2020-12-01T20:59:40Z,politics,Politics,Nervy EU states wary of Brexit concessions by Michel Barnier,"Michel Barnier will be told on Wednesday that the EU capitals want full sight of any deal with the UK before it is agreed, amid concerns the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator may concede too much ground in the final days of negotiation. The member states have called on Barnier, who is in London, to address their representatives in Brussels in an early morning video conference to provide a full account of the latest developments. A senior EU diplomat said they had confidence in Barnier as a negotiator but added there was some nervousness following his briefing on Friday where he had told the ambassadors of his “flexibility” over aspects of customs and border controls. Barnier counselled that the British negotiators led by David Frost were yet to reciprocate by agreeing a robust system of dispute settlement, which he admitted could give “rise to concerns about cherrypicking”. A senior EU diplomat said: “[Barnier] will be asked to relay the message to the commission the member states would like to have prior scrutiny of a possible agreement before closing it. Being in the dark makes people nervous.” The negotiations remain stuck on the level of access that will be granted to European fishing fleets in UK waters and the means by which either side will be able to hit back if the other seeks to gain a competitive advantage by diverging on environmental, labour or social standards. On Tuesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, spoke at a joint press conference of their determination to ensure EU interests were not damaged in the last moments of the negotiation. Macron said: “We are particularly vigilant on the level playing field, today and in the future, and the question of fishing. The preservation of the activities of our fishermen in British waters is an essential condition, the fair rules of the market in the future equally so. On the subject of Brexit our position has been constant – a deal must allow for a fair future relationship and France won’t accept a deal that doesn’t respect our interests in the future.” De Croo used a football analogy to emphasise his concern about the UK scoring a “decisive goal … in the last minute”. Some diplomats have said they are concerned that the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, may be willing to offer too many concessions in order to enhance her own legacy by sealing a last-minute deal. Von der Leyen said during comments in a debate with regional and national parliamentarians that she was determined to secure a system that goes beyond a conventional free trade “non-regression” clause on environmental or social standards. “At the moment, we’re discussing how we replicate control of the level playing field,” she said, “so that we can be clear there is no regression on what we have achieved and there is fairness over time, so access can be without quota or tariffs and all companies play by the same rules in the single market.” The EU wants to ensure regulatory alignment through a dispute mechanism that would allow Brussels to hit trade with unilateral tariffs where the UK has diverged from the single market rulebook. “We want an agreement, but not at any price. We are well prepared for both scenarios so we will see in the next days how things turn out,” Von der Leyen said. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no deal preparations, said the demand revealed that the EU was not prepared to fully accept that UK was leaving. “The EU still want us to be tied to their way of doing things,” he said. “The EU are at the moment reserving the right, if there is any sort of dispute, not quite to rip everything up but to impose some really penal and tough restrictions on us, and we don’t think that’s fair.”"
2020-12-01T20:51:16Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus : Johnson suffers biggest Commons revolt since election as MPs back new Covid tiers by 291 to 78 - as it happened,"MPs approved the UK governmentâ€™s plan for a tougher tiered system for England to begin on Wednesday by 291 votes to 78. It means the new tier restrictions will replace the second national lockdown at midnight. However, the figures represent the governmentâ€™s biggest defeat since it won last yearâ€™s general election, thanks to a sizeable Tory rebellion against the new measures. A total of 55 Tory MPs voted against the government and 16 did note vote (some of these will have been abstentions, others will have been absences for other reasons). Senior Tories, MPs who would usually back Johnson on Brexit, as well as some from the 2019 intake, were among the rebels. For the most part, the Labour party abstained from the vote, though 15 of its MPs voted against the government. The division list is here. The UKâ€™s total Covid-19 death toll has passed 75,000, according to a tally of all fatalities that mention the disease on death certificates. Our story here."

2020-12-01T20:28:04Z,politics,Politics,Major Sulk enters his darkest hour as rank and file desert him | John Crace,"Out of desperation more than anything else, Boris Johnson has taken to calling Keir Starmer “Captain Hindsight”. Even when the Labour leader is making predictions about what will happen next. But in the Commons debate on the new coronavirus tiers, the prime minister revealed a new persona for himself: Major Sulk. You could tell Johnson wasn’t a happy bunny from the off, because he arrived looking a total mess. More often than not, Boris’s appearance is less art than artifice. He hopes that appearing shambolic will make people think he’s not too bothered. That he’s the Mister Good Time Guy on whom you can rely for a joke. Except no one is laughing any more. Least of all Boris. His bedraggled, slumped demeanour was not a sign that he wasn’t bothered. Rather it was the opposite. He couldn’t bear for his public to see just how much he did care. Not for the country, obviously. But for himself. Up till now, the Great Narcissistic Sulk has never really given a toss about his rank-and-file backbenchers. He didn’t even know the names of three-quarters of them. But this was the day he came to realise the one-way love affair was over and the magic had worn off for a significant number of the Conservative parliamentary party. MPs willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he had managed to win an 80-seat majority now realised they had bought a dud. A prime minister who at a time of crisis could be relied on to let you down. Johnson’s opening speech was a lazy, badly argued ramble through the familiar arguments he had been making over the past week. He began by listing the positives of the new regime – hairdressers, gyms and round-the-clock shopping – insisting that the evidence for reopening them had been taken with granular thoroughness. Despite the fact that his economic impact assessments, released at the last minute the previous day, bore a closer resemblance to something knocked up on the back of cigarette packet. He then went on to say that no one should take Christmas for granted. Only that was precisely what he was doing by granting a five-day Christmas amnesty that could turn into a New Year killing zone. He also promised an extra £1,000 to every pub that didn’t serve scotch eggs as a sop to the Tory malcontents. Or beer money, as Keir Starmer scathingly described it. The longer Boris spoke the emptier his words became. By the end he was running on fumes. In reply, the Labour leader merely voiced what was on everyone’s mind. We’d all been here before on several occasions with Johnson, but every time he had let the country down. He had been too late to lock down initially; he had ignored Sage’s advice for a circuit breaker in September; he had introduced a tiering system that was soon proved to be hopelessly inadequate; Typhoid Dido’s track and trace had been a joke. He had promised the pandemic would be over by the summer. And then by Christmas. Now we were clinging on for dear life waiting for the vaccines to save us. So why should anyone believe a word the prime minister said when it looked as though the new tiers were guided by what Boris could smuggle past enough of his backbenchers rather than by the science. A third national lockdown in January was all but an inevitability. And in the meantime, where was the financial help for the hospitality sector and the self-employed? As so often, Johnson had over-promised and under-delivered. Even so, something had to be better than nothing. So Labour would be abstaining to make sure everyone’s main focus was on the number of Tory rebels. Yet again then, Starmer would be giving Johnson the benefit of the doubt and putting the government on notice. It’s been on notice for a while now. There would come a time when Keir would have to say enough was enough and vote against the government on its handling of the coronavirus. But now was not the right time. The rest of the debate was dominated by unhappy Tories, either promising to rebel or to vote reluctantly for the government. Bernard Jenkin, after listing all the many faults in the new tiering system, sadly concluded that he would vote for Boris. Out of pity as much as anything else. Others were less forgiving, demanding more localised banding of tiers and proof that the hospitality industry was the root of all Covid evils. Steve Baker even went so far as to demand expert evidence. This from the MP who happily ignored both experts and evidence during numerous Brexit debates. Better a sinner who repenteth, I suppose. It was Chris Grayling who delivered the real coup de grace by saying that he was “very concerned”. When you’ve lost the trust of Failing Grayling, who has cost the taxpayer more than £3bn in a ministerial career of unrivalled uselessness, then you’ve lost the soul of the Tory party. With Labour abstaining, the vote itself was a formality, the motion passing with a majority of 213. But with 56 Tories voting against him and more abstaining, this was Boris’s darkest hour. One from which he may never recover. Many of us saw through Johnson long ago. An opportunist chancer only interested in self-glorification. Now it looks as if the mist has lifted from the eyes of many of his own benches. Enough for him never to take a vote again for granted. What goes around, comes around. • Join John Crace and Guardian columnist Marina Hyde as they look back at a political year like no other.

2020-12-01T17:48:55Z,politics,Politics,"NHS staff could lose 75% of Sturgeon Covid bonus, say experts","Tax experts have warned that Scotland’s poorest health and care workers could lose up to 75% of the £500 bonus pledged by Nicola Sturgeon because it will not be tax-free. The Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) said the lowest-paid workers who receive universal credit would be penalised the most because the extra income would be deducted from their welfare payments, while a leading economics thinktank criticised it as bad policy. The first minister announced during her keynote speech at the Scottish National party’s annual conference on Monday that 391,000 NHS and social care workers would get up to £500 as a one-off Covid bonus, at a cost of £180m. Sturgeon appealed to Boris Johnson to use the UK government’s powers to make that tax-free, implying it was the morally right thing for the prime minister to do, but that request was rejected by the Treasury. It said that as the Scottish government set and received Scottish income taxes, it could increase the bonus to make sure recipients got the full £500 in their pockets and recoup that tax from their pay packets.
The CIOT’s Low Incomes Tax Reform Group said on Tuesday that NHS and care workers on universal credit who earned the Scottish median salary of £25,200 could only get £123.95 after taxes and national insurance, because the welfare system deducts 63p from every extra pound of earnings. Joanne Walker, a CIOT official, said Sturgeon was right to argue that making the payment tax-free would prevent that happening, but said Wales had been through a similar situation before with the Treasury. The Welsh government was the first to pay public employees a £500 Covid bonus by giving it to 65,000 social care workers in May. It also asked the Treasury to make it tax-free, but the Treasury said since Wales set and received its income taxes, it should increase the bonus to a level high enough to cover the tax take. Welsh government officials confirmed on Tuesday they also knew about the impact on workers on universal credit: Welsh trade unions warned in June those employees would lose up to £375. Scottish government sources said they knew about the issues affecting the Welsh payments before Sturgeon’s speech, but insisted that should not have deflected the first minister from making her offer. One official said it raised fresh questions about how fair the UK government’s tax and welfare systems are, and made the case for those systems to be under full Scottish control. The CIOT’s warning came after the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI), a leading economics thinktank based at the University of Strathclyde and run by Alex Salmond’s former head of policy, Professor Graeme Roy, criticised Sturgeon for insisting the bonus should be tax-free. In a blog cowritten by Roy, the FAI said Sturgeon’s offer to reward health workers was understandable. It said that even if the Scottish government recouped the income tax, the Treasury would still earn £60 per £500 in national insurance payments, which were not collected in Scotland. However, the FAI said it would be bad policy to make bonuses tax-free, arguing it was not a progressive way of distributing money, and undermined the social contract of the tax system that meant everyone contributed fairly. “Exempting bonuses from tax appears at odds with the context of the existing progressive tax system,” the blog said. “[It] would gift higher rate taxpayers a significantly larger tax break than basic rate taxpayers. It is really not clear what the rationale for this would be. “[If] policymakers want those employees to benefit by £500 after tax, the solution is to pay a higher gross bonus. There is little reason for these rewards to be exempt from the existing social contract, or for them to require administrative and legislative hurdles to implement.”"
2020-12-01T17:22:43Z,politics,Politics,How the Tory lockdown rebels are organising to thwart restrictions,"Boris Johnson may have breathed a sigh of relief when he survived last month’s Commons vote to approve lockdown 2.0 with 34 Tory rebels lining up against him – but there was a sense it represented the calm before the storm. Speaking a day after the showdown on 4 November, former Tory minister Steve Baker – a ringleader of lockdown sceptics on the backbenches, who said he had consciously taken his foot off the pedal at the time – made his feelings clear.
“I will organise against further lockdown after this. This was the one time that I not merely stepped back but positively helped the government to make their case because it’s very serious. But next time round I will give all of my strength and courage to organising the maximum vote against further lockdown,” he told the Guardian. Baker, it seems, has been true to his word. The following week, he was announced as deputy chairman of the new anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group (CRG), with the former Tory chief whip, Mark Harper, in charge. And behind the scenes the rebellious group has been organising and professionalising. Swelling from 50 to 70 Tory MPs, it has enlisted former Tory parliamentary candidate Ed Barker to run its press relations operation. Efforts on social media also appear to also be tightly coordinated, with members using the #Road2Recovery hashtag on Twitter when issuing supportive messages. The CRG has been described as an echo of the European Research Group (ERG), which, with Baker as its chair, helped shape Brexit policy from the backbenches during Theresa May’s turbulent time in No 10. Familiar faces made up the CRG’s steering group, including Sir Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbenchers. But the group has attracted the support of a wider ideological pool of Tories, beyond the ERG’s Eurosceptic makeup. Harriett Baldwin, who supported remain during the EU referendum, was named on the steering group. Kent Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, who backed remain, is also a supporter. Key among the group’s “three guiding principles” was a call for the government to undertake and publish a full cost-benefit analysis of coronavirus restrictions. It also urged No 10 to “end the monopoly on advice of government scientists” and improve existing measures to tackle the virus, such as the performance of test and trace. They set out a raft of concerns in a letter to the prime minister on 21 November. As the clamour grew, Johnson held a Zoom meeting with Harper and Baker last Tuesday to listen to those concerns. In a last-ditch effort to appease the group’s membership, Johnson wrote to them this weekend setting out a series of concessions, including committing to publication of further analysis of the health, economic and social impacts of Covid restrictions. But when it came on Monday it fell far short of expectations. The 48-page report highlighted the government’s view that letting the NHS be overwhelmed would be “intolerable for our society” but concluded it was not possible to know whether the economic impact of the new strengthened tiers system would be greater than doing nothing. Harper, frustrated by the rushed publication of the document just 24 hours before Tuesday’s vote on restrictions, was unrelenting in his criticism. “Even with so little time, the government’s analysis seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny,” he declared on Monday, adding: “We are now seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the government’s arguments.” With the prime minister watching on, Brady told parliament on Tuesday that the government had to “demonstrate beyond question” that it was acting in a way that was both proportionate and absolutely necessary if it was to remove people’s fundamental liberties. It had, he concluded, failed to do so. While Tuesday’s vote is expected to pass despite the rebellion, the question for the prime minister is: what will the CRG do next?"
2020-12-01T16:04:44Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer urged to return donations from 'Islamophobic' property developer,"Keir Starmer has been urged to return donations to Labour made by a property developer whose tweets have been condemned by Muslim groups as Islamophobic. Muslim communal groups and a Labour NEC member challenged Starmer to take action over the “abhorrent and Islamophobic” posts by David Abrahams, a businessman and philanthropist. Abrahams is the latest Blair-era donor drawn back to Labour by Starmer. He confirmed last month that he had set up a direct debit to the Labour party, having ceased donations in 2016. However, Muslim groups, pointing to online comments by Abrahams, have raised the alarm over his renewed links to the Labour leadership. Abrahams’ tweets included suggestions that Muslims have “mixed loyalties”, that conservative Muslim culture is inherently violent, and that Muslim youth have a propensity for suicide. “Don’t think I know how to divide political Islam from moderates and fundamentalists,” Abrahams posted in 2013. “It is the very nature of the beast!” As recently as this January, he tweeted the claim that while Israel was a “brand new hi-tech state with new inventions to benefit mankind” its “close neighbours chose terrorism and invented suicide bombers”. Mish Rahman, an NEC member, called on Labour to give Abrahams back his money. “These comments are deeply disturbing,” Rahman said. “Donating huge amounts of money to Labour should not mean someone can make racist remarks and get away with it. The party should immediately return Abrahams’ donations. “We now know that the majority of Muslim members do not trust the leadership to deal with Islamophobia effectively. Failing to act on these outrageous comments will deepen these concerns and provide further evidence that there is a hierarchy of racism within the party.” Responding to Abrahams’ tweets, a spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said: “Abrahams’ abhorrent and deeply Islamophobic views that he has felt emboldened to publish in the past is yet more evidence of how prevalent and seemingly acceptable Islamophobia in British society is. “Just last week, the Labour Muslim Network (LMN) published a report exposing a culture of Islamophobia and discrimination within parts of the Labour party which echo the unacceptable views Abrahams has voiced. “The Labour party, in its work to address other forms of racism from within its ranks, must also stand firm against Islamophobia and take decisive action against this kind of hate.” LMN’s report, published this month, said that one in three Muslim Labour members had experienced Islamophobia within the party. A poll of Muslim Labour members and supporters, cited in the report, found less than half had confidence in the leadership’s ability to tackle Islamophobia or to represent their interests. A spokesperson for LMN said: “Days after the Labour Muslim Network released a report detailing the scale of Islamophobia within the Labour party, it is extremely distressing and concerning to see such abhorrent and Islamophobic comments from an alleged Labour party donor. “Letting this go unchallenged will add insult to injury for Muslim communities who have time and again supported Labour.” A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party takes all complaints of Islamophobia extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.” Abrahams did not respond to a request for comment. Abrahams has a long history with the Labour party, holding office as a councillor in the 80s and unsuccessfully running as Labour candidate for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in the 1992 general election. Previously associated with Tony Blair, Abrahams reportedly gave hundreds of thousands to Labour. He ceased his donations in 2016 after remarks made by Naz Shah, the Labour MP, and the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, which were condemned as antisemitic. “When Keir came in I knew I was supporting somebody who was decent,” Abrahams was quoted as saying by the Times, which first reported his donations, adding that he was “happy to donate more” if Labour committed to “the right policies”."
2020-12-01T15:06:04Z,politics,Politics,Number of people rejecting Queen's honours doubles in past decade,"The proportion of people turning down honours from the Queen is rising and has more than doubled over the past nine years, a Guardian analysis shows. From 2011 to this year, 443 people rejected a knighthood, MBE, OBE or other awards in recognition of their merit, service or bravery, according to Cabinet Office figures released under a freedom of information (FoI) request. While annual rejection figures fluctuate and remain small, experts said in recent years there has been growing awareness of the ills of the British empire and unease around governments using the 700-year-old system to reward political allies and donors. This year, 68 people rejected offers of awards on the Queen’s birthday and new year honours lists – 2.7% of the total of 2,504 – and the highest number between 2010 and 2020, the FoI request showed. In 2011, under the first full year of the new Conservative-led government, the proportion of rejections stood at 1.3%, or 25 of the 1,987 offered, down from 2.3% in 2010 under Labour, the last year for which data was obtained.
Prof Kehinde Andrew, from Birmingham City University, said there was increasing focus on the history of empire and racism, and the awards’ links to the country’s bloody imperial past. OBE stands for Officer of the Order of the British Empire, while CBE signifies Commander and MBE, Member. “This leads to more people rejecting honours and seeing them as problematic,” he said. “The bigger story is that thousands of people accept them. Aside from the problematic nature of empire, it doesn’t exist anymore, so why are we handing out orders of the British empire?” The former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, the author of And What Do You Do? What the Royal Family Don’t Want You to Know, claimed the honours system had been “corrupted” through its use by political parties “to hand out political favours often in return for political donations”. “That has devalued the system so people feel it’s less worthy than it used to be,” he said. “The system is becoming less respected as a consequence of its misuse by politicians.” Following a leaked list of alleged “refuseniks” to the Sunday Times in 2003, it emerged that almost 300 people, including the authors Roald Dahl and Aldous Huxley and the chef Nigella Lawson, had declined an honour from 1951 to 1999 – though the Cabinet Office would not admit whether that was the total figure. The author JG Ballard, another so-called refusenik, said in 2003: “Thousands of medals are given out in the name of a non-existent empire. It makes us look a laughing stock and encourages deference to the crown.” The honours nomination and selection process is opaque. Nominees are asked by Downing Street if they will accept in advance of the announcement and are usually able to privately reject the offer. There has been repeated speculation that the system could be overhauled to eliminate the word “empire” from awards such as the OBE. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “As the figures show, refusal rates for honours remain extremely low. There has been considerable reform to the honours system in the last 25 years to ensure it is inclusive. There are no plans to change the names of any of the orders.” Honours ‘refuseniks’ Gina Martin, a campaigner against upskirting, revealed last week that she rejected an OBE this year due to the enduring “violence and oppression” of the British empire. She wrote on Twitter: “It would be deeply hypocritical of me to accept this honour while continuing to be vocal in my commitment to anti-racism and understanding the deep and unsettling race issues the British empire has built into the foundation of our country and many others.”
Howard Gayle, Liverpool Football Club’s first black player, who has since campaigned with Show Racism the Red Card, said no to an MBE in 2016 because accepting it risked his ancestors “turning in their graves after how empire and colonialism had enslaved them”. “This is a decision that I have had to make and there will be others who may feel different and would enjoy the attraction of being a Member of the British Empire and those three letters after their name, but I feel that it would be a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of empire,” he said.
The former Watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood rejected the offer of an MBE, saying the honours system needs to be dragged “into the 21st century”. She told the BBC: “I’ve changed laws and I’ve helped saved a lot of people’s lives, so maybe I’m deserving of an honour, but I just wouldn’t accept it while we still have party donors donating huge amounts of money and getting an honour.” The Hillsborough campaigner and academic Prof Phil Scraton rebuffed an OBE, saying successive governments had refused to take seriously the issues raised about the disaster and subsequent cover-up. He added: “I think that many of the people who are involved in offering such honours have been part of that process and I feel very strongly that I could not accept an honour now that these issues have been resolved in the way in which they have.”
Danny Boyle, the director and man behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, said he turned down a subsequent honour because he did not want to be seen as considered above the thousands of others involved in staging and planning the event. “I’m very proud to be an equal citizen, and I think that’s what the opening ceremony was actually about,” he said. The poet Benjamin Zephaniah rejected an OBE in 2003, dismissing it as a legacy of colonialism and calling for clarity over the shocking circumstances over the death in custody of his cousin, Michael Powell. “You have lied to us, and you continue to lie to us, and you have poured the working-class dream of a fair, compassionate, caring society down the dirty drain of empire,” he wrote, addressing the former prime minister Tony Blair. To the Queen, he wrote: “Stop going on about the empire. Let’s do something else.”

2020-12-01T14:55:09Z,politics,Politics,Johnson publishes plans to regain power from courts and MPs,"Boris Johnson will scrap the need for parliamentary approval to call elections, and ban the courts from questioning the dissolution of parliament under legislation that hands powers back to the prime minister. Johnson published legislation on Tuesday to scrap the Fixed-term Parliaments Act passed by the Conservatives as part of a deal with the Liberal Democrats in 2010 to ensure a stable coalition government. It means parliaments should serve a fixed five-year term but it has been overruled twice by the 2017 and 2019 elections. The most controversial change is an attempt to bar the courts from ruling on the powers of the government to dissolve parliament. The move will be seen as a direct retaliation against the supreme court, which humiliated Johnson last year after it ruled that his prorogation of parliament at a key point in the Brexit talks was unlawful. The Cabinet Office confirmed the legislation would “reaffirm the longstanding position that the prerogative powers are not reviewable by courts, providing legal clarity”. Parliament’s fixed term can only be overruled by a two-thirds majority in favour of an early election, which caused chaos during the hung parliament in autumn 2019 because MPs refused to back Johnson’s demand for an election. Eventually, however, both Labour and the Lib Dems bowed to pressure. Johnson vowed during the 2019 general election campaign to scrap the act, and the return of the power to call elections to the prime minister’s control will give him the opportunity to determine the timing of the 2024 election. Many have assumed the poll will be in May but it could be as late as December and the returned power allows Johnson the advantage of being able to time a poll to maximise his chances of winning a second term. The decision is ultimately the Queen’s, who acts on advice from the prime minister. The Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said the decision to scrap the act was a return to the tried-and-tested system. “The Fixed-term Parliaments Act caused constitutional chaos last year which, when combined with total gridlock in parliament, meant the previous government couldn’t deliver what it was asked to do,” she said. “Ultimately, at critical moments for our country, we trust the public to decide. So we are going back to the system that lets elections happen when they are needed. We want to return to constitutional arrangements that give people more confidence in what to expect, and more security.” The legislation will be accompanied by a draft set of principles that will underpin the legal framework for dissolving parliament and inform what would happen in the event that a prime minister lost a vote of confidence. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was subject to such a vote in January 2019 but won. Dr Jessica Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society said the government should be making efforts to decentralise power, rather than reclaim it. “The UK already has one of the most centralised political systems amongst modern democracies so any plans to give our already dominant executive more powers should be carefully scrutinised and treated with caution,” she said. “Any reforms to our politics should be made with the view of moving powers away from the centre, which already has significant control over the Commons and the Lords, which the Prime Minister can pack with appointees at will. “The government should instead be looking at shifting power to voters and other representatives, moving politics closer to people, instead of further entrenching power in the executive.”"
2020-12-01T14:37:13Z,politics,Politics,UK likely to axe finance bill clauses if Brexit trade deal made,"The UK is to table its long awaited finance bill next week but anticipated controversial clauses to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement are expected to be axed if a trade deal is struck beforehand. The EU has warned that trade talks will be pulled immediately if the government goes ahead with a second batch of legislation granting itself unilateral powers to renege on part of the withdrawal agreement signed in January. “If it violates the withdrawal agreement, it’s curtains, no deal,” said a senior Brussels source. However government sources have said the content of the bill depends on progress in the trade talks, now at a make-or-break phase. If a deal is struck this week the clauses are “pretty unlikely if we are in a world of a trade deal”, they said. The bill has been on the cards since September and was expected to include several clauses mirroring the controversial measures in the internal market bill – denounced by three former prime ministers and last month comprehensively rejected by the House of Lords, which was horrified by the government’s admission it was prepared to break international law. If the government goes ahead, the finance bill with its contentious clauses intact would be seen by the EU as an incendiary act if the trade and security negotiations were ongoing – but there is no expectation in Brussels of such an outcome. Sources in the UK said the next three to five days were critical, with hopes that even if a deal does not emerge before Friday it will do so over the weekend. The proposed finance bill would have given a minister the unilateral power to decide which goods being exported from Britain to Northern Ireland would be deemed “at risk” of entering the Republic of Ireland. Such “at risk” goods would attract tariffs – although the tax would be redeemable if it could be proved that the item stayed in Northern Ireland. The issue is being discussed by the joint EU-UK committee implementing the withdrawal agreement. But a trade deal delivering “zero tariffs and zero quotas” on goods being traded between the UK and the EU would completely resolve the problem, leaving the government without any requirement for the relevant clauses in the finance bill. A separate strand of talks being run by the UK-EU joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and Maroš Šefčovič is said to be making good progress on the issue, and that of the free movement of food between Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK government had argued that both the Brexit clauses in the finance bill and the internal market bill were a safety net needed to guarantee unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the event that trade talks collapsed. In an interview with the Irish Times the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said: “We are now really in the endgame if a deal is to be arrived at this week.”"
2020-12-01T12:52:09Z,politics,Politics,Northern Labour MPs reluctant to abstain on Covid tiers vote,"A Labour MP has said the party’s decision not to oppose the government’s new Covid tier restrictions made her feel ill, and that about 20 colleagues had wanted to vote against the measures. Emma Lewell-Buck, the MP for South Shields, said she would break the party whip in a Commons vote on the new coronavirus rules later on Tuesday, even though it made her feel uncomfortable to do so.
Keir Starmer has ordered Labour MPs to abstain from voting either for or against the measures, meaning they are likely to pass despite a sizeable Tory rebellion that Boris Johnson is struggling to contain. Several Labour MPs told the Guardian on Tuesday that while they were minded to vote against the tier restrictions, they would follow the party line or had not yet decided. Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, said he would vote against the measures. His constituency straddles Stockport and Tameside, which have infection rates of 170 per 100,000 and 178 per 100,000, respectively. Like the rest of Greater Manchester, his constituency has been in a local lockdown for four months, with all household mixing indoors banned. A shadow cabinet minister in an area with a relatively low infection rate said they had pushed Starmer to abstain, a decision that has left several party colleagues feeling uncomfortable. Lewell-Buck said: “I felt a bit ill when I saw that we’re going to be abstaining because I knew that I’d have to do what I felt was right by my community and that would be vote against. I knew I’d have to break the whip today and that’s an uncomfortable place to be.” The MP, whose South Shields constituency has been under some of England’s strictest lockdown rules since September, said the hospitality industry was “going to the wall” and that businesses needed more support. “There comes a point where if you abstain or you vote for it, you’re saying that you’re okay with the status quo and you’re okay with the approach – and I’m not,” she said. “My hospitality industry in South Shields is all going to the wall, yet there’s no evidence really to prove that infection rates are highest in hospitality.” Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood and the shadow minister for voter engagement and young people, said: “When I spoke to my whip over the weekend I was very clear I wouldn’t vote for [the restrictions]. I agree with the principle of restrictions [but] disagree with the application when it comes to my constituency.” She said the infection rate in Lancaster was low, but bed occupancy in the local hospital had remained at 95% for several weeks. She stressed that that figure had not yet been validated but that she had been told by sources at the local University hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS foundation trust that bed occupancy was now at 98%. “We are not out of the woods yet,” she said. Lancaster has an infection rate of 115 per 100,000 people, according to the seven-day rolling average, far below the English average of 168 cases per 100,000. Kate Osborne, the Labour MP for Jarrow, said she was leaning towards voting against the tier restrictions but would make a decision after the Commons debate. She said she would have voted against the measures had Labour given MPs a free vote: “The reason I’m even contemplating voting against this is because it just doesn’t have the [financial] support in place and I think that’s unfortunate. “I do worry that if we abstain on certain votes like this then is there enough pressure to actually make the government put in place some of the things that are needed around support packages?” Osborne said her mailbag was full of constituents wanting her to vote against the new tier restrictions, which are due to come into force on Wednesday morning, but that there would be others who supported them.
Richard Burgon, the Labour MP for Leeds East, described the government’s approach as “recklessly inadequate” and confirmed he would vote against the measures."
2020-12-01T06:00:18Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock under pressure to explain £30m test tube work for ex-neighbour,"There is mounting pressure on Matt Hancock to explain how his former neighbour was awarded about £30m-worth of work making test tubes for Covid test samples as questions arose about the safety certification of the products. A Guardian investigation revealed last week that Alex Bourne, who used to run a pub in Hancock’s village, and had no previous experience in medical supplies, has for about six months been manufacturing tens of millions of plastic vials for Covid test kits. However, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed his products only “recently” gained certification. Bourne first contacted Hancock to offer his services during the pandemic via WhatsApp in March. His company, Hinpack, was at the time manufacturing disposable catering items and had no experience in the highly regulated medical products sector. Medical supplies are regulated under an EC directive which ensures they meet safety standards and requires them to be “CE” marked. The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has given emergency exemptions from the EC rules for some companies to use their products during the crisis. Hinpack does not appear on the current version of its public exemption list.
Shortly after 12pm last Friday, Bourne told the Guardian that he did not have CE marks for the empty vials he had been supplying. “The stuff I’ve been delivering since June did not require a CE mark,” he said. Later the same day, however, a spokesperson for the DHSC said that Hinpack had received certification for its products. A government source said the products had only been approved “recently” and would be registered as such on the regulator’s website shortly. They refused to say when exactly the products were certified. “Hinpack are not in breach of regulations,” a spokesperson said. “No products used in test and trace are used until full regulatory approval has been achieved.” The government source said that Hinpack vials were being supplied for use in Covid test kits, but would not be sent out to the public until the full regulatory approval had been achieved. They added that all Hinpack products passed through the standard regulatory review process, including vigorous validation to make sure they were fit for purpose. Bourne has produced as many as 2m vials a week for NHS Covid tests since June. He told the Guardian that he did not believe he needed the safety certification for supplying empty test tubes and said, at the beginning of the summer, the MHRA wrote to him confirming that. The MHRA did not respond to a request for comment. Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences and a leading NHS pathologist, said all the vials his lab used were CE marked, whether empty or filled with solution. “My understanding is vials do require a CE mark,” he said. Several other industry sources also said they believed CE marks were required.
One industry source, with long experience of manufacturing and regulating medical products, said he was aware that Bourne was seeking help to secure certification for his products back in September – three months after production began. Bourne said that related to the next phase of his business, when he intends to begin filling the empty test tubes with saline solution. He said he had submitted a technical file to the regulator as part of the process of gaining approval for filled vials, and expected to be on the public exemption list shortly. “We submitted technical documents to MHRA. There has been no comment and it’s now an administrative process,” he said. The industry source said they were in any event baffled as to how Hinpack could come to supply test tubes. “It is highly irregular to source from an unproven, new-to-market provider where established certified providers exist,” they said. The source added he was aware of at least one large UK-based manufacturer which believed it had capacity, experience and certification for producing vials for tests which was turned down for a government Covid contract. Another industry source told us that retrospective certification of products, if that was what had occurred here, was very unusual. Bourne’s lawyers initially denied that their client had any discussions with Hancock in relation to Covid-19 supplies. However, Bourne later conceded that he had exchanged text and email messages and had conversations with Hancock over several months – but denied they had ever involved discussion of his business interests. His lawyers said it was “untrue” Bourne was helped “in any way, commercially or operationally” by Hancock. “To suggest that our client has had political, indeed ministerial, help is to betray a deeply regrettable lack of understanding of how the supply chain works,” they said. However, it remains unclear how Bourne’s company came to be awarded the work supplying millions of vials via two distributors. He said that after contacting Hancock via WhatsApp the health secretary directed him to a DHSC website where he registered his company’s credentials. He said there was no further follow-up with Hancock. A couple of weeks later, he said he received a call from a US multinational he had never heard of, called VWR, which had a pre-existing contract with the DHSC. After weeks of negotiations, VWR contracted Bourne’s firm to begin producing medical vials.
VWR declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about how it came to contact a small company with no prior track record in medical supplies and whether it had sold on the supplies with or without CE marks. A spokesman said that VWR was trusted around the world and while it had received NHS orders for Hinpack test tubes, it had not had any recently. Since August, Hinpack has been supplying a new distributor, Alpha Laboratories, which also had a pre-existing contract with the DHSC. In a statement, Alpha Laboratories said it was aware Bourne had met Hancock but “this was irrelevant to our discussions as we were sourcing from Hinpack a price-competitive product for the NHS supply chain which fitted within our product range”. When asked whether it had supplied Hinpack vials to fulfil its NHS test-and-trace contracts, and whether they were CE marked, the distributor responded that the product it supplied the government “meets the specification of the contract in question. The final application of any products supplied by us is unknown.” Lawyers for Bourne said many UK companies had “retooled” during the pandemic, adding that the medical devices he manufactured were “by no means complicated and are well within our client’s existing skillset”. The DHSC spokesperson said there was “no evidence” to support claims that Hinpack received any preferential treatment because of Bourne’s contacts with the health secretary."
2020-12-01T00:48:12Z,politics,Politics,Mass Covid testing to be rolled out to local authorities in tier 3,"Local authorities in tier 3, with the toughest Covid restrictions, will be invited to apply for funds to run mass testing programmes of people with no symptoms, in hopes of driving down the virus and moving to tier 2, the government has said. Public health directors will be able to put forward proposals for testing in those parts of their communities most at risk from the virus, if they so choose, which could be particular neighbourhoods or workplaces where infection rates are high. It would be open to them if they wanted to focus on particular ethnic minority communities, where there have been high death rates, if there was evidence they were more at risk or that an outbreak had originated in one community, with priority groups decided by local councils and directors of public health, the Department of Health and Social Care said. The programmes will run for six weeks and be supported by the government. They follow the mass testing pilot rolled out in Liverpool, which is said to have driven down the prevalence of the virus. However, testing in Liverpool was organised and supervised by the army. Other towns have already said they do not have the staff needed to run mass testing.
Gen Sir Gordon Messenger, head of operations for the programme, said at a Downing Street press conference that most areas would have to use their own people and resources. Military support of the kind that Liverpool had would be “simply undeliverable” for all of the country. “I can say with confidence that cannot be replicated around the country, and therefore the military support, along with all other types of central support, has to be targeted where it’s needed most and where it can have the greatest effect,” he said. “I have absolutely no doubt that the military will continue to play a really important part in the community testing programme but the baseline assumption in terms of workforce generation is that that will be delivered locally with considerable support from the centre.” Messenger also said he did not yet know how many of the 23 million people going into tier 3 after lockdown ends on Wednesday would be able to access the regime, as “planning is still very much under way”. But he said that capabilities will “sequence over time”, adding this would be into “January and beyond”. The testing will involve rapid lateral flow tests, which give a result in about 20 minutes. They are not as accurate as the gold-standard PCR test, which is run in a lab or mobile unit and takes considerably longer. But the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the briefing testing was vital and could drive the virus levels down in tier 3 cities. “By expanding our testing to include people showing no symptoms, we are finding more positive cases more quickly and breaking chains of transmission,” he said. “Up to a third of people have coronavirus without symptoms, so it is incredibly important to be testing those who could be infecting others unknowingly. “When more people come forward for regular community testing, we have a much greater chance of driving down prevalence of the virus and saving lives. “I know people in the top tiers are facing a particularly difficult time, which is why we are supporting them with mass community testing to provide a route towards lowering the level of restrictions they face.”"
2020-11-30T20:12:06Z,politics,Politics,Government rolls out the Door Matt to say nothing much at all | John Crace,"Where’s Priti Patel? Unintentionally busy, presumably. As are Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Alok Sharma and others. There was a time back in the spring when we had a rolling cast of ministers to compere the Downing Street press conferences. Now it seems that almost all of the cabinet have learned to make themselves unavailable. Things to do, people not to see. Well, it is lockdown. So inevitably it was Matt Hancock who was yet again delegated to do the front-of-house gig at No 10. The health secretary has long since resigned himself to doing all the jobs that no one else will. That’s why he’s the Door Matt; the ideal fall guy for a press conference at which the government has almost nothing much to say. And what he did have to say didn’t really stand up to much scrutiny. You could tell Matt didn’t have much news as he was sent out with the B team of Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, and the aptly named Gen Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for community testing, who saw his job as repeating, when asked, what Hancock had just said. But Door Matt is nothing if not willing and he’s never been afraid to fill 10 minutes of dead air with 10 minutes of dead words. The lockdown had worked, the virus was coming under control, but we needed to still be vigilant, he began, which was why the government was bringing in the regional tiering system. Well, tell us something we didn’t know. Like, what was in the government’s social and health impact assessment that had been knocked up in a few hours to try to placate a few potential Tory rebels? Except it was obvious that either Door Matt hadn’t read the assessment or knew that it didn’t have anything in it that hadn’t already been published in one way or another. What passed for the big news of the day was that we were now about to roll out community testing so we could stop asymptomatic carriers passing on the disease. Hancock looked exhausted rather than elated by this piece of news. Then again, it was hardly something that registered as news. We’ve known for months that about a third of people with coronavirus displayed no symptoms, so the real question was why it had taken the government so long to get round to realising it might be a good idea not to just offer tests to the symptomatic. “Hope is on the horizon,” he concluded. As was the light of dawn. It’s going to be one hell of a horizon when it finally appears. Our sacrifices would not be for nothing. If it’s any consolation to the health secretary, Boris Johnson is no more convincing when he’s going through his own repertoire of sub-Churchillian bollocks. It would be nice for once to have a politician who just radiated honesty, rather than ones that substituted grandstanding for sincerity. After advising a woman called Ella to check the government’s website to see if she was allowed to see her long-term partner indoors – he seemed reluctant to break the bad news to her in person – Door Matt struggled to explain why the pre-Christmas university testing regime could be guaranteed to work, given it wasn’t being made mandatory. It’s a huge logistical exercise that would come together, was the best he could come up with. Hardly a ringing endorsement. “We will be working with local communities,” said Messenger Messenger. Nor was Hancock at all convincing when insisting that some regions might be able to come down a tier before Christmas, despite no one knowing what the impact of the five-day festive amnesty on each region would be. You could tell he was floundering because he lapsed into his default management consultancy speak. The type of language for which you get paid £600 per hour for saying precisely nothing at all. That was pretty much the high point of the 45 minutes. Because straight afterwards he was asked if the move to community testing wasn’t actually an admission that Dido Harding’s test, track and trace programme had been a complete failure. Quite the reverse, Door Matt, said, the bags beneath his eyes visibly drooping still further. It was only because of Typhoid Dido’s brilliance in only managing to ring the flatmates who already knew that the person they shared with had had a positive test, that community testing had become possible. All the best scientific advances were made on the back of calamity, and the country owed a huge debt of gratitude to Typhoid Dido for her uselessness. The briefing ended with Messenger Messenger going slightly off message by saying that the mass community testing probably wouldn’t be happening en masse. Given the numbers involved and the comparatively limited personnel resources, it would take months to sequence out the testing of the 23 million people in tier 3. Not such a happy Christmas everyone. But by now Hancock was just glad to bring the briefing to an end. No one had asked him about scotch eggs or his friendship with the landlord of the Cock Inn, who had made millions from testing equipment. And on a bad day, that constituted a win. • Join John Crace and Guardian columnist Marina Hyde as they look back at a political year like no other.

2020-11-30T20:00:06Z,politics,Politics,England's Covid tiers impact report: what it says and doesn't say,"On Monday the government finally set out the economic and health impacts that it says are behind the tiering system for controlling the pandemic. The 48-page document does not include many new facts and figures, instead pulling together statistics and forecasts. Using language likely to frustrate many MPs, it says it is not possible to assess whether the economic cost of the tiers system in England will be greater than that of taking no action. However, it argues that preventing the NHS from becoming overwhelmed has to be the priority. “The costs in terms of loss of life in such a scenario are considered intolerable for society,” it says. The need for continued action The impact assessment focuses heavily on the risks of doing nothing. It says the previous system, in which the rules were relatively light, let the pandemic get out of control. “This resulted in a sustained period where R [reproduction number] was above 1 for several weeks” during September, the document says. “Without further ongoing intervention when the national restrictions end … R would again increase to a level that is significantly above 1.” It highlights that there was “rapid growth in hospital admissions in England, with the 7-day rolling average jumping from 59 on 1 September to 364 to 1 October and to 1,276 on 1 November”. And it makes a stark warning about what would happen if a tough new tiered system is not introduced. “A sustained period of exponential growth, with R above 1, will result in hospitals becoming overwhelmed.” The document says that if the pandemic was left unchecked, there would no longer be enough capacity in intensive care for both Covid patients and others needing emergency help. That would lead to “a much higher proportion” of deaths in intensive care. It would also affect routine hospital work. A panel sets out what could be a risk: “In a typical month, the NHS delivers: half a million emergency admissions, 49,000 cancer treatments, 10,000 hip replacements, 7,000 knee replacements, 39,000 cataract operations, 2m first outpatient appointments, and millions of other treatments.” The document argues: “Given the catastrophic health costs, both from increased Covid-19 deaths and due to the wider impacts across NHS services, the government is clear that a scenario of the NHS being overwhelmed must be averted, through proportional policy.” Tiers and the ‘R’ number No specific forecast is given for the impact that the incoming three-tier system of restrictions is expected to have on the R number, the speed of transmission of Covid-19. Instead it makes a general and an uncontentious statement: “We are confident that it will be substantially lower than the counterfactual of no tiering or equivalent measures being in place,” so “reducing deaths in the short term as well as reducing the risk of an overwhelming of the National Health Service.” But it does note that “the initial tier 3 restrictions agreed by local areas in October” may have been associated with “a reduction in R between a quarter to a half” relative to the lowest level, tier 1. A shift from tier 1 to tier 2 was associated with “a modest reduction” in the transmission rate, although here no figure is cited. Wider effects on health: the pros and cons of tiers The document then goes through the new tiered restrictions as seen through the prisms of health and wider society, many of which are statements of the obvious. Air pollution and road traffic accidents are expected to be lower, as are accidents at work. The rates of other communicable diseases, such as influenza, are expected to drop, as was seen during winter across the southern hemisphere.
Personal health is likely to be worse. “We anticipate physical activity will be slightly lower under the tiers,” the impact analysis says, and “alcohol consumption slightly higher”. There may also be more home accidents and “musculoskeletal disorders” because home workers will have “less access to professional ergonomic advice” and will be more likely to have cramped setups. Every 1% fall in employment caused by the introduction of the tiers system is met with a 2% increase in “five categories of chronic illness” – musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, mental health, and what are described as other conditions. Mental health issues There are expected to be “some short-term negative mental health impacts” associated with the tiers system, although social bubbles may help offset that to some extent. But there is little detailed analysis here, other than to stress that “mental health could be worse in a counterfactual situation of Covid-19 resuming exponential growth”. And, in what may be a surprising finding, the assessment concludes there is “no significant worsening” in “generalised anxiety disorder scores”, which are monitored by Public Health England.
One aspect of public mood monitoring is highlighted as particularly important for justifying a return to the tiered model as opposed to remaining in lockdown. As of 9 November, according to University College London, “around 1 in 3 people report being worried about finances (up from 1 in 4 over the summer)”, thereby justifying a controlled opening up of the economy. Crime and society People “will not be able to undertake all the activities they ordinarily would” under the tiered system. But the ability of people to meet others from beyond their bubble outdoors in tier 2 “will go some way to addressing the issues of social isolation and loneliness seen earlier in the pandemic”, the document concludes. The impacts on crime are mixed, and based largely on previous experience. “There was a reduction in theft and the overall number of victims of crime during the first national lockdown,” the assessment notes, following a 30% reduction in theft between April and June. But recorded crime “flagged as domestic abuse-related increased”. It concludes: “We know that the health, societal and the economic effects are unevenly distributed, so the government has taken a range of actions to tackle this.” The particular focus has been “to mitigate the impact on children and young people – especially the disadvantaged”, which is why schools have remained open while so many activities have been suspended or curtailed. Economic impact The document says the economic damage from tiered coronavirus restrictions in England is impossible to quantify. Essentially it argues that it is too difficult to disentangle from other factors influencing Britain’s economic performance during the health emergency. The economic impact is “not possible to know with any degree of confidence”, given the unprecedented nature of the virus and the restrictions that have been used to control it, it says. Instead of setting out fresh analysis on the economic costs and benefits, the report republishes estimates for the UK economy made last week by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury tax and spending watchdog. Repackaging the OBR forecasts presented by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, alongside last week’s spending review, the analysis says these estimates could illustrate the potential impacts of revised restrictions from Wednesday.
In the OBR’s central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) falls by 11.3% this year – the biggest decline in more than three centuries – but gradually recovers next year, before the economy returns to its pre-pandemic size by the end of 2022. Unemployment peaks at 7.5% – as many as 2.6 million people – by the middle of next year. However, although the OBR estimates take into account continued restrictions, they do not model the precise detail of specific restrictions or the impact they might have on the economy. Setting out the ways in which restrictions can have both costs and benefits for jobs and growth, the document concludes that given “the unprecedented nature of both the virus and the restrictions that have been required to mitigate it, it is not possible to assess the balance of these effects.” In a short section on the longer-term impacts on the economy, the document only notes: “Despite the substantive and unprecedented fiscal support given to support public services, households and businesses since March … both the central forecast and downside scenario do lead to economic scarring.”"
2020-11-30T18:31:56Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Matt Hancock says pandemic 'back under control' but country cannot let up – as it happened,"A government document intended to win over Tory MPs reluctant to vote for the three-tier coronavirus restrictions in England tomorrow has failed to impress backbenchers. They wanted a cost-benefit analysis of the restrictions. But the assessment published this afternoon does not provide that. (See 5.56pm and 6.08pm.) Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said: On a number of occasions, Iâ€™ve requested from the chancellor and Treasury officials that they publish an analysis of the economic impacts of the three tiers. With little over 24 hours until MPs vote on the new tiered system, this rehashed document offers very little further in economic terms other than that which the OBR published last week. Itâ€™s frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country. Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will be banned from selling alcohol and forced to shut early, as the Welsh first minister said Covid was spreading â€œincredibly quicklyâ€� across the country and that the gains made during its â€œfirebreakâ€� lockdown were being eroded. Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to pay every NHS and social care worker in Scotland a Â£500 Covid bonus and has called on Boris Johnson to make the payment tax-free. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has claimed that some areas of England could be moved into a lower tier before Christmas. Speaking at a No 10 conference, he said: We will look at the data on December 16 and will announce the results of that review on December 17. Of course youâ€™ve got to take into account that Christmas is coming up, but, nevertheless, with the case rates coming down as they are - coming down by almost third in the last week - then we will be absolutely looking at each area and seeing what is the right tier for that area. I want to see areas that have pulled together, followed the rules, got the case rate down - like Liverpool has over the last month, which has led to it going into Tier 2 - I want to see that happening more broadly. A flagship government scheme to use rapid testing to allow care home visitors to hug loved ones before Christmas has been dealt a serious blow after a council instructed providers not to use the tests, citing fears that they lack accuracy. More than half of people applying for financial support to self-isolate are being rejected in some coronavirus hotspots in England as councils report running out of cash and loopholes leave low-income families ineligible. Almost 700,000 people in the UK, including 120,000 children, have been plunged into poverty as a result of the Covid economic crisis, according to a thinktank analysis. The British government has decided not to order a public inquiry into the 1989 murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane, one of the most notorious killings of the Troubles, despite intense legal and political pressure. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-30T17:54:08Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon promises £500 for all NHS staff in Scotland,"Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to pay every NHS and social care worker in Scotland a £500 Covid bonus and has called on Boris Johnson to make the payment tax-free. In a speech to the Scottish National party’s annual conference that sought to link the recovery from the pandemic with the push for independence, the first minister said health and social care workers deserved special recognition for the “incredible” sacrifices they had made. Sturgeon added to repeated attacks on Johnson’s government in her speech on Monday by urging the prime minister not to tax the bonus, arguing that Holyrood’s income tax powers were too limited to do so. Implying that this was a test of Johnson’s compassion, she said: “We are asking nothing of the UK government – with this one exception. Please allow our health and care heroes to keep every penny of Scotland’s thank-you to them. Do not take any of it away in tax.” Scottish government officials said the pledge would cost about £180m and would cover 391,000 full-time and part-time NHS and social care staff, including students who volunteered to help during lockdown, GP surgery staff and palliative care workers, as well as their employers’ share of staff national insurance contributions.
Sturgeon’s aides said they did not know whether the UK tax system allowed one-off bonuses to be made tax-free and were not aware whether it had been done before. One said it was down to the prime minister to confirm whether he liked the proposal, before working out the logistics. The Treasury said any income tax levied on the £500 bonus would be collected by the Scottish government, so Sturgeon could increase the bonus to cover the tax lost, and then eventually recoup that via increased tax revenues. “The income tax on these payments is paid to Scotland, not Westminster – and the Scottish government has the powers and funding to cover the tax owed on the payment if it wishes,” a spokesman said. The first minister also unveiled other funding pledges: £100m to help the poor and vulnerable over winter, including a £100 one-off payment to families whose children get free school meals; and new funding for apprenticeships, including a £100-a-week apprenticeship bonus for school leavers under 18 and £5,000 to firms for each new apprentice they hire. The Scottish Conservatives argued that these schemes used £9.2bn in record extra funding from the Treasury to the devolved government to tackle the social and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. About £1bn of that has not yet been accounted for in Scottish government budgets. “This was a series of SNP promises brought to you by [the chancellor] Rishi Sunak’s spending,” said Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. Sturgeon said, however, that the policies were evidence of Scotland’s socially conscious and inclusive ethics in a speech that mentioned Johnson by name five times and Brexit eight times. She said the Covid crisis had proved there was a gulf between the UK and Scottish government’s outlook and attitude, strengthening the case for independence. She deflected demands from many SNP activists for headway on a fresh referendum, however, asking voters for their authority in next May’s Scottish election to call for one “in the early part of the next parliament”. “If we want to make sure the country we rebuild is the one we want it to be, with kindness, compassion, fairness, equality and enterprise at its heart, and not one built in the image of Boris Johnson and his band of Brexiteers, we must work to the right plan, with all the tools we need to do the job,” she said. “Independence is not a distraction from the task of post-Covid reconstruction. It is essential to getting it right.” Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said: “This sum announced by Nicola Sturgeon will not make up for the years of pay restraint and austerity that staff in these sectors have had imposed on them by Tory and SNP ministers.” As many care staff were part-time, their pro rata bonus would be “derisory”, he added."
2020-11-30T17:32:43Z,politics,Politics,"No way to assess costs of Covid tiers against no action, Tory MPs told","It is impossible to know whether the economic cost of the new coronavirus tiers system in England will be greater than that of taking no action, a government analysis has concluded, arguing instead that allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be “intolerable for our society”. The 48-page document, released in response to demands from Conservative MPs threatening to vote down the tiers plan in the Commons on Tuesday, cites modelling suggesting that the top tier of restrictions lasting to the spring would cause an 11.3% drop in real GDP. But in a section about what would happen to the economy if limited or no action is taken and coronavirus cases start to rise exponentially again, the document says it is “not possible to know with any degree of confidence”. The report seemingly contains no new data, instead citing existing statistics and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Office for National Statistics and other bodies. Arguing that the new tiers are needed to get the R number below one, the document notes that limited restrictions would “allow many people and businesses to operate as normal, if they chose to do so.” It adds: “On the other hand, more widespread infections and the consequences of pressure on the NHS would affect spending in the economy due to voluntary social distancing, effects to confidence and impacts on businesses, including through high levels of employee sickness. “Given the unprecedented nature of both the virus and the restrictions that have been required to mitigate it, it is not possible to assess the balance of these effects.” Instead, the analysis primarily argues in favour of the tiers on public health grounds, saying that a failure to control the R number would swamp hospitals, putting at risk the lives of not just Covid patients but others, and would lead to routine operations being cancelled. It cites scientific estimates that on 1 October, infection numbers were doubling every 8 to 14 days, and growing even faster in some areas. “It is particularly important to consider this eventuality during the winter months, when the NHS is under additional non-Covid -19 winter pressures, so in comparison to the spring and summer periods, action to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed is even more critical. “A stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy. The government’s view is that the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society.” It remains to be seen whether this satisfies the rebel Conservatives, who are believed to number up to 70. Several have asked for assurance that the benefits of imposing the new tiers will be greater than the costs. If many Tory MPs rebel, the government could need to rely on Labour MPs backing the plans, or at least abstaining.
The Tory MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of MPs sceptical about the pandemic restrictions, said he was disappointed at the delay in publishing the data but said MPs mulling whether to vote against the tiers plan would decide on Tuesday before the vote. “I am disappointed MPs, journalists and the public have been given so little time to digest information of this magnitude,” he said. “We are, after all, talking about imposing some of the most severe restrictions on our constituents and the way they lead their lives and run their businesses. This information is what ministers should have been insisting on before they made their decisions, so it surely could have been made available earlier. “As I have said before, I and a number of colleagues are particularly keen to understand the likely impact of the restrictions on Covid and the full extent of some of the non-Covid health implications they have, as well as the undoubted impact on livelihoods. So we will read and analyse this data tonight and report back on our findings later tomorrow.” The report says the complexities of the spread of Covid and any actions to mitigate it mean it is “not possible to know” exactly what would happen in different circumstances, adding: “Any assessment of a given change to restrictions is therefore unavoidably only partial in nature.”"
2020-11-30T15:34:00Z,politics,Politics,"EU will not fall into Brexit 'negotiating trap',  UK told","Senior Irish and French and ministers have warned that the EU is not going to fall into a Brexit “negotiating trap” being laid by the UK as both sides entered into what the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has described as “the last week or so” of substantive talks. Simon Coveney, who has had a leading role in the first phase of negotiations over the Irish border, said at the same time both sides must avoid engaging in a blame game as the “truth of Brexit” and its subsequent challenges become clear. He added that there was a big incentive to get a deal done but two big issues remained unresolved. “The truth of Brexit is now being exposed in terms of the challenges of it,” Coveney told Radio Ulster. “This is something that the UK and the EU have to find a way forward on as opposed to focus on a blame game as regards who is at fault.” France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said Downing Street was misguided if it believed that running down the clock would work to No 10’s advantage, citing the experience of the last four years of Brexit talks. “We have a bit of time left but still a long way to go and if the UK believes that [the limited] time left works in its favour as it has in the past few years, that is not the case,” Beaune said. On the issue of access to UK waters, Beaune said Downing Street would not be allowed to “lay down the law” in the negotiation. “We are still very far from an agreement,” he said. “There can be no agreement unless there is one that gives sustainable and wide-ranging access to British waters … Our terms are known, they are not new.” Speaking at an event for parliamentarians from across Europe, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, conceded that there was some anxiety about the prolonged negotiations, with the Netherlands, Belgium and France all asking the European commission to trigger no-deal preparations in recent weeks.
She said: “We hope that these talks will come to a happy ending. We don’t need an agreement at any price. We want one but otherwise we’ll take measures that are necessary. In any case a deal is in the interest of all. “Some member states are now becoming unsettled. There’s not much time left.” Merkel hinted at the trade-off being offered in the negotiations between access to the EU’s single market in electricity and EU rights to catches in UK fishing waters. She said: “Perhaps for some the most tangible are concrete questions, from the British point of view access to energy markets, from our view access to British fishing grounds.” The EU had always maintained there could be no trade deal unless the contentious issue of fishing was first agreed. Although the sector contributes just 0.2% of the UK economy, it is a huge political issue for struggling coastal communities who rely on fishing and voted for Brexit. Coveney suggested the UK was using it as leverage in other parts of the trade talks and was alive to the potential for Britain to agree compromises in other areas including state aid and governance and then use that to squeeze a last-minute compromise on fishing out of the EU. “What we are not going to do is to get an agreement in all of these other areas and then allow a situation where the UK side say: ‘Look, we’re not going to allow this whole thing to collapse over fish,’ and for us to essentially give Britain what they want over fish,” he said. Coveney said this would be a “British negotiating trap”, adding: “We’re not playing that game. If there isn’t an agreement on this the whole thing could fall on the back of it.” It is thought the remaining dispute over fishing lies in both the length of a potential deal and the access of EU boats and fishing stocks in British coastal waters. According to reports, the EU’s offer on fishing – to return between 15-18% of fish stocks ccaught by EU fleets in British waters – was dismissed as “derisory” by British negotiators. However, sources say the negotiations are focused on the quotas of each of the 140 species of fish. “It’s percentages of different types of fish – rights to cod in the English Channel is more important to Britain than, say, rights to mackerel in the North Sea,” said a source. Downing Street said the negotiating teams led by Michel Barnier and David Frost worked until “late last night” in London but warned there would no compromise in the UK’s position on winning back control of fishing waters. “We want to try and reach a free trade agreement as soon as possible. But we have been clear that we won’t change our negotiating position and we have been clear what that position is,” said Boris Johnson’s spokesman."
2020-11-30T08:42:25Z,politics,Politics,Covid tiers revolt may leave ministers reliant on Labour in key vote,"Up to 100 Conservative MPs are concerned at England’s new coronavirus tiers, meaning the government may have to rely on Labour votes to get the system approved by parliament, the UK environment secretary, George Eustice, has said. Labour has not yet guaranteed its support for the system amid concerns in the party about the level of financial support available for the hard-hit hospitality industry. A Treasury source confirmed that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was planning a new package of support for pubs, bars and restaurant hit by the impact of restrictions on pre-Christmas trade but said details were still being “worked up”. Amid increasing Tory backbench disquiet about the post-lockdown tiers, in which virtually all regions in England would be put into the higher two levels this week, Eustice also said ministers could not rule out a third national lockdown. “I think it’s too early to say,” he told Sky News. “We can’t rule anything out, because this is a rapidly developing situation. The government has to respond to the epidemiological evidence that it will have at a given time.
“It’s always difficult to predict exactly what will happen. But we judge at moment that if we stick to the course with this tiered approach, at this stage, then this might get us through the winter.” Boris Johnson is trying to win over concerned Tories with promises of an economic analysis of the new tiers before Tuesday’s Commons vote, and an appeal to MPs to show unity, saying “the worst is nearly behind us”. Asked if the scale of Conservative dissent meant the government was expecting to have to rely on Labour votes to get the plan through the Commons, Eustice said: “I don’t know, and the chief whip will be, obviously, talking to those MPs who have got concerns. He said: “I’ve seen suggestions that there could up to 100 or so people who have got concerns. But the prime minister and other ministers will be working very hard to reassure them about the steps that we’re taking.” Pressed again on the need for Labour votes, Eustice conceded this was possible. He said: “Like all these things, it will depend on what other parties do, yes. It will depend on what the Labour party choose to do. I think at time like this, when you do have a national emergency, and we’re having to take emergency measures to try and save lives, it’s not the time really for any political party to play political games.” While the tiers were unveiled as a system that would last until the spring, Eustice said MPs would be offered a vote to renew them in late January. Some MPs are demanding this take place earlier.
Eustice said he understood MPs’ concerns: “There’s great frustration with the emergency measures that we’ve had to take to deal with this pandemic. We haven’t taken them lightly, we have had to take these to get the virus under control. “What we need to show to those MPs, and the country at large, is that we’ve got a clear route towards fixing this problem and turning a corner, and that will come through the deployment of the vaccine.”
In a letter on Sunday to the new Covid Research Group of Conservative MPs, which comprises many of those worried about the new tiers, Johnson promised the analysis would be published on Monday. “Disagreement on approach is natural, and I hope you recognise that the government is seeking as far as possible to listen to criticism and respond positively to constructive proposals,” the prime minister wrote. “There is every reason to hope and believe that the worst is nearly behind us, so now more than ever is the time to demonstrate unity and resolve. As we move from winter to spring, the prospects offered by vaccines and testing mean we can begin the process of recovery in earnest and focus our energies once again on improving the lives of the people we were elected to serve.”"
2020-11-29T16:50:03Z,politics,Politics,Ethics watchdog asked to assess if Rishi Sunak broke ministerial code,"The government ethics watchdog has been asked to assess whether the ministerial code was breached by Rishi Sunak not declaring in the register of ministerial interests a multimillion-pound portfolio of shares held by his wife and her family. The Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi has written to Lord Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life, to ask him to look into the issue “as a matter of urgency”. Her concerns were echoed by the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, who said the revelations raised “serious questions” about the chancellor’s conduct.
The Guardian revealed on Friday that Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, was richer than the Queen thanks to a £430m shareholding in the IT multinational Infosys, which was founded by her father and is a contractor to the UK government and public bodies. She also holds direct shareholdings in at least six UK companies. None of these investments were mentioned in the chancellor’s entry in the official register. Ministers are obliged to publish details of any financial interests held by themselves, and their close family, which are relevant to their role in government and “which might be thought to give rise to a conflict” with their public duties. “The reports around the chancellor’s financial affairs are extremely concerning, and I am writing to ask you to assess whether this is a direct contravention of the ministerial code of conduct,” Antoniazzi wrote. The committee on standards in public life monitors the conduct of public office holders and advises the prime minister on ethics. It has no formal powers but its recommendations are traditionally accepted by the government of the day. Antoniazzi said allegations of a lack of transparency by the chancellor “further erode public trust in politicians and bring parliament into disrepute”. Murray added: “The ministerial code is clear that ministers must ensure no conflict arises between their position and their private interests, as well as those of their close family members. If the chancellor has nothing to hide, he should come clean to the British public.” Sunak and Murty have not responded directly to requests for comment. The Treasury said Sunak made a full declaration of his wife’s interests to senior civil servants, and that the decision about what to publish in the list was taken by advisers. Before entering the Treasury, Sunak met the government’s then head of propriety and ethics, Helen MacNamara, to decide what needed to be declared, a government source said. MacNamara reviewed the interests of Sunak and Murty and confirmed at the time, and again recently, that she was “satisfied” with what had been registered. The former independent adviser on ministers’ interests Sir Alex Allan also approved the disclosures, according to the source. A Treasury spokesperson said Allan had confirmed he was “completely satisfied with the chancellor’s propriety of arrangements” and that he had “followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests”. Allan resigned from his role this month after falling out with the prime minister over his decision not to take action against the home secretary, Priti Patel. A report by Allan concluded Patel had breached the ministerial code by bullying civil servants. At the time, Evans, the chair of the committee on standards in public life, said Allan’s departure raised “serious questions about the effectiveness of the current arrangements for investigating and responding to breaches of the ministerial code”. His committee recently launched a “landscape review” of the institutions, processes and structures that uphold standards in public life, after acknowledging mounting concern about the conduct of Boris Johnson’s government over issues such as the purchasing of PPE. Transparency International said the register of interests was there to ensure decisions were being made in the national interest, not for “personal gain”. Alex Runswick, the senior advocacy manager at the campaign group, said: “To rebuild public confidence, we need a political culture where it is common practice to go above and beyond the letter of the guidance in declaring potential conflicts of interest and where there are consequences for breaching the rules.”"
2020-11-29T14:33:20Z,politics,Politics,Jamaicans who came to UK as children will be left off deportation flight,"A deal has been quietly agreed between the Home Office and Jamaica not to remove people who came to the UK as children on a controversial charter flight to the Caribbean island this week, its high commissioner has said. Seth Ramocan told the Guardian that following diplomatic overtures to the Home Office, officials agreed not to deport Jamaicans who came to Britain under the age of 12. The Home Office has declined to comment and there has been no public announcement. It comes after 82 black public figures – including the author Bernardine Evaristo, model Naomi Campbell and historian David Olusoga – urged airlines not to carry up to 50 Jamaicans on the Home Office deportation flight scheduled for Wednesday. Home Office charter flights are a common way to remove those classed as having no right to remain, including due to certain serious criminal convictions. The last charter flight to Jamaica was in February; many others due to fly had their deportation halted at the 11th hour due to legal action. Charter flights to Jamaica are particularly controversial because of the Windrush scandal and because some earmarked for deportation came to the UK as children and had families there. In 2018 a Home Office-commissioned report from the former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephen Shaw called for a new approach to the policy of detaining and removing people who had committed crimes but lived most of their lives in Britain. The Home Office has not implemented the recommendation. But Ramocan said the high commission had made representations ahead of the Wednesday charter flight and that an agreement had been reached not to deport those who arrived as young children. “It’s not law, it’s a kind of understanding,” he said. “They have consented to having an age limit. It isn’t that the law has changed in any way. It’s a consideration, a request that has been granted. We really appreciate the level of cooperation and consideration given to the representations we made to the Home Office.” Karen Doyle from the campaign group Movement For Justice has analysed the backgrounds of charter flight deportees. She said that of a sample of 20 cases who are due to fly to Jamaica on Wednesday, it is notable that none arrived in the UK before the age of 12. Doyle said: “With previous flights the proportion who arrived here as children was always much higher. This is a welcome change and something that has been fought for for many years. But the secrecy around it is disturbing. A backroom deal just for this flight is not acceptable. The change must apply to all those who came as children regardless of their country of origin.” The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said “it shouldn’t take the Jamaican government to force the Home Office” to act. “This sort of deal-making behind closed doors is no way to make policy on such an important issue,” he said. Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said: “If true, this agreement marks progress in reforming our barbaric deportation system, but why the secrecy? To be effective, this rule must be written into the law so that it can provide protection in practice and should be applied equally to all who arrive in the UK under 18, wherever they may have arrived from.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals to keep the public safe. Each week we remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries who have no right to be here; this flight is no different. The people being detained for this flight include convicted murderers and rapists.”"
2020-11-29T14:00:29Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: what will change for Britons in the EU on 1 January?,"The end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December is looming, and with it some major changes for anyone going from the UK to continental Europe – either to holiday, work or live. Some have been confirmed but others are dependent on continuing negotiations over a deal. UK state pensions If you already live in the EU and draw a state pension from the UK, your payments will go up each year in line with the triple lock – that is the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. Even if you do not claim a pension yet, when you start doing so you will get the same as if you lived in the UK and this will hold for your lifetime.
British in Europe, a coalition of campaign groups for British nationals settled or about to live in the EU, has put together a useful set of guides on benefits and their future. Remember the rules will apply to any EU citizen, British or otherwise, who has paid their national contributions in the UK. If you have worked in several countries, your contributions will be aggregated and payable just as they are now under the withdrawal agreement signed in January. For anyone who moves to the EU after January, you will still be able to claim your UK state pension, but how much you get will depend on the outcome of the talks. A draft agreement on social security drawn up by the UK government puts forward a system whereby pensioners in the EU will receive the same as if they had remained in Britain. If you are moving to Ireland, you will still benefit from the annual rise. Healthcare One of the issues that has not been settled yet is that of reciprocal healthcare. UK citizens living in the EU before the end of 2020, and EU citizens living in the UK, will still be entitled to access healthcare as they do currently. But anyone relocating after that could find the situation is different unless a deal is agreed. Only some groups will definitely continue to benefit from free healthcare. These are Irish citizens moving to the UK and UK citizens moving to Ireland; students studying in the EU; and people who hold an S1 form from the UK, which is for pensioners and people receiving certain state benefits. Ehic cards Currently anyone on a temporary stay in the EU should get a European health insurance card (Ehic) from the UK government; with this, you will be able to access treatment while in the EU. But after the transition period, an Ehic issued in the UK will not be valid. This applies to EU nationals living in the UK as the entitlement flows from tax residency not birth nationality. The UK is seeking a like-for-like replacement scheme with the EU as a whole, but nothing has been signed off yet.
The good news is that after December 2020 the scheme will still work for some groups of people from the UK. These include students studying in the EU, who can get a card that is valid only in the country where they are studying, and S1 form holders (see above). Also, if you are living in the EU before the end of 2020, you will be allowed an Ehic card issued in that country that will be valid in the UK and elsewhere. Travel insurance When it is possible to travel again without Covid restrictions, if there are no arrangements in place you will need to make sure you have travel insurance. Currently cheaper policies come with the proviso that you need an Ehic card, and the provider will not expect to pay out for treatment you could get using that. If you have an annual policy you plan to rely on, you need to make sure it is not affected. The Association of British Insurers is warning consumers that travel insurance policies could be more costly if Ehic is not continued or replaced. Its website says: “In the absence of the Ehic or similar reciprocal health agreement, insurers will inevitably see an increase in claims costs – this could have a direct impact on the prices charged to consumers. This will vary depending on the provider.” Driving in Europe If you are planning a trip to Europe that involves driving, under current arrangements you will need some extra documents when you go. Anyone driving their own vehicle will need to have a so-called green card – this is proof that you are insured and you get it from your car insurer. Make sure you ask for it a month before you plan to travel. You may also need an international driving permit (IDP) to drive in some countries, although it is not yet clear which states may ask for it – currently no EU countries are on the list. The IDP costs £5.50 and is available from post offices. Pet passports The UK has applied to become a “listed country”, which will allow pets to be moved between it and the EU almost as freely as now. But if this is not approved, travelling with your pet will become much harder if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. Moving a pet between Northern Ireland and the EU will continue to be as easy as it is now. The current pet passport scheme is to end, and you will need to get an animal health certificate when you want to travel overseas. This will involve waiting three months after a blood sample has been taken from your pet, so journeys will involve a lot more planning. Roaming charges Under EU law mobile phone providers are not allowed to charge customers extra for making calls from a different country in the bloc. But as of January, customers from the UK will not be covered by this rule. The big providers, Three, EE, O2 and Vodafone, have all said they have no plans to introduce roaming charges, but if they wanted to change their policies this would be allowed. The only protection travellers would have from big bills is under a new UK rule on unexpected charges – this applies a financial cap on mobile data usage overseas. Under the rule, which comes into force on 1 January, customers will not be able to spend more than £45 a month on mobile data services when roaming without actively opting in to use more. They will be alerted when they are at 80% and 100% of usage. Customers in Northern Ireland will have an extra protection against inadvertent roaming in Ireland– this can happen near borders when a phone links to a mast in a different country. Providers will be obliged to help customers avoid these charges, and may offer special tariffs or messaging when people inadvertently roam. • This article was amended on 30 November 2020. Text was added to clarify that S1 form holders will remain eligible for the Ehic scheme after 1 January 2021."
2020-11-29T13:32:45Z,politics,Politics,"Tories are 'in a panic' over Scottish independence, says Ian Blackford","The Scottish National party’s leader in Westminster has accused Tory MPs of denying Holyrood the powers to hold a second independence referendum because “unionism has run out of road”. Ian Blackford told the SNP’s online conference: “The UK that they argue for no longer exists and they have no idea how to reimagine or reinvent it … The Tories are in a panic – they are unwilling to accept the truth that a majority of Scotland’s people now want an independent future.” Referring to the UK government’s insistence that it will not grant the section 30 order required for the Scottish parliament to legally hold another poll, as well as their plans for a UK-wide internal market after Brexit, Blackford said: “Instead of listening to the will of the Scottish people, the Tories are attempting to deny democracy and destroy devolution.”
Blackford was speaking before a motion on Sunday morning affirming the party’s commitment to independence, which has been dismissed as “bland” by some activists amid growing frustration that focused debate on referendum strategy is being quashed by the SNP leadership. A vote on resolutions excluded from the conference, including a so-called Plan B route to a second referendum and the development of a Scottish pound, will take place at an alternative event also being held online on Sunday. Introducing the resolution on an independent future for Scotland, the SNP’s constitutional relations secretary, Mike Russell, told delegates that his government would bring forward legislation required to hold another referendum before next May’s Holyrood elections and “we will ask the people of Scotland to specifically endorse [it] at the election”. In a warning to more impatient activists, Russell said: “There are good ideas aplenty from B-Z [but] nothing can happen unless the SNP is in government.” Referring to the US election this month, he noted that when dealing with Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the democratic outcomes, Joe Biden “didn’t match it with threats or lawsuits”. But other speakers challenged the party to take immediate action. The former MP Roger Mullin said arguments to convince voters of independence “must dominate policymaking”, telling delegates: “We have much work to do and the party has not been doing enough of it.” Joanna Cherry, a vocal proponent of the need to develop policy positions and have answers to questions that scuppered the last independence campaign, encouraged members to vote candidates on to the party’s governing body to “get on with planning and free up the first minister to concentrate on the Covid crisis”."
2020-11-29T10:45:25Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer warned not to insist Labour MPs vote for Brexit deal,"Keir Starmer, the Labour party leader, faces the threat of resignations from his frontbench team should he order MPs to vote in favour of a Brexit deal agreed by the government. Labour sources said that there were shadow ministers willing to step down if ordered to vote for the deal that could be agreed this week, with one describing it as a “dangerous moment” for the Starmer’s authority. The Brexit row is just one of the issues facing the party over the next few months that are set to test Starmer, as he attempts to rejuvenate Labour after its crushing election defeat last year. Figures close to him said that early in the new year, he would begin to spell out how the party would foster a post-Covid recovery and move beyond attacks on the government’s competence. Since he became leader, Starmer has closed a Tory lead of more than 20 points in the polls to level pegging in recent weeks, but many in the party believe that a combination of unrest on the left, Labour’s reluctance to discuss Brexit and the economic damage wrought by Covid will pose greater challenges for him. Others think the emergence of Covid vaccines in the spring will help Boris Johnson’s government stabilise its reputation after a torrid 2020. One Labour veteran said that while Starmer had made a strong start by focusing on his competence, many in the party were “worried about Keir, because they don’t feel they know enough about where he sits on the political spectrum”. He added: “I think there is some degree of confusion within the Labour party as to where he stands and what his values are. And that is because of the lack of things that he’s fighting for beyond competence. He has to establish not a set of detailed policies, but a political position, which tells the public that we stand for our values. It has to be about much more than competence.” How Starmer orders MPs to vote on the Brexit deal, should it be agreed, is already causing anguish among his team. One influential MP said that there was nervousness among frontbenchers and within the shadow cabinet over backing the deal, adding they would “consider their position” should Labour vote for it. Another said: “There would be several junior ministerial resignations if we were forced to vote for it. I think that it would be a terrible mistake and there are many more people who feel that way in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] and in the shadow cabinet than has been suggested.” Figures at the top of the party are convinced voting through a deal is the only realistic option, with sources suggesting that Starmer is ready to order his MPs to back it. However, concern has built since a meeting of Labour MPs early last week, when several spoke in favour of backing a Brexit deal. Some present said they felt the event had been coordinated. Labour’s internal row over Brexit came as the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs he was prepared for a further four days of make-or-break negotiations, with growing scepticism among EU member states about the utility of further talks. Having spent a week in isolation after a member of the bloc’s team tested positive for coronavirus, Barnier and his staff resumed face-to-face negotiations in London on Saturday. Barnier told MEPs in a private meeting on Friday that he would work through the weekend and then “maybe one or two more days” in a last-ditch attempt to bridge the large gaps between the sides. EU sources said there was a growing feeling that the lack of progress and the need to prepare businesses for the repercussions of a no-deal British departure from the EU made it unwise for negotiations to continue beyond then."
2020-11-28T19:02:46Z,politics,Politics,Last-ditch Brexit trade talks resume amid growing EU scepticism,"Michel Barnier has told MEPs he is prepared for a further four days of make-or-break Brexit negotiations, with growing scepticism among EU member states about the utility of further talks. Having spent a week in isolation after a member of the bloc’s team tested positive for coronavirus, Barnier and his staff resumed face-to-face negotiations in London on Saturday morning. Barnier told MEPs in a private meeting on Friday that he would work through the weekend and then “maybe one or two more days” in a last-ditch attempt to bridge the large gaps between the sides. EU sources said there was a growing feeling that the lack of progress and the need to prepare businesses for the repercussions of a no-deal British departure from the EU made it unwise for negotiations to continue beyond then.
With just 34 days before the end of the transition period, Barnier has been advised by officials in the European parliament that arranging for sufficient scrutiny and a consent vote by MEPs before the end of the year would be difficult without a deal by Wednesday. Priti Patel, the UK home secretary, said on Saturday: “As a government, we’re very clear in our commitment to make sure that those talks continue so that we can get to a conclusive end. “But at the same time we are preparing in the way in which our country would expect us to prepare for the end of transition – and from the Home Office and every aspect of government we are continuing while those negotiations carry on.” An extraordinary sitting of the EU chamber has been pencilled in for 28 December, as first revealed by the Guardian. A final result would be announced at 6.30pm, central European time. There is some doubt over whether the EU would be willing to take the blame for a no-deal exit by walking away if this week fails to provide a breakthrough. There is the “worst-case” option of the deal being provisionally applied and a vote being held by the European parliament after the end of the year, if further time appears useful, but that is not currently being considered. The European parliament has insisted, with Barnier’s backing, that it will have the “last word” on the trade and security treaty. The negotiations remain stuck on the level of access that will be granted to European fishing fleets in UK waters, and the means by which either side will be able to hit back if the other seeks to gain a competitive advantage by diverging on environmental, labour or social standards. Barnier expressed his dismay to EU ambassadors on Friday that the UK was still claiming that the EU-Canada trade deal offered precedent for its negotiating demands. He described progress on “level playing field” provisions as “ephemeral”, with one week’s progress constantly at risk of being undone by the next. In the political declaration on the future relationship, both sides committed to “uphold the common high standards” in the UK and the EU “at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, the climate crisis and relevant tax matters”.
The UK has agreed to non-regression on standards but it does not want EU law to be the baseline. That would introduce EU concepts and the European court of justice into the treaty. The two sides are therefore locked in talks about how to define their current common high standards. The EU is also seeking a “ratchet clause” to ensure that as either side develops its standards over time, the other side faces consequences should it choose not to follow with equivalent regulations. The negotiators are working on a model where if one side raises standards, the other must consider adopting them. The EU then wants an independent panel to judge if one side’s refusal to move in tandem is creating a competitive advantage. They would then set a remedy. But the UK is resisting anything that amounts to Brussels having the right of prior approval on domestic legislation. The scale of the difference between the two sides on fisheries was laid bare after Barnier told MEPs on Friday that the UK was seeking to repatriate 80% of the EU’s current catch in British seas, described as an “outsized” volume. The EU has so far only offered to return between 15% to 18%, an offer described by British negotiators as “derisory”."
2020-11-28T17:01:02Z,politics,Politics,SNP pledges free breakfast and lunch for primary pupils all year round,"Scotland could become the first UK nation to provide free breakfasts and lunches to every primary school child all year round, after the SNP pledged to do so if re-elected next May. Speaking at the party’s conference, the Scottish education secretary, John Swinney, made the policy commitment as he claimed that the UK chancellor Rishi Sunak’s “second wave of austerity” would unleash a “tsunami of child poverty” in Scotland. Scotland currently provides free lunches for children in years one to three, while eligibility for breakfasts varies depending on individual councils. Swinney, also Scotland’s deputy first minister, said: “We will not leave a child at the mercy of a Tory chancellor just because they are in [primary school years] P4, P5, P6 or P7. If elected next May, from 2022 we will extend universal free school lunches to all primary school pupils, P1 to P7.” The policy would be implemented from August 2022. The provision of free school breakfasts for all primary school children would also be a historic first within the UK if introduced. Swinney said: “We want every child to have every chance to learn every minute of every school day, starting from the moment they arrive in class. A child arriving at school hungry cannot learn as well as they should. So, we will also extend free provision of a healthy breakfast to all primary school pupils as well.” Like Wales, Scotland’s devolved government has previously committed to extending free meals through the Christmas and Easter holidays to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. The expanded policy would see the SNP commit to providing the meals throughout all holidays, regardless of how long the pandemic lasts. Swinney told the conference: “Another lesson of 2020 is term-time isn’t enough. Hunger doesn’t take a holiday and so neither can we. Just as we extended free meals through the holidays this year and next, if re-elected we will extend free school meals through every school holiday.” In England, the government was pushed into its second U-turn this year following Marcus Rashford’s powerful campaign against child hunger. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson called the 22-year-old footballer to tell him the government would offer an extension of its holiday activities and food programme as part of a package to support vulnerable families in England. The prime minister’s change of heart followed widespread anger after the government refused to offer meals during the October half-term break, leading to scores of councils, local businesses, charities and schools stepping up to provide meals for disadvantaged children over the holiday."
2020-11-28T14:25:31Z,politics,Politics,Nadhim Zahawi appointed minister in charge of Covid-19 vaccine rollout,"Nadhim Zahawi, a minister for business and industry, has been placed in charge of overseeing the deployment of the Covid-19 vaccine, Downing Street has announced. No 10 said the Stratford-on-Avon MP would take on the role until at least next summer. Zahari will temporarily relinquish responsibility for most areas of his brief at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Under the interim arrangement, he will serve as a joint minister between BEIS and the Department for Health and Social Care. Zahawi said he was delighted to be appointed to the role. He tweeted: “A big responsibility and a big operational challenge but absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly – saving lives and livelihoods and helping us build back better.” The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted he was “delighted” Zahawi had been appointed, adding: “We’ve an enormous task ahead with the NHS rolling out coronavirus vaccines across the UK.” Hospitals in England have been told to prepare for the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine in as little as nine days’ time, with NHS workers expected to be the first to receive the jab. NHS bosses said hospitals could expect to receive their first deliveries of a vaccine produced by the US drugmaker Pfizer and the German biotech firm BioNTech as soon as 7 December, with regulatory approval anticipated within days. The UK has placed orders for 100m doses of the Oxford vaccine – enough to vaccinate most of the population – with rollout expected in the coming weeks if the jab is approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It also has orders for 40m doses of the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech, which has been shown to have a 95% efficacy rate, and 5m doses from US firm Moderna, which trials suggest is similarly effective. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination. “We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine, alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible.” Zahawi, a businessman and co-founder of the polling firm YouGov, said this week he was concerned that his Stratford-on-Avon constituency had been placed in the third tier of restrictions. “I am hugely disappointed and sad that Warwickshire will be moving into tier 3 next week, in particular because of the effect this will have on our hospitality and tourism industries, who have already been through so much this year,” he said according to local press. “It seems that the high numbers of infections, especially among those over 60, and hospitalisations in the north of the county have counted against us. “I understand the concerns raised by large numbers of constituents about why the restrictions in Stratford-on-Avon are being affected by factors in areas further away from us than from our immediate neighbours, such as Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, both of whom will be moving into tier 2 next week. “The whole county therefore needs to work together to drive down infections so we can follow our neighbouring counties into tier 2 when these restrictions are reviewed in a fortnight’s time. I will do all I can to push and make the case for this to happen.”

2020-11-28T12:43:57Z,politics,Politics,"Scottish independence has never been so certain, Sturgeon tells SNP","Nicola Sturgeon has opened the Scottish National party annual conference by telling members she has “never been so certain” the country will achieve independence. The first minister said Scotland was “a nation on the cusp of making history” as she insisted the SNP’s goal of independence was “in clear sight”. Her comments followed last December’s “landslide victory” in Scotland during the UK general elections, in which the SNP won 48 of the 59 available seats. Since then, several opinion polls have suggested a majority of Scots are in favour of leaving the UK. While Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not allow another referendum on Scottish independence to take place, Sturgeon said a majority for her party in next year’s Holyrood election should enable such a vote to happen. Sturgeon told the conference, which is taking place online from Saturday because of coronavirus: “Scotland is now a nation on the cusp of making history. Independence is in clear sight – and with unity of purpose, humility and hard work I have never been so certain that we will deliver it. “The people of Scotland have the right to choose their future. Let’s now focus all our efforts on making sure we bring about that better country they and future generations deserve.”
The SNP leader will say support for independence among Scots has now “risen to become the sustained and majority view in public opinion”. She added that, while the primary focus must currently be on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, “Scotland must also be ready for what comes next”. She told the conference that Covid-19 had taken thousands of lives and upended Scottish society, with businesses and the economy severely damaged. But she claimed that with independence Scotland could have a “resilient economy, with job creation and fairness at its heart” and would be able to protect and invest in public services like the NHS. She said: “We can overcome poverty, inequality, and we lead the way in tackling the climate emergency. The question for all of us as we look ahead to the election next May is this – who should be taking the decisions that shape our futures? “We know that it is the people who live here, wherever they come from, who can best harness Scotland’s immense human and natural resources to the benefit of everyone.” She said the main question leading up to the election next May was: “Who should be taking the decisions that will shape our futures? We know that it is the people who live here, wherever they come from, who can best harness Scotland’s immense human and natural resources to the benefit of everyone.”
Sturgeon’s opponents have said she should focus on the fight against Covid-19. The Scottish Labour constitution spokesman, Anas Sarwar, said: “This proves that Nicola Sturgeon only has one priority – dividing the people of Scotland. “In the midst of a global pandemic, when people are losing their jobs and saying goodbye to loved ones, it is insulting that she wants to focus on independence.” Pamela Nash, the chief executive of the pro-UK Scotland in Union group, said: “Issuing a rallying cry for independence when people across Scotland are struggling with the devastating impact of the pandemic is deeply insulting. The next few years must be all about recovery from coronavirus, and that should be the entire focus for the Scottish government.” In early November, an Ipsos Mori poll found Scottish voters believed the economy, health and Brexit were more important issues than independence, while a narrow majority of voters did not want a referendum next year, even if the SNP won a majority of seats."
2020-11-28T10:26:03Z,politics,Politics,Starmer prepares to reopen old Labour wounds over Brexit deal vote,"Keir Starmer is preparing to risk a party rift by throwing Labour’s weight behind a Brexit deal if last-minute negotiations succeed in the coming days. In what he hopes will be a signal to “red wall” voters that the party has heard them, multiple Labour sources said Starmer, and Cabinet Office shadow minister, Rachel Reeves – who has been liaising with backbenchers on the issue – are minded to impose a three-line whip in support of a deal, subject to the detail. They have rejected the idea of abstaining or giving MPs a free vote, fearing it would suggest Labour has failed to absorb the lessons of the pasting it took in last December’s general election. Brexit deal negotiations are in their final, make-or-break few days, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier returning to London on Friday to resume face-to-face talks on Saturday despite his threat to pull out earlier in the week. If a deal can be done, the prime minister is expected to bring it to parliament before Christmas, most likely by tabling the future relationship bill which the Cabinet Office has been working on for several months. That could potentially allow Labour to signal its lack of enthusiasm by tabling amendments – though these would stand little chance of passing. Boris Johnson’s majority of 80 means the deal would be highly likely to go through even if Labour abstained, but Starmer and his team believe the consequences of a no-deal exit from the transition period would be too dire for the party to stand on the sidelines. “If you want something to happen in parliament, the best way to go about it is to vote for it,” said one shadow cabinet member with knowledge of Starmer’s thinking. They are likely to avoid language such as “supporting” the deal, however. Starmer is also expected to make a speech setting out more details of how Labour sees Britain’s future place in the world. Even many of those MPs who fought hard during the 2017-19 parliament for a people’s vote are expected to fall in behind the leadership, fearing the dire consequences of a no-deal exit on 1 January. But some MPs say Starmer’s team, led by former former Darlington MP Jenny Chapman, is too focused on “fighting the last war” by aiming all their political messaging at disgruntled Brexit voters in the red wall. They believe supporting a Johnson deal will leave Labour unable to hold the government to account for Brexit’s economic consequences, and damage the party in Scotland by allowing Nicola Sturgeon to lump the “Westminster parties” together on the issue. “The SNP will be cock-a-hoop,” said one Labour insider. Starmer’s allies reject the idea that they will be blamed if Brexit is economically disastrous, however, pointing out that while Labour supported entering the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in 1990, it was the Tory government, and not John Smith or Gordon Brown, whom voters held responsible when the UK crashed out two years later.
A different concern is expressed by members of the Love Socialism, Hate Brexit group of MPs, who made the leftwing case for revisiting the 2016 referendum in the last parliament, and were recently addressed by Reeves in a zoom meeting. Some of this caucus are worried about the idea that the deal will set the pattern for future trade deals for the next decade and beyond, triggering a race to the bottom on rights and regulations. The Norwich South MP Clive Lewis, who resigned rather than vote for article 50, said: “It’s likely to be a framework deal, which means there will be massive holes in it. That’s in effect a near blank cheque, and it potentially ties Labour’s hands for 10-15 years. “It’s not just about our relationship with Europe, it’s about regulatory realignment and whether we end up with a neoliberal US-type economy, on workers’ rights, on the environment, on food standards. For people like me, it’s a point of principle.” Several members of the group – recently relaunched under the name Love Socialism, in recognition that the chance of stopping Brexit has passed – have junior roles on Starmer’s frontbench including Alex Sobel and Rachael Maskell. It also includes Marsha De Cordova, who is in the shadow cabinet. Meanwhile, the irony of Starmer, who systematically dismantled Theresa May’s Brexit deal with his “six tests”, now whipping MPs to back a deal that will put the UK outside the single market and the customs union, is not lost on some of his Labour colleagues. One former red wall MP who lost their seat in 2019 said: “I’m thoroughly pissed off that the same group of people who were putting through clever technical bills a year ago are now the same people saying: ‘It’s very important that we support a deal.’ When we were advocating a much softer deal, we were basically hung out as Tory sympathisers.” There are also questions over whether Johnson would bring any deal to the House for a vote. Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher at the Hansard Society said the government had the legal means to get around lengthy scrutiny of a document that could extend to 700 pages. It should allow parliament 21 days’ scrutiny under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. “Unless parliament were to sit Fridays and Christmas, it’s too late for the UK to lay a deal before parliament for the 21-sitting-day scrutiny period under the Crag Act and still ratify it before 1 January,” she said. “But, assuming the deal needs primary legislation to implement it, that legislation could just exempt the treaty from Crag. Or, the government could use section 22 of the Crag Act, which says the act does not apply to a treaty if a minister ‘is of the opinion that, exceptionally, the treaty should be ratified without [its] requirements having been met.’” Some believe the reaction of the ERG to the details on fishing and sovereignty will dictate the route Johnson takes. “It will be a political question as to whether the government wants to bring it to a vote.”
Barnier, before his return to London, briefed EU ambassadors that “he was clear that things are entirely stuck,” said an EU source. Barnier’s travel plans appeared to be “driven more by a wish at the highest levels of the European commission to negotiate until the bitter end than actual progress on the ground,” the source added. In turn, David Frost, who is leading the UK’s negotiating team, offered his own downbeat assessment in a statement on social media, as both sides sought to extract a final deal-making concession. “Some people are asking me why we are still talking,” Frost tweeted. “My answer is that it’s my job to do my utmost to see if the conditions for a deal exist. It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it’s clear that it isn’t.” • This article was amended on 28 November 2020 to clarify that Marsha De Cordova is in the shadow cabinet, not in a junior role on the Labour frontbench as stated in an earlier version."
2020-11-27T17:48:11Z,politics,Politics,Johnson defends Covid tier system in England as Tory backlash grows,"Boris Johnson has made clear he has no intention of ripping up the stringent new tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England to placate angry Tory MPs, as a row continues to rage about the data underlying the government’s decisions. The prime minister promised to publish what his spokesman called “an analysis of the health, economic and social impact of the tiers approach” before next Tuesday’s vote on the system, and committed to reviewing the tiers on 16 December. But senior MPs have continued to raise concerns about the data underlying the decision-making that led to 99% of England’s population being placed in the top two tiers, with strict limits on socialising. Some believe up to 70 Tory backbenchers could refuse to support the government, leaving Johnson reliant on Labour votes to implement the policy. The chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, William Wragg, wrote to Michael Gove on Friday posing a series of questions, including “can you explain the governance of lockdown decisions?” and “who should we hold to account for ensuring data underpinning lockdown decisions are transparent?”. Johnson gave a robust defence of the new approach, which government scientists have acknowledged is stricter for many people than the rules that were in place before the four-week lockdown. Johnson explained why broad areas had been placed in the same tier – a decision that has infuriated Kent MPs, for example, who resent the entire county facing the toughest restrictions. “The difficulty is, if you did it any other way, first of all you’d divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated subdivisions – there’s got to be some simplicity and some clarity in the way we do this,” he said on a visit to a Public Health England lab. He added that when an area was placed in a lower tier than an adjacent area where the infection rate was high, “the low incidence area I’m afraid starts to catch up”. The economic analysis document is being put together by officials in the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office. Privately, some government insiders acknowledge that key rebel figures such as Steve Baker are unlikely to be won over by any number of Whitehall bar charts. Lockdown sceptics questioned one of the graphs used in Thursday’s Downing Street press conference, showing a continued rise in hospital occupancy, arguing that official figures showed new admissions to hospitals had begun falling even before the lockdown. “Time and again we are being given data out of context or data that just doesn’t stack up when challenged,” said a former Conservative minister. “The information presented to justify the current lockdown proved to be completely inaccurate. Now it feels as if we are being given selective information to justify these latest measures. The government cannot expect to get the support of backbenchers if the data presented to us all keeps proving to be either dodgy or misleading.” Labour has not yet made a decision on whether to support the new system. Keir Starmer is due to be briefed by government advisers, including the chief medical officer, on Monday.
Labour is pressing the government to provide more support for businesses in the areas under the toughest rules, and a clear route out of tier 3. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said on Friday there would be an opportunity for some areas to “de-escalate” to a lower tier before Christmas. But his optimism contrasted with the view of Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Sage advisory committee, who told the BBC he didn’t expect enough data to have emerged by 16 December. “I think that is quite an early time to be able to see what the effect has been,” he said. “For me I think that is quite an early review stage. I can’t imagine there will be huge changes at that point just simply because I don’t think we will have accumulated much data by then.” Johnson has stressed the importance of mass, rapid turnaround testing, as used in Liverpool, in bringing case levels down. Local authorities in all tier-3 areas will be able to apply from next week for a six-week package of support to roll out rapid testing. But with more than 23 million people in tier 3, some areas will have to be prioritised."
2020-11-27T17:29:29Z,politics,Politics,Kent rebranded 'toilet of England' by anti-Brexit protesters,"Road signs at the Kent border welcoming drivers to the “Garden of England” have been defaced by anti-Brexit protesters to label the county the “Toilet of England”. A group called EU Flag Mafia said they had used “scissors and stickers” to transform dozens of signs at 27 entry roads across the 90-mile county border. The protest – a reference to the likelihood of gridlock on carriageways due to Brexit leading to stranded motorists taking desperate measures by the roadside – came as lorry traffic was brought to a standstill for the second time in a week on the approach road to Eurotunnel and the port of Dover. An EU Flag Mafia spokesperson said: “It is utter madness. Just this week they tested the border controls at Dover and there were tailbacks as far as the eye could see. There were even headlines about it in the New York Times. We are an international laughing stock. Something has to be done: there are already bottles of urine thrown in laybys and bags of excrement hanging off trees. It is all set to get much worse. People around here have had enough.” The five-mile queues to Dover earlier this week were blamed on a French rehearsal of Brexit checks. Friday’s jams were put down to a combination of “Christmas and Brexit stockpiling”, according to Eurotunnel sources, and a reduced ferry service due to Covid. Businessman Peter Cook, who organised the sign changes, said he was careful not to do any permanent damage: “We did the lot [of the welcome signs]. We may have missed a couple of country roads, but I don’t think we did. We excluded the M25 and the A2 because that would be seriously breaking the law to stop on a carriageway. “We took great care to produce signage that could be removed without a trace. We haven’t spray painted anything. We haven’t done anything criminally damaging. We have made a simple point with a non-invasive sticker. If the police want to take that up with us we can discuss that.” Kent Police said they had been “made aware of criminal damage to road signs in the county” and was making inquiries. The force also apologised to road users on Friday:
Sources said traffic was heavier than normal because of the number of trucks returning to the continent. They had been delivering stockpiles to British customers before custom declarations apply from 1 January.
The queues offer a glimpse of what could transpire in January when checks on both the UK and French sides are introduced, whether or not there is a trade deal. France will introduce a suite of controls, including tests for regulatory compliance and food safety, and immigration and customs checks, while the UK has decided to phase in measures over six months to mitigate against estimated queues of up to 7,000 trucks in Kent.
The prospect of long Brexit queues in Dover is also concerning hauliers of goods between Ireland and the continent, who fearthey could be caught in the Brexit queues. On Friday the Danish shipping company DFDS announced it would launch a daily service from a port in Wexford in Ireland to Dunkirk in France to get around the Brexit chaos."
2020-11-27T15:39:32Z,politics,Politics,Labour MPs and members ordered not to discuss Corbyn's suspension,"Labour’s general secretary has barred MPs and party members from discussing Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension, voicing solidarity with him or criticising the equalities watchdog report on antisemitism in the party, claiming it could make local meetings unwelcoming for Jewish members. The move by David Evans, which has been criticised by Momentum as an attempt to stifle debate, will mean any local party that seeks to discuss Keir Starmer’s decision to remove the whip from Corbyn will be ruled out of order. Corbyn was suspended from the party after saying the scale of the problem investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. He has since issued a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to “tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it”, and he has been readmitted to the party with a warning. However, Starmer has suspended the Labour whip for at least three months, requiring Corbyn to make a formal apology. Research by the grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum found that 36 of the more than 600 constituency Labour parties (CLPs), including the first to nominate Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership, have passed motions in support of the former Labour leader in the past week. A further 16 constituency Labour parties have had their motions in support of Corbyn ruled out of order, according to Momentum. The group described the guidance as “yet another disturbing attack on the rights of members to democratically discuss matters vital to the party”. It claimed in a Twitter thread: “The cynical misuse of rules designed to protect against discrimination in order to prevent discussion of what is a factional attack against Jeremy Corbyn is outrageous and trivialises the fight against racism. It is a grossly irresponsible move that purposefully confuses the fight against antisemitism with a fight against the left and risks tarring Labour members who disagree with the leadership as racists.” In his letter to CLP chairs and MPs, Evans wrote that motions questioning the EHRC’s finding were “not competent business for branches or CLPs” and said that also applied to “motions relating to ongoing disciplinary cases”. “I am aware that other motions (including expressions of solidarity, and matters relating to the internal processes of the PLP) are providing a flashpoint for the expression of views that undermine the Labour party’s ability to provide a safe and welcoming space for all members, in particular our Jewish members,” Evans wrote. “Therefore, all motions which touch on these issues will also be ruled out of order.” He added: “Please rest assured that when I took up post as general secretary I had no desire at all to hamper discussion by our local parties, but until we can improve our culture, such restrictions may be required to stay in place.” A internal memo about the new rule, sent by Labour’s head of internal governance, Fraser Welsh, to regional secretaries, said: “As we have previously advised we will not hesitate to take appropriate action – including against individual members – where our rules and guidance are not adhered to, or standards of behaviour fall below that which we expect.” According to a list compiled by Momentum, 20 CLPs have passed motions of solidarity with their former leader, 18 have passed motions calling on Labour to restore the whip, and four have passed motions to “defend CLPs’ right to political debate”. Some CLPs passed more than one motion. Among those who passed a statement drafted by a separate Labour left group, the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, was Richmond Park, the first CLP to nominate Starmer for the leadership. The circulated motion of solidarity said: “Jeremy is a lifelong campaigner against racism and antisemitism. We believe that unity, not division, is important for the party to make progress and effectively challenge racism, fascism, antisemitism and harassment in what ever form this may take.” A spokesperson for the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, which drafted the motions being passed by local parties, said the advice “suggests the leadership are ignoring the valid concerns of party members and doubling down in its attacks on political discussion. “This will only exacerbate the anger and frustration of members who would like to focus on fighting the Tories but are not prepared to see their former leader trashed and their rights to political discussion curtailed.”"
2020-11-27T13:31:52Z,politics,Politics,Barnier urged not to be intimidated as Brexit talks enter 'final few days',"The French government has urged Michel Barnier not to be intimidated in the Brexit standoff with Downing Street, as his British counterpart hinted at pressure on him to end the talks. During a briefing on Friday, the EU’s chief negotiator advised ambassadors that he would resume the negotiations in London, despite his threat to pull out earlier in the week. “But he was clear that things are entirely stuck,” said an EU source. Barnier’s travel plans appeared to be “driven more by a wish at the highest levels of the European commission to negotiate until the bitter end than actual progress on the ground”, the source added. In turn, David Frost, who is leading the UK’s negotiating team, offered his own downbeat assessment in a statement on social media, as both sides sought to extract a final deal-making concession. “Some people are asking me why we are still talking,” Frost tweeted. “My answer is that it’s my job to do my utmost to see if the conditions for a deal exist. It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it’s clear that it isn’t.” Boris Johnson later claimed in a television interview that the “likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU”. With the two sides engaged in what amounts to a prolonged blinking match, Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister and a close ally of the president, Emmanuel Macron, said the EU must stay resolute in the face of British brinkmanship. “We can’t yet say that we have an agreement, and I don’t know if we will have one,” he said. “I think it is possible and obviously preferable for us, and even more so for the UK. “We must not be intimidated. Of course, this negotiation is difficult. The British need a deal more than we do. The Europeans must be convinced of this, and convinced of their strength in this negotiation. This is the best way to defend our interests and our priorities.” Barnier had told Frost on Tuesday via video conference that he could not see any point in coming to London unless the UK moved towards the EU’s positions. Despite a lack of substantive progress since, he still opted to avoid a major crisis in the negotiations by confirming he would travel to London on Friday evening to reopen the face-to-face talks. Barnier has been in quarantine since last Thursday after one of his team tested positive for coronavirus. Beaune said the negotiations were in the last “few days” and the European commission should not weaken in the face of Johnson’s calls for compromise. He said: “Let us not forget that we are a market eight times the size of the UK market. It is not a question of lack of respect or aggressiveness or arrogance on the part of Europeans, but we always tend to do the opposite. That is to say, to believe that we are weak, that we must make gestures and find compromises or accommodation.” During his briefing, Barnier echoed the warning made by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, earlier in the week, saying he could not be confident that Downing Street would compromise sufficiently for a deal to be possible. A senior EU diplomat said: “Without London taking the necessary decisions quickly, reaching a deal will be all but impossible. Time is running out quickly. There are only a few days left for further negotiations.” The negotiation remains stuck on the level of access that will be granted to European fishing fleets in UK waters and the means by which either side will be able to hit back if the other seeks to gain a competitive advantage by diverging on environmental, labour or social standards. The scale of the difference between the two sides on fisheries was laid bare after Barnier told MEPs on Friday that the UK was seeking to repatriate 80% of the EU’s current catch in British seas. As previously reported by the Guardian, the EU has so far only offered to return between 15% to 18%, an offer described by British negotiators as “derisory”. The transition period, during which the UK has remained in the single market and customs union, will end in 35 days. It is understood that during a meeting of MEPs on Thursday it was agreed that it would be very difficult for the European parliament to scrutinise and give its consent for a deal unless it was reached by next Wednesday. An extraordinary sitting of the parliament has been pencilled in for 28 December."
2020-11-27T13:08:53Z,politics,Politics,SNP conference set to be dominated by race and referendum strategy,"Despite its pared-down online format, this weekend’s Scottish National party conference will see two areas of significant tension between the leadership and ordinary members, amid anger at the quashing of debate on independence referendum strategy and frustration at the lack of black and minority ethnic candidates for next May’s Holyrood elections. While the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, refused to rule out a second referendum next year in pre-conference interviews, this is unlikely to satisfy those within the SNP and the wider independence movement pushing for development of a plan B for holding a referendum if the UK government continues to deny Holyrood the powers to hold one legally. But senior party sources believe that Sturgeon’s popularity with voters and the bounce in support for independence this year gives them increasing latitude to disappoint these activists, arguing that a second referendum is not a priority for conference. A senior SNP source said the party leadership believed combating Covid, dealing with Brexit and the combined economic impacts of both those crises had to be prioritised; they had to tread water on the second referendum for now. Recent polling indicates that most voters do not want one in 2021, even if the SNP wins a majority at next spring’s Scottish parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, senior minority ethnic members are planning an emergency intervention after a concerted drive to encourage more candidates of colour to stand for Holyrood resulted in only one new minority ethnic constituency candidate, which the SNP’s only BAME MSP and the justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, has described as “beyond disappointing”. They will demand that the party agrees to “zip” regional lists – the second way that candidates can win Holyrood seats – to prioritise candidates of colour. Zipping has been used in the past to alternate men and women on candidate lists. Of 22 prospective minority ethnic candidates, only Kaukab Stewart was selected for Glasgow Kelvin, joining Yousaf as two out of 73 constituency candidates. Stewart, who has pressed for representation within the party for more than two decades, agreed it was disappointing not to have seen more of a breakthrough, but insisted that progress has been made. Anum Qaisar-Javed, a teacher who stood for selection in Uddingston and Bellshill, received online abuse during selection, that prompted an intervention from Sturgeon. She warned: “If people who were standing felt they were penalised on race there has to be an open dialogue with the party leadership afterwards. It’s not enough to say ‘we’re not racist’, we have to be actively anti-racist.” Privately, multiple sources with knowledge of the selection process have expressed frustration at what they described as “window dressing”, “tokenism” and a failure to address structural racism within the SNP, with reports of prospective candidates encountering regular micro-aggressions in person and blatant abuse online. Describing her experience as “largely positive”, Fatima Zahra Joji, who stood for Aberdeenshire West, was targeted by online trolls who claimed she had only passed vetting because she was from a minority ethnic community. Joji said: “It took years of work and planning to get BAME candidates to stand in record numbers, then we were accused by a small but vocal minority of being parachuted in.” Osama Bhutta, who stood for the Cunninghame North nomination, formally complained to the party after a leaflet, titled “the Sins of Osama”, which he described as “defamatory, racist and Islamophobic”, was circulated anonymously. Bhutta said: “Racism doesn’t just appear through people making Nazi salutes. It has always created ‘others’ and found ways to present them as a threat to our way of life. Moreover, I’m also worried what it will mean for other minorities later if the party doesn’t take action against this racist and underhand behaviour.” An SNP spokesperson said: “More people from BAME backgrounds entered contests than ever before. And now there is a great opportunity for the first woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish parliament. This clearly represents progress, but we accept there is more work to be done”. Meanwhile, wider calls to democratise party structures are coalescing around moves by the party’s Common Weal group to elect a slate of candidates on to the party’s NEC who want to give ordinary members a greater say in policy and decision-making. Members are reported to be angry that popular motions on independence strategy, currency options and committing to UN-led nuclear disarmament have been excluded from discussion this weekend. MP Joanna Cherry, one of the Common Weal-backed candidates, described it as “bizarre” that conference organisers refused an amendment based on her suggestion that the party set up a working group to consider all democratic and legitimate routes to a second independence vote. “We need proper planning for a second referendum now: I want us to get our governance in order, decide on policy positions and have the answers to those questions that lost us the first referendum.” But the senior SNP source insisted: “It’s a timing thing really. In my experience, over the last few months the yes movement has come back together and is prepared to let us roll out the strategy that we’ve got, the section 30 route; there’s much less push-back than there was six months ago.” In early November Ipsos Mori found Scottish voters believed the economy, health and Brexit were more important issues than independence, while a narrow majority of voters did not want a referendum next year, even if the SNP won a majority of seats. Due to her assured approach to Covid, Ipsos Mori put Sturgeon’s popularity rating at +49 in October, with 93% of SNP voters satisfied with her leadership. A discussion of referendum strategy is now expected to be thrown forward to a national assembly in January. Chris McEleny, who has faced strong opposition from the party hierarchy as he pushed for discussion of a plan B, should a section 30 order be repeatedly refused, said: “We understand that it is difficult for Nicola Sturgeon to say she is focused on Covid then speak about independence, and that the party doesn’t want to put off the broad coalition of support it needs to win next May, but we are not delivering for the ten of thousands of new members who joined after 2014.”"
2020-11-27T12:19:13Z,politics,Politics,Huge wealth of Rishi Sunak's family not declared in ministerial register,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing questions over the transparency of his financial affairs after a Guardian investigation established that his wife and her family hold a multimillion-pound portfolio of shareholdings and directorships that are not declared in the official register of ministers’ interests. Akshata Murty, who married Sunak in 2009, is the daughter of one of India’s most successful entrepreneurs. Her father co-founded the technology giant Infosys, and her shares in the company are worth £430m, making her one of the wealthiest women in Britain, with a fortune larger than the Queen’s. Sunak is bound by the ministerial code, which requires him to declare any financial interests that are “relevant” to his responsibilities, and which could conflict with his duty to the public. Ministers must also declare those interests of their close family, including siblings, parents, spouse and in-laws, which might give rise to a conflict. But Sunak’s entry mentions no family members other than his wife, and only refers to her ownership of a small, UK-based venture capital company. Research by the Guardian shows that Murty and her family hold many other interests, including: • A combined £1.7bn shareholding in Infosys, which employs thousands of staff in the UK and has held contracts with government ministries and public bodies. • A £900m-a-year joint venture with Amazon in India, through an investment vehicle owned by Murty’s father. • A direct shareholding by Murty in a UK firm which runs Jamie Oliver and Wendy’s burger restaurants in India. • Five other UK companies where Murty is a director or direct shareholder, including a Mayfair outfitter that supplies the tailcoats worn by pupils at Eton College. Sir Alistair Graham, a former chair of the committee on standards in public life, which acts as a watchdog for UK public office holders, said it was vital that Sunak declare the financial interests of himself and his close family given “the chancellor’s capacity to determine the government’s financial and business policies”. “He seems to have taken the most minimalist approach possible to this requirement. Perhaps Rishi Sunak should carefully read the ‘Seven principles of Public Life’ to make sure he is fulfilling the two principles of ‘Honesty and Leadership’.”
Sunak and Murty have not responded directly to requests for comment. The Treasury said all the proper procedures for declaring interests had been followed, and that decisions about what to declare were not taken by ministers themselves but by civil servants and independent advisers. A Treasury spokesperson said the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests “confirmed he is completely satisfied with the chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests”. Ministers are held to a higher level of disclosure than MPs. The code of conduct states they must provide a “full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict”. This list “should also cover interests of the minister’s spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to a conflict”. Advisers then decide what to put on the official list of ministers’ interests. Sunak and family’s financial interests After becoming chief secretary to the Treasury in July 2019, Sunak revealed for the first time that he was the beneficiary of a blind trust. He also included Murty for the first time, stating: “Mr Sunak’s wife owns a venture capital investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd.” There is no information about his own family or his wife’s parents and siblings. Catamaran represents just a small part of the interests held by the chancellor’s wife. The source of her extraordinary wealth is a stake in Infosys, founded by her father NR Narayana Murthy (his children have dropped the “h” from their surname). According to the Infosys annual report, Akshata Murty owns a 0.91% stake in the group; that stake is currently worth £430m. Each year, her shares entitle her to millions in dividends. Of all the family, only her brother, Rohan Murty, owns more of the company. The combined family holding is worth an estimated £1.7bn.
Murty’s holding is not secret, and it is not clear why it was not declared in the register. The interest could be seen to present a conflict, because Infosys is a contractor to the UK government and publicly funded organisations. Since 2015, the firm has won taxpayer-funded work worth £22m, according to filings on the government’s contracts website. These include a £5m deal with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, awarded in 2018, which runs until 2021. Infosys has also worked for the Home Office and has signed a framework agreement with Whitehall, which means it can be awarded contracts without competition. The company employs an estimated 10,000 staff in the UK, some of whom benefited from Sunak’s furlough scheme.
The Murty family has invested part of the wealth created by Infosys through Catamaran Ventures, which takes stakes in growth businesses. It is understood Murty has no financial or legal interest in the Indian arm of Catamaran. However, the fund benefits other family members, including her father. One of its most successful deals is a partnership with the online retailer Amazon. Together they own Cloudtail, one of the largest sellers on Amazon’s Indian marketplace, with revenues of over £900m last year. The investment could be seen as a conflict of interest, given that the chancellor is responsible for decisions about how to tax large digital corporations, such as Amazon, in the UK. Murty set up Catamaran’s UK arm with Sunak in order to invest her private wealth. He transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament and she is now the sole owner. Through it, she has invested in a clutch of start-up businesses. What Sunak has not declared is that his wife also holds direct shareholdings – in her own name, rather than through Catamaran – in at least six UK companies. She is an investor and director at the gentlemen’s outfitters New & Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats, and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murty also holds shares in a UK business which operates Jamie’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and gyms operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both Digme and New & Lingwood have furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm.
Before entering the Treasury, Sunak met the government’s then head of propriety and ethics, Helen MacNamara, to decide what needed to be declared, a government source said. MacNamara reviewed the interests of Sunak and Murty and confirmed at the time, and again recently, that she was satisfied with what had been registered. Sir Alex Allan, the former independent adviser on minister’s interests, also approved the disclosures, according to the source. Allan resigned from his post last week following a dispute over the publication of a report into allegations of bullying by the home secretary, Priti Patel."
2020-11-27T06:00:18Z,politics,Politics,First-year EU students face £800 Brexit bill if not in UK before 2021,"First-year EU students who enrolled in UK universities this autumn but have been unable to move to the country due to the pandemic face an £800 Brexit bill shock if they don’t set foot on British soil before 31 December, campaigners have warned. The Home Office said they will not qualify for EU pre-settled status if they arrive after the end of the transition period, even though they have been unable to relocate because of Covid. It potentially means tens of thousands of students will have to pay £348 in application fees for a visa with £470 a year in health charges, both new post-Brexit costs. Mantas Gudelis, 19, who started a biochemistry degree at the University of Edinburgh in September but is studying at home in Vilnius, Lithuania, said: “The university have told us quite a few times about this. It is sad for me because it is quite a financial hit. The health surcharge over four years is £2,000 and for my family that is a lot of money, especially as one of my parents was laid off because of the pandemic. The system should allow us to come because this is not our fault.” Luke Piper, a lawyer and head of policy at campaign group the3million, has raised concerns with the Home Office that many students face these costs and could miss out on benefits that come with pre-settled and settled status, such as long-term residency, employment and social benefits rights. “It’s a really big issue. A lot of students have paid fees and have started their studies abroad so are actively studying at British universities. But when we spoke to the government they say they need to create a clear deadline to end freedom of movement on 31 December,” he said. “They are students who have not been able to come to the UK through no fault of their own. We should be able to make an exception for this cohort. They could easily adapt the EU settlement scheme, otherwise these students will have to pay extortionate fees to the Home Office and potentially miss out on other opportunities.” Arguably students enrolling at British universities this year have done so under free movement laws, which allowed them to get home fees, so “it doesn’t seem right that they can’t come and study here using those same rights”, Piper added. An estimated 150,000 students come to the UK from other countries in the EU and the European Economic Area, according to Universities UK (UUK), which is helping educational institutes advise their students. “All universities are working closely with the Home Office to ensure that currently enrolled EU students are aware of UK requirements for obtaining pre-settled status, and UUK has issued guidance to universities on the latest immigration rule changes,” said a spokesperson. One issue for EU students who have not started their education in the UK before the end of the transition period is that they cannot evidence their residency with rent receipts, utility bills or bank accounts. Gudelis and the3million are pressing to know whether EU students would establish their right to pre-settled status if they came to the UK for just a few days before 31 December.
According to Home Office rules published on the government website, students only need to provide one document dated in the last six months in order to be granted pre-settled status, including a “passport stamp confirming entry at the UK border” or “a used travel ticket confirming you entered the UK from another country”. In a section entitled “evidence that covers shorter periods of time”, the Home Office states: “these documents count as evidence for one month if they have a single date on” suggesting a short trip to the UK up to and including New Year’s Eve is enough to evince free movement rights. The Home Office confirmed this was the case saying that to apply for pre-settled status, “individuals only need to be here for a day before the deadline on 31 December. If an individual has arrived in the UK on 31 December they will still be eligible to apply for pre-settled status”. It gave no indication it would be addressing the exceptional circumstances affecting EU students who arrived after 31 December but had enrolled for classes in 2020. “We have been clear that students, like all other EEA and Swiss citizens, must be resident in the UK by 31 December 2020 to have rights under the Citizens’ Rights Agreements,” said a spokesperson."
2020-11-27T06:00:18Z,politics,Politics,Black public figures urge airlines not to carry out Home Office deportation,"Eighty-two black public figures have written to airlines who have worked on deportation charter flights urging them not to carry up to 50 Jamaicans the Home Office wants to deport next week. Signatories include the author Bernardine Evaristo, model Naomi Campbell, historian David Olusoga and actors Naomie Harris and Thandie Newton, as well as lawyers, broadcasters and NGO chiefs. Leading Windrush campaigners including Michael Braithwaite and Elwaldo Romeo have also signed. The letter has been sent to six airlines known to have previously worked with the Home Office on deportation charter flights.
It urges the airline chiefs to refuse to operate the flight on 2 December, the second Jamaica deportation flight this year, if they have been approached by the Home Office to do so, and to pause the operation of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries for the foreseeable future. They are calling on airlines that have previously operated these flights for the Home Office to state publicly that they will not operate next week’s flight. It is not known which airline the Home Office has engaged for it. Any airline that has agreed to transport the Jamaicans earmarked for deportation is urged to reconsider its position and to communicate this to government and the wider public. The public figures warned that if next week’s and other similar flights go ahead there is a risk of the unlawful removal of people who have the right to remain in the UK. One of the men deported from the UK to Jamaica on a charter flight in February 2020 was the grandson of a woman who arrived on the Empire Windrush and is still seeking to have his deportation order revoked. They added that the recent resignation of Alexandra Ankrah, the most senior black civil servant working on the Windrush compensation scheme, calls into question the Home Office’s competency to deal with the continuing injustices it has created. Concern is also expressed by the signatories about the fate of victims of trafficking. “The UK’s system for identifying victims of trafficking is in disarray, meaning that the government frequently seeks to deport people whose offences occurred by reason of their trafficking or forced labour,” the letter stated. It warned that some of those already detained and due to be deported on 2 December have physical scars and further evidence of being subjected to ill-treatment, or have had siblings killed in Jamaica, which puts them at grave risk if removed from the UK. “In an already challenging festive period … we ask you to reflect on whether the operation of this flight would comply with your corporate social responsibility values,” it stated. There is precedent for airlines ceasing to cooperate with the Home Office. In June 2018 Virgin Airlines announced that it would no longer be assisting the Home Office to deport people in the wake of the Windrush scandal. “We made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office. We believe this decision is in the best interest of our customers and people, and is in keeping with our values as a company,” the airline said in a statement at the time. The Home Office said: “We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals to keep the public safe. Each week we remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries who have no right to be here, this flight is no different. The people being detained for this flight include convicted murderers and rapists. “The UK only ever returns those who the Home Office and, where applicable, the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain in the UK.”"
2020-11-26T19:32:01Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn to start legal action over suspension of Labour whip,"Jeremy Corbyn is to start a formal legal claim against the Labour party for suspending the whip, in a case which allies of the former Labour leader say is intended to prove there was a deal with Keir Starmer’s office to readmit him to the party. The Guardian has seen evidence of exchanges between key members of Starmer’s office and Corbyn’s representatives, suggesting there were private meetings in the run-up to the party’s decision to lift his suspension from the party. Starmer subsequently ordered the Labour whip be withheld from Corbyn until he apologises and deletes comments made following the equalities watchdog investigation into antisemitism in the party. Corbyn’s lawyers lodged a pre-action disclosure application to the high court on Thursday night. “All of this will be in the public domain soon,” one source involved in the discussions said. A Labour source said: “Any accusation that there was a deal or an attempt to determine the outcome of any disciplinary process is wrong.” Corbyn has not directly apologised for the claim that the scale of the problem investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media but has since issued a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to “tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it”. It is understood Corbyn’s legal team are attempting to put in the public domain evidence of what the former Labour leader will claim was a deal thrashed out by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and special advisor Simon Fletcher, with Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, and the former shadow cabinet minister Jon Trickett, acting on behalf of Corbyn. His advisers say they have evidence of two key meetings, one in person and one on Zoom, where the choreography of Corbyn’s disciplinary process was allegedly discussed. The legal team is also expected to claim that Starmer, McSweeney and Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, met McCluskey and Trickett in the leader of the opposition’s office boardroom in parliament the day after the EHRC report and Corbyn’s suspension. Labour sources do not deny the meeting took place, but say it was at the request of McCluskey and that Starmer had said publicly he wanted Corbyn to issue an apology. Starmer is understood to have told his office he did not want to be involved in any decisions around the convening of the disciplinary panel. Corbyn’s allies will claim that his clarifying statement was then agreed over the course of the next 24 hours in Zoom calls and WhatsApp messages between McCluskey, Trickett, McSweeney and Fletcher. The claim, fiercely denied by Labour sources, is that it was agreed the early publication of the statement would lead to a swift disciplinary panel of the party’s governing body, the national executive committee, who would be recommended to administer only the most minor sanction. The legal action is also expected to allege that another meeting took place on Zoom between Corbyn’s advisers and Starmer’s chief of staff, where it is alleged the final sanction was discussed and agreed. This has also been denied by Labour. The release of the statement, which came on the morning of the panel deliberation, prompted anger from Starmer, as well as Jewish Labour members and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, because of the lack of a formal apology. The final NEC panel decision was in fact to issue Corbyn with a more stringent sanction, a formal warning, but it is understood the panel received legal advice that the suspension from the party would be challengeable in court. Corbyn has been told the whip will be suspended for three months while an investigation is carried out, and has been told by the chief whip, Nick Brown, to “unequivocally, unambiguously and without reservation” apologise for his claims made in the aftermath of the EHRC report."
2020-11-26T19:15:30Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson emerges from Covid isolation to sap the UK's confidence | John Crace,"Some people get all the crap jobs. Even though Boris Johnson was out of isolation and in the chamber, it was left to Matt Hancock to make the statement on which coronavirus tier every English region would be dumped into once the national lockdown ended next Wednesday. And knowing that only Cornwall, the Scilly Isles and the Isle of Wight – about 1% of the population – had managed to remain in the lowest tier, the health secretary knew he was in for a rough time from many of his own grumpy MPs. The majority of the country, 57%, was to be in tier two, and 42%, predominantly in the north and midlands, would be in tier 3. Hancock began on autopilot, repeating many of the familiar tropes he has used in previous statements about thanking the country for the sacrifices it had made and asking for another push to help see the NHS through January and February. At which point his logic began to fall apart. Because if you’re trying to reduce infections during the winter months, why on earth would you grant a five-day amnesty over Christmas? It was like turning the festive period into a Killing Zone. That though, was pretty much the intellectual highpoint of his speech. Because within seconds he was presenting the revamped tiered system as a triumph of both the previous tiers and the four-week national lockdown. There was a clear model on which the new tiers had been decided, Door Matt insisted. But not so clear as to explain why some parts of London – which was to be in tier 2 – had higher infection rates than other towns and cities which had been put in tier 3. Nor what some areas, such as Kent, south Gloucestershire and north Somerset had been doing in the past few weeks to push them straight from the former lax tier 1 straight into the highest level. The thing is that, deep down, Hancock has no idea if the new tiers will work or not or whether a third national lockdown will be necessary. But he does know that if the shit hits the fan, it will be his fan it hits. The only time he looked remotely chipper was when he was able to inform the house that Liverpool had been downgraded to tier 2 while Greater Manchester would remain in tier 3. That would teach Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, not to get stroppy over £5m and to be as compliant as Liverpool in future. Still, the tiering system would be reviewed in two weeks’ time – and weekly thereafter – so there would be plenty of time for arguments later. Or now, even. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, asked for more details of what each region would need to do to move down a tier and what financial assistance would be available for those businesses most affected by being in tier 3. But – apart from a brief love-in between Boris and Jeremy Hunt who is desperate to get back into the cabinet, a prospect that Door Matt experiences, probably correctly, as an existential threat – that was nothing compared to some of the complaints from his own backbenches. Many MPs from rural constituencies in the south – and a few in the north – were incredulous they had been downgraded to tier 2, while MPs from the more upmarket parts of Kent were incandescent that they had been bundled up with the more deprived areas of the county. Their constituents didn’t spend a fortune to live in the Lorry Park of England only to be contaminated by people living in the Thames estuary. How come Kent couldn’t be treated as various districts rather than a single region? After all, Slough had managed to be treated as a lone tier 3 outlier in Berkshire. There again, Windsor was awfully close to Slough, and it wouldn’t do for Her Maj to be confined to a tier 3 area. Come the end, Hancock had received such a kicking, it looked as if there would be tiers before bedtime. Boris did make an appearance at a Downing Street press conference in the afternoon, which was basically a more shambolic – at one point Johnson appeared to lose his place and nearly dropped his papers – version of Hancock’s statement. Only without cohorts of MPs to complain about which tier their constituency would be put in. Johnson rambled on about how it was important to “keep our foot on the throat of the beast” – most people would reckon the virus has had its foot on our throats for most of the last eight months – and had no idea how he was going to roll out the mass-testing system that would enable regions to come down from tier three to tier two. It would help if Boris thought before speaking sometimes. Every time he talks, a little more confidence that the virus can be beaten ebbs away. We need a leader not a harlequin. Luckily, the prime minister was flanked by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance to give the briefing a little more credibility. Both made clear that though they hoped the new tiering system would be effective, it was still very much a work in progress. They also hinted that if it had been left to them, there would have been no Christmas amnesty and that hugging elderly relatives could be handing out a death sentence. Boris nodded earnestly, apparently unaware that the Christmas freedom pass had been his decision. Then, as Hancock would happily tell you, personal responsibility has never been one of Johnson’s strong points. • Join John Crace and Guardian columnist Marina Hyde as they look back at a political year like no other.

2020-11-26T18:40:32Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Whitty says people should not hug elderly relatives as PM warns against easing up on virus fight – as it happened,"Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has bluntly told people not to hug and kiss elderly relatives at Christmas. Only 48 hour after the government announced a temporary relaxation of rules intended to allow families to mix at Christmas, Whitty highlighted the risks, saying people should not hug elderly relatives â€œif you want them to survive to be hugged againâ€�. Speaking at a No 10 press conference, he said: Would I want someone to see their family? Of course, thatâ€™s what Christmas is about, whether people celebrate Christmas as a festival themselves or from any other belief system. It is an opportunity for families. But would I encourage someone to hug and kiss their elderly relatives? No, I would not. It is not against the law - and thatâ€™s the whole point. You can do it in the rules that are there but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus and if youâ€™ve got an elderly relative, that would not be the thing you want to do in the period where weâ€™re running up to a point where we might be able to protect older people. Boris Johnson has said that mass testing could allow individuals to escape particular restrictions - even if they are living in a tier 3 area. In his latest upbeat statement about the possibilities offered by mass testing (once described by No 10 as the Moonshot plan), Johnson told the press conference. If [mass testing] works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions even if their home area stays in tier 3. Johnson has defended the governmentâ€™s decision to place large parts of England under tougher restrictions once the lockdown ends than they were under when it started, saying â€œtaking our foot off the throat of the beastâ€� now would be a mistake. He told the press conference. What we want to avoid is relaxing now too much, taking our foot off the throat of the beast now, when weâ€™ve got [the virus] in a much, much better place than it was before the rules and measures. Johnson is facing a backlash from Tory MPs ahead of next weekâ€™s Commons vote on the new post-lockdown restrictions announced for England today. Some of his MPs have already said they will vote against the government, but many more have expressed anger or disappointment about finding their constituencies unexpectedly in tier 3 or tier 2. Some are demanding the publication of better evidence from the government to justify the restrictions before deciding how they will vote. At his press conference Johnson said the allocation of tiers would be reviewed every fortnight. But in the Commons, in an attempt to mollify his Tory critics, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that, after the first review on 16 December, the system would be reviewed at least weekly. He told one MP: We will review the tiers in a fortnight and then regularly, which he can reasonably take to be weekly. And Hancock told another MP he was committing to regular reviews, rather than weekly ones, â€œsimply because we sometimes have to do it more than weekly, especially if cases are shooting up in an area.â€� Coronavirus infections are largely levelling off in England although prevalence remains high, the latest data suggests. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine is coming under increasing scrutiny, with critics questioning the claim that trials showed it could protect up to 90% of people against coronavirus. The pub companies Mitchells & Butlers and Fuller, Smith & Turner have reported heavy losses and said they had axed about 1,700 jobs, highlighting the impact of continued coronavirus restrictions on Britainâ€™s hospitality sector. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has decided legislation is required to cut the aid budget since the current fiscal uncertainty means the government may feel obliged to miss the commitment to spend 0.7% on gross national income on overseas aid for longer than a year. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-26T15:10:27Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson appoints Dan Rosenfield as No 10 chief of staff,"Boris Johnson has appointed Dan Rosenfield, a relatively little-known former Treasury official and banker, to become his chief of staff, a key part of a reorganisation process following the departure of Dominic Cummings. Rosenfield currently works for Hakluyt, an upmarket corporate advisory firm that has a number of former intelligence members among its staff. He will take over from Edward Lister, Johnson’s longtime aide and interim chief of staff, on 1 January. Rosenfield, who is Hakluyt’s global head of corporate clients and runs the UK side of the business, formerly held a senior role at Bank of America. He spent more than 10 years as an official at the Treasury, acting as principal private secretary to Alistair Darling and George Osborne when they were chancellors, from 2007 to 2011. He chairs World Jewish Relief, a British Jewish community humanitarian agency. Last week, it joined more than 180 other charities to call on Johnson to rethink his plans to reduce the proportion of GDP the UK spends on overseas aid. The appointment of a relative outsider will wrongfoot those who had been pushing for the role to either go to a Conservative MP or to a well-established political insider. Rosenfield is not well-known in Conservative circles, or even to have shown any particular affiliation to the party. He has spoken warmly of his time working with Osborne, and some speculate the former chancellor could have suggested Rosenfield for the role. One former colleague from Rosenfield’s days as a Whitehall civil servant described him as “popular and smart, very good to work with, friendly and sociable”, adding: “It’s a definite change of type for No 10.” Another said he was “very, very straight talking”. The appointment follows the departure a fortnight ago of Cummings, Johnson’s controversial chief aide, and of Lee Cain, the Downing Street head of communications, amid bitter infighting within No 10. Johnson had offered the chief of staff job to Cain, but this was resisted by some within Downing Street, among them Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. The role had not officially existed before, although Cummings in effect acted as this. A number of Conservative MPs had urged Johnson to use the departures as an opportunity to revamp what many complained was a dysfunctional No 10 operation, seen as out of touch with backbenchers and lurching from crisis to crisis. While Lister took over as chief of staff on a temporary basis, a number of people were tipped to get the job permanently, including the MPs Alex Burghart and Oliver Dowden, and longtime Conservative insiders such as Isaac Levido, a a protege of the political adviser Lynton Crosby, who was involved in the Tories’ 2019 election victory, or the special adviser Henry Newman. The Downing Street announcement said Lister, who is now a peer and was a key Johnson aide when the PM was London mayor, would from January “continue to provide support to both the prime minister and the new chief of staff”."
2020-11-25T22:38:45Z,politics,Politics,Spending review 2020: the winners and losers in Sunak's statement,"Denis Campbell, health policy editor, and Robert Booth, social affairs correspondent The NHS in England has been given £3bn extra next year to tackle the huge backlog of operations cancelled because of Covid and the spike in mental illness caused by the pandemic. Hospitals will spend around £1bn of the money trying to reduce the number of people who are waiting for non-urgent surgery, such as a hip or knee replacement or cataract removal, and the long delays that are becoming increasingly common. The number of people forced to wait at least a year for elective care has rocketed from 1,500 in February to almost 140,000 in September. “Our world-class NHS has played a critical role in the response to coronavirus but we know how desperately difficult and distressing it has been for patients that are waiting to have operations and medical treatment during the pandemic,” said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. The £3bn is much less than the £10bn a year more that the British Medical Association and Health Foundation thinktank have said the service needed to cope with the rising demand for care. The £1bn will fund the NHS to carry out up to one million more checks, scans and operations on people who could not get treatment in the spring when many non-Covid services were suspended. Around £500m of the £3bn will go into expanding mental health care for people who could not access help when the pandemic struck. That money will be used to tackle both the backlog of adults referred for mental health care and to create new specialist services for under-18s. It should also help ensure faster access to “talking therapy” for people with anxiety and depression. The £3bn will boost the Department of Health and Social Care’s budget by £6.6bn and mean that the NHS’s revenue budget in England in 2021/22 will be £136.1bn. Cancer Research UK welcomed the £1bn to reduce waits for care and the £325m that has been earmarked for expanding diagnostic testing, including the replacement of old scanners, to detect cancer and other diseases. Some of the money will also go into expanding the NHS’s workforce and improving training. However, health experts said the £3bn was inadequate. “This additional funding comes as the NHS faces the most difficult time in its history. Although welcome, it is not clear that this will be adequate to meet the enormous challenge ahead,” said Prof John Appleby, the Nuffield Trust thinktank’s director of research and chief economist. Sunak also came under fire for increasing spending on the crumbling social care system by just £300m. Care home providers said he had left a “black hole” in social care budgets with announcements of what he said was £2bn in additional funding. MPs, peers and the care sector have argued that even before the Covid crisis the government needed to increase spending on adult social care by £7bn to £8bn per year. Councils have estimated that Covid has added a further £6.6bn in costs in just six months with costs soaring and occupancy falling. More than 18,000 people died from the virus in care homes. Sunak’s offer falls well short of filling the void, the care industry said. Sunak announced £300m in new central government grants plus powers for councils to levy a 3% council tax precept to fund social care. Sunak said that adds up to £1bn in new money, but the Kings Fund thinktank said the precept does not guarantee money is raised where needed. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, said the deal was “a catastrophe for social care” and said the funding was “completely and wholly inadequate – it can only lead to reductions in the provision of care”. Jeanelle de Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said the absence of a budget increase for public health was “completely incomprehensible”. Sally Weale, education correspondent Headteachers responded with fury to the chancellor’s spending review, describing it as “a slap in the face” and “a body blow” for school leaders and their teams, who have worked tirelessly to keep schools open during the pandemic. They were angry that the chancellor failed to provide any additional money to help schools with mounting Covid costs that are decimating budgets, and warned that a pay freeze would negate efforts to keep teachers in the profession after a decade of pay austerity. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said public sector workers, who had been on the frontline of the pandemic response, should not be forced to pay for the recovery out of their own pockets. “Keeping schools open is leaving school leaders frayed and exhausted. Today they and other public sector workers were looking for relief from the government. “But the chancellor has not provided a single additional penny to cope with the costs of Covid. Salaries are being suppressed, Covid costs are being left unmet and the needs of the most vulnerable students are being ignored.” School leaders would be “justifiably furious”, he said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The government asks more and more of teachers and leaders, and then effectively cuts their pay. It should not be surprised if staff decide to leave the profession.” He welcomed confirmation of additional investment in schools through to 2023, but said any uplift in funding was being wiped out by the cost of Covid safety measures and teacher supply cover which the government has not yet reimbursed. “Many schools will be significantly worse off as a result of these additional costs and it is likely that they will have to make further cuts.” Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added: “The chancellor said he wants stronger public services but has delivered a body blow to staff in our schools and colleges. Education workers are key workers who have kept the country going during the pandemic, but pay cuts are their only reward from this government.” Patrick Butler, social policy editor The £3bn spending review boost for English councils from April is unlikely to fully cover the rising costs of coronavirus and social care costs or prevent major cuts to services in the coming months, local authorities have warned. The chancellor said councils would receive a 4.5% increase in “spending power” next year – including £300m in social care grants, and £3bn to help councils meet Covid-related losses from business rates and council tax takings. Ratepayers in England will see council tax bills rise by up to 5% from April after ministers allowed councils to raise up to £1bn through a special 3% local precept ringfenced for adults and children’s social care. Cllr James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association, said while extra financial support was welcome councils would “still have to find savings to already stretched budgets in order to plug funding gaps and meet their legal duty to set a balanced budget next year”. Cllr David Williams, chairman of the County Councils Network and leader of Hertfordshire county council, said while the chancellor’s announcement would “ease the burden” on councils, many still faced “some difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce”. Care England, which represents social care providers, called the £1bn boost a “drop in the ocean” compared with the pressures on care budgets. “Of course £1bn is welcome, we welcome every penny but, in comparison with the NHS and the challenges that the sector faces, this figure is too little and too late,” said the chief executive, Martin Green. Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor Specialist Met police and MI5 officers will come together in a new Counter Terrorism Operations Centre to improve coordination between investigators tackling the violent threat from Islamism and the far right. The plan was quietly announced in the detail of Sunak’s spending review, although Whitehall sources said it had been a couple of years in development and was originally a response to the string of terror attacks in 2017. Specialist police and spies will gradually relocate from Scotland Yard and Thames House to a new London building, whose location is not yet disclosed, although it is expected to take five years before it is fully operational. Independent reviews have said that while the Met and MI5 generally work well together there remain areas of difficulty, including “non-integrated systems” as reported by Lord Anderson last year. Previously MI5 has acknowledged in evidence to parliament: “If we are honest at the moment we have a spirit of partnership and a sort [of] professional esprit de corps that is up here and we have IT connectivity that is kind of [down] here.” Prosecutors and other specialists are expected to join the centre, but the organisation will not have its own head – and while investigators will work side by side they will continue to report to their separate agencies. Britain’s intelligence agencies will also receive £173m more in 2021/22, which the Treasury said amounted to “a 5.4% average annual real-terms increase since 2019-20” – plus £1.3bn capital investment for the next three years. The extra cash is shared between MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, whose individual budgets are kept secret. As announced by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, last week, defence enjoyed one of the biggest cash increases of any Whitehall department. The £41.5bn defence budget will increase by £24bn over the next four years, including £6.6bn of R&D. Defence spending would grow by “1.8% per year” above inflation to the end of the parliament in 2024, ending years of real-terms cuts that began when David Cameron came to office in 2010."
2020-11-25T19:55:11Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak says Covid economic emergency has only just begun,"Rishi Sunak has warned Britain that its Covid-19 economic emergency has only just begun after responding to news of the deepest slump in more than 300 years by pledging a fresh £55bn to tackle the pandemic. On the day that the daily death toll from the virus reached a new second-wave peak of 696, the chancellor said that despite borrowing a peacetime record of £394bn this year, he would need to carry on spending in order to protect lives and livelihoods. Sunak said his one-year spending plan for the economy included the biggest sustained increase in infrastructure investment for four decades, and involved more money for housing, railways, broadband upgrades and Boris Johnson’s green agenda, totalling £100bn next year.
With unemployment on course to reach 2.6 million by the middle of next year, Sunak allocated £3bn to help the long-term jobless find work and announced a £4bn “levelling-up fund” for local projects ranging from new roads to libraries in areas of greatest need. “Our health emergency is not yet over. And our economic emergency has only just begun,” Sunak told MPs as he announced that forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility showed the UK economy on course to contract by more than 11% in 2020. The OBR said the extension to the furlough scheme until March had saved 300,000 jobs, but even with strong growth in the next two years, it would take until the end of 2022 to recover the economic ground lost during the Covid-19 crisis. The government’s economic forecasting body added that the permanent damage caused by the pandemic would be exacerbated by a 2% hit to growth were trade talks between the UK and the EU to end in failure.
The chancellor said the £280bn spent tackling the pandemic in the current financial year would be followed by a further £55bn of spending in 2021-22. The extra funds will include £18bn for testing, PPE equipment and vaccines; £3bn to help the NHS reduce its routine caseload backlog; and £2bn to subsidise the railways. Part of the £55bn will be clawed back by a cut in the UK’s aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, and by a public sector pay freeze that will exclude the NHS and those earning less than £24,000 a year. Sunak’s plans to provide an overall economic boost of £40bn do not include any wage subsidy support after the furlough scheme ends in March or an extension of the one-year £20 a week increase in universal credit announced at the start of the crisis. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: “It seems more likely than not that spending will end up significantly higher than set out today, and so borrowing in 2024-25 will be considerably more than the £100bn forecast by the OBR. Either that or we are in for a pretty austere few years once again, or for some significant tax rises.” Sunak said the government had a responsibility, once the economy recovered, to repair the damage to the public finances. The OBR said even the loosest definition of balancing the books would require tax increases or spending cuts of £27bn. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, accused the government of squandering public money “on an industrial scale” during the crisis and attacked the decision to “pause” pay increases for many public sector workers. “Key workers who willingly took on so much responsibility during this crisis, are now being forced to tighten their belts,” she said. “In contrast there’s been a bonanza for those who have won contracts from this government.” In a dig at Sunak’s polished public image, Dodds added, “the measure of this government won’t be the number of press releases it issued during this crisis or the number of pictures it published on Instagram. It will be the responsible action it took – or didn’t take – for the sake of our country.” Conservative MPs were broadly supportive of Sunak’s approach – but a series of senior backbenchers, including former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and former development secretary Andrew Mitchell, were fiercely critical of the decision to ditch the 0.7% aid promise. Hunt warned the chancellor: “To cut our aid by a third, in a year when millions more people will fall into extreme poverty, will make not just them poorer but us poorer in the eyes of the world, because people will worry that we are abandoning a noble ideal that we in this country have done more to champion than anyone else.” The decision prompted the resignation of Tory peer Liz Sugg from her role as sustainable development minister. Sugg said it was “fundamentally wrong”. Sunak said: “This country has always and will always be open and outward-looking, leading in solving the world’s toughest problems. “But during a domestic fiscal emergency, when we need to prioritise our limited resources on jobs and public services, sticking rigidly to spending 0.7% of our national income on overseas aid is difficult to justify to the British people especially when we’re seeing the highest peacetime levels of borrowing on record.” Labour attacked Sunak’s levelling-up fund as “pork barrel politics”, pointing to a recent report from the National Audit Office that suggested the allocation of the government’s £3.6bn towns fund may have been partly politically motivated.
Downing Street is keen to have tangible improvements to show voters in former Labour seats across the Midlands and north of England who backed the Tories a year ago – and in swing seats they hope to win in 2024. Footballer Marcus Rashford, who successfully campaigned for the government to extend food vouchers to the poorest families over the forthcoming Christmas holidays, questioned why Sunak had not announced an extension to the £20-a-week emergency uplift in universal credit that is due to end next April. The government has only said that it will review the “health and economic context” in the new year. “I’m really concerned that families are constantly counting down the days until help is taken away from them. The need for longterm change is massive. Children cannot be living to deadlines,” Rashford tweeted."
2020-11-25T19:11:52Z,politics,Politics,"Pay freeze for millions of UK workers ‘a kick in the teeth’, say unions","The chancellor vowed to protect low-paid workers on Wednesday as he pressed ahead with a wages freeze that will hit more than 2 million public sector workers. To the dismay of public sector unions, Rishi Sunak said he would “pause” pay rises for workers including firefighters, police, teachers and local authority staff as he outlined Whitehall spending next year. However, a million NHS doctors and nurses will receive an annual increase next year, and 2.1 million public sector workers who earn below the median average wage of £24,000 will receive a £250 increase. Unions said that still left more than 2 million public sector workers without an increase, many of them frontline workers who have been tackling the pandemic. The TUC leader, Frances O‘Grady, described the chancellor’s attack on the public sector as a breach of his pledge to level up jobs and pay across the country. She said: “After a decade of standstill pay, yet another pay freeze is a kick in the teeth for the key workers in the public sector who kept the country going in this crisis.” Police leaders said the pay freeze was wrong and hit those in the public sector who were on the frontline of fighting the pandemic. Paul Griffiths, the president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, said the freeze came as police officers were being called upon to protect the public, “at significant risk to their own health, during the greatest health and economic emergency of our lifetime”. John Apter of the Police Federation, representing more than 120,000 rank-and-file officers, said: “After years of austerity and a real terms pay cut of 18%, today’s news will be a kick in the teeth for police officers.” Sunak extended his pledge to low-paid private sector workers, who will benefit from a 2.2% increase in the “national living wage” to £8.91 an hour from April 2021, “likely benefiting around 2 million of the lowest paid”. Sunak said: “A full-time worker on the national living wage will see their annual earnings increase by £345 next year. And compared to 2016 when the policy was first introduced, that’s a pay rise of over £4,000.” Bryan Sanderson, the chair of the Low Pay Commission, said he was pleased the government had accepted his organisation’s recommendation. Some business groups said they were concerned about the capacity of firms that paid low wages, many of them among the hardest hit by the pandemic, to increase staff pay. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said: “Many lower-paid workers have been the heroes of the Covid crisis, and business supports government’s ambition of ending low pay. But unemployment is rising in lower-paying sectors and these increases will be tough for some firms afford, so caution is justified to protect jobs.”"
2020-11-25T19:06:56Z,politics,Politics,'Got to make cuts somewhere': Maltby gives Sunak benefit of the doubt,"There are many sensible people in South Yorkshire who were certain Rother Valley would never elect a Conservative MP, certainly not while the miners’ strike remained in the collective consciousness. Rother Valley held on to its pits for longer than most, with its final colliery, in Maltby, closing down only in 2013. Yet in December, after 101 years of unbroken Labour representation, and seven years after its final haul of coal was brought to the surface, the constituency not only voted in a Tory but a Tory who once claimed his political idol was Margaret Thatcher. Alexander Stafford, a Londoner with a background in PR, said in 2011 that he admired Thatcher “because she was a strong leader who saved the country from where it was headed”. He won a 6,318 majority, taking over from Sir Kevin Barron, who spent 20 years down Maltby colliery before his election to parliament in 1983.
One of those who gave Stafford his vote was Marban Iqbal, who runs a tyre and exhaust garage in what was once the depot for the Maltby Miners Home Coal Transport Service. The old sign still hangs above the entrance but the new owner has roots in Kashmir, not down the mine. Iqbal said he’d had a busy pandemic, staying open throughout. He switched his vote to the Conservatives for the first time in December (“I didn’t like the way Labour were going”) and thought Rishi Sunak had done a decent job so far – “until he puts our taxes up, which we know he will”. Of Sunak’s announcements on Wednesday, it was the cut to the foreign aid budget which Iqbal thought would go down best locally. “I’ve lived in this country for about 30 years and as somebody coloured, you are still classed as a foreigner,” he mused, suggesting he had never quite been accepted locally, despite also running a curry house around the corner for years. “It might be good for the average British folk if the government is giving more to people here than abroad.” Amid the doom and gloom of Sunak’s economic predictions was one announcement expressly designed to gladden the hearts of residents in “red wall” areas like Maltby: a £4bn “levelling up” fund open to all areas who feel they’ve had a raw deal when it comes to government investment.
Boris Johnson started talking about levelling up back in the summer. But the phrase hasn’t filtered up to Maltby just yet and the voters of tomorrow do not appear to be growing up with a sense of north-south injustice. Does London get too much government money? Sixteen-year-old Jemma Frost, walking home from sixth form college, wasn’t sure: “The south has bigger cities than the north, doesn’t it, so they will need more.” She too thought Johnson had done a good job: “He’s tried his best.” There is no stigma against the Conservatives among her generation, she suggested. The miners’ strike was 20 years before they were born: “It’s only older people who are still angry about it.” Round the corner at Kell’s Kitchen it was another slow afternoon. The corner cafe is takeaway only during the second lockdown and many of their enormous sandwiches – the special contains three rashers of bacon, four sausages, three eggs, beans and mushrooms – are difficult to eat on the hoof. The owner, Tracey Taylor – Kell is her daughter – is just about making ends meet, but times are tough. Normally she delivers to local salons, but they’re all shut. Half the workers on the nearby industrial estate are furloughed, so they don’t need feeding. “Business is rubbish,” she sighed, behind a Perspex screen and a mask. Yet like many people in this former Labour stronghold, Taylor didn’t blame Johnson for her predicament. “I think he’s done quite well. I feel quite sorry for him, he’s had it tough,” she said. Would Labour have done a better job? “Probably not.” Over 1,300 people were employed at the colliery during its peak, enough to warrant the building of an entire “model village” to house 500 families. Arranged around two concentric circles with a bandstand at the centre, the inner circle contained semi-detached villas for senior officials, with the miners housed in modest terraces on the outside circle. These days, Maltby Model Village is among the 6% most deprived areas in England. The bandstand has been demolished for retirement bungalows, the once plush villas sell for just £155,000 and those residents in work now largely drive to Sheffield or Rotherham for employment. Some 29% of all jobs in the area disappeared between 2011 and 2017, according to the local council. A disproportionately large number of residents claim disability benefits. Joe Plant is one of them. Now 59, his mental health problems have left him unable to work for more than 30 years. He too was inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt – “there’s no guidebook to deal with this situation” – but said it was a shame only doctors and nurses were getting a public sector pay rise. “I think teachers and bin men should get one too.” But he said Sunak was in a bind: “He’s got to make the cuts somewhere.”"
2020-11-25T19:02:34Z,politics,Politics,‘Twisted priorities’: SNP criticises Sunak's spending review,"Rishi Sunak has announced record funding for the UK’s devolved nations next year but faced accusations from the Scottish National party that the Treasury’s overall stimulus package is too weak to cope with the Covid crisis. The chancellor unveiled an increase in overall funding for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments of £4.7bn next year, including £2.6bn in extra spending to deal with impacts from the pandemic. That broke down to £2.4bn extra for Scotland, £1.3bn for Wales and £900m for Northern Ireland, adding to the “unprecedented” £16bn the Treasury had given the devolved nations since March to combat the Covid crisis.
The Treasury said this funding was double the sums it had provided to the devolved nations in March’s statement, although UK government officials acknowledge privately that the pandemic has created a unique situation. The Office for Budget Responsibility said these increases added to the spending uplifts pledged by Sunak in March which, in a “striking turnaround” in UK government support, had reversed all the real-terms cuts imposed by the Treasury over the previous eight years. The Treasury asserted too that each devolved area would be given at least one free port, an area that pays little to no tax; nearly £3bn in support for city deals; a share of the UK government’s “levelling up” fund; and more than £1bn to compensate farmers and fishermen for the loss of EU subsidies. Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s Treasury spokeswoman at Westminster and MP for Glasgow Central, said Sunak had failed to provide the investment the economy needed to help it recover from the pandemic and recession. The SNP had called this week for a fiscal stimulus package of at least £98bn, but that was ignored, she said. Scotland also needed the devolution of further financial powers, to help it tailor the response to fit the country’s economic needs, she added. “The fact that the Tories are wasting millions on a Brexit festival while slashing public sector pay, and cutting support for the world’s poorest, tells you everything you need to know about this government’s twisted priorities,” Thewliss said.
Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said Sunak had gone further than any government in peacetime, and had listened to his calls for city and regional growth deal funding to be accelerated. “These unparalleled spending promises show that the deep pockets of the UK government are best placed to support Scottish jobs, schools and hospitals,” he said. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, said Sunak’s statement upheld the UK government’s pledge to maintain EU levels of funding for farming and infrastructure spending – a position the Scottish government disputes. “The UK government’s spending review delivers for all parts of the UK at this challenging time. Never before has the strength of the union, and the role of the UK Treasury, been more important,” Jack said. Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary and SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber & Badenoch, said the extra Treasury help for building and infrastructure investment actually led to a real terms cut of 5% in capital funding. She said Sunak’s policies in England, such as freezing public sector pay, had knock-on implications for Scotland’s share of UK spending. “Freezing public sector pay for so many at the frontline, scrapping the proposed increase in the national minimum wage to £9.21 and failing to extend the £20 uplift to universal credit and working tax credit beyond April 2021 mean millions of people will have less money to spend to help drive our economic recovery. “I am also alarmed at the failure to replace EU funding in full. A promise that the new shared prosperity fund will be fully funded at an unspecified future date will be of scant comfort to Scottish communities that have benefited so much from EU support,” Forbes said."
2020-11-25T19:02:08Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak’s £4.8bn ‘levelling-up’ UK fund met with scepticism,"The government will launch a “levelling-up fund” for England worth £4bn to support towns and communities with regeneration projects, Rishi Sunak has said. The chancellor used his spending review statement to announce details of the new funding package as part of Boris Johnson’s election promise to boost the economic prosperity of areas outside London and the south-east of England. Alongside the £4bn for England, there will be funding worth £800m for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Local areas will be able to apply for up to £20m each from the fund to spend on projects which command local support, including from an MP. Sunak said the fund, which will be controlled from Westminster, was designed to improve “the infrastructure of everyday life”.
He said this could include funding for a new bypass, upgraded railway station, roadworks to cut traffic, more libraries, museums and galleries, or town centre improvements. Promises to rebalance Britain’s lopsided economy through higher spending on infrastructure and other projects were a central message of Boris Johnson at the 2019 election, helping him to win seats in traditionally Labour-voting northern constituencies. Sunak said the fund would be managed jointly by the Treasury, the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Projects must have “real impact” and be delivered before the end of the current parliament in 2024.
Sarah Longlands, the director of the leftwing IPPR North thinktank, said control of the fund from Westminster, and the requirement for local areas to submit competitive bids, risked pitting areas against each other and would not hand power to communities. She added: “What we really needed today was ambitious plans to empower local leaders and people to lead our recovery from Covid-19, and from our regional divides. What we got was a sticking plaster.” Helen Barnard, the director of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Remarkably for a much-hyped statement on levelling-up opportunity across the country, the chancellor’s words ring hollow as weaker local economies will be getting less money than previously in the aftermath of the pandemic.”"
2020-11-25T18:28:06Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak sets out £100bn investment in infrastructure,"Britain’s first national infrastructure strategy will deliver a “once in a generation investment” worth £100bn to spur the country’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the chancellor said on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak set out plans for the “highest sustained levels of public investment in more than 40 years” as the government attempted to offset a grim economic prognosis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The £100bn spending plans for next year are £27bn higher than for last year in real terms, and over the next four years government spending on infrastructure will rise to £600bn, Sunak said. The infrastructure plans are designed to rebuild the economy by creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs while upgrading the country’s roads, railways and full-fibre broadband cables, and investing in green infrastructure to help create a “net zero” economy by 2050. The plans promise to spread investment across the UK’s regions with the help of a new national infrastructure bank, based in the north of England, to invest in infrastructure projects alongside private investors. The bank has been created despite calls for an institution that more closely resembles the UK’s Green Investment Bank, which was controversially sold off in 2017. The new bank will be aligned with the government’s climate aims but will also have a broader focus on “levelling up” regions of the UK which have been neglected in the past. Sunak told the House of Commons: “For many people, the most powerful barometer of economic success is the change they see and the pride they feel in the places they call home.” His infrastructure strategy includes plans to help deliver 860,000 new homes by ploughing £7.1bn into “the biggest ever investment” in new roads, cycle lanes, community facilities and better 4G broadband across 95% of the UK by 2025 in order to support new housing developments across the country. Alongside the infrastructure spending Sunak announced a new “levelling up fund” worth £4bn and changes to the guidelines used by officials to make key investment decisions, known as the Green Book, to favour projects which help support the government’s levelling up agenda. The chancellor’s infrastructure strategy, which was based on recommendations by Britain’s National Infrastructure Committee, offered little new spending for green measures after the prime minister set out his 10-point plan for a climate revolution last week which will be backed by £12bn of funding, including about £4bn of new spending commitments. The exception was a windfall for green transport, including £120m for an extra 500 zero-emissions buses next year, and £950m to future-proof the electricity grid along motorways so that private investors can install high-powered charging hubs at every motorway service area by 2023."
2020-11-25T18:22:46Z,politics,Politics,UK politics: minister resigns over aid spending cut; Rishi Sunak freezes public sector pay except for NHS – as it happened,"Rishi Sunak has said the government will borrow a peacetime record of almost Â£400bn this year as it seeks to combat the worst recession in more than 300 years. He confirmed the figure in a statement to MPs setting out his spending review for 2020. Here is a summary of the key points.
And here is an analysis from our colleague Larry Elliott.
The government will need to find up to Â£27bn worth of spending cuts or tax rises by 2024 to put the public finances on a sustainable footing, the Treasuryâ€™s spending watchdog has warned. Boris Johnson was struggling to contain a Conservative revolt as a Foreign Office minister resigned after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced he was breaking a manifesto promise by cutting the overseas aid budget by a third and ending the Tory commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. The UK has recorded 696 further deaths - a new record for the second wave of the pandemic and the highest daily total since early May. (See 5.49pm.) Deaths are always a lagging indicators, and UK case numbers continue to fall, but the figure serves as a reminder of the seriousness of the second wave on the eve of the announcement from the government about which areas in England are going into which tiers when the lockdown ends next week. Some governnment figures have been claiming that the whole of the country could end up in tiers 3 or 2, the two tiers with the strictest rules. This evening the Office for National Statistics has announced that it will publish its weekly coronavirus infection survey, which is regarded as one of the best guides to the prevalance of coronavirus in the community, tomorrow at 10.30am, instead of Friday at 12pm at usual. The govenrment has promised to release data justifying its decisions about which areas are going into which tiers, and that may explain why the ONS publication has been moved forward. In its announcement about the revised release time the ONS said: Analysis relating to the pandemic is subject to changes at short notice. The ONS is working to ensure the UK has the vital information needed to respond to the impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on our economy and society.
Thatâ€™s all from us for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-25T18:20:26Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: the sticking points,"In just over five weeks, the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union with or without a trade and security deal. Much of the 600-plus pages of legal text is complete, but three outstanding issues remain to be resolved. Such are the differences between the two sides that it is likely the politicians will have to take over from the negotiators, who are running out of track given their respective mandates.
Fishing The issue was always likely to be a thorn in the side of the negotiators, as there will be clear winners and losers. The UK is leaving the common fisheries policy and taking back control of its exclusive economic zone: 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline or to the halfway line in smaller stretches of water. The UK is seeking annual negotiations with the EU on what European fishing fleets will be allowed to catch in its sovereign waters. A “zonal attachment” system would divide up species between the two sides according to where the fish reside rather than the current division based on fixed fishing patterns. The UK also has priority stocks where it expects to enjoy an increase in the amount its fleet can fish within its own waters. The EU is resisting both “zonal attachment” and annual negotiations as it does not offer security to its coastal communities. It also wants to keep the British gains to around 15-18% of the fish caught by EU boats today. The UK is seeking a far higher windfall but has offered a three-year transition period to phase in the changes. The EU is seeking a longer transition period. Standards and domestic subsidies In the political declaration on the future relationship, both sides committed to “uphold the common high standards” in the UK and the EU “at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change and relevant tax matters”. The UK has agreed to “non-regression” but it does not want EU law to be the baseline. That would introduce EU concepts and the European court of justice into the treaty. The two sides are therefore locked in talks about how to define their current common high standards. The EU is also seeking a “ratchet clause” to ensure that as either side develops its standards over time, the other side faces consequences should it choose not to follow with equivalent regulations. The negotiators are working on a model where if one side raises standards, the other must consider adopting them. The EU then wants an independent panel to judge if one side’s refusal to move in tandem is creating a competitive advantage. They would then set a remedy. The UK is resisting anything that amounts to Brussels having the right of prior approval on domestic legislation. On domestic subsidies, or state aid, the two sides have agreed on principles which would be part of both sides’ regime. The UK will also have an independent regulator. But the EU wants a mechanism through which to swiftly sanction the UK if it believes the government or the new regulator has breached the principles set out in the treaty. Again, the UK is allergic to the suggestion that the EU will have any ex-ante oversight of government decisions. Dispute resolution Given that the UK unilaterally sought to rewrite the withdrawal agreement and break international law, there is particular onus being put on keeping the British government to the promises it makes in the treaty. The EU wants to be able to swiftly cross-retaliate if there is a breach of obligations in any part of the treaty. The UK wants to keep fisheries and security outside of the scope of the dispute resolution provisions."
2020-11-25T18:14:55Z,politics,Politics,No dice for key workers from Rishi the Monopoly chancellor | John Crace,"Playing the supporting act does not come naturally to Boris Johnson. But, on reflection, he might come to thank Rishi Sunak for taking centre stage with his spending review statement, as it allowed most people to overlook his third-rate performance at prime minister’s questions. Accusing Keir Starmer of focusing on trivia when asked about multiple breaches of the ministerial code will not go down as one of Johnson’s career highlights. Not that the chancellor had an easy time of it either. Sunak tried to give his usual urbane, unflustered “don’t worry your pretty little heads, I’ve got everything under control” performance, but you could sense the tension in his voice. Then again, telling the country that it is basically economically screwed for the foreseeable future is not a job anyone would much relish. GDP had suffered its biggest fall in 300 years. The UK was committed to the highest level of borrowing during peacetime. Unemployment would rise to 2.6 million people. And even in five years’ time, the economy would be 5% smaller. The sums involved were eye-watering, the sort of numbers that no one could properly get their heads around. There were mitigating circumstances, of course. No one had predicted the coronavirus pandemic, though Sunak was proud to say that the UK’s response had been worse than most. We had suffered the second largest – behind Spain – economic decline in Europe, but we had made up for that by leading the way in the number of people who had died. But what was clear was that though there were hopeful signs that the worst of the health emergency might be over next year if the vaccines came on stream, the economic emergency was only just beginning. Sunak did his best to talk up his achievements and spending commitments, but it was hard to keep up the pretence when departmental budgets were being cut. Nor did a pay freeze for firefighters, teachers and other public sector employees quite square with the key worker promises from earlier in the year. Presumably we were supposed to have realised at the time that we were only clapping for some of our carers. There was talk of a “once in a generation” chance to build new homes but nobody was holding out much hope on that promise as “once in a generation” opportunities seem to come and go in weeks in Westminster these days. Other moneys came and went at speed. There would be no continuation of the £20 uplift in universal credit and people with disabilities should rejoice in their 37p a week pay rise. And as from today the government’s manifesto promise to maintain overseas aid at 0.7% of gross national income was dead in the water. Those foreigners would have to start looking after themselves. We had done our bit by helping to develop a coronavirus vaccine that they might be able to use, so what more could anyone ask? But just to prove that the government didn’t break all its promises, Sunak concluded with a £4bn levelling-up fund for which MPs could bid. Provided those MPs held Tory red wall seats. The statement lasted just under 25 minutes – there’s something to be said for keeping the bad news shortish and sweet, when some budget speeches can last the full hour – but was as remarkable for what it didn’t say as much as for what it did. There was no mention of the Brexit bonus which Boris had promised would come to our rescue in our hour of need. There again, now was not the time to mention a no-deal scenario that would knock a further 2% off GDP, or a third-rate deal that would achieve little better. Nor did Sunak give any clue about how we were eventually going to pay for all the excess borrowing, but then he probably didn’t know. This was effectively the seventh or eighth budget he had given since March and the figures have got worse every time. So why make himself a hostage to fortune by mentioning tax rises when he still didn’t have a clue how much money he would eventually need? Rishi is the Monopoly chancellor who is writing cheques he has no idea if he will be able to cash. Labour’s Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, was witheringly sceptical in her reply. While she didn’t underestimate the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, she did question many of the chancellor’s priorities in where to make cuts. Many inequalities would not just remain but be deepened. The chancellor may have called his rescue package one of the most generous on offer, but there were still gaping cracks through which many people would fall at a time when Tory friends and donors were doing quite nicely out of the crisis. She was also the first to mention the B word. But even when reminded, Sunak was careful to forget to outline his Brexit calculations. There’s only so much bad news anyone can take at one time.
Nor was it just the opposition parties who were criticising the chancellor for his choice of priorities. Many Tories, including the normally mild-mannered, easy-going Peter Bottomley, Tobias Ellwood and Tom Tugendhat, were all highly critical of the decision to break the manifesto pledge and cut the aid budget. Andrew Mitchell suggested the cut would lead to an extra 100,000 unnecessary deaths among some of the world’s poorest people. Sunak merely shrugged it off. He could live with 100,000 deaths. Que sera, sera. By now his noted sangfroid was starting to wear off and his responses became less conciliatory. He is only used to being praised by his party for his generosity and foresight – even when many of his budgets have had to be revised in hindsight – being anointed as Boris’s natural successor. This is the first time his competence and judgment had come under scrutiny from his own side and he didn’t appear to much like it. Though he may have to get used to it. • Join John Crace and Guardian columnist Marina Hyde as they look back at a political year like no other. Thursday 10 December, 7pm GMT, 8pm CET, 2pm EST.

2020-11-25T18:06:54Z,politics,Politics,‘Economic emergency has only just begun’: spending review reaction in quotes,"“Our health emergency is not yet over and our economic emergency has only just begun.” Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer “This will hit household and public finances hard. The British state has never seen anything like this outside of world war two.” Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation “Stark forecasts point to tough times ahead. The chancellor has made some bold autumn decisions to power a spring recovery. But ambition must be matched by action on the ground. The government’s commitment to build, build, build must be delivered now.” Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist of the CBI “The chancellor appears not to have pledged a single extra penny towards a green economic recovery today, while wasting tens of billions on polluting new roads. This would be a failure for jobs, the economy and the future of our planet.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK “It seems more likely than not that spending will end up significantly higher than set out today, and so borrowing in 2024-25 will be considerably more than the £100bn forecast by the OBR. Either that or we are in for a pretty austere few years once again, or for some significant tax rises.” Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies “Business leaders will be relieved that the Treasury is resisting the temptation to hike taxes on enterprise for now, but will be concerned that Brexit didn’t merit a mention.” Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors “By freezing the pay of many thousands of public servants [Sunak] is undermining the very people who are the foundation of our public sector. The comparison of public and private sector wage growth was insulting.” Mike Clancy, Prospect union general secretary “Our estimates this week showed a fiscal stimulus of £164bn was needed to support the economy and prevent needless, permanent damage to businesses and incomes. The chancellor has acted too timidly, and in doing so has failed to live up to the scale of the challenge.” Carys Roberts, IPPR executive director “This was a realistic statement which lays bare the immense challenges the chancellor and the economy faces in the near term. In the face of these it is absolutely right that the priority must be to protect jobs. Industry will commend the chancellor for addressing this difficult balancing act with a package of measures designed to get boots and shovels on the ground.” Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK"
2020-11-25T17:22:04Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak's spending review 'will fail to kickstart green recovery',"A new infrastructure bank, to be based in the north of England, and an emissions-trading scheme covering large portions of industry were proclaimed by Rishi Sunak as evidence that the government is aligning its aim of rescuing the UK economy from the Covid-19 slump with its goal of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. But for the most part, experts said the chancellor’s spending review and infrastructure strategy failed to give the kickstart to the green recovery that economists have been advising and green campaigners have urged. Of the £100bn to be invested in the UK’s infrastructure, only a fraction seems destined to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while large portions of the spending are in danger of locking in high emissions far into the future. Road-building schemes will account for £27bn, and while housebuilding is a key aim there are few safeguards to ensure new houses will be zero-carbon. There is also little to guarantee that the £4bn “levelling-up fund” will avoid propping up the high-carbon economy. Pedro Guertler, clean economy programme leader at the E3G thinktank, said: “The £1.1bn for green buildings is only 1% of the total [infrastructure] budget. This will not be enough to get on track to net zero.” He called for further multi-year funding for green buildings to give the supply chain confidence to invest. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of sustainable businesses, said: “A key task for the government in the near future will be to introduce new regulations and market mechanisms to drive private-sector low carbon investment in critical areas such as buildings, heavy industry and nature restoration.” There was praise for the chancellor’s plan for a new national infrastructure bank, but experts warned that it must be given a clear mandate and adequate funding to ensure its investments drive a green economy. “A net zero mission must be put at the heart of the institution,” said Kate Levick, of E3G. “It must also be given full banking powers, an independent remit, and the capital needed to drive our green recovery.” The government’s last attempt, the Green Investment Bank, was sold off only a few years into its mandate, so experts want the latest version to have a long-term vision. Lord Stern of Brentford, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, said: “The new bank should play a vital role in fostering sustainable infrastructure projects and programmes, in managing the risks associated with infrastructure, and in providing assurance to the private sector that it can invest with confidence.” Green campaigners slammed the government for failing to follow through on pledges made last week of a “green industrial revolution” to shift the UK’s economy permanently to a low-carbon footing, set out in Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Shaun Spiers, executive director of Green Alliance, contrasted Sunak’s announcements with last week’s pledges. “The chancellor’s statement was a chance to back [the 10-point plan] with serious money, but he muffed it. The chancellor gave no sense that he understands the scale of the climate and nature emergencies, or the potential of the green economy for immediate job creation across the country.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace, contrasted the UK’s attempts at a green recovery with those of EU rivals. “The chancellor appears not have pledged a single extra penny towards a green economic recovery today, while wasting tens of billions on polluting new roads,” she said. “This would be a failure for jobs, the economy and the future of our planet. France and Germany get it – they’re throwing a combined £63bn towards carbon-cutting stimulus measures.” Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, added: “With billions of pounds earmarked for a climate-wrecking road-building programme, and inadequate funding for home insulation, eco-heating, buses and cycling, this strategy falls woefully short of what’s needed to meet the UK’s legally-binding targets for building a green future.” There was concern at the lack of funding for infrastructure projects that restore the UK’s natural environment, despite assurances last week by the prime minister that it was a key aim. Hilary McGrady, director-general of the National Trust, said: “This year has shown how important nature and green space are to people. While we welcome confirmation that climate change and the environment remain an important priority for the government, we’ve not seen the long-term funding commitment to deliver the bold changes we need.” Climate campaigners were also dismayed by the slashing of the international aid budget. Pledges by rich nations to provide at least £100bn a year to the developing world from this year, to help poor countries cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, have been central to gaining support from the developing world for the Paris climate agreement. For the UK to renege on its aid spending would send a damaging signal to the developing world, just as the UK prepares to host the next vital climate summit, campaigners warned. “The decision to cut the aid budget will fundamentally undermine the UK’s climate leadership. It will hinder poorer countries’ ability to tackle and adapt to the climate emergency, and sour the UK’s diplomatic relationships in the run-up to the crucial Glasgow climate conference next year,” Newsom said."
2020-11-25T16:26:10Z,politics,Politics,Conservatives face inquiry over attempt to influence Elphicke hearing,"Character references that were provided for the sentencing of the jailed former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke should “in principle” be released, a judge has said following an application by media. Mrs Justice Whipple was also dismissive of attempted interventions by five Tory MPs and a peer who were rebuked by senior judges for seeking to exert “improper” influence before Wednesday’s hearing. The parliamentarians, including Elphicke’s wife Natalie, have been referred to the parliamentary commissioner for standards by the Labour MP Helen Hayes after they wrote to senior judges before the hearing and expressed concern that “matters of principle” should first be considered by senior figures of the judiciary and parliament. “In doing so, they sought improperly to influence the decision of a judge in the Elphicke case itself,” wrote Hayes. “Of particular concern is the use of House of Commons notepaper for this letter, showing disregard for the important separation of constitutional powers and the independence of our judicial system. A businessman with an official role in the Port of Dover, past and present councillors, a local religious leader, a member of Kent’s chamber of commerce, someone who heads up “quite a well-known” war remembrance charity locally and at least one person who had been involved in the Tory party’s electoral selection process in Kent were among those who provided references, the court heard on Wednesday. The judge told the hearing at Southwark crown court that she would release some references and would consider what redactions might also be necessary in cases where their release was contested. Some of the individuals had provided them on the understanding they would not be publicly disclosed, though a solicitor who had handled their processing said she was unaware of any such assurances. Elphicke was sentenced in September to two years in prison after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against two women. Mrs Justice Whipple referred on Wednesday to correspondence by Tory politicians earlier this month that she said “had invited senior judges to consider the matters at stake in this application seemingly before I had decided it”. She added that five of them – the Tory peer David Freud and the MPs Sir Roger Gale, Adam Holloway, Bob Stewart and Theresa Villiers – were entitled to make submissions via Elphicke’s legal team as they were among those who provided character references. But they were not entitled to make “wider submissions” and ceased to have any role when they then voluntarily identified themselves recently as the authors of those references. She added: “The sixth person in the group is Mrs [Natalie] Elphicke, the defendant’s wife and the MP for Dover and Deal, his former constituency. As far as I am concerned, she has no interest or role in the current application and never has had.” An application for the letters’ release was made by the Guardian, Times and Associated Newspapers where the author is a public figure, in public office or holds or has held a position of public responsibility. Sarah Palin, a barrister acting for the media, argued that the letters be released on the basis of “open justice” but also because they contribute to the debate about attitudes and conduct of former senior politicians and were “essential to the functioning of democracy. Elphicke was not present for the hearing, although the court heard he was in the building having been brought to Southwark “by mistake”. Judgment will be handed down under embargo in the coming weeks.”."
2020-11-25T16:20:19Z,politics,Politics,Sunak announces record peacetime borrowing to combat historic downturn,"Rishi Sunak has said the government will borrow a peacetime record of almost £400bn this year as it seeks to combat the worst recession in more than 300 years.
The chancellor said the UK faced an “economic emergency” warranting a cut in international aid and a public sector pay freeze for millions, with an exemption for NHS staff and workers earning less than £24,000 per year. However, he insisted there would be no turning back from the government’s levelling-up agenda, announcing a £4bn fund to pay for local projects such as bypasses, libraries and station improvements.
Sunak’s “levelling up” fund, which must be spent over the course of the parliament, will be a welcome boost to Conservative MPs particularly in “red wall” seats where MPs have been warning the chancellor they must see tangible improvements to their high streets and infrastructure to keep hold of the newly Tory seats. Though some red wall MPs have voiced approval at the cut in spending on foreign aid, Sunak faced a furious backlash from senior Tories committed to the 0.7% target who have vowed to block the cut.
Setting out the government’s spending plans for 2021-22 as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to push Britain’s economy into a double-dip recession, the chancellor said the one-year spending review would “deliver stronger public services and a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure”.
Forecasts from the government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), updated to take account of the second lockdown in England and tougher restrictions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, show the economy will drop by 11.3% this year and take until the end of 2022 to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Unemployment will rise to 7.5% next year – less than originally feared because of the Treasury’s furlough scheme and support for the self-employed – before falling to 4.4% in 2024. Nonetheless, it will mean 2.6 million people unemployed, as furlough comes to an end and companies struggle to stay afloat or retain some staff.
Setting out the government’s plans to find some savings while increasing public spending overall next year by 3.8% – the fastest rate in 15 years – Sunak said he could not justify maintaining the international aid budget at its current levels “at a time of unprecedented crisis”. He said a significant cut from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5% would be deployed to save £4bn next year. Spending would then return to the internationally agreed level “when the fiscal situation allows”.
He said the freeze on public sector pay would not apply to millions of workers, including NHS staff and public servants earning less than £24,000, who will get a pay rise of £250. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said cuts to public sector pay would hit the economy and flew in the face of public support. “Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. “This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence. Firefighters, police officers and teachers will know their spending power is going down, so they will spend less in our small businesses and on our high streets. They will spend less in our private sector,.” Trade union leaders warned the chancellor was delivering a kick in the teeth to workers on the frontline of the government’s pandemic response. However, Sunak said the renewed pay freeze – reminiscent of the austerity drive imposed by George Osborne after the 2008 financial crisis – was vital to ensure fairness between the public and private sectors. The chancellor said private sector wages had fallen in the six months to September by 1% compared with a year ago, while public sector pay had risen by almost 4%, and that public servants’ jobs were under less threat during the crisis. The cut to international aid sparked a serious backlash among Conservatives responding to the chancellor’s statement. The Foreign Office minister Lady Sugg has submitted her resignation over the cut and the Tory grandees Sir Peter Bottomley, David Davis and Andrew Mitchell said they would work with any opposition efforts to oppose it.
Others who voiced anger and distress at the cut included the Tory chairs of the foreign and defence select committee, Tom Tugendhat and Tobias Ellwood.
One influential Tory backbench group, the Northern Research Group led by the former minister Jake Berry, which includes most MPs in the new red wall seats across the north of England, declared the statement a triumph for the group’s lobbying efforts on levelling up. In a statement, the group said it was thrilled to see “the tearing-up of the Green Book rules that favours investment in London and the south-east” and said it was “clear this northern chancellor has actively engaged with the Northern Research Group’s agenda”."
2020-11-25T15:43:50Z,politics,Politics,Foreign Office minister resigns as Sunak cuts aid budget,"Boris Johnson was struggling to contain a Conservative revolt as a Foreign Office minister resigned after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced he was breaking a manifesto promise by cutting the overseas aid budget by a third and ending the Tory commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. Lady Sugg, whose brief includes sustainable development, submitted her resignation to Johnson in protest against the cut. Sunak insisted the cut reflected people’s priorities at a time of unprecedented economic emergency. But Sugg, a close ally of David Cameron and enthusiastic advocate of girls’ education, did not appear at the Lords dispatch box to answer questions on the aid cut that formed the most controversial measure in Sunak’s spending review. In her resignation letter, she wrote: “Many in our country face severe challenges as a result of the pandemic and I know the government must make very difficult choices in response. But I believe it is fundamentally wrong to abandon our commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on development. “This promise should be kept in the tough times as well as the good. Given the link between our development spend and the health of our economy, the economic downturn has already led to significant cuts this year and I do not believe we should reduce our support further at a time of unprecedented global crises.”
Speaking in the Commons, Sunak said: “Sticking rigidly to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid is difficult to justify to the British people,” adding that aid spending would fall to £10bn in in 2020-21. The aid target would be cut to 0.5%, Sunak confirmed, adding he hoped the 0.7% target could be restored when the UK’s finances allowed it. A number of senior MPs warned Sunak he was endangering the government’s leadership role at a critical time for the world, including the British hosting of the UN climate change conference next year. Andrew Mitchell, a former Conservative international development secretary, said the aid cuts “will be the cause of 100,000 preventable deaths, mainly among children. This is a choice I for one am not prepared to make. None of us will be able to look our children in the eye and claim we did not know what we were voting for.” The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “To cut our aid budget by a third in a year when millions more will fall into extreme poverty will make not just them poorer but us poorer in the eyes of the world.” He added: “People will worry we are abandoning noble ideas that we have done more to champion than anyone else.” Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the defence select committee, condemned the move, saying the UK cannot genuinely claim to be global Britain “when our hard power is not matched by soft power”. Peter Bottomley, the Tory father of the house, said he would work across party lines to block the cut. Pauline Latham, the Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire, said the aid budget would be decimated, “leading to more child marriages, more instances of early childbirth FGM, more domestic violence, and we will not be vaccinating millions”. The cut in aid spending contrasted with a large three-year increase for the defence budget, but Sunak clearly decided to brush aside warnings that Britain’s commitment to foreign aid symbolised an outward looking and generous UK. Setting aid spending at 0.7% was first adopted in principle as a target by the UK in 1974 and enshrined in law in 2015, two years after the target had been met for the first time. In practice the law only requires the foreign secretary to provide a report to parliament explaining why the target has not been met. The £15bn aid budget in this financial year is already cut by £2.9bn due to the sharp decline in growth, but was expected to recover next year along with the projected 5.5% growth in the British economy. Hopes that the target would be cut to 0.5% only temporarily in a measure that might not require primary legislation were dashed, as were suggestions that more of the aid budget could be redefined and given to other departments, including assistance with security and climate change, two preconditions for development. However, the requirement to introduce primary legislation will give an opportunity for the reformed Tory One Nation group to show if it can test the government’s overall 80-seat majority. A fortnight ago the group published a pamphlet authored by the former foreign secretaries Hunt and Malcolm Rifkind, and Mitchell. Many Tory MPs also warned Johnson’s calling card on the world stage would be thrown away ahead of the UK’s chairmanship of the G7 this year and it hosting the UN climate change summit in Glasgow. Sunak also resisted opposition from more than 180 aid groups, two former prime ministers – Tony Blair and David Cameron – as well as the archbishop of Canterbury. There were also hints of opposition from US Democrats, although the US itself has never taken on the target. The abolition of the target has been long sought by Conservative rightwingers, who say it plays well with swing voters at a time of domestic austerity. Many Tory MPs claim the figure is arbitrary and leads to a rush in inefficient spending at the end of the financial year. The government’s aid watchdog, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, rejected this argument in a report published this week. The 0.7% figure was adopted internationally as a target by the UN general assembly in October 1970 following a World Bank report recommendation. In 2005 the 15 countries that were members of the EU by 2004 agreed to reach the target by 2015, but few in practice did so. The target was also the reference point for the UK when it chaired the G8 Gleneagles summit in 2005, which was seen as the high-water mark of international efforts to restructure unsustainable debt in the world’s poorest countries. Sarah Champion MP, chair of the international aid select committee, said the cut in aid was devastating. She said: “Within six months a specialist development government department has been scrapped, this year’s budget has already been slashed and next year’s too by even more. I think we can wave goodbye to the development superpower status that we have proudly had for so long.”"
2020-11-25T15:04:38Z,politics,Politics,EU threatens to pull out of Brexit talks if UK refuses to compromise,"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned David Frost that without a major negotiating shift by Downing Street within the next 48 hours he will pull out of the Brexit negotiations in London this weekend, pushing the talks into a fresh crisis. In talks via videoconference on Tuesday, Barnier told his British counterpart that further negotiations would be pointless if the UK was not willing to compromise on the outstanding issues. Should Barnier effectively walk out on the negotiations it would present the most dangerous moment yet for the troubled talks, with just 36 days to go before the end of the transition period.
While Brussels might hope such a move would put the UK prime minister under pressure to give Frost new negotiating instructions, it might also embolden those within the Tory party who believe no deal is the better outcome. During a speech in the European parliament on Wednesday, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was willing to be “creative” to get a deal with the UK but admitted an agreement was in the balance with “very little time ahead of us”. Physical talks are on hold after a member of the EU negotiating team tested positive for coronavirus, but Barnier is expected to leave quarantine on Thursday evening. He is due to head to London on Friday for a last-ditch push for an agreement once he receives a negative coronavirus test.
“These are decisive days for negotiations with the United Kingdom,” Von der Leyen told MEPs. “But, frankly, I cannot tell you today if in the end, there will be a deal.” “We will do all in our power to reach an agreement. We’re ready to be creative,” she said. “But we are not ready to put into question the integrity of the single market, the main safeguard for European prosperity and wealth.” Von der Leyen said legal texts on judicial and social security coordination, trade in goods and services and transport were almost finalised. “However, there’s still three issues that can make the difference between a deal and no deal,” she added. She said fishing communities needed “predictability” from year to year over access to British waters, in a reference to Downing Street’s wish to hold annual negotiations over catches in UK seas, with the option of blocking access.
On state aid, Von der Leyen said the EU was seeking a mechanism through which any breach of agreed principles controlling domestic subsidies could be swiftly remedied. The EU is also seeking a mechanism to ensure there are consequences for either side within the trade deal if standards diverge over time. “Significant difficulties remain on the question, how we can secure now, and over time, our common high standards on labour on social rights on the environment, the climate change and tax transparency,” Von der Leyen said. “We want to know what remedies are available in case one side will deviate in the future. Because trust is good, but law is better.” There is concern among some member states that the UK is successfully pushing the commission into making concessions that will give British businesses an advantage in the marketplace over the decades to come. Von der Leyen offered assurances that the commission’s negotiating team was being open-minded as to how to bridge the gaps between the two sides, but that they were holding firm on key principles. She called on leaders to back any compromise that emerges. The talks were in their “decisive days”, she said, adding: “It is when we negotiate hard, and then stick to the compromise found that we move forward fast.” EU leaders are due to meet on 10 December. The European parliament is due to hold a special session on 28 December to give its consent to a deal. However, any agreement would need to be finalised in the coming days to allow time for legal and parliamentary scrutiny and translation."
2020-11-25T14:57:23Z,politics,Politics,Sunak offers jam today in spending review as Covid deficit spreads,"Jam tomorrow but no jam today. As devotees of Lewis Carroll know, that was the credo of the White Queen in Alice Through the Looking-Glass. Plenty of chancellors of the exchequer have adopted the frugal White Queen approach but so far Rishi Sunak has not been one of them. He has spent an extra £280bn since the Covid-19 crisis began and is on course to preside over a budget deficit of £394bn this year – comfortably a peacetime record. Indeed, at 19% of national output, the deficit for 2020-21 will not be all that shy of the levels it reached during the two world wars – 27% in 1941-42 and 28% in 1916-17. During the course of the current financial year, the government will have been responsible for 56p of every pound spent in the economy. While spooning out large dollops of jam today, Sunak has talked a lot about how there will be no jam tomorrow but has never quite got round to it.
The chancellor’s spending statement to the Commons was, therefore a first. The jam pot has been taken away from the public sector workers who will face a pay squeeze and from poor people in the developing world as a consequence of a cut in the UK aid budgets. Non-Covid departmental spending next year will be £10bn lower than previously planned. But in truth, the money saved will be small change when set against the colossal spending deemed necessary to combat the economic emergency. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) noted the chancellor had averaged £20bn of extra spending in each of the 14 fiscal events since the start of the crisis. “Each of these would have constituted a substantial budget package in normal times.” Assuming the economy does not take further hits from fresh waves of the pandemic, spending will increase by less in the coming years and borrowing will come down. Yet even by the middle of the decade, the gap between what the state takes in taxes and what it spends will be running at £100bn a year. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, says spending is likely to be higher than planned. He doubts whether £10bn will be cut from non-Covid spending next year, points out that there is no pandemic pencilled in after 2021-22, and notes the growing pressure on the chancellor to continue with the £20-a-week increase in universal credit which is due to expire in the spring. Sunak did not mention Brexit in his speech, but the possibility of the UK and the EU going their separate ways without a trade deal did not escape the OBR. It said such an outcome would reduce output by 2%, putting further upward pressure on borrowing.
Even with a deal, there will be no miracle cure. The OBR’s best guess is that it will take until the end of 2022 for the economy to return to its pre-crisis level and that by the middle of the decade the economy will be 3% smaller than it would otherwise have been. Yet Sunak would say the £280bn is money well spent. Yes, the budget deficit is at the top end of financial market expectations. But the government is having no trouble financing its borrowing, and the money has been spent on emergency funding for the NHS and to prevent even worse scarring. In the early 1980s, when the economy contracted by much less than it will this year, unemployment soared to double-digit percentage levels. This time, it is expected to peak at 7.5%. Still bad, but not nearly as bad as it might have been."
2020-11-25T13:10:52Z,politics,Politics,'We made a promise': fallout from UK's cut in overseas aid remains to be seen,"The former prime minister David Cameron’s political legacy will be permanently dominated by Brexit, an event he misjudged and abhorred. But until now he could at least comfort himself with one positive foreign policy achievement to his name: he was prime minister when the UK for the first time met its goal of spending 0.7% of its gross national income on overseas aid, and also enshrined it in law in 2015, so apparently entrenching Britain’s commitment to the world’s poorest.
It is easy to dismiss Cameron’s commitment to the policy as a piece of clever Tory window dressing – something to which he could point whenever someone shouted “nasty party” at him. But from the opening speech of his bid to be Conservative leader in 2005, aid was a vehicle through which he took the party in a new direction, saying: “When the Conservative party talks about international affairs, it can’t just be Gibraltar and Zimbabwe – we’ve got to show as much passion about Darfur and the millions of people living on less than a dollar a day in sub-Saharan Africa, who are getting poorer while we are getting richer.” It was at one level an acceptance of the Blair-Brown settlement on the importance of helping Africa, symbolised by the G8 summit in Gleneagles and the Live 8 concerts in the summer of 2005. Once in office, and austerity had struck in the wake of the financial crash in 2008, Cameron chose to make an issue of defending the aid target from relentless tabloid assault. At a largely routine press conference, at the close of the G8 meeting in Deauville in 2011, he was challenged by a reporter from the Daily Mail as to why the G8’s own reports showed only the UK was so naive as to meet its overseas aid targets. Cameron suddenly came alight, saying: “I think what people think about these summits is that frankly a bunch of people in suits get together, make some promises, particularly to the world’s poorest, and then go in and have a good lunch and forget about the promises. “I am not going to do that. We made a promise. I remember where I was during Live Aid in 1985. If we are going to try to get across to the poorest people in the world that we care about their plight and we want them to join one world with the rest of us, we have got to make promises and keep promises.” His pitch was entirely patriotic. National pride was measured not just by military hardware, but whether Britain pitched up when it came to the big crises, “whether hurricanes or earthquakes or tsunamis or pandemics”. He matched that by appointing two committed international development secretaries, Andrew Mitchell and Justine Greening. Since his departure, the department has churned through five different secretaries of state, some of whom spent much of their time wishing they were somewhere else, running an independent foreign policy or briefing rightwing media about how they were going to crack down on waste. Nevertheless, by 2019 the total aid budget was £15.2bn, representing about 1.7% of total public spending, a larger proportion than ever. Since 2015, the budget has been under relentless attack. The proportion of the aid budget spent by departments other than DfID rose, leading to claims that the spending was either less transparent or less focused on poverty alleviation. By this summer, Boris Johnson – who had always wanted to subsume DfID into the Foreign Office – got his way. Critics of the now merged departments will point to the fact that at the first time of asking, the Foreign Office was unable, or unwilling, to defend the aid budget from a twin attack mounted by the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence. The issue now is whether Johnson or the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will suffer any political damage either internationally or domestically for dumping this manifesto pledge. Conservative whips claim cutting the aid budget may not be popular in some leafy Tory suburbs, but in the “red wall” areas, this is red meat for some working-class voters who want the government “to look after number one”. Internationally, it will not be easy for the French or Germans to complain since they only spent 0.44% and 0.6% respectively in 2019. If socialist Spain starts kicking up, they are on 0.21%. The UK, in reality, has been an outlier along with the Scandinavians. But that, arguably, is precisely the point. British exceptionalism is too often traded in nostalgic or defunct coinage, but the commitment to help the world’s poorest, and to spend the money transparently and efficiently, was presented as a central part of the modern British identity, along with the other intangibles that make soft power. It is part of who we are, as argued by Cameron. Finally, it would also be an invaluable tool for the UK in the battles ahead hosting the UN climate crisis summit. John Kerry, the new US climate emergency tsar, said on leaving the Senate in 2013 that he was conscious his credibility as a diplomat in foreign capitals rested to a large degree on what happened in the US capitol. Nothing persuades more, he said, than leadership by example."
2020-11-25T13:09:16Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson dismisses bullying and leak concerns as 'trivia',"Boris Johnson has accused Keir Starmer of focusing on “trivia” and “pathetic lines of attack” after the Labour leader challenged him in the Commons on allegations of bullying in government, wasting taxpayers’ money and conflicts of interest. In an often bad-tempered prime minister’s questions, Starmer referred to a foreword written by Johnson to the ministerial code – the rules of conduct in government – and accused Johnson of breaking a series of pledges within it. The foreword said there must be no bullying or harassment, no leaking, no misuse of taxpayers’ money and no conflicts of interest, Starmer noted. “That’s five promises in two sentences. How many of those promises does the prime minister think his ministers have kept?”
After Johnson avoided the question, merely saying his ministers were “doing an outstanding job”, Starmer started to lead the PM through each promise in turn. He first asked Johnson why he had kept Priti Patel as home secretary, after a report by his independent adviser on standards – who later resigned – concluded that she had bullied staff. “I make no apology for standing by a home secretary who is getting on with delivering the people’s priorities,” Johnson replied, adding that Patel had shown a “steely determination” in her work.
After Starmer then asked about what he called “serial leaking” on Covid restrictions, and suggested this was causing anxiety to the public, Johnson accused Starmer of concentrating on trivia. Starmer then challenged Johnson on the amount of public money spent on personal protective equipment that could not be used. Johnson said Starmer was using “pathetic lines of attack”. The prime minister added: “He just seems to be attacking the government for shifting heaven and earth, as we did, to get the medicines, to get the PPE, to get the equipment, to get the treatments that this country needed.” Starmer asked Johnson about claims that contractors with government connections had been preferred for Covid-related contracts, and the appointment of friends and contacts to public roles. “I think it’s a clean sweep: bullying, harassment, leaking, wasting public money, and obvious conflicts of interest,” Starmer said. “It’s the same old story: one rule for the British public, another for the prime minister and his friends. “Just look at the contrast in his attitude towards spraying public money to contracts that don’t deliver, and his attitudes to pay rises for the key workers who kept the country going during this pandemic.” Johnson accused Starmer of having a “deep, underlying hatred of the private sector” and wanting to instead impose a “deranged form of state control”."
2020-11-25T12:51:57Z,politics,Politics,Spending review 2020: Rishi Sunak’s key points at a glance,"Sunak’s opening remarks Rishi Sunak says the spending review comes as the coronavirus health emergency is not over and the economic emergency has only just begun. Saying he will prioritise jobs, businesses and public services, the chancellor says the government is spending £280bn to get the country through Covid-19. Next year, the government will allocate an initial £18bn in response. There will be £3bn for the NHS, £2bn for keeping transport running, £3bn to local councils, and extra £250m to end rough sleeping. Total funding to tackle coronavirus will be £55bn, he says. Peter Walker, political correspondent: An inevitably downbeat opening by the chancellor, who says that while the Covid-19 health emergency continues, “our economic emergency has only just begun”. Yes, he says, there is spending coming, but the immediate message is clear: it’s time for the tough chancellor.
Growth The chancellor says forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) show the economy will contract by 11.3% this year, the biggest decline in three centuries. Sunak says it will take until the end of 2022 for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size. GDP will grow by 5.5% next year, 6.6% in 2022, 2.3% in 2023, 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025. In July, the OBR said its “central scenario” was for a 12.4% plunge in gross domestic product (GDP) this year. This compares with estimates made at the start of November from the Bank of England for an 11% fall in 2020. PW: There’s no easy way to deliver this news, and Sunak doesn’t sugar-coat it. There will be “long-term scarring” as late as 2025, he says. No chancellor would relish handing out forecasts like this – but it does give Sunak significant political cover for any tough spending decisions to come. Borrowing Sunak says the budget deficit will be £394bn this year, or 19% of GDP – the highest level in peacetime. Borrowing will remain at £164bn next year and remains at about £100bn for the remainder of the forecast. In July, the OBR estimated a budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income – of £322bn for 2020-21. The OBR had previously estimated the national debt – the sum total of every budget deficit – of £2.2tn in 2020-21, or 104.1% of GDP. PW: It’s not exactly natural ground for a Conservative chancellor to defend this level of borrowing and Sunak takes a politely defensive tone, stressing that this was “an economic emergency”, and that to not act would have caused significantly more damage.
Public sector pay Pay rises for the public sector will be paused next year, with an exemption for more than 1 million nurses and doctors in the NHS. 2.1 million public sector workers who earn below the median wage of £24,000 will be guaranteed a pay rise of at least £250. Sunak says he cannot justify a significant across-the-board pay increase for public sector workers, to protect public sector jobs and ensure fairness between the public and private sectors. The chancellor says the national living wage will be increased to £8.91 an hour, and extended to over-21s. Overall unemployment is forecast to peak next year at 7.5%. PW: A public sector pay freeze for all but medical NHS staff had been long trailed, and critics will inevitably contrast this with the lockdown applause for key workers. Sunak couches this as an issue of fairness against the private sector – and pulls out the surprise of some possible pay rises for the lowest-paid. A hurdle dodged? The details will be crucial. Departmental spending Sunak says day-to-day departmental spending will rise in real terms by 3.8%, the fastest growth rate in 15 years. He says in cash terms, this will be an increase of £14.8bn on current levels. The government will match EU funding for regional development after Brexit, he says. Funding for communities to pilot programmes will be made next year. The core health budget will grow by £6.6bn. The chancellor says this will help to hire 50,000 new nurses. The schools budget will increase by £2.2bn. PW: Sunak, usually a fairly pithy chancellor, spends quite some time labouring the point that overall spending will rise. Why? To try to see off accusations of a return to austerity, an idea the government has promised to banish, and which is now seen as politically toxic. Again, not natural Conservative territory, but coronavirus (among other factors) means the usual party rules don’t apply.
Overseas aid Sunak says the government will cut the overseas aid budget to 0.5% in 2021, allocating £10bn at this spending review. The intention is to return to 0.7% “when the fiscal situation allows”. The chancellor says during a “domestic fiscal emergency” sticking rigidly to spending the international commitment of 0.7% on overseas aid is difficult to justify to the British people. PW: Sunak’s announcement on aid sees Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, nod furiously on the benches next to Suak, but is heard in virtual silence by the Commons. This is a very politically tricky moment, as shown by the amount of time Sunak uses justifying it. A lot of Tory MPs are angry. The change potentially requires a Commons vote, and there is no guarantee the government will win. This one, as they say, could run and run. Infrastructure and levelling up Sunak says investment in infrastructure will total £100bn next year, with plans to deliver the highest levels of sustained investment in 40 years. He confirms plans to launch a new infrastructure bank, to be headquartered in the north of England. The chancellor announces a new £4bn fund for “levelling up”, to which any local area can bid for the funding of local projects. PW: Sunak’s “levelling-up fund” is clearly intended as the good news at the end of a difficult statement and is likely to prove popular – as well as very on-message. But councils might say that in the context of a decade-plus of underspending on local government, £4bn might prove to be not that much. Expect Labour to keep an eye on whether, as with the earlier towns fund, a mysteriously high proportion of the money ends up going to marginal Conservative seats."

2020-11-25T06:00:19Z,politics,Politics,What will be in Rishi  Sunak's mini-budget?,"Rishi Sunak is set to deliver one of the toughest spending review statements in modern history with the economy in the deepest recession on record amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here is what to expect from the chancellor’s mini-budget on Wednesday. Economic outlook New forecasts from the government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are expected to show the UK’s economy is heading for the biggest decline in more than 300 years in 2020, with a drop in gross domestic product (GDP) of more than 10%. The chancellor could draw some comfort because the forecasts probably won’t be as bad as the OBR expected earlier this year, when it pencilled in a 13% decline in GDP for 2020. But after a rapid summer rebound, the second wave and return to lockdown will result in a double-dip recession this winter. Slightly better bad news is still bad news. Meanwhile, the watchdog is expected to forecast rising unemployment next year – despite the extension of furlough – and a degree of long-term scarring for the economy, with the UK taking several years to return to its pre-pandemic economic peak. Public finances Providing a dramatic backdrop to the chancellor’s spending decisions, the latest figures from the OBR are expected to forecast a budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income – of about £400bn this year, as spending on the Covid crisis balloons and tax receipts evaporate. More than twice the size of the deficit incurred during the 2008 financial crisis, Sunak is expected to use these figures to argue “hard choices” must be made to balance the books – despite the International Monetary Fund calling for growth rather than austerity in response to Covid-19. The chancellor could set out a longer-term vision for fixing the public finances, including through higher taxes. Changes are unlikely to be announced until the spring, but could include a hike in capital gains tax after a government review. Road pricing could also be used to plug the hole left by fuel taxes, after bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars to 2030. Public sector pay squeeze The chancellor is expected to say savings are required to fund spending elsewhere. Top of the list is likely to be a renewed public sector pay squeeze – enraging unions and hitting workers on the frontline of the pandemic. Echoing his predecessor, George Osborne, Sunak will argue this is fair because public sector pay has held up better than private sector wages. However, the return to pay restraint comes after a decade of austerity that has left public sector pay 1.5% lower after accounting for inflation, and at the lowest level relative to the private sector in decades. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says public sector workers can expect no more than 1% next year. The Centre for Policy Studies, a free-market thinktank whose director helped write the 2019 Conservative manifesto, argues a three-year pay freeze would save a total £23bn. Sunak could also put the brakes on the government plan to increase the national living wage, which would be another blow for low-income households. Ahead of the 2019 election the Conservatives had promised to end low pay by raising the legal wage floor to two-thirds of median earnings by 2024. However, the strategy has an “emergency brake” clause that can be applied during times of economic stress. Levelling up In an attempt to reset the government’s agenda and provide a vision for the UK economy beyond the Covid pandemic, billions of pounds for infrastructure projects are expected to be announced to meet the government’s “levelling-up” agenda. Sunak will earmark £1.6bn for local roads aimed at fixing potholes, congestion pinch-points and other upgrades, drawn from a £600bn commitment made at the March budget. Plans to move civil servants to the north of England will also be confirmed. The delayed national infrastructure strategy, which sets out the government’s priorities for major public works, will be published, and changes will be made to the Treasury green book, which guides spending decisions, to boost investment outside of London and the south-sast of England. Sunak will also set out the government’s plan to replace EU funding spent in struggling parts of the country. An additional £151m will be provided for tackling homelessness. However, Sunak is under pressure to increase funding for local authority budgets, with councils across the country close to breaking point. Covid and Brexit The pandemic and end of the Brexit transition on 31 December will dominate the next few months – and both will involve costs. Expectations are on Sunak to find funds for the NHS, test and trace, protective equipment and the mass delivery of vaccines when they become available. The chancellor had already committed to extending the furlough scheme until the end of March, in a spending commitment costing billions of pounds. However, businesses are calling for additional steps to be made to support the economy. Whitehall departments will also need money as they take on extra post-Brexit responsibilities. Job creation and welfare support As many as 9.6m jobs in total have been furloughed at a cost of more £40bn since the start of the flagship wage subsidy scheme in March, keeping millions of people in work who risked losing their jobs during lockdown. Aiming to prevent a return to the 1980s when unemployment hit a post-war high under the Thatcher government, the chancellor will use the spending review to plough more money into job creation. Sunak will pump £2.9bn into a new three-year “restart” scheme to help more than 1 million unemployed people look for work. Those out of a job for more than 12 months will get help with regular, intensive support. A further £1.4bn will also be ploughed into the Job Centre network. Attention will, however, also be focused on universal credit, with the chancellor under pressure to maintain the temporary £20 per week increase in the benefit system made earlier this year, which is due to be cut again from April. Sunak has also been lobbied to scrap the pensions-triple lock to save money. Aid budget Boris Johnson’s £16.5bn defence budget settlement, designed to strengthen UK power overseas, is set to be confirmed in the spending review. However, there is speculation that cuts to the overseas aid budget could be made to save money, in a development experts warn could damage the nation’s international standing. The UK has a legal commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas development. But there is a get-out clause in times of exceptional economic circumstances, including when there is a substantial fall in national income. The aid budget was set to shrink anyway by about £1.5bn as a result of the recession. Cutting it from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP would probably save a further £3bn-4bn and delight the right of the Conservative party who have long campaigned for a cut."
2020-11-24T20:05:13Z,politics,Politics,"UK facing risk of 'systemic economic crisis', official paper says","The government has privately admitted the UK faces an increased likelihood of “systemic economic crisis” as it completes its exit from the European Union in the middle of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. A confidential Cabinet Office briefing seen by the Guardian also warns of a “notable risk” that in coming months the country could face a perfect storm of simultaneous disasters, including the prospect of a bad flu season on top of the medical strains caused by Covid. “Winter 2020 could see a combination of severe flooding, pandemic influenza, a novel emerging infectious disease and coordinated industrial action, against a backdrop of the end of the [Brexit] transition period,” it warns.
The briefing, marked “official sensitive” and dated September, lays out for government planners the possible impacts of the last stage of Brexit, detailing “reasonable worst case scenarios” across 20 different areas of national life from oil and healthcare to travel and policing. It also summarises Whitehall’s views on the current state of the nation to provide context for those warnings, depicting a country struggling to overcome difficulties posed by one crisis, yet bracing for a second, as all departments are told to prepare for a “no deal” departure. Global and British food supply chains will be disrupted by “circumstances occurring concurrently at the end of the year”, the paper warns. Stockpiles built up at the end of 2019 were diminished during the pandemic and cannot easily be replenished. There will not be overall food shortages but problems could reduce availability of some fresh supplies and push up prices. Low income groups will be most at risk of food insecurity if there is a no-deal Brexit, including single parents, children in large families and those with disabilities.
Economic chaos could raise the risks of a breakdown in public order and a national mental health crisis, while reducing the “financial levers” available for the government to respond to other risks, this description of “planning assumptions” warns. There may also be an increase in “community tensions” and public disorder. Police tracked increases in Brexit-related hate crime in March 2019 and the end of that year – two other periods of intensive political and public focus on leaving the EU, the briefing notes. The Cabinet Office said it did not comment on the contents of leaked documents, but said it was part of “intensive planning” to support individuals and citizens at the end of the transition period. “As a responsible government we continue to make extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios, including the reasonable worst case. This is not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a stretching scenario. It reflects a responsible government ensuring we are ready for all eventualities,” a spokesperson said. The threats of disruption to essential services, and analysts’ confidence in their assessments are ranked by a traffic light system – red, amber and green. Areas marked as high or moderate concern include public disorder, law enforcement, “impact on low economic groups”, adult social care and food and water supplies. The projections incorporate some of the details revealed when “Operation Yellowhammer” contingency plans for a no-deal exit leaked last year. But the new scenarios go even further. Many problems identified then have been magnified by the impact of a costly and devastating pandemic and the briefing includes warnings of a “high degree of change” regardless of whether Britain can agree a trade deal with Europe. Some of the starkest descriptions are reserved for the health and social care sectors. “The pandemic has and will continue to limit the capacity of the health and care sector to prepare for and respond to the end of the transition period,” it warns, noting expectations of a “sustained level of system disruption from November until at least April”. Adult social care provision is a particular concern with the civil service admitting it is “acutely aware” of the risk posed by potential labour shortages caused by Brexit, because of reliance on EU citizens and a workforce already stretched by pandemic controls. The government had not expected Brexit to cause a major change in this area, but an increase in inflation that pushes up staff and supply costs “may lead to provider failure”. A drop in imports of medicines is also flagged as a serious potential problem, with “a reasonable worst case flow rate of 60-80% of current levels”, putting patient safety at risk. However, in October the government announced ferry freight contracts worth nearly £80m, to ensure medicines and other vital supplies continue to reach the UK. Second wave The scenarios assume “significant winter resurgence” of Covid with cases increasing through October and November – exactly the trajectory the country was on before the second national lockdown, though there is evidence infections are now falling. Controls to combat this new rise in cases may “severely damage” the economy. “Recovery is negligible; consumer and investor confidence remains low in the longer term; international trade is severely disrupted,” the description of fallout from a surge of infections warns. The government may struggle to get help from the private sector, as the pandemic has left many of the UK’s businesses with diminished capacity to deal with any financial shock caused by Brexit. “Companies are more fragile across many sectors and this will have an impact on business readiness and vulnerability towards the end of the transition period,” the document says. “The likelihood of commercial failures, including of major government contractors, has increased,” while smaller companies may be “harder to reach and slower to act”. Local council finances are particularly shaky. “The level of sustained activity over 2020 at the local level has resulted in a lack of institutional capacity to absorb and implement the required changes for the end of the transition period” the document warned. Five per cent of them are at risk of financial failure in the wake of Covid-19, even after government support, and a no-deal Brexit could mean even higher demand on their services. The most vulnerable could need support from the military, or extra aid from the central government “especially if local responders find resources diverted to concurrent emergencies”. Other concerns include shortages of chemicals needed to treat the water supply and veterinary medicines essential to the food chain. These “are now depleted” and British manufacturing capacity has been reduced because of Covid. Other fresh problems flagged up in the report include a potential 10 to 20% increase in travel insurance premiums for holidaymakers heading to the continent, now the European Union health insurance card is not valid, and people with pre-existing conditions may struggle to get coverage. Covid may also have complicated people’s plans to move, either to or from the UK, leading to people losing access to social security cover, without any agreement to cover them. In the UK vulnerable people who have not correctly completed their paperwork, but have struggled to access help during the pandemic, could also be cut off from support."
2020-11-24T18:45:04Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak to launch £3bn unemployment support plan,"Rishi Sunak will lay bare the government’s fears over the long-lasting impact of a looming winter surge in unemployment when he unveils a new £4.3bn package of support to help the jobless find work. On the eve of the publication of the Treasury’s spending allocations for the coming year, the chancellor announced plans for a £2.9bn Restart scheme designed to aid a million workers with their job searches. Sunak’s concern that the Covid-induced collapse in the economy will leave deep scars on the UK’s workforce was underlined by his decision to make funds available for the scheme for three years from 2021-2. On top of Restart, the chancellor will provide a further £1.4bn to increase the capacity of Jobcentre Plus – the government’s support service for the unemployed. Sunak will tell MPs that tens of billions of government spending on infrastructure projects will create and protect hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. But new forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will show that the current four-week lockdown in England together with tougher autumn restrictions elsewhere in the UK have left the economy on course for its biggest contraction in three centuries and public borrowing unprecedented in peacetime. As a result of the gloomier jobs outlook, Sunak has decided to expand his Kickstart job placement scheme for the under-25s, providing an additional £1.6bn on top of the original £2bn investment. The Treasury said the money would provide up to 250,000 government-subsidised jobs in 2021-2. Other measures to boost employment will include the extension of the apprenticeship hiring incentive, which offers employers up to £2,000 for every new apprentice they hire, and a £375m package to support skills. The chancellor is also expected to announce that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will be relocated outside London. Sunak said: “My number one priority is to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. “This spending review will ensure hundreds of thousands of jobs are supported and protected in the acute phase of this crisis and beyond with a multibillion package of investment to ensure that no one is left without hope or opportunity.” Matthew Fell, the CBI’s UK chief policy director, said: “The scarring effects of long-term unemployment are all too real, so the sooner more people can get back into work the better.” Plans for a budget and a three-year spending plan were abandoned as it became clear that a second wave of the pandemic would bring an end to a summer economic recovery. The one-year spending round will be the latest in a series of mini-budgets since the summer designed to shield individuals and businesses from decisions that have seen large chunks of the economy closed or restricted in order to promote social distancing. Sunak will tell the Commons that the government has spent unprecedented sums since March – including paying the wages of 9.6 million workers who were furloughed and the 2.5 million self-employed people who were eligible for state support. He will also insist that extra money for the NHS and other Whitehall departments, together with the increase in capital spending, shows that there is no intention to return to austerity. But, with the OBR set to forecast a budget deficit this year in excess of £350bn, the chancellor will use a public sector pay freeze to signal the need eventually to rein in spending and reduce borrowing. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: “The chancellor’s irresponsible choices this year have wasted billions, have left us with the worst economic downturn in the G7 and pushed hundreds of thousands into unemployment. “We now need a relentless focus on jobs and growth, and responsible choices to get the economy back on its feet again.”"

The NHS should routinely test people for illnesses such as seasonal flu once the coronavirus pandemic has passed, Matt Hancock has said, adding that he wants to end the UKâ€™s culture of â€œsoldiering onâ€� and going to work while ill, infecting others. The UK has recorded 608 further coronavirus deaths - the highest daily total since early May - although case numbers are continuing to fall, the latest government figures show. (See 4.35pm.) The government will be forced to rely on Labour support to pass new tiered coronavirus restrictions in England with about 70 MPs believed to be considering rebelling when the measures are put to parliament next week. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, acted unlawfully in removing safeguards for children in care at the start of the Covid pandemic without consulting childrenâ€™s rights organisations, the court of appeal has ruled.

2020-11-24T18:19:25Z,politics,Politics,Trial of Brexit border checks causes five-mile lorry queues in Kent,"Queues of trucks stretching for five miles unexpectedly built up in Kent on Tuesday after the French started a trial of post-Brexit checks. Lorries on their way across the English channel were forced to stop in long lines up to junction 11 on the M20 as they tried to approach the Eurotunnel entrance just outside Folkestone and the Port of Dover.
The queues give a glimpse of things to come in January whether a deal is reached or not with the government last month warning of queues of 7,000 lorries on the main motorway routes to both Eurotunnel and Dover ferries in the worst-case scenario. The delays were caused after the Police Aux Frontières, the equivalent to Border Force, rehearsed new immigration procedures. Under the Le Touquet agreement, French authorities conduct immigration checks at the UK side of the tunnel and the port.
A spokesman for Highways England said they had been told a new trial software for border checks, with all HGVs been checked from 6am until 3pm, was responsible for the delay. “On a conference call chaired by Kent Police at 16.00 we were informed that the trial has now finished and traffic is now free flowing within the port. The queue of HGVs is backed up to around M20 J11, but we expect this to start to ease given the trial is no longer operational,” said the spokesman. Eurotunnel and Port of Dover was also on the call. The controls require truck drivers to provide passports, and are asked about proof of means, their destination and length of stay which can last up to 70 seconds per passenger. After January truck drivers, will also face additional delays for checks on food, drink and agricultural products and customs in both directions.
However, the UK government has said it will phase these checks on the British side over six weeks to reduce the chances of gridlock in Dover and on Kent roads One source said the dry run caused delays because the French had not deployed enough staff needed for a live operation and once properly resourced more lanes would be open to help ease the congestion. The delays will also concern the UK haulage and customs sector which has warned the government repeatedly about the delays in key British software which will not be available until December. Last week Kent county council also expressed worries over the welfare of animals that could be stuck in lorries in the event of a standstill. “We do have concerns over the impact the road system will have, and particularly the impact on animals in transit,” said Steve Rock, head of trading standards. The council is looking to double the number of trading standards officers from six to 12 to cope with Brexit checks and are concerned that routine deliveries of veterinary medicine to farms and getting animals off farms to markets are not disrupted by Brexit.
Tuesday’s Brexit tests come a day after the UK government confirmed it would be shipping portaloos to the motorways as a “reactive” plan when long queues occur. It decided against installing them on a longer term basis because of risk of drivers needing a convenience break stopping to use them when traffic is flowing at normal levels. The Department for Transport is looking to hire private contractors to assist Kent Police in managing the traffic although the local police have said if any extra workers are brought in they would not be involved in any enforcement action."
2020-11-24T16:48:19Z,politics,Politics,Guided? Followed? Down the Covid rabbit hole with Hancock | John Crace,"There must be many times when Matt Hancock wonders what he has done in a previous life to deserve his present one. Come to think of it, there are many times when most of us must wonder what we have done in a previous life to deserve Matt Hancock. The health secretary’s life is now one of non-stop misery where he is called upon to explain stuff about the coronavirus that is little more than hope and guesswork on his part. Only on Monday, on what he had imagined was a day off, he was forced to ad lib for Boris Johnson in the Commons for 45 minutes when the Downing Street communications nerve centre went mute. On Tuesday, Hancock was back for a two-hour “lessons learned” interrogation . Sadly this wasn’t to be an extended therapy session for the more profound, existential questions of Door Matt’s psyche. So we never found out whether he had learned his lesson in hubris, and would never again allow his ambition to exceed his capabilities. Just when the country needed a really able health secretary, we’ve got someone whose enthusiasm and patter would have seen him rise to be the manager of an upmarket car showroom. Not that Matt isn’t a trier. No one can deny that he means well – even when he’s clearly out of his depth – and that’s what makes him such a figure of pathos. But even Hancock is beginning to fray around the edges. Back in the day, he could be relied on to be a Tigger, full of boundless optimism and energy, but now he’s beginning to look defensive and knackered; torn between not wanting to be thought to have failed and longing for the day when the prime minister moves him sideways into a less stressful job. So the early exchanges between Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the select committee, and Door Matt were decidedly tetchy. After the briefest of acknowledgements that hope was on the distant horizon in the form of three potential vaccines, Hunt asked Hancock if he had always followed the science. “I prefer to say that we were always guided by the science,” Matt said. “But you did used to say you were following the science,” Hunt observed. “I was merely being colloquial on those occasions,” Hancock snapped. Now we were slipping down a semantic rabbit hole. One in which it was unclear if the government was following the science when it got things right and was guided by the science when it screwed up. Or vice versa. Not even Door Matt could quite think his way out of that one, as his answer to whether we locked down too late in March was that we had actually locked down earlier in the curve compared with some European countries. Which didn’t really answer the questions of why some Asian countries managed the pandemic without a lockdown using a working system of community test, track and trace and why we hadn’t taken the mounting numbers of body bags in Italy as some kind of warning to act sooner. You get the feeling that it is still a complete mystery to Hancock why the UK has the highest mortality count in Europe. The health secretary also struggled to explain why Sage had described the test-and-trace system, which had already cost £12bn, as having only a marginal effect. The best he could come up with was that Sage must have been talking about one particular rogue tracer and that it would be wrong for anyone to necessarily believe the statistics that his own department put out. “One of the lessons we’ve learned is that you must hit the disease hard and hit it early,” Door Matt said forcibly. At which point most people’s jaws dropped, because it was only too obvious this was something both he and the government had failed to do. Rather than accepting Sage’s advice for a two-week circuit breaker in September, he had persisted with a three-tiered regional approach that had been proved to be ineffective. Hancock was soon tying himself in knots: first arguing that a two-week circuit breaker would not have been enough, then grumpily insisting that the four-week later lockdown was definitely going to work – even if it didn’t and had been introduced too late. By now it was again unclear whether Matt was following the science or being guided by it. Or whether he was following the incompetence or being guided by it.
Like the loyal Tories they are, neither Hunt nor the joint committee chair, Greg Clark, were too keen to explore whether one of the lessons learned might be that handing out expensive contracts to friends of friends could be a waste of government money during a pandemic, so this subject was largely avoided. Though Hancock did quite reasonably say that he had no regrets about spending £44,000 on pizza for staff working round the clock. Just a shame he hadn’t taken the same humane stance on free school meals during holidays. The Conservative Luke Evans was keen to end the session on a high. Surely there must have been some good things we had learned from the whole sorry mess? We had kept the schools open second time round, Door Matt said. Good, everyone nodded. Anything else? “Yes,” yelled Hancock. It was time for Brits to break the habit of soldiering on into work and learn to take more time off. So once the coronavirus pandemic was under control he wanted to keep all the testing centres open so that even someone with a hint of a sniffle could go along and get diagnosed as having a cold and be signed off sick. I’m not sure that’s quite the lesson the NHS hoped to learn from the pandemic."
2020-11-24T16:08:27Z,politics,Politics,"Gavin Williamson unlawfully removed child safeguards in pandemic, court rules","The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, acted unlawfully in removing safeguards for children in care at the start of the Covid pandemic without consulting children’s rights organisations, the court of appeal has ruled. The children’s rights charity Article 39 launched a legal challenge after the Department for Education removed or diluted 65 separate legal protections, designed to safeguard the 78,000 children in care in England, during lockdown last April. They included timescales for social worker visits to children in care, six-monthly reviews of children’s welfare, independent scrutiny of children’s homes, and oversight of adoption decision-making for babies and children. The DfE argued it had taken swift action to bring in temporary changes during a national crisis. The judgment, which was handed down on Tuesday, said Williamson should have consulted the children’s commissioner for England, as well as other bodies representing the rights of children in care, before introducing the changes through the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) regulations 2020. “It was manifestly in the interests of the vulnerable children who would be most affected by the proposed amendments that those agencies and organisations representing the rights and interests of children in care should be consulted,” concluded Lord Justice Baker, sitting with Lord Justice Henderson and Lord Justice Underhill. The high court had previously ruled in the government’s favour. Allowing the appeal, the judges granted a declaration that “the secretary of state acted unlawfully by failing to consult the children’s commissioner and other bodies representing the rights of children in care before introducing the [legal changes]”. Welcoming the judgment, Carolyne Willow, Article 39’s director, said: “The government’s actions were shameful, both in the scale of the protections they took away from very vulnerable children in England and the way they went about it.” The DfE meanwhile expressed disappointment. A spokesperson said: “Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and our intention has always been to act in their best interests at every stage. “We took swift action to bring in temporary changes during a national crisis, all of which have now expired. We will continue working with the children’s commissioner and children’s charities to provide the best possible support to vulnerable children.” The shadow minister for children and early years, Tulip Siddiq, said the judgment was further proof of the education secretary’s incompetence. She said: “He must now come to parliament and apologise for acting unlawfully and letting down the most vulnerable children.” Meanwhile, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools in England has told the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) that addressing the pandemic has been a “gigantic priority”, pushing every other priority down the list. Amanda Spielman said school attendance had been particularly low among groups of children known to be vulnerable, and some of the normal checks and balances might be compromised as a result of the conditions under which schools and others were working. Referring to children with special educational needs and disabilities, she told the inquiry: “I would express concern that safeguarding for those children in particular is unusually weak, though not necessarily as a result of a fault by the school but because of the constraints we are all under.” Helen Humphreys, Ofsted’s specialist adviser for residential care, said some parents were not sending their children to residential special schools because of fears they were not “Covid secure”. “Some parents don’t feel confident enough that their children will be safe enough if they send them back overnight and a lot of the schools have had to reduce the number of children they accommodate,” she added. “The offer is much reduced for children in residential special schools and short break settings. The children who perhaps need to be in those settings are not getting that level of offer.” Spielman told the inquiry Ofsted was not always getting the level of information required about schools from the government and other agencies even though, for example, her body always passed on complaints about independent schools to the DfE. “There is an enormous web of information which we are not necessarily or consistently able to tap into,” she said, adding that this had also been affected by the strong policy emphasis around privacy and data in recent years. “The very heavy regime operated by the information commissioner also makes it genuinely difficult for people to know what they can properly record and share.” Humphreys and John Kennedy, Ofsted’s regional director for London, told the inquiry of occasions when schools had told inspectors, wrongly, that they could not view pupils’ records. Many staff had also been reluctant to note things down or had done so in a very limited way, meaning there was a limited paper trail for inspectors to follow."
2020-11-24T15:09:21Z,politics,Politics,PM's ethics adviser queries Johnson's role in Priti Patel inquiry,"Boris Johnson’s adviser on ethical standards has questioned whether the prime minister should maintain sole responsibility for the ministerial code days after an outcry over the decision not to sack Priti Patel for bullying staff. Jonathan Evans, the chair of the committee on standards in public life, said the PM having sole discretion over both launching investigations and deciding to punish an errant minister risked looking like “marking your own homework”. His remarks come after Johnson was accused of double standards after telling ministers there was “no place for bullying” in the wake of a damning report into the behaviour of the home secretary. Johnson refused to sack Patel on Friday despite an inquiry by his adviser Sir Alex Allan that concluded she had broken the ministerial code. The prime minister has sole power both to trigger investigations into wrongdoing by ministers, and to decide on what action, if any, to take.
Johnson’s decision not to sack Patel set a new precedent because previous ministers who have been found to have broken the code have been sacked or resigned from office. Lord Evans, a former head of MI5, told parliament’s standards committee he was to take evidence on whether to hand both the powers to an independent body similar to those that have been introduced in parliament. “The triggering of an investigation rests solely with the prime minister. The decision on what action to take about that also rests entirely with the prime minister. “In the same way that adjudicating those same issues in the Commons or the Lords looks as though you are marking your own homework, the same concerns could be expressed about the way the ministerial code works,” he said. “There is a problem here … the ministerial code does not have the same independent process which supports the Commons’ code [of conduct] and I think that is an issue which has been overtaken. “Increasingly – we have seen it in the Commons, we have seen it in the Lords and we have seen it elsewhere – an independent element has been introduced. So there is a kind of mismatch between the expectations of what you would deliver from the Commons and what you get from the ministerial code. “So I think there’s a question to be asked about whether there should be more independence, whether the investigative element should be triggered independently, potentially and then there’s the separate but parallel issue of what the response to the actual investigation should be.” Lord Evans said the public would be confused by the fact that allegations of bullying by MPs are investigated by an independent panel, but allegations of bullying by ministers are not. “If bullying is treated in one particular way for MPs in their parliamentary role then why would you want to handle it differently in their ministerial role?” He also suggested there should be more options for punishing ministers who break the code, rather than simply whether or not to sack them. “At the moment it’s rather a binary thing, either you get virtually nothing, really, or you have to resign,” he said. On Friday, Johnson refused to sack Patel after Allan’s inquiry concluded she had broken the ministerial code following bullying allegations across three government departments. Allan, the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards, resigned from his post after Johnson contradicted his report by vigorously defending the home secretary and keeping her in her role.
One of the justifications Johnson used for defending Patel was the element of Allan’s report that said she had been unaware of the impact of her behaviour because no Home Office official had complained about her. Sources have said, however, that Allan sought to interview the former top Home Office civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam, who resigned after clashing with Patel, but government officials blocked him. Offering what she described as an “unreserved, fulsome apology”, Patel has seized on Allan’s finding that she had received no feedback on the impact of her behaviour. Rutnam, who is suing Patel for wrongful dismissal under whistleblowing laws, issued a statement on Friday that said she was advised not to shout and swear at staff the month after her appointment in 2019, and that he had told her to treat staff with respect “on further occasions”."
2020-11-24T11:03:05Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn-supporting Labour members stage NEC mass walkout,"Leftwing members of Labour’s governing body have staged a mass walkout in protest of the actions of the Labour leadership, including the election of a key ally of Keir Starmer as the body’s chair. The Guardian understands 13 members of the national executive committee (NEC) – including senior members of the trade unions Unite and the FBU, as well as constituency representatives including the ex-MP Laura Pidcock – staged a pre-planned walkout in protest of the election of MP Margaret Beckett as NEC chair. A number of leftwing members of the NEC have expressed outrage at Starmer’s decision to withhold the whip from the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after comments he made in the wake of a report by the equality watchdog into antisemitism in the party.
The Corbyn-supporting bloc on the NEC – which now has a majority supportive of Starmer’s leadership – has been further angered by a decision to suspend the system of a rotating chairmanship of the body. The move allowed Beckett, the former Labour deputy leader, to be elected chair instead of the FBU’s Ian Murray, who was due to take on the role after having served as vice-chair. Murray was among 14 NEC members who signed a letter to the general secretary, David Evans, which was highly critical of Starmer’s leadership and criticised the “political interference” in the decision to suspend the whip from Corbyn after his suspension from the party was lifted by an NEC disciplinary panel. In a second letter to Evans released after the walkout, the 13 members repeated their request that Evans “admonish Starmer for his decision to undermine the role of the NEC by withdrawing the whip from Jeremy Corbyn”. They said the “longstanding protocol” was for the vice-chair to be elected to the head of the body. “This is not protocol and is another example of the leader promoting factional division within Labour,” the letter said. “The leader’s decision to again promote factionalism comes at a time when the historic relationship with trade unions is under tremendous strain,” the letter said. The letter said the 13 members were not intending to resign from the NEC and would return to future meetings “to be the legitimate voice of the membership and to continue to demand that the party unite and reject the current factional approach of the leader”. It is understood the walkout, which took place at the Labour NEC away-day on Zoom, was coordinated by Pidcock and Unite’s Howard Beckett, a candidate hoping to succeed Len McCluskey as the trade union’s general secretary. Mish Rahman, one of the local constituency representatives on the body, said: “Yet again Starmer is trying to play games with democracy and undermine the role of trade unions within our party. This latest action fits a worrying pattern of control-freakery reminiscent of the New Labour years. “There can be no party unity until Starmer fully understands the need to work with the Labour movement and the many tens of thousands of grassroots members who can help deliver a Labour government. Our walkout today was to remind him of this, and to send a message that we will not put up with petty and repeated attacks on trade unions and members.” NEC members described chaos as the bloc walked out, which allowed Margaret Beckett to be elected NEC by a unanimous 24 votes. One NEC member said it was “clearly planned in advance … they’ve thrown their toys out of the pram … none of us ever walked out when we didn’t get our way, lost votes!” Another called it a “full-frontal attack” on the leader by Howard Beckett and Pidcock. The walkout did not go as smoothly as intended. One source described how Howard Beckett had given an angry speech ahead of the walkout but then spent an agonising minute attempting to find the button to leave the virtual meeting. Labour sources said the move to elect Margaret Beckett rather than allow Murray to take his turn in the chair was the restoration of the old system which had been in place until 2017 under which the longest-serving NEC member becomes chair. Beckett was first elected to the NEC in 1980. Alice Perry, a long-serving Islington councillor, was elected vice-chair. Corbyn has had the whip suspended for three months – barring him from the parliamentary Labour party – pending an investigation into whether he had broken the PLP code of conduct. He had been suspended from the Labour party as a whole in late October over comments he made after a report by the equality watchdog about antisemitism in the party, but his membership was restored after three weeks when he was given a formal warning by the party. The former Labour leader has been asked to formally apologise and withdraw comments in which he said the scale of the problem had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media."
2020-11-24T06:00:14Z,politics,Politics,"'Orwellian' government unit obstructs freedom of information, says report","The government has been accused of operating an “Orwellian” unit that obstructs the release of sensitive information requested by the public under the Freedom of Information Act. A new report on the “clearing house”, a little-known unit that sits at the heart of government, discloses how it seeks to control the release of potentially embarrassing information. The unit requires Whitehall departments to send it requests that are deemed to be potentially sensitive or too expensive to answer. The unit routinely instructs departments to submit to it drafts of proposed responses so that they can be vetted. The requests, which are understood to total about 50 a day, have often originated from journalists seeking to hold ministers to account, campaigners challenging government policy and academics.
On Tuesday, the openDemocracy website called the unit “Orwellian” in a report which accuses ministers of hindering the disclosure of information in “disturbing” ways. Introduced in 2005 to open up the workings of official bodies, the Freedom of Information Act allows the public to submit requests for specific pieces of information to government organisations which are then required to decide whether to release it.
In its analysis, openDemocracy says central government departments are granting fewer requests than ever before. It says that the Cabinet Office, which is in charge of freedom of information policy, has one of the worst records on access to information. The Cabinet Office, and other public bodies, often cynically fail to respond to requests from the public in any way, according to openDemocracy. Whitehall departments are required to send to the clearing house requests that seek information about subjects deemed to be “sensitive”. It is unclear what constitutes a “sensitive” subject. The unit also asks to see requests that have been submitted to multiple departments but are asking for the same information from each. The Cabinet Office has said this allows the government to monitor requests that may cost too much public money to answer, as permitted under the act. Each day, the clearing house circulates advice on how to answer these requests to Whitehall departments. Whitehall sources confirm that these requests have been submitted by journalists from the Guardian, the BBC, the Times, the Mirror, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph. Other requests have been submitted by campaigners such as Privacy International, which opposes government surveillance. Routinely, the unit tells Whitehall departments “we would like to see drafts” or “send draft responses to clearing house”. The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for running the prime minister’s office and supporting his cabinet, has said individual departments can ultimately decide what information to disclose. David Davis, the former Conservative minister, said: “The whole purpose of the Freedom of Information Act was to increase transparency and accountability of government.” “This clearing house is certainly against the spirit of that act – and probably the letter, too. Ministers should explain to the House of Commons precisely why they continue with this set-up in view of the fact that it is contradictory to the whole purpose of freedom ofinformation.” In a statement, the Cabinet Office said: “The Cabinet Office plays an important role through the FOI Clearing House of ensuring there is a standard approach across government in the way we consider and respond to requests. “The government is committed to its transparency agenda, routinely discloses information beyond its obligations under the FOI Act, and is releasing more proactive publications than before. “With increasing transparency, we receive increasingly more complex requests under freedom of information. We must balance the public need to make information available with our duty to protect sensitive information and ensure national security.”"
2020-11-23T20:56:49Z,politics,Politics,Tiers of a clown as Boris Johnson's video link falls down | John Crace,"On a normal Monday the Commons might have been preoccupied with the prime minister’s “unintentional” decision not to sack Priti Patel after she was found guilty of having broken the ministerial code on bullying. Instead, the home secretary’s behaviour was long forgotten as Boris Johnson used the time to announce the new coronavirus measures instead. Talking via a video link from No 10, where he is still self-isolating, Johnson said we were returning to the tiered system, which worked so well the first time that a second lockdown became a necessity. Though these new tiers would be quite different from the old tiers. In some ways they would be more relaxed, with non-necessary retail and gyms now allowed open in all levels. And in tiers 1 and 2, some outdoor and indoor spectators would be allowed to attend sporting events, while in tier 2 no one one would be allowed into a pub unless they also ordered a substantial meal. Go figure. Tier 3 would more or less be like the current national lockdown apart from the bits that wouldn’t. It all felt pretty much like something that had been cobbled together on the back of a fag packet in cabinet to fit in with what the libertarian wing of the Tory party might accept, rather than something that was based on hard scientific evidence. But Boris didn’t want us to feel too gloomy about everything. The vaccine trials did look promising, testing was improving, and all being well we might be back to more or less normal by Easter. And as a special treat – though he couldn’t yet go into exact details – there would be some kind of amnesty over Christmas so families could meet up. Though this had to kept hush-hush for now, because if the coronavirus got wind of any relaxations in measures it could seek to take advantage by working overtime and leaving many elderly relatives dead in January and February. There again, it’s been a long old year for Covid-19 as well, so maybe the virus could do with a four-day break too. Keir Starmer didn’t sound wholly convinced. He’s heard too many broken promises from Johnson already and, having backed the government on all its previous public health measures, he wanted a little more detail on the package before conferring his blessing. How confident was Johnson that these new tiers weren’t also going to end up in another lockdown?
And when would he announce which regions would be put into which tiers? There were going to be some mightily pissed off people in the north of England if they were to find themselves back in tier 3, if parts of London and the south-east – where the R rate was at its highest – remained in tier 2. As an aside, Starmer ended by saying the government had rather forgotten the track and isolate bit of test, track and isolate. But this was Boris at his most nonchalant. His answers to the Labour leader amounted to little more than qualified thanks for opposition support, and he again gave the chamber the distinct impression that he was more interested in coming up with a system of measures that all of his own party could tolerate rather than one designed to beat the virus. Something that was borne out in his reply to Mark Harper, who declared he and fellow Conservative MP Steve Baker had written to the prime minister demanding evidence for his policies. This felt like trying to get a parent to prove the existence of Santa, though Baker demanding policy-driven evidence was a first for the MP for Wycombe. Next the Brexiter will be threatening to go to the European court of human rights. Oh. He already has. The irony was not lost on anyone. At which point the sound link from No 10 went down. “Have you muted yourself?” said the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, hopefully. “Have you pressed the button?” Still nothing. Boris’s IT skills don’t appear to have been noticeably improved by his lessons from Jennifer Arcuri. Just as Hoyle was about to suspend the session amid much laughter, you could hear Johnson plaintively yell: “Some problem with the sound.” But the Speaker had heard too much already and handed over the next 45 minutes of the session to Matt Hancock to answer the questions, as he reckoned we’d more likely hear more sense.
Not that the health secretary had any better answers than Boris, but at least his smirk looks more serious in his non-committal answers than the prime minister’s. There was an understandable edge of panic in Door Matt’s voice. Not just at being unexpectedly put on the spot but with the self-awareness that the latest measures are as much guesswork as the previous ones. Shortly after 5pm we did get Johnson back, seemingly from another room in No 10 that had been hastily converted into a new comms nerve centre, AKA somewhere you could operate the broadband connection via a personal hotspot. But we didn’t really learn anything new. It looked as if Boris was still experiencing IT problems a couple of hours later when he left the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine, waiting at the Downing Street lecterns like a couple of spare parts as he failed to show up on his remote screen. But eventually the prime minister managed to reboot his laptop for a press conference that was basically a rerun of his Commons statement, albeit with more focus on the vaccine. Johnson happily went into a string of lazy metaphors – “the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the hill”, “Tis the season to be jolly, but also the season to be jolly careful” – before lapsing into rhyme with “squeeze the disease”. Not for the first time, it was left to the scientists to remind everyone to basically ignore the prime minister and to listen to them instead."
2020-11-23T20:27:26Z,politics,Politics,Leaders from England's north warn PM over revised Covid curbs,"Millions more people in England will be subject to tougher coronavirus restrictions that could last at least four months, Boris Johnson has warned, as northern leaders said they would fiercely resist a return to the highest tier. The prime minister is expected to unveil plans on Tuesday to let a limited number of households mix indoors for up to five days over Christmas. However, he cautioned that people “will need to make a careful judgment about the risk of visiting elderly relatives”. It was also confirmed that the test-and-trace system will get a £7bn funding boost, taking it cost to £22bn this year, as part of an expanded programme of mass testing. England will emerge from national lockdown into a fresh, tiered system of controls from 2 December, Johnson confirmed to the Commons on Monday. Millions are set to enter or re-enter tier 3 curbs, under which pubs and restaurants will remain closed and restricted to takeaways. In tier 2, hospitality businesses will only be allowed to serve alcohol with a “substantial meal”. Johnson warned that “more regions will fall – at least temporarily – into higher levels than before” when details are finalised on Thursday. Before the decision is announced, leaders in north-west England are expected to argue that cases there are slowing dramatically compared with in London and the south-east.
Unlike under the previous system, there will be no negotiation with local leaders, in an attempt to prevent a repeat of bitter public disputes. Financial support will be allocated on a uniform per-capita basis following a damaging row with the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. Dan Jarvis, the mayor of the Sheffield city region, said the system could not continue to disproportionately affect the poorest regions without negotiation with local leaders, or it would risk losing trust. “This pandemic has hit some of the most disadvantaged parts of the country the hardest. Many of those parts may now be asked to remain under serious restrictions while the rest of the country faces a lesser burden,” he said. “We’re willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted. We’re already sacrificing a great deal when we can ill afford it. “Consistency and fairness is the essential condition of all of this. You can’t refuse to negotiate with local governments but then say lockdowns are a matter of judgment. You can’t refuse to negotiate and then not give us the support we need. You have to get it right.”
Ministers are likely to face questions over the north-south divide in restrictions unless areas in southern England are subjected to tougher measures. In the latest figures, London is one of only two regions where a majority of areas have recorded a rise in cases. Of the 32 areas in London, 20 showed an increase, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge. Kent, where cases are rising most rapidly, is also at risk. The south-east is now the region with the highest coronavirus rates in England – they are rising in 34 out of 67 local authority areas. The Labour MP Rosie Duffield, whose Kent constituency borders Swale, which has overtaken Hull in east Yorkshire to become England’s worst-hit local authority, said it was “clear that previous measures have failed to stop the rise in cases”. She said the county should prepare for tough restrictions but the government needed to give “further clarity about how areas enter and exit particular tiers”. London leaders are expecting the capital to be in tier 2, and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is likely to resist tier 3 unless there is compelling data. One London MP said Tories were “fiercely lobbying” the government to allow hospitality to remain open in the capital. Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said “all northern core cities are expecting to be in tier 3 – with a review in two weeks”. But Liverpool’s Labour mayor, Joe Anderson, said his city should not re-enter tier 3, given the infection level was down to less than 200 per 100,000 people, down from 700 six weeks ago. “The pressure is off hospitals, they’re down to around 80% occupancy in the Covid wards and round about 80% in the ICUs … So looking at the figures as they are today, I’d be arguing that we are in tier 2 territory,” he said. Burnham, who fiercely resisted his region being placed in tier 3 in October, said the toughened version of the tier would devastate the city, suggesting he would lobby hard for his region to be downgraded.
“A toughened tier 3 could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed,” he told the BBC. “They seem to be going too far before Christmas to allow too much over Christmas and that will lead to a huge loss of hospitality businesses, which I would say is too big a price to pay. To close all hospitality businesses in tier 3 areas – that will be large parts of the north – that will be devastating for many of those businesses. They will not survive that.” Tier positions will be reviewed every 14 days and will be based on five criteria: case numbers across all age groups, cases in those aged over 60, the rate of rise or fall in infections, the percentage of those tested who have the virus, and current and projected pressures on the NHS locally. Johnson is likely to face a tough day in Westminster when the levels of restrictions are announced, with a number of backbench MPs seeming sceptical of the proposals. Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of MPs critical of harsh lockdown measures, said those with areas in tier 3 would “struggle to spot much of a difference from the lockdown”. Keir Starmer warned Johnson there were “huge gaps … huge uncertainties and huge risks” in the plan and suggested more detail would be needed for Labour to back the plan. MPs will vote on the measures early next week. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said people should take the opportunity to see family over Christmas but do it “incredibly responsibly”. He said “of course” the relaxation of rules over Christmas would have an impact on infections. “If everyone is serious before during and after, then we can minimise the amount of impact it will have, [but] of course it will have an impact”."
2020-11-23T20:19:53Z,politics,Politics,Labour chief whip tells Jeremy Corbyn to apologise for antisemitism claims,"Labour’s chief whip has told Jeremy Corbyn to “unequivocally, unambiguously and without reservation” apologise for his claims that the extent of antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated”, which led to his membership being suspended. The party’s governing body readmitted Corbyn last week but Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, has refused to restore the whip to his predecessor, effectively suspending him from the parliamentary party. The chief whip, Nick Brown, has said the suspension will last at least three months while an investigation takes place into whether Corbyn has broken the MPs’ code of conduct. In a new letter released by Brown on Monday, the chief whip told Corbyn he must apologise for his comments made in the wake of a report on antisemitism in the party under his leadership by the equalities watchdog.
Brown said the comments made in response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report caused “distress and pain” to the Jewish community and should be deleted from the former Labour leader’s Facebook page. Brown said Corbyn must also commit to supporting the party’s efforts to comply with recommendations by the equalities watchdog. He said the suspension was related to parliamentary rules “that Labour MPs conduct themselves at all times in a manner consistent with membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party, including doing nothing that brings the Labour party into disrepute”. Multiple sources have previously told the Guardian that conversations took place in recent weeks between representatives of Corbyn and key figures in Starmer’s office, including his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, ahead of Corbyn being readmitted to the party.
Corbyn’s side believed the outcome of those negotiations was that the party’s governing national executive committee (NEC) would issue Corbyn with a lesser punishment, but sources close to Starmer have underlined that Corbyn had been repeatedly urged to retract last month’s comments – which he had not done despite issuing clarifications. In Monday’s letter, Brown said Corbyn’s statement “in particular, the implications that this form of racism is ‘exaggerated’ and that it is media reporting of that racism, rather than the actual impact on its victims, that hurt Jewish people – caused significant distress to many, in particular Jewish members of the Labour party and the wider Jewish community”. Brown said he would be happy to meet Corbyn soon to discuss the potential restoration of the whip. “The EHRC’s conclusion that the Labour party had broken the law by committing unlawful acts is a shameful indictment for our party,” Brown wrote. “There is a legal requirement to correct where the Labour party has acted unlawfully and a moral obligation to implement all the recommendations of the EHRC report. Keir Starmer has been unequivocal that antisemitism has been a stain on our party and that we must tear out this poison by its roots.” Members of the NEC will meet on Tuesday in what is expected to be a showdown following Corbyn’s reinstatement and the refusal of Starmer to restore the whip. Last week, in the most open declaration of civil war in the party yet, 14 left-aligned members of the NEC said the decision to withhold the whip from Corbyn was a “deliberate political interference in the handling of a complaint” and called on the general secretary, David Evans, to intervene."

2020-11-23T18:59:21Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit to cost more than Covid, Bank of England governor says","The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has warned that the economic cost of a no-deal Brexit would be bigger in the long term than the damage caused by Covid-19. Bailey said failure to agree to a deal before the Brexit transition expires at the end of December would cause disruption to cross-border trade and damage the goodwill between London and Brussels needed to build a future economic partnership. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Treasury committee, he said the fallout from the pandemic and the second national lockdown in England was having a much bigger short-term impact on the economy. However, “the long-term effects, I think, would be larger than the long-term effects of Covid. But … it would be better to have a trade deal, yes, no question about it.” With little more than a month before the transition period ends, a trade deal between London and Brussels is close to being finalised, although officials have warned that the risk remains of an accidental no deal if compromises cannot be reached. Over the weekend, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said that Britain should not accept a deal with the EU at any price, insisting that Covid-19 posed a much greater threat to the economy than a no-deal scenario. Sunak said a deal was preferable but that the UK would “prosper in any eventuality”. However, Bailey said it was in the “best interests of both sides, for the UK and the EU, for there to be a trade agreement”. It comes after analysis by the London School of Economics and UK in a Changing Europe concluded in September that the long-term economic impact of a no-deal Brexit could be two or three times worse than that of the pandemic. Asked about the research, Bailey said economic models suggested there would be long-term consequences, as it could take a long time for the UK to adjust to a new trading relationship. “It takes a much longer period of time for the real side of the economy to adjust to the change in openness and change in the profile of trade,” he said. The fallout from Covid-19 and lockdown measures sunk Britain’s economy into the deepest recession on record this spring, with a 20% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter. With the economy under continued pressure amid the second Covid wave, despite a rapid recovery this summer, Threadneedle Street estimates that the pandemic will cause persistent scarring over the long term, with total economic output about 1.75% lower than would otherwise have been the case by the end of 2023. No-deal Brexit would not cause as much damage as inflicted by the pandemic earlier this year. However, the LSE modelling estimates a reduction in GDP worth 8% over a decade compared with remaining in the EU."
2020-11-23T16:15:53Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson opposes pay rise for MPs, says No 10","Boris Johnson believes MPs should not receive a pay rise this year, Downing Street has said, as MPs called on the government to legislate to prevent the publicly damaging pay increase. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which sets MPs’ salaries, is expected to recommended that MPs should get a 4.1% increase worth £3,300. The move, should it go ahead, is likely to spark public indignation coupled with an expected public sector pay freeze at the spending review later this week. Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister had already acted where he had the power to do so and had frozen ministerial pay, but said he did not believe MPs should get a rise. “MPs’ salaries are obviously decided by an independent body but given the circumstances, the PM doesn’t believe MPs should be receiving a pay rise,” the spokesman said. Ipsa, which was set up in the wake of the expenses’ scandal, has a statutory duty to review MPs’ pay in the first year of a parliament but many parliamentarians have publicly spoken out against the potential increase. John Redwood, a former cabinet minister, tweeted that if a public sector pay freeze was announced then Johnson “must legislate to override the independent MP pay body that otherwise will pay more to MPs at a time of restraint”. The former minister Steve Baker said: “Ipsa must freeze MP pay if there is a public sector pay freeze. If necessary, the law must be changed.” Rachel Maclean, the transport minister, also released a statement saying MPs should not get a pay rise. “I vehemently believe now is not the right time for MPs to be receiving a pay rise,” she said in a statement. “Ipsa should be blocked from attempting to give MPs this increase in pay… The government should consider all options to block Ipsa from awarding this pay rise.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to announce a renewed squeeze on public sector pay in this week’s government spending review in response to the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement on pay restraint is expected to be part of the mini-budget on Wednesday, as part of plans to launch a Whitehall savings drive to tackle record levels of government borrowing incurred during the crisis. Senior leaders from 18 of the country’s biggest trade unions have warned the chancellor that pay controls during the health emergency could cause a staffing crisis."
2020-11-23T13:30:09Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson under fire over ‘no place for bullying’ claim,"Boris Johnson has been accused of double standards after writing to ministers and senior civil servants claiming there is “no place for bullying” in the wake of a damning investigation into the home secretary, Priti Patel. The prime minister and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, wrote a joint email on Monday calling for relationships of “mutual trust and respect between politicians and their officials”. On Friday, Johnson broke with precedent and refused to sack Patel after an inquiry concluded she had broken the ministerial code following bullying allegations across three government departments. Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards, quit his post after Johnson contradicted his report by vigorously defending the home secretary and keeping her in her role. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union that represents senior civil servants, said the prime minister’s latest words would do little to reassure public servants. “In August 2019 he set out, in precise terms in the foreword to the ministerial code, that ‘there must be no bullying and no harassment’,” Penman said. “In the first test of his commitment to these words, he has transparently chosen partisan political interest over the interests of the victims of the home secretary’s behaviour as well as the broader standards that should rightly be expected of ministers. “If the prime minister was serious about his commitment to these standards, he would introduce an independent and transparent process for dealing with these complaints, that was free from the political interference he has so blatantly shown in regard to the home secretary.” In a written ministerial statement, which acknowledged that Allan had concluded that Patel’s behaviour could “on occasion” be described “as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals”, Johnson said: “Together with the cabinet secretary, I have this morning written to all ministers and permanent secretaries. This letter sets out the paramount importance of relationships of mutual trust and respect between politicians and their officials. “This includes keeping internal conversations private, feeling able to speak freely and honestly about matters of state and to speak constructively about things that are not working so that we can fix them together promptly. “I am clear that there is a particular duty on ministers and permanent secretaries to create jointly across government a culture which is professional, respectful, focused and ambitious for change and in which there is no place for bullying. The cabinet secretary and I are enormously grateful to civil servants for the commitment they have shown as we navigate through these challenging times.” Johnson added that he had “full confidence” in Patel and that he considered “this matter now closed”. In a published summary of the long-delayed report, Allan said Patel’s conduct had “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying”, and highlighted instances of shouting and swearing. He concluded she had breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. One of the justifications Johnson used for defending Patel was the element of Allan’s report that said she had been unaware of the impact of her behaviour because no Home Office official had complained about her. Sources have said, however, that Allan sought to interview the former top Home Office civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam, who resigned after clashing with Patel, but government officials blocked him. Offering what she described as an “unreserved, fulsome apology”, Patel has seized on Allan’s finding that she had received no feedback on the impact of her behaviour. Rutnam, who is suing Patel for wrongful dismissal under whistleblowing laws, issued a statement on Friday that said she was advised not to shout and swear at staff the month after her appointment in 2019, and that he had told her to treat staff with respect “on further occasions”."
2020-11-22T22:30:34Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak says public sector pay freeze is not a return to austerity,"Rishi Sunak has rejected accusations that his planned public sector pay freeze amounts to a return of austerity and insisted that spending plans to be announced on Wednesday will result in more money for health, education and the police. With trade unions demanding that the chancellor do a last-minute U-turn over his clearly signalled intention to clamp down on the state’s wage bill and refusing to rule out strikes, Sunak said there would be significant increases in spending on public services next year. The Guardian has learned that Sunak’s plans include an additional £151m to tackle rough sleeping and prevent homelessness on top of the £103m that he announced in his March budget. The extra cash to combat the UK’s homeless crisis – along with a reconfirmation of funding for 40 new hospitals, 20,000 additional police officers, the refurbishment of further education colleges and a 10-year school rebuilding programme – will be used by the chancellor to fend off criticism of the public sector wage restraint. Sunak said on Sunday: “This has been a tough year for us all. But we won’t let it get in the way of delivering on our promises – the British people deserve outstanding public services, and we remain committed to delivering their priorities as we put our public services at the heart of our economic renewal.” Also featuring in Wednesday’s package will be: New forecasts showing the economy on course to shrink by more than 10% this year. A public sector pay freeze for all workers outside the NHS. An extra £3bn for the NHS to tackle a backlog in operations caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Confirmation of funding for 50,000 more nurses and 50m additional GP appointments. A cut in the UK aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income. Plans for a new national infrastructure bank and a northern campus for the Treasury. A warning from the chancellor that the unlimited spending to cope with the twin health and economic emergencies is coming to an end. In a private letter to the chancellor seen by the Guardian, senior leaders from 18 of the country’s biggest unions warned pay controls during the health emergency would damage the economy, hurt frontline workers and cause a staffing crisis. The union chiefs called instead for pay rises to be awarded to recognise the unique role played by public sector staff during the Covid outbreak. The letter says a pay rise is a “matter of justice” for firefighters, teaching assistants, care workers, refuse collectors and other key public sector staff to reward them for their efforts during the crisis. The letter was signed by the leaders of the UK’s three biggest unions – Unison, Unite and the GMB – as well as the NEU teachers’ union and representatives from prisons and healthcare. Asked if about the possibility of going on strike over the issue, the head of the TUC federation of trade unions, Frances O’Grady, refused to rule it out. She told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I’m really conscious of the feeling out there that governments only seem to recognise the true value of labour when it’s withdrawn ... Nobody can rule anything out at the moment but what I am saying and asking for is that the government stands by key workers, respects the contribution they are continuing to make and recognises that this is absolutely the wrong time to be talking about pay cuts.” Figures from the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing thinktank led by Robert Colvile, an author of the 2019 Conservative manifesto, suggest a three-year pay freeze could save a cumulative £23bn for the exchequer, and Sunak did nothing to quash speculation that action was imminent. The chancellor told Ridge: “I can’t comment on future pay policy in advance of the spending review, but what I would say is, when we launched the spending review, I did say to departments that when we think about settlements it would be entirely reasonable to think about those in the context of the wider economic climate. That’s a reasonable thing to do. “Secondly, I think it would be fair to also think about what’s happening with wages, with jobs, with hours across the economy, when we think about what the right thing to do in the public sector is.” Sunak denied this amounted to a return of austerity, which the government has said is over. “You will not see austerity next week,” he said. “What you will see is an increase in the government’s spending on day-to-day public services, quite a significant one, coming on the increase we had last year. So there’s absolutely no way in which anyone can say that’s austerity.” Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, will say in a speech on Monday : “The British people shouldn’t have to pay the price for a government that doesn’t know the value of public money, splurging it on outsourced contracts to Tory-linked firms that don’t deliver.” In a speech to Reuters, Dodds will add: “The chancellor’s irresponsible choices and unacceptable delays are damaging the economy. That’s why we’re in the grip of a jobs crisis – and it’s got Rishi Sunak’s name all over it.”"
2020-11-22T22:00:33Z,politics,Politics,"UK should tilt foreign policy to Indo-Pacific region, report says","The UK should make a major post-Brexit tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region, ploughing military, financial and diplomatic resources into building a major democratic counterweight to China’s growing threat to the post-1945 world order, a major report urges. The report, prepared by a group of UK politicians for the right of centre thinktank Policy Exchange, and endorsed by the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, represents a key shift in UK foreign policy thinking. The UK and the EU have agreed on the need for a new role for Britain dedicated to helping the countries of the Indo-Pacific area stand up to Beijing by upholding democracy, free trade supported by open seas and an uncensored internet. The report is deliberately framed as an attempt to carve out “the essence of a manifesto of what a global Britain looks like in the 2020s and beyond”. Requiring a major shift in resources – in part enabled by last week’s rise in defence spending and the summer merger of the UK’s foreign and aid budgets – the proposals would set the UK up as a country committed to challenging China’s authoritarian model. It proposes the Indo-Pacific countries commit to a 21st century charter for democracy akin to the Atlantic charter signed by the UK and the US in 1941. In a region accounting for close to half of global economic output and more than half the world’s population, the report envisages the UK working closely with allies such as Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Overseen by Stephen Harper, the former Canadian prime minister, it will also receive support from the current Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. Critics of the strategy will argue Britain is late to the region – both France and Germany have published Indo-Pacific strategies, and the UK’s ambitions exceed its resources and relevance. But Abe writes: “Britain can work with countries throughout the region on upholding democratic values and supporting the multinational institutions that have developed in recent years. On the security front, the British military, and the Royal Navy in particular, will be a welcome presence in the seas of the Indo-Pacific.” The report argues: “In contradiction with some of the prevailing narratives about Britain’s assumed post-Brexit irrelevance, friendly countries from across the IPR [Indo-Pacific region] are eager to see more UK involvement in their part of the world. “To fully globalise Britain, the Indo-Pacific region, stretching from the eastern Indian Ocean to the western Pacific and Oceania, must become a priority.” The report says that, since the early 2010s, the UK has been too narrowly focused on trade with China and failed to see the rise of Asia as an epochal transformation driven by many contributions, and not just China. The Indo-China tilt, it says, is about the UK recovering “its much older role as one of the custodians of a multilateral consensus on regional order”. “Britain recognises the increasing strategic competition between two competing visions of regional order, offered by China and the United States. The UK does not seek any new cold wars, but it will defend its interests at home and abroad,” the report states. “At the same time, the UK government cannot take a value-neutral position between Beijing and Washington, nor should it see itself as leading a new ‘non-aligned’ movement of smaller states in opposition to the two great powers of the region. “Britain should defend global cooperation, openness, respect for law and adherence to accepted norms of behaviour in concert with the United States and like-minded nations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.” The UK has a duty to “counter the threats which strike at the pillars of the post-1945 international system of norms and rules – the system in whose creation Britain was essential and whose demise would adversely affect the country’s security and prosperity”.
As part of the tilt, the UK would apply for membership of the regional free trade partnership, seek to join the existing US, India, Australia and Japan security dialogue and enhance its military capacity in bases such as Diego Garcia. “The UK government should expand the deployment of Royal Navy assets, RAF aircraft and Army (including Special Forces)/Royal Marines personnel to achieve uninterrupted, year-round UK military presence in the IPR (both on operational and training missions).” The City of London would offer its financial muscle through an Indo-Pacific investment initiative to set up a clean alternative to the Chinese belt and road initiative – a strategy adopted by China in 2013 to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organisations. An Indo-Pacific multinational investment treaty is also proposed to protect investors from Chinese discriminatory practices and allow investors to enter into arbitration under international law. It also envisages the UK acting as a regional champion for human rights, not just in the former colony Hong Kong, but to promote and strengthen democratic values in the region. In the case of Hong Kong, the report proposes that sanctions are now imposed on to Chinese Communist party officials for their role in the destruction of the territory’s sovereignty. In a move that would further antagonise China, the report suggests the UK should start normalising relations with Taiwan, especially on global issues such as cyber security and health."

As the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, defended Patel on Sunday, saying ministers sometimes had to be “direct” in pushing forward change, the FDA union said members in the Home Office had complained about what they felt were double standards. Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards, quit his post on Friday after Johnson contradicted his report by vigorously defending the home secretary and keeping her in her role. In a published summary of the long-delayed report, Allan said Patel’s conduct had “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying”, and highlighted instances of shouting and swearing. He concluded she had breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. The FDA’s general secretary, Dave Penman, said members had stressed that they would lose their jobs if they were officially found to have to have breached their equivalent code of conduct. “They are contractually bound by the civil service code, and they would be sacked if they broke it,” Penman said. “And here’s the ministerial code, the one thing that governs the conduct of ministers, and despite the fact that she was found to have broken it, the prime minister gives no sanction. A lot of people are furious at what they see as double standards.” One of the justifications Johnson used for defending Patel was the element of Allan’s report that said she had been unaware of the impact of her behaviour because no Home Office official had complained about her.
Sources have said, however, that Allan sought to interview the former top Home Office civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam, who resigned after clashing with Patel, but government officials blocked him. Johnson has ordered ministers and MPs to defend Patel. Asked about her behaviour on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Sunak said: “I don’t think shouting is an effective way to get the best out of people. But it is necessary sometimes to be direct in order to drive progress in an organisation, particularly under stressful circumstances. “On a personal level, I’ve worked closely with Priti and found her to be entirely kind and very focused and passionate about what she does.” In an interview with Sky, Sunak defended Johnson’s decision to overrule the report’s conclusions. “It is right that the prime minister, as the person who is in charge and runs the government, is able to receive that report, go through the findings and make a decision that he think is right, weighing up all the considerations,” he said. “That’s what he’s done. The home secretary has offered a full and unreserved apology for what’s happened and I think at that point we can move on and focus on the things that people want us to do, which is keeping their streets safe and that’s what the home secretary is doing, that’s what the government is doing.”
Labour said Patel could not remain in her post. The shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said: “She has been found by an independent inquiry of breaking the ministerial code and I think if you are found to be breaking the ministerial code, your position is completely untenable. “I think it’s appalling that the prime minister has decided to back her instead of sacking her, and that’s what he should have done. “It’s not that bullying can’t exist in all political parties, of course it can and it does – believe me it does – but it’s how you deal with it, it’s how you tackle it and it’s whether you show the leadership and the tough decisions that you need to take to root it out.”"
2020-11-22T18:19:51Z,politics,Politics,"UK should not sign EU deal at any price, says Sunak","The UK should not accept a deal with the EU at any price, the chancellor has said, insisting that the coronavirus pandemic posed a greater threat to the UK economy than Brexit. Speaking as UK and EU negotiators enter what could be their final week of discussions, Rishi Sunak said he was hopeful that a trade and security agreement would be reached. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Friday that “better progress” had been made in recent days, but there were still gaps on significant issues such as fishing and competition regulations. In an echo of Theresa May’s 2018 speech in which she insisted “no deal is better than a bad deal”, Sunak told the BBC: “I think we’re being entirely reasonable with our requests and have been consistent and transparent through this process about what’s important to us,” he said. “But we will prosper in any eventuality. “In the short-term specifically, and most immediately, it would be preferable to have a deal because it would ease things in the short-term. I think the most important impact on our economy next year is not going to be from that, it’s because of coronavirus. “We should not be going for a deal at any price, that would be the wrong thing to do and I think there are things that are important to us in these negotiations, and we’ve been entirely, as I said, reasonable, consistent and transparent.” Analysis by the London School of Economics and UK in a Changing Europe concluded In September that the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit could be two or three times worse than that of the pandemic. There have been suggestions in recent weeks that Sunak is one of a number of senior government figures urging caution on a looming no-deal scenario. Fiscal experts say the best deal the UK can secure would have counted as “one of the hardest of Brexits” three or four years ago. Paul Johnson, the director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: “That sort of deal will result, at best, in the economy growing less quickly than it otherwise would have done. “It is worth saying that, especially in the context of coronavirus, there’s just such uncertainty about what the impact is going to be, and particularly the short-term impact.” A separate report reveals the UK could face costs of up to £1.6bn if it does not apply EU standards to its treatment of personal and commercial data after Brexit. The study by the New Economics Foundation thinktank and University College London’s European Institute is the first to detail the business impact of having to set up new compliance procedures to continue exchanging data with the EU. It found that smaller companies would be disproportionately affected with an average compliance cost of £3,000 for micro-businesses that employ fewer than 10 people, £10,000 for small, £20,000 for medium and £163,000 for large businesses. Duncan McCann, a senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation, said the risk would hit small and medium-sized enterprises “at a time when the economy is already severely challenged by the pandemic and trading conditions are difficult”. Most modern businesses employ cross-border data flows without even knowing it. Computer server space for email clients, for example, may be in another EU country. Failure to get EU approval would increase the legal costs for British companies and increase their risk of fines for non-compliance with GDPR, but could also result in businesses and personnel relocating to elsewhere in Europe."
2020-11-22T12:00:21Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan: 'There is potentially an existential threat to central London',"There have only been three London mayors and the current one, Sadiq Khan, is not like either of his predecessors. He doesn’t possess Boris Johnson’s entitled flamboyance, nor Ken Livingstone’s maverick independence. And neither has he inherited their gift for generating headlines. But, having met all three men, I’d say he is easily the most genuine and likable. A much less obviously ego-driven character than the other two, he is, at 5ft 6ins, both literally and figuratively more down to earth. Where Livingstone and Johnson won as personality candidates, Khan was framed in the 2016 mayoral election, not least by his opponent, Zac Goldsmith, as the identity candidate. He was vying to become the first Muslim mayor of a western capital five months after the terrorist attacks on Paris by gunmen loyal to Islamic State. That he triumphed had as much to do with his natural sense of inclusivity as London’s cosmopolitan diversity. His first instinct in almost any situation is to try not to alienate anyone. When I met him last week he had just published an “action plan” to address BAME communities’ concerns about the Metropolitan police. The statistics the report throws up are startling. Although more than 40% of Londoners are from BAME communities, they provide only about 19% of new police recruits. Black people are four times more likely to be stopped and searched than their white counterparts, and of those who are searched while driving, black people are six times more likely to be pulled over to the side of the road. But it wasn’t these figures that prompted the action plan so much as George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed in its wake. “What was clear,” says Khan, “speaking to black friends, black staff, black Londoners, was they were traumatised by George Floyd’s brutal killing, though it happened thousands of miles away. The common theme among black people is, there but for the grace of God, it could have been my dad, my brother, my uncle, my son.” Here in London? “Here in London,” he confirms. “And yes, American policing is very different to British policing. And that policing is light years better than it was when I was growing up, or at the time of Stephen Lawrence, but black people still feel this way. Now you can have a discussion about why they feel that way, but this is how black people are feeling, by and large.”
We’re speaking on the empty ninth floor of the now ghost operation that is City Hall in lockdown. It’s an eerie setting. Our conversation echoes quietly across the dwarfing size of the event room, against the backdrop of what Khan calls “the best view in London”. It feels like we’re on a film set – perhaps a billionaire’s loft – rather than in a local government office. The symbolism of City Hall is too rich for any visitor to ignore. Its location on the south bank of the Thames, opposite the attention-seeking office blocks of the City of London and the stalwart sturdiness of the Tower of London, makes for a topography of wealth, power and history that is hard to beat. Then there is the building itself, a Norman Foster-designed diaphanous bulb that was supposed to embody transparency but has more often evoked vulnerability. Livingstone called it a “glass testicle” and you can all too easily imagine its occupants girding themselves against the encroaching might of Westminster a couple of miles upstream. Of course the second mayor, Johnson, is now in No 10 and it’s his successor, Khan, whose job it is to defend the capital against central government. Earlier this year, the usual tension peaked after Khan was forced to sign a deal with Downing Street to bail out Transport for London with a £1.1bn grant and a £505m loan. The deal resulted in steep travel price increases and several other bitter pills. Furthermore, the government then briefed the media that Khan had voluntarily acted to take away free children’s travel and restrict travel for older people, though these were the government conditions. As he admitted, he “blinked” first in the negotiations, believing, he said, that what was in the interest of public health – the maintenance of public transport in a pandemic – was more important than the politics. To some observers, he looked naive, especially when he claimed that the government was seeking to make him look bad before the May 2021 mayoral elections (postponed by a year because of Covid). After all, that is what politicians do. What does he think of Johnson now? “Personally, on a social level, we get on OK. He’s perfectly reasonable. He is not rude. But I think for the last year and a half, he’s been held hostage by people – Lee Cain, Dominic Cummings. We’ll have to wait and see whether he’ll now be free.” The fact is, Khan can’t afford to make an enemy of the prime minister. He wants him to honour the findings of the London Finance Commission that Johnson set up when he was mayor. It recommended fiscal devolution, which would bring London in line with other major cities in being able to spend more of what it creates. “We only get to spend 7% of the taxes raised in London,” Khan complains. “New York is 50% and Tokyo is 70%. That’s the change of power we need.”
Making that case is a test of resolve at the best of times. Khan says there has never been a day when he has gone to bed feeling that everything went according to plan. He makes reference several times to being kept awake by problems and he gives the impression of taking the job much more seriously than Johnson. And during this pandemic and its lockdowns, the business of being mayor has been a challenge that Khan says has taken a psychological toll. “I found it really hard working from home,” he says. “I’ve never in my life worked from home. Particularly, when you’re in a leadership position, it’s really hard. Lonely is the wrong word because I’m lucky – I’ve got a wife and kids and we get on in a decent-size house. But I thrive on company, I thrive on mixing with people, sharing ideas. Zoom meetings and team meetings aren’t the same.” He says he struggled with motivation in the first lockdown. And going out only once a day for exercise really got to him. A keen Sunday footballer, he missed the release of competitive sport. He savours that normality of being on a football pitch, where no one treats him differently. But it was the lack of access to his wider family, in particular his mother, which left him feeling quite downcast. “People of my generation assume that if you’ve got mental ill health, you need to be medicalised. Not true. I’ve learned a lot over the last few years about mental health. One of the things you can do is make yourself more resilient. For example, exercise works for me, music works for me, running, playing football on Sunday.” The son of a bus driver, Khan grew up in Tooting, south London, and he says that as a child he didn’t know anyone who went to work in a suit. On television, the only people he saw like himself were in TV shows such as Mind Your Language and It Ain’t Half Hot Mum that would “embarrass” him. The first time he got a sense of pride, he says, was when Chaka Khan had a big hit with Ain’t Nobody. He was so impressed by sharing her surname that he went to school and told his friends that she was his cousin.
Another American import inspired him to become a lawyer: the TV drama LA Law. Having studied at the Polytechnic of North London, he joined Christian Fisher, a small but radical law firm specialising in civil rights. It was there he made a name for himself winning discrimination cases and then defending a number of figures caught up in anti-terrorism investigations in the aftermath of 9/11 and the Iraq war. Colleagues from that time have since expressed dismay and disappointment at his political journey towards the centre left. Given that many of his political opponents, both in the Labour party and outside, have been surprised by how hard he works, does he think people tend to underestimate him? “I think my entire life,” he says without hesitation. “I mean, one of my dad’s things was, you’ve got to work twice as hard to be considered half as good. But I always say, you shouldn’t be offended by the word prejudice. It just means prejudging. And people prejudge people like me. They always have.” Leaving aside the racial prejudice, you can see why people might not at first appreciate just how shrewd a politician Khan is. He doesn’t always project himself as well as he might. He is an impatiently fast talker, often swallowing consonants or even syllables, and occasionally whole words, in the rush to make his point. And though he is a lively Twitter presence – his spat with Donald Trump further endeared him to Londoners – he can sometimes err on the side of subdued or long-winded when on television. But in person he is a warm and engaging presence with a firm grasp of detail. There’s only one occasion when he bristles and that’s when I ask him if he regrets nominating Jeremy Corbyn for leader (he didn’t vote for him in either leadership contest). The answer seems to be no, I think. “In 2010, when I was helping run Ed’s campaign, do you know who nominated Diane Abbott to get on the ballot paper?” he asks. “David Miliband. And so all I would say is, it’s worth everyone just checking the history.” Sometimes, his guile and determination have been depicted as naked ambition. And given that the last mayor became prime minister, the job could easily be seen as a career springboard. But he dismisses that possibility, arguing that cities are the political future. Just as the 19th century was about empires, and the 20th about nations, so he says the 21st is about cities.
“I think,” he says firmly, “this will be my last political job.” Whether or not that proves to be the case, so far he hasn’t enjoyed any major policy breakthroughs that people automatically associate with his name. He is most proud, he says, of his clean air initiative, the biggest number of council homes built last year since 1983 and the values his office promotes. In many respects, he is well placed to be a reforming mayor. He’s certainly the first to know what it’s like to be the focus of biased police attention. He says that when he was young he was stopped by the police between “10 and 20 times”. His father told him never to talk back to the police. It was advice, he says, that he made sure to follow – at least until he was a defence lawyer in court. “I’ve not been stopped in my car for ages,” he says. “But there is still that sensation you get when you’re driving and you see a police car behind you and your heart starts beating faster. And that comes from the experiences you have growing up.” He wants to raise the Met’s BAME recruitment rate to 40% within the next two years and double the amount of sergeants and inspectors. It’s an ambitious target. “What’s clear from the conversations I had with black Londoners was they would rather I be ambitious and fall short than set a target just to tick a box,” he says, though the distinction doesn’t seem to contain a noticeable difference. At the same time, he acknowledges that his ambition is seen by some as not nearly ambitious enough. His answer to stopping cars is to try to get some reliable data – at the moment, if a vehicle is not searched, there is no record of its being stopped. Khan says the Met is going to do a pilot study for a year in a part of London, collecting details of who’s stopped. He’s really pleased that his plan has been welcomed by the Met’s commissioner, Cressida Dick. “That’s really important,” he says. As there isn’t a “progressive government” he can liaise with, he says, he has to build his bridges where he can. “Some people, and I don’t criticise them for this,” he says quickly, “don’t think that it [the action plan] has gone far enough. Some people, and again I don’t criticise them for this, think we’re interfering with police in some matters. And so you can’t please people on both sides.” It’s a characteristic piece of Khan compromise and moderation. Critics say that his willingness to see both sides of the story is informed more by political expediency than any great empathic understanding. They point out that he’s flip-flopped on issues such as Heathrow’s third runway and the Thames garden bridge. Is it unfair to say that he’s prone to change his mind? “I don’t think it is,” he replies. “I’m a former lawyer. One of the things you rely on is the evidence you have. And I think you should be pragmatic. Being an ideologue and being dogmatic is what leads to what you see in America, what you see with Brexit. I think you’ve got to just look at the evidence and be humble enough to adapt.” Aside from evidence, it’s experience he says that informs his opinions. It’s why he rejects wholesale notions of “white privilege” and “white supremacy” that are increasingly part of the anti-racism debate. “Since I was little,” he says, “I’ve always had mates, allies, people who are part of the coalition who are white. If I was ever walking down the street, and somebody used the P-word against me, or the N-word against my mates, it was my white mates who’d jump in first and there’d be a punch-up. So that sense of solidarity has alway been with me. People I grew up with, on the council estate, or people now in parts of London who live in huge deprivation, they are on free school meals, their parents can’t get jobs, many of them are white. I think you have to be a bit careful about the issue of white privilege or white supremacy.” But perhaps the greatest anxiety he now faces is the social and economic future of London in a post-Covid world. As the spectacular view from City Hall testifies, the capital has flourished as a European centre of finance, even if, as Khan is quick to note, that wealth has been far from evenly distributed.
With London’s success has come ever more people, bringing the population in recent years to its highest level in history. Brexit, which London voted against, marked the first dent in the capital’s relentless rise. But the pandemic has raised a question about what kind of city will emerge from an era of homeworking. After all, 90% of workers say they don’t want to return to the office full time. Without the offices, what will happen to all the restaurants, bars and cafes? And without all of that, what will happen to London? “That’s one of the big things that keeps you up at night,” he says, returning to the sleeplessness theme. “I think we’ve got to accept the fact that there is potentially an existential threat to central London as we know it.” That is a shocking thing to hear a mayor of a city admit, but it’s not said for dramatic effect. He says his team are working on a number of responses to the threat. “Are there going to be satellite-type offices in outer London because people may not want to work from home but in a co-working space in zone five or zone four?” he asks, conjuring an image of a suburban shift from the centre. One of the joys of London, he says, is that, unlike many big European cities, it doesn’t have a “doughnut, where the centre is for the elite and the outside for the rest of us. We have a cheek-by-jowl model, sons of bus drivers and daughters of doctors living together.” If a shortage of affordable housing has threatened that arrangement, the pandemic has placed it in long-term jeopardy. “I think there will still be a huge role for central London,” he says, remembering his role as the capital’s chief salesman, “because of our unique ecosystem. It’s not just finance, professional services, and creative industries, it’s tech, it’s culture, it’s museums, it’s arts, it’s galleries. Young people,” he concludes, “need the buzz of office space.” No doubt he’s right, but you sense the person who’s most in need of the energy of human interaction is the man himself. As I leave he is standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, striking a pensive pose for the camera, as he looks out over the city he hopes to continue representing come next May. I tell him that my 20-year-old daughter was thrilled by the fact he’s my interview subject and he lets out a big but appealingly bashful belly laugh. In spite of all the problems he carries on his slender shoulders, just for a moment the mayor of London looks as though he’s king of the world."
2020-11-22T11:15:20Z,politics,Politics,"Threat to central London as commuters embrace suburbs, warns Sadiq Khan","The Covid-19 pandemic has created a potential “existential threat” to central London because many people may in future choose to work in the suburbs rather than in the heart of the capital, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said on Sunday. In an interview in the Observer New Review, the mayor says it is issues such as this possible reconfiguration of London that keep him awake at night. He also talks openly about his struggles with mental health during the pandemic, admitting that he has found it “really hard” working from home, that he misses personal contact, including playing football every Sunday, and that lack of access to his wider family and particularly his mother has left him feeling down.
With less than six months to go before he stands for a second term in elections that have been delayed by a year as a result of Covid-19, he suggests the effects of the pandemic could be profound and lasting, changing how and where people work. “I think we’ve got to accept the fact that there is potentially an existential threat to central London as we know it,” he says. His team is, he says, working on a number of responses to the challenges. “Are there going to be satellite-type offices in outer London because people may not want to work from home but in a co-working space in zone 5 or zone 4?” he asks. Recent surveys have suggested many people who have worked from home since March would be reluctant to go back to commuting into busy city centres – partly because of their fears of the health consequences of cramming together on public transport, and partly because they have realised it can be more efficient not to spend so much time travelling. Khan stresses that whatever happens, central London will remain a huge draw. “It’s not just finance, professional services, and creative industries, it’s tech, it’s culture, it’s museums, it’s arts, it’s galleries.” But he appears to foresee big changes. He has had a bruising time trying to keep transport in London operating, with passenger numbers falling off a cliff since the first lockdown in March, and debts mounting. He accepts he “blinked” first in negotiations with Boris Johnson over a £1bn grant and £500m loan for Transport for London that involved strict conditions, including price increases.
He has produced an “Action Plan” to address concerns in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities about the Metropolitan police, including why they provide only 19% of new police recruits. Khan’s aim is to raise that recruitment rate to 40% within the next two years, and double the number of sergeants and inspectors. Black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. He says that when he was young he was stopped by the police between “10 and 20 times”. His father always told him never to talk back to the police. It was advice, he says, that he made sure to follow – at least until he was a defence lawyer in court. “Now, I’ve not been stopped in my car for ages,” he says. “But there is still that sensation you get when you’re driving a car, and you see a police car behind you and your heart starts beating faster. And that comes from the experiences you have growing up.” He adds: “What’s clear from the conversations I had with black Londoners was they would rather I be ambitious and fall short than set a target just to tick a box.” Of his own struggles during lockdown, he says: “I found it really hard working from home. I’ve never in my life worked from home. Particularly in a leadership position, it’s really hard. Lonely is the wrong word because I’m lucky, I’ve got a wife and kids, and we get on in a decent-sized house. But I thrive on company, I thrive on mixing with people, sharing ideas. Zoom meetings and Teams meetings aren’t the same.”"
2020-11-22T10:45:19Z,politics,Politics,Labour infighting inquiry ‘damaging Starmer’s position’,"The results of a “nightmare” inquiry into Labour infighting are to be published within weeks in a development that will further erode Sir Keir Starmer’s attempts to unify the party. Insiders have become concerned that Starmer has created a “major flashpoint” by launching an independent inquiry to examine the commissioning, publication and contents of a highly controversial party report leaked last year. The report, drawn up at the end of Jeremy Corbyn’s time as leader, alleges that internal hostility to his leadership hampered efforts to tackle antisemitism and damaged the 2017 election campaign. Concerns have now emerged over the scale and unpredictability of the independent inquiry, which insiders fear has taken on “a life of its own”. It is understood to have received hundreds of submissions. Party figures said the inquiry was going “anywhere and everywhere”. Another said: “We have created a real millstone here. This could be sorted out, frankly, in a few weeks, but the inquiry seems to be looking at everything. It’s become a nightmare.” The leaking of the 860-page document caused anger in the party when it emerged in the spring. The report claimed there was an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ … which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”. It makes a series of allegations about the alleged funnelling of money towards certain MPs and that others were deprived of it. It also includes disparaging remarks made by staff about Corbyn allies. John McDonnell, Labour’s former shadow chancellor, has said the report was commissioned by former general secretary Jennie Formby and put together by the party’s governance and legal unit. It was due to be submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism in the party, but that was blocked by Labour’s lawyers.
The left of the party claimed the report showed a toxic culture in Labour HQ, damaging the 2017 election effort. Meanwhile, some of those named are taking legal action, claiming privacy has been breached or their comments misrepresented. The inquiry into the report is being led by Martin Forde QC, a respected lawyer who advised the government’s Windrush compensation scheme about racial inequality in the UK. It is due to be published before the end of the year. It was originally meant to emerge in the summer. It comes as the latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggests the renewed row over Corbyn’s suspension and the antisemitism issue may have affected the party’s support. Labour trails the Tories by three points overall. Starmer’s approval ratings have also taken a hit. His net approval has fallen from 17 points to 11 points since a fortnight ago. Labour is already suffering from renewed internal unrest after Starmer’s decision not to readmit Corbyn as a Labour MP. The former leader has been informed that he will be suspended from the parliamentary Labour party for at least three months. Corbyn was suspended as a party member for suggesting that allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. He has since clarified that he did not think concerns about antisemitism were exaggerated nor overstated. His clarification led to his reinstatement as a Labour member, but Starmer has refused to allow him back into the parliamentary party. Starmer faces resignations should he allow Corbyn back as a Labour MP, with several frontbenchers said to be against it. However, the left of the party is also warning of a mass exodus of members should he refuse to reinstate him. The inquiry into the leaked report could further inflame internal warring."
2020-11-22T10:15:19Z,politics,Politics,British ski workers ‘set to lose seasonal jobs’ after Brexit,"Adieu to the British seasonaire. Barring an 11th-hour reprieve, Europe’s ski resorts will soon be largely devoid of British seasonal workers. From 1 January, post-Brexit, British employees seeking seasonal work as chalet hosts, instructors, drivers and nannies in European ski resorts will find it more difficult to obtain work.
“It’s game over unless the government makes an agreement with the EU that will mean there is a way for British staff to work across Europe in the tourism industry on seasonal jobs,” said Charles Owen, director of Seasonal Businesses in Travel (SBiT), which represents many holiday firms. The trade body claims that up to 25,000 British seasonal worker jobs in the travel industry will be lost, many contracted by UK-based companies. Currently, under the EU’s “posted worker” directive, any UK company can second staff to positions in other EU member states. The staff are on UK contracts, pay UK tax and national insurance and, under existing freedom of movement rules, do not need a work permit or immigration visa. “Unfortunately, when the Brexit transition deals ends, all that ends,” Owen said. “In the future, if a British company wants to employ British chalet staff or bar staff, they would need to get a work permit in, say, France, proving a French person couldn’t do that job by advertising at an unemployment office for eight weeks to show no one wants to apply for it; then go through a minimum two- to three-month process to get a work permit; and then, once they’ve got that, the worker must apply for an immigration visa so they can enter the country – which means it’s not going to happen.” The travel industry has been warning about the threat to British workers for more than two years. But it had been believed that this ski season would operate largely as if the UK remained part of the EU. Under the existing arrangements, UK staff who are working in the resorts before 31 December can remain in their jobs for the entirety of the 2020-21 ski season. However, Covid has thrown a large spanner in the works as a second wave of lockdowns is rolled out across Europe. “The chances of a ski season starting in December are diminishing by the day,” Owen said. “So firms have an unenviable choice: do they bring staff out, take a risk and hope they can get them on some kind of a furlough scheme? Or don’t bring them out and wait? It’s an absolute nightmare.” SBiT has launched an online petition to save jobs that is being backed by many in the industry. “As someone who has worked in the ski industry for 30 years, it is heartbreaking to see the impact, the loss of opportunity and the end of so many dreams,” said Dan Fox, managing director of SkiWeekends. “We have thousands of applications for these roles – young people from every walk of life. Every year we have staff who have never even skied but have the right attitude. We employ people we believe will succeed, we don’t care about qualifications.” Fox said he had made many friends in his 30 years in the ski industry. “And, having spent more than half overseas, I know the life-changing impact. So many of those who said ‘I’m just doing one season’ have ended up as a senior manager back in the UK. Many have created their own businesses and, between us, we have created thousands of jobs, taking people on holiday and making them happy.”
Rob Stewart, who runs a a PR firm that represents many businesses in the industry, started off as a ski instructor in the Alps 25 years ago. “What concerns me the most is the thought that ski holidays will become the exclusive right of the super-wealthy. People like myself, from very normal backgrounds, from families that weren’t used to taking ski holidays, followed a dream by working overseas and earning money from doing something we loved. I’ve managed to make a career out of that, like thousands of others. Brexit is potentially taking those opportunities away.”"
2020-11-21T22:30:05Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson ‘acted illegally’ over jobs for top anti-Covid staff,"Boris Johnson and his health secretary, Matt Hancock, acted “unlawfully” when appointing three key figures – including the head of NHS Test and Trace, Dido Harding – to posts in the fight against Covid-19, according to a legal challenge submitted by campaigners to the high court.
The Observer has seen details of documents from those pursuing the case – and initial responses from government lawyers – relating to the call for a judicial review into the appointment of Baroness Harding, who is a Tory peer, and into those of Kate Bingham to the post of head of the UK’s vaccine taskforce and Mike Coupe to the role of director of testing at NHS Test and Trace.
The case has been lodged jointly by the not-for-profit Good Law Project headed by Jolyon Maugham QC, and the UK’s leading race equality thinktank, the Runnymede Trust. If it is successful, it would represent a further serious blow to the credibility of the government’s handling of the pandemic and support claims that ministers have been running a “chumocracy”. The claimants say the appointments were made without advertising the positions, and without the open competition normally insisted on for important public sector roles. Instead they suggest those identified and then appointed were installed in part because of their Tory connections. Harding and Bingham are both married to Conservative MPs while Coupe is a former chief executive of Sainsbury’s, and was a colleague of Harding’s at the supermarket. The claimants question the experience and suitability of the three to carry out the roles and also say that because the positions were not advertised and are unpaid, the government was guilty of indirectly discriminating against others outside the very well-off, predominantly white group from which the three were chosen. They also say the government breached equality obligations for public sector appointments. In relation to Harding’s appointment by Hancock in May to head the test and trace programme, the claimants say her experience “was not such that it was obvious without a selection process that she was uniquely qualified for the role”. Hancock and Harding already knew each other, partly through horse racing connections. Harding was appointed to a second role in September as head of the National Institute for Health Protection, again without an open competition or the role being advertised.
The claimants say Bingham, who has worked in the fields of venture capital and therapeutics, and was at school with the prime minister’s sister, Rachel, “has no experience of public health administration and no expertise in immunology”. Her husband, Jesse Norman, is a Tory minister and was a contemporary of the prime minister’s at Eton. Referring to Coupe’s appointment the claimants say: “Mr Coupe’s most significant professional experience is as the former CEO of Sainsbury’s. He has no experience as a public administrator or in the health sector. He is a former colleague and friend of Baroness Harding, who worked with him at Sainsbury’s.” The claimants are inviting the court to declare that the government acted “unlawfully” in the way it made the appointments. They are not seeking to remove the three from their posts, which they accept would be disruptive at a time of crisis, but to ensure that in future governments are bound to act fairly and lawfully. Another 341 people in the UK died of Covid-19 on Saturday, and 19,875 new cases were recorded. News of the legal legal challenge comes as Johnson prepares to outline to parliament on Monday details of the restrictions that will apply after the lockdown in England ends on 2 December. He will hold discussions with his cabinet on Sunday to finalise the details of extra restrictions that will have to apply in the worst-hit areas, and how rules can be loosened for a few days over Christmas. Sources said the three-tier system would remain, although with extra restrictions imposed where necessary. Johnson may have to rely on support from Labour when the new restrictions are voted on. It is understood 70 Tory MPs have signed a letter warning they cannot support a return to a tiered system unless ministers can demonstrate measures “will save more lives than they cost”. The group, led by former chief whip Mark Harper and former Brexit minister Steve Baker, are demanding to see a full cost-benefit analysis of the restrictions being proposed after the current national lockdown ends.
A pre-action letter outlining the details of Good Law Project’s case has been sent to Johnson and Hancock. The government legal department has responded by defending all the appointments, saying the urgency of the pandemic necessitated swift, ad hoc and temporary appointments. The legal department said they were not civil service roles so fell outside the requirements for full and open competition, and praised the administrative abilities and experience of those chosen. It also dismissed the claims of indirect discrimination as baseless, saying the claimants had failed to say precisely who had been discriminated against. The government’s lawyers say the case is “unnecessary and will soon be academic”. Dr Halima Begum, director of the Runnymede Trust, said in her submission: “Corners must not be cut to the point where the government is discriminating against non-white and/or disabled people. Qualified individuals should all have an equal opportunity to compete for these vital jobs, no matter their background. They should also be able to afford to accept these jobs while supporting themselves and their families. “Dispensing with open competition and failing to remunerate full-time positions builds a perception that important jobs are being given to an inner circle of wives and friends within Westminster. This is what people increasingly call the ‘chumocracy’.” Dave Penman, head of the civil servants’ union the FDA, said: “Ensuring civil servants are recruited on merit is not only a legal obligation on the government, it is critical in ensuring the effectiveness of public services and protects the civil service from cronyism and corruption. It ensures that from local jobcentres to ministerial private offices, civil servants are recruited for what they can do, not who they know or what they believe.” Maugham said: “If our politicians care in the slightest about public trust, we need to get back to how things used to be. Public service needs to be exactly that – not a cloak for the advancement of private interests.” Good Law Project is also pursuing allegations that Covid-19-related contracts have been awarded to people with close Tory connections. Last week Julia Lopez, a Cabinet Office minister, said an internal review would be held into the awarding of private contracts during the pandemic, so ministers could be sure there was “no basis” for claims of favouritism towards Tory supporters or donors. The National Audit Office is also carrying out its own review into procurement. A spokesman for No 10 said: “We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”"
2020-11-21T20:39:41Z,politics,Politics,Christmas in lockdown preferred by UK public over new restrictions in January,"Most of the public would rather have a locked-down Christmas than have a new lockdown imposed in January, a new poll suggests. With the government considering the extent to which restrictions should be lifted to limit the impact on Christmas family gatherings, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that the public opted for a locked-down Christmas over new January restrictions by a margin of 54% to 33%. This split is almost identical across all party groups and demographics, with older voters in particular preferring to lock down over Christmas rather than in January. There was also strong support for banning people from posting conspiracy theories about the vaccine online, with 64% supporting the idea. The public are split on whether coronavirus vaccinations should be mandatory, with 42% in support and 45% opposing. Two thirds (66%) of adults in the UK would take a vaccine if it became available and were recommended by the government for people like them.
Meanwhile, the country’s two main political parties switched places in terms of overall support this week. The Conservatives lead by three points on 41%, with Labour on 38%. Labour has dropped by four points, while the Conservatives have gained three. It continues a trend since the summer which has seen neither party secure a clear lead. Keir Starmer has also surrendered his narrow lead over Boris Johnson as best prime minister. Two weeks ago, Starmer led Johnson by 33% to 31%, but he now trails him by a point. Almost a third (32%) now approve of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, up 1%, but the proportion disapproving is down from 51% to 47%.
Adam Drummond, associate director and head of political polling at Opinium, said: “If you squint really hard it’s possible to see the faintest outline of a story on both sides. For the government, the tiniest of vaccine boosts with the Conservatives inching back into the lead while the percentage disapproving of the government’s handling of the pandemic has dropped slightly, leading to an increase in their approval figures. “For Labour, the impact of another round of news stories involving the words ‘Jeremy Corbyn’ and ‘antisemitism’ may have been to lower the party’s vote share and Keir Starmer’s ratings. While we can’t tell if this is down to people being annoyed that Starmer withdrew the whip from his predecessor, or people annoyed that Labour readmitted Corbyn in the first place, the more likely impact is that the story simply reminds voters that Labour hasn’t got its house in order yet.”"
2020-11-21T18:13:56Z,politics,Politics,Officials ‘blocked access to witness’ in Priti Patel inquiry,"Boris Johnson’s former adviser on ministerial standards was prevented from interviewing a key witness for his bullying inquiry into Priti Patel’s behaviour. Legal and Whitehall sources have revealed that Sir Alex Allan sought to interview the former top Home Office civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam about his dealings with Patel, but was blocked by government officials. The inquiry was launched by the prime minister following the resignation of Rutnam over Patel’s alleged behaviour. Rutman is suing the government for constructive dismissal. Sources say Allan was informed he could not interview Rutnam because of the legal action. Allan, however, felt that his inquiry was being denied potentially crucial evidence. Even so, he uncovered sufficient material about her behaviour in three separate departments to conclude Patel had broken the code governing ministers’ behaviour. A Cabinet Office spokesman said on Saturday: “Alex Allan was satisfied he had all the information that he needed to reach his findings.” On Friday Allan resigned after the prime minister took the unprecedented step of rallying his MPs behind an effort to defend Patel, who has refused to resign. Offering what she described as an “unreserved, fulsome apology”, Patel seized on Allan’s finding that she had received no feedback on the impact of her behaviour. This is challenged by Rutnam, who said she was clearly advised not to shout and swear at staff the month after her appointment in 2019 and that he told her to treat staff with respect “on further occasions”.
The latest revelation undermines one of the main mitigating factors in Allan’s report – that “no feedback was given”. Had Rutnam been interviewed, it appears unlikely it could have concluded she had not been made aware. The revelation fuels the growing concern over the prime minister’s handling of the controversy. Sir David Normington, a former Home Office permanent secretary, said on Saturday that Boris Johnson “doesn’t seem willing to stand up for high standards in public life”. The prime minister had “simply put aside the findings of a report, and of the independent adviser Sir Alex Allan, that she is a bully, and you shouldn’t have bullies in government”, Normington told BBC Radio. “We have to put ourselves in the position of the bullied. No one has spoken up for them. Some of them are junior staff who will be sitting there today thinking that their voice has not been heard and you cannot rely on the prime minister to stand up for them.” The Conservative peer Ken Clarke, a former home secretary, said he was “troubled” by the “very awkward situation”. “It was assumed before that if an investigation was taken this far and if anyone was found to have broken the ministerial code, I don’t think anyone would have doubted the minister – to use the old phrase – would have to consider his or her position,” Clarke told Times Radio. Meanwhile, a former Tory cabinet minister said the fact that Patel could survive was extraordinary enough, but equally incredible was the prime minister’s behaviour in rallying his MPs behind an effort to defend her. The senior figure, now on the backbenches, said: “He [Johnson] has a formal role, a kind of judicial role. He should at least try to show respect for that. Instead he just sticks two fingers up at the whole process.” On Saturday questions emerged about whether Johnson attempted to tone down the bullying report, amid claims Allan had resisted pressure to make the findings more “palatable”. Downing Street did not deny the claim, with a No 10 spokesman saying: “As you would expect, the prime minister spoke to Sir Alex Allan to further his understanding of the report.”
Sources with knowledge of Allan’s inquiry into Patel confirmed he had come under “a lot of pressure”. “Allan bent over backwards to be as fair as possible to the home secretary but the weight of evidence was such that he still came to the conclusion that Patel had bullied staff,” said a legal source. It has also emerged that Allan’s investigation was conducted far more quickly than previously reported and was on the prime minister’s desk as early as April. It means Johnson elected to sit on its damning findings for seven months until pressure grew so intense he had no option but to make its findings public. Away from Westminster, senior figures from the immigration and asylum sector said Patel’s refusal to resign had destroyed any shred of political legitimacy she had. Bella Sankey of Detention Action said: “Given her conduct since becoming home secretary, she’s become a byword for a joke.”"
2020-11-21T16:50:16Z,politics,Politics,"Government must be tougher on ministers who mistreat staff, unions say","Unions have called for tougher repercussions for ministers found to have mistreated staff, after Boris Johnson’s decision not to sack or reprimand Priti Patel despite an independent inquiry finding that she had bullied civil servants. Johnson denied the ministerial code had been violated after the inquiry concluded otherwise, and insisted he had full faith in the home secretary. Unions said the move undermined protections for workers, and risked setting a “worrying precedent” for workplace behaviour. “Where investigations show bullying behaviour to be proved there must be sanctions, otherwise what’s the point?” the assistant general secretary of Unite, Gail Cartmail, said. “Unite expects every workplace to have in place clear ‘dignity at work’ policies. Policies must be backed up by training on the procedure to employees can trigger if they are bullied. Without this, the claim to oppose bullying is just lip service.
“Workplace surveys show bullying is endemic and particularly damaging if used to exercise power over junior employees. Workers are likely to become less efficient and productive, with poor self-esteem and may suffer mental ill-health leading to sickness absence.” Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), said: “Bosses must have a zero-tolerance policy and take complaints of abuse seriously. There is no place for bullying in any workplace, whether that’s on the shop floor or in the Houses of Parliament. “Bullying is abusive behaviour that causes stress and anxiety, and it can have long-term effects on victims’ physical and mental health. Employers must not turn a blind eye or condone bullying in any way. If bullies are allowed to dominate a workplace, wider morale and productivity suffers too.” Rehana Azam, the GMB national secretary, said the incident “demonstrates how this government led by Boris Johnson has allowed abhorrent behaviour and bullying to flourish against those who work to serve the public”. “It shows how indispensable and vital unions are in providing safeguards to workers in the face of bad bosses like Ms Patel,” she said. Henry Chango Lopez, the general secretary of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said: “For the findings of an independent investigation to be so swiftly brushed aside by the prime minister sets a worrying precedent and a strong signal confirming what we already know: this government does not believe in human rights at work.” IWGB said it represented precarious workers who “already face enormous barriers to report bullying at work”. The union has long been critical of the government’s record on working rights, winning a high court case last week over claims that the government failed to transpose EU health and safety protections into UK laws. “We should not be surprised either by the home secretary’s record of bullying or by the prime minister’s alleged attempts to water down these findings,” Chango Lopez said. The Cabinet Office inquiry uncovered instances of Patel shouting and swearing at staff, which the prime minister’s ethics advisor, Sir Alex Allan, said “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying”. Allan resigned on Friday after Johnson’s decision to override the report. The findings followed the resignation of the Home Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam, over what he described as Patel’s “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him."
2020-11-21T16:00:57Z,politics,Politics,Five things to watch out for in Rishi Sunak's spending review,"The Covid-19 pandemic has forced Rishi Sunak to postpone both his planned autumn budget and the announcement of plans for public spending until the middle of the decade. So uncertain is the short-term outlook that the chancellor will now outline what the government intends to spend for one year only, 2021-22. These are some of the things to look out for. New forecasts for growth and the public finances After taking account of any decisions Sunak will make on Wednesday, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will provide an assessment of the outlook for the economy. During the early stages of the crisis, the OBR said output was likely to shrink by 13% in 2020, making it the worst slump in more than 300 years. The new forecasts will not be as bad as that, but the tightening of restrictions this autumn during the second wave of the pandemic mean the OBR will still be looking at a double-digit fall in GDP of about 11% and a budget deficit in the region of £400bn – a peacetime record. Watch out for Extent of long-term scarring to the economy. Public sector pay squeeze One of the themes of the spending review will be that there will be no return to the austerity programme imposed by George Osborne when he was David Cameron’s chancellor after 2010. But above-inflation spending allocations to departments will be accompanied by a fresh attempt to curb public sector pay. Sunak will argue that this is fair because public sector pay has held up better during the pandemic than private sector wages. Over the past decade, however, public sector pay has fallen by 1.5% when adjusted for inflation, causing problems for recruitment and retention. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says public sector workers can expect no more than 1% next year. Watch out for The NHS being exempted from the squeeze. Cuts to the aid budget A commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on development aid is enshrined in law but there is a get-out clause in times of exceptional economic or financial circumstances, including when there is a substantial fall in national income. The aid budget was set to shrink anyway by about £1.5bn as a result of the economy being smaller. Cutting overseas assistance from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income would probably save a further £3bn-4bn and delight those on the right of the Conservative party who have long campaigned for a cut. Watch out for Hints that the reduction is for more than one year. ‘Levelling up’ Before Covid-19 intervened, 2020 was supposed to be the year when Boris Johnson started to deliver on his pledge to tackle Britain’s north-south divide. To this end, Sunak will pledge to rewrite the Treasury green book, which calculates where money should be spent. An inbuilt bias towards London and the south-east, where it is easier to justify the broader, beneficial impact of infrastructure projects, will shift northwards. More of a new £1.6bn potholes and road widening budget should be spent outside the south-east. Watch out for How much of the money is new, as opposed to being “recycled”. Covid and Brexit The pandemic and the UK’s departure from the EU’s single market and customs union will dominate the next few months – and both involve costs. Sunak is going to have to set aside extra cash for the NHS and local government, and to cover the costs of the extended furlough scheme. But some Whitehall departments will need money as they take on extra post-Brexit responsibilities. Sunak also needs to fund replacements for EU programmes such as financial support for struggling parts of the UK. Watch out for How many extra customs officers will need to be employed."
2020-11-21T15:46:51Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson insists he is not opposed to devolution after 'disaster' comment,"Boris Johnson has insisted he is not opposed to devolution, days after he described it as a disaster in Scotland. Speaking to the Scottish Conservatives via video link on Saturday, Johnson said his comments had been reported “not entirely accurately” and that he had been referring to “the way the SNP have handled devolution in Scotland”. “Just because I have criticised the performance of devolution does not mean I want to oppose devolution as a concept,” he said. Johnson accused the SNP of having an abysmal record in office, causing ”plummeting education standards, low business confidence and the lowest satisfaction in public services ever”.
“The key is to have policies to show how devolution can work for Scotland, for the people in Scotland, rather than the SNP obsession with making devolution work against the rest of the UK,” he said. The prime minister also called for cooperation between England and the devolved nations over the coronavirus pandemic, saying now was not the time for “division or distraction about our national constitution”. “Covid-19 doesn’t care about constitutional arrangements and whatever our political differences,” he said. “We all need to work together at this time to protect the health and jobs of the people of Scotland.” Addressing Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, Johnson said that “to tackle the shared and common threat that is Covid-19, the focus on separation has got to stop.” He also thanked the first minister and her government, however, for cooperating with Westminster and the other devolved administrations during the pandemic. The SNP’s deputy leader, Keith Brown, described Johnson’s comments as “a nothing speech that demonstrates exactly how much thought and consideration the prime minister really gives to Scotland”. “Zero effort, zero consideration, zero thought, just 10 minutes of hollow nothingness beyond more weasel words of deflection from his blunder in revealing he thinks devolution has been a disaster,” he said. Brown called on Johnson to apologise for “insulting the democratic choice of the people of Scotland and for the litany of toxic Tory policies, from austerity to a disastrous Brexit in the midst of a devastating pandemic”.
He said: “Once again, untrustworthy Johnson has demonstrated the Tories don’t care about the needs of the people of Scotland. The only way to properly protect Scotland’s interests is to become an independent, European country.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, accused the SNP earlier of Saturday of using devolution to further its ambition of independence, rather than to help people and communities. “This isn’t about devolution,” he said. “But where we have an issue is a nationalist government using devolution to further their ambition of independence. “I think we should be using devolution to help people and communities in every part of Scotland” rather “than to help an individual political party’s aims to separate Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom”."
2020-11-21T13:23:39Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak to unveil national infrastructure strategy for UK,"Rishi Sunak is set to unveil the government’s national infrastructure strategy next week, including long-term investments in the climate and transport sectors and plans to narrow the north-south divide. The strategy, which the chancellor had been due to be published in March, provides £100bn to improve connectivity in transport systems and work toward the government’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. It includes a down payment on flagship programmes including fibre broadband, flood defences and transport schemes, according to the Treasury. Sunak will announce the plans on Wednesday along with his spending review, which will provide tens of billions of pounds for infrastructure investment, including £1.6bn to tackle potholes. The strategy is also designed to push back against accusations of a discrepancy in funding for the north and south of England. The Treasury confirmed Sunak would be changing the department’s green book, a set of regulations that determines the value of government schemes and which is said to favour London and the south-east of England. Sunak will also introduce a new national infrastructure bank, which will have its headquarters somewhere in the north of England. The bank will be launched next year to replace the work of the European Investment Bank after the UK leaves the EU. The Treasury also said it would announce the location of its new northern headquarters in the coming weeks, part of a wider drive to get more civil servants to work outside London. “We are absolutely committed to levelling-up opportunities so those living in all corners of the UK get their fair share of our future prosperity,” Sunak said. “All nations and regions of the UK have benefited from our unprecedented £200bn Covid support package. And after a difficult year for this country, this spending review will help us build back better by investing over £600bn across the UK during the next five years.” Jake Berry, who leads a group of Tory MPs representing the north of England, welcomed the chancellor’s announcement. He said it demonstrated that Sunak had “‘levelling-up’ at the heart of this government’s agenda”. Unions and the Labour Party have criticised the chancellor over reports that he would announce a pay limit as part of the spending review, although NHS doctors and nurses are expected to be exempt. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, described the measures as “more empty rhetoric”. “The Conservatives have been in power for 10 long years, but their track record is a litany of failure and broken promises,” she said. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested the Treasury had got the ideas for policies including the national investment bank, the overhaul of the Treasury green book and the move north from Labour’s 2019 manifesto. “We’ll see whether it is on the scale needed to address the decade of Tory underinvestment, match the catastrophic climate crisis we face and whether it will tackle the grotesque levels of inequality they have created or line the pockets of their friends in big business,” he tweeted."
2020-11-21T10:31:56Z,politics,Politics,Ken Clarke joins criticism of Boris Johnson's refusal to sack Priti Patel,"The former home secretary Ken Clarke has expressed concern over the prime minister’s refusal to sack Priti Patel, despite a formal investigation finding evidence that she had bullied civil servants. Speaking on Times Radio on Saturday, Clarke said he was troubled by the “awkward situation”. “It was assumed before that if an investigation was taken this far and if anyone was found to have broken the ministerial code, I don’t think anyone would have doubted the minister, to use the old phrase, would have to consider his or her position,” he said. Clarke said he was particularly worried by the resignation of Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s ethics adviser, whom he described as “quiet and reasonable”. Allan quit on Friday after Boris Johnson overruled his conclusion that Patel had broken ministerial code. The prime minister had insisted that the code had not been breached, and said he had full confidence in Patel.
The former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Normington also criticised Boris Johnson for backing Patel, condemning the decision as “completely unacceptable”. Normington said it was “the first time as far as I can remember we have a prime minister that doesn’t seem willing to stand up for high standards in public life”. He told BBC Radio 4 on Saturday: “There needs to be a recognition from her [Patel] and the prime minister that she was found to have bullied staff, possibly in three departments not just the Home Office, and that is completely unacceptable. “The prime minister has simply put aside the findings of a report, and of the independent adviser, Sir Alex Allan, that she is a bully and you shouldn’t have bullies in government. “We have to put ourselves in the position of the bullied. No one has spoken up for them, some of them are junior staff and who will be sitting there today thinking that their voice has not been heard and you cannot rely on the prime minister to stand up for them.” The crossbench peer Lord Ricketts added to the criticism on Saturday, saying the decision not to reprimand Patel “sends a worrying message about the state of this ministerial code and its implementation”. He said Johnson needed to be held to account by parliament for his decision to override the inquiry’s conclusion, noting that the move was “a change from the past” when prime ministers had accepted findings. Ricketts also said reports that the prime minister had been in contact with Allan over the summer were concerning, and suggested the government publish the details of what went between the pair. He noted that civil servants were already under huge pressure dealing the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, and that there were pre-existing problems with the relationship between them and ministers. “There’s an impression that personal links to ministers matter more to this government. All of this is a worry,” he said. “It’s time that ministers restore confidence between ministers and cvivil servants.” On Friday, Patel said she was “sorry that my behaviour had upset people” and that she had “never intentionally set out to upset anyone”. But Alex Thomas, a programme director for the Institute for Government and a former civil servant, said the incident threatened the “institutions and political norms and safeguards we have in our system”. “The fact that the prime minister has just decided she didn’t break ministerial code shows the weakness of that,” he told BBC Radio 5 live. “To me, this is less a public loss of confidence, although there is an aspect of that, and more about safeguards that exist within the state to prevent wrongdoing.” Some Conservatives rallied around Johnson and Patel on Saturday, however, with the Berwick-upon-Tweed MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan saying that it was the responsibility of junior staff members to complain or ask the home secretary to change her behaviour. Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the decision over Patel’s position ultimately resided with the prime minister, but suggested that the reports into bullying allegations should be shared. “That’s a decision for the prime minister, he has reviewed the whole report and the home secretary has apologised,” Ross told Times Radio. “But ultimately it is the choice for the prime minister who sits at his cabinet table.” “I actually think there’s an argument we do see the full detail of these reports,” he added."
2020-11-20T22:30:36Z,politics,Politics,Treasury poised to name site of northern HQ within weeks,"The Treasury has said it will announce the location of a new northern headquarters within weeks as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to set out plans in next Wednesday’s spending review for levelling up Britain’s lopsided economy. Sunak is expected to use the mini-budget in the House of Commons to plough billions of pounds into regions other than London and the south-east of England, as part of plans to meet Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” promises. In an attempt to reset the government’s agenda, the Treasury said the chancellor would announce £1.6bn in funding for local roads as part of the review to cover investment in the 2021-22 financial year, aimed at fixing potholes, congestion pinch-points and other upgrades across the country. It will be drawn from the £600bn, five-year funding pot for infrastructure investment promised by the government this year. With the economy fighting to escape the deepest recession in history, the plan forms part of the delayed national infrastructure strategy, which sets out the government’s spending priorities for major public works. However, the promises of additional funding for levelling up the economy are likely to be undermined by the chancellor preparing to impose a renewed public sector pay freeze in response to record levels of public borrowing. The planned cap has angered unions and drawn accusations that the government is instead levelling down the economy through a return to austerity-era policies. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: “This is the irresponsible choice to make for the economy. Freezing pay will leave people worried about making ends meet. That means they’ll cut back on spending, and the economy will take longer to recover.” Setting out the plan to boost opportunities for parts of the country where voters backed Conservative MPs for the first time at the 2019 election, the Treasury said changes to its green book, which provides guidelines for spending decisions, would lend greater weight to projects outside of London and the south-east. As part of wider plans to move 22,000 civil servants outside of the capital by 2030, an announcement is expected within weeks on where the new northern campus of No 11 will be situated from next year. This month the Northern Policy Foundation, a Manchester-based thinktank founded by Conservative “red wall” MPs, recommended moving the Treasury to Leeds. However, there has also been speculation that a campus could be established in Darlington. Sunak said: “We are absolutely committed to levelling up opportunities so those living in all corners of the UK get their fair share of our future prosperity. All nations and regions of the UK have benefited from our unprecedented £200bn Covid support package. And after a difficult year for this country, this spending eview will help us build back better by investing over £600bn across the UK during the next five years.”"
2020-11-20T19:12:07Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson adviser quits after being overruled on Priti Patel bullying report,"Boris Johnson drove his own ethics adviser to quit on Friday as he ripped up the rulebook by refusing to sack Priti Patel despite a formal investigation finding evidence that she bullied civil servants. After a Cabinet Office inquiry, Sir Alex Allan said the home secretary’s conduct “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying” – noting instances of shouting and swearing, and finding that she had breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. Johnson seized on that caveat, seemingly dismissing the report, by insisting he judged the code had not been breached – and he had full confidence in Patel. He then urged Tory colleagues in a WhatsApp message to “form a square around the Prittster”. In a statement issued at the same time as the prime minister’s decision, Allan, who also served Johnson’s two predecessors, said: “I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister’s independent adviser on the code.” Late on Friday night, Downing Street failed to deny reports that the prime minister had tried to persuade Allan to tone down his conclusions to find there was no clear evidence of bullying. A No 10 spokesman said: “As you would expect, the prime minister spoke to Sir Alex Allan to further his understanding of the report. Sir Alex’s conclusions are entirely his own.” The shadow home office minister, Holly Lynch, said the “initial, unedited report” must be published in full and called for an independent investigation. “These are serious allegations that suggest Boris Johnson tried to interfere with an investigation into bullying accusations against one of his closest political allies,” the Labour MP said. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union for senior civil servants, said Johnson’s decision to ignore the report’s findings meant “no civil servant will now have confidence that any complaint raised about ministerial behaviour will be dealt with fairly or impartially”. Jonathan Evans, the chair of the committee on standards in public life, called Allan’s resignation “deeply concerning” and added: “This episode raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the current arrangements for investigating and responding to breaches of the ministerial code.” Patel later apologised, saying in a broadcast interview on Friday evening: “I’m sorry that my behaviour has upset people and I have never intentionally set out to upset anyone. I work with thousands of brilliant civil servants every single day and we work together, day in day out, to deliver on the agenda of this government and I’m absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset.”
However, Sir Philip Rutnam, who resigned as the Home Office’s permanent secretary after accusing Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him, added to the pressure on Patel by challenging a claim in the bullying report that she had been given no feedback about her behaviour by civil servants, and was therefore unaware of the impact. “This is not correct,” Rutnam said. “As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect, and to make changes to protect health, safety and wellbeing.” In another remarkable admission, he said he was “at no stage asked to contribute evidence to the Cabinet Office investigation”. Johnson’s decision to stand by Patel provoked fury among opposition MPs. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said: “If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job. “It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top.” No 10’s determination to brazen out the row has echoes of the prime minister’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Barnard Castle. A statement from Downing Street insisted: “The prime minister has full confidence in the home secretary and considers this matter now closed.” Conservative MPs largely rallied behind Patel, the MP for Witham, who was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign alongside Johnson and the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. Johnson’s new press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said of the prime minister: “He loathes bullying. He takes it very seriously and recognises that it is very difficult for people to come forward and raise concerns. It’s a brave thing to do, he knows that, and he believes that this process has been thorough. But it is also his responsibility to look at … the conclusions in the round.” Asked about the “Prittster” message, she said it reflected an acknowledgment that “this is a testing day for her”.
The decision came on day five of Johnson’s “reset”, after a tumultuous period in No 10 last week that ended with the resignations of his two key aides, Cummings and Lee Cain. But the outcome of the Patel inquiry, which has been sitting on Johnson’s desk for weeks, is unlikely to reassure civil servants, who may have hoped for a letup in the “hard rain” Cummings had promised would fall on Whitehall. Johnson did not appear in public himself on Friday, with the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, fronting a Downing Street press conference. Asked what the point was of having an independent adviser on ministerial standards if the prime minister ignored the advice when it was “one of his mates in the firing line”, Hancock said: “The prime minister has been clear that he doesn’t think that the home secretary has broken the ministerial code.” Rutnam has lodged an employment tribunal claim against Patel under whistleblowing laws, claiming he faced constructive dismissal after informing the Cabinet Office of the home secretary’s behaviour. Downing Street only published a one-and-a-half page summary of Allan’s report, which included criticism of the culture in the Home Office, a notoriously dysfunctional department. Patel’s predecessor, Amber Rudd, resigned over the Windrush scandal. “The civil service itself needs to reflect on its role during this period,” Allan’s report said. “The Home Office was not as flexible as it could have been in responding to the home secretary’s requests and direction. She has – legitimately – not always felt supported by the department.” In its statement, Downing Street said: “The prime minister notes Sir Alex’s advice that many of the concerns now raised were not raised at the time and that the home secretary was unaware of the impact that she had. He is reassured that the home secretary is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working.” It added: “As the arbiter of the code, having considered Sir Alex’s advice and weighing up all the factors, the prime minister’s judgment is that the ministerial code was not breached.” The chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, who repeatedly pressed Rudd over Windrush, called on the government to publish Allan’s report in full. “The issues raised by Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry are extremely serious, and his resignation in the light of the prime minister’s response makes them doubly so. I am therefore asking the cabinet secretary to provide the home affairs select committee with a copy of the full report as a first step so that we can consider the issues it raises on misconduct, bullying and the operations of the Home Office,” she said. “Public servants working in government departments must never be bullied by ministers or treated with disrespect, and they need to know there are standards and safeguards in place to prevent that happening.”"

2020-11-20T18:46:43Z,politics,Politics,Van-Tam Covid show is all 'over' but far from out,"If there was any doubt about Prof Jonathan Van-Tam’s status as the leading light of the government’s coronavirus briefings, he cemented it on Friday evening, drawing bafflement and delight by repeatedly finishing his answers with the word “over”. Perhaps inspired by his tenuous description of the country as being on a “glide path” towards a vaccine with a risk of “side winds”, Van-Tam marked his first coronavirus briefing from self-isolation “due to a household contact” with a nod to the idiom of pilots. In responses instantly destined for a million supercuts, the deputy chief medical officer for England said “over” over and over, but – crucially – avoided the rookie error of adding “and out”. Van-Tam offered no warning or explanation of his eccentric phrasing, but it was presumably intended to provide a signal to the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and the NHS England medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, that they could safely talk without interrupting him. They did not respond in kind. Previous press briefings, work meetings, Zoom calls and telephone conversations conducted throughout the pandemic as well as before have largely been navigated without using the phrase, which is typically associated with crackly two-way radio conversations in war movies. On the other hand, it is substantially less annoying for those watching the briefing than the refrain of “you need to unmute” aimed by ministers at panicking journalists. Van-Tam’s appearance was also marked by his backdrop of Boston United football programmes. He has previously worn the club tie at the government podium, to the delight of the club, and described himself as a “devout season ticket holder”, a clip which was turned into an obscure meme. His use of the glide path image, meanwhile, is not his first brush with strained analogies. Among other moments of improvised imagery, he has compared aspects of the pandemic to a swallow, to the successful first penalty at the end of a play-off final, and to waiting for a train on a wet, windy night and seeing two lights appearing on the tracks 2 miles away but then noticing it slowing down, then having it finally arrive only for the doors not to open. Over."
2020-11-20T18:25:45Z,politics,Politics,Why do so many home secretaries fall out with their officials?,"Probably of the great Whitehall departments, the Home Office has been the one in which ministers and senior civil servants most often find themselves embroiled in conflict. Whether it is the life and death nature of the subjects under discussion – policing, migration, terrorism – that lead to the tensions or something deep in the Home Office culture has always been a matter of debate. But by reputation, it is a graveyard for ministers. None of this is to excuse Priti Patel’s behaviour to her civil servants. Good bosses do not try to improve underperforming staff by bullying them. Warnings from the now-departed special adviser Dominic Cummings that a “hard rain” was coming, or Boris Johnson’s complaint that Whitehall had been sluggish in its response to coronavirus, look suspiciously like buck passing.
Michael Gove’s recent Ditchley lecture about the civil service revealed how frustrated ministers are by what they regard as a mediocre culture “hostile to risk, adventure, experimentation and novelty”. But as he himself acknowledged, change requires a more generous management style, and leaders prepared to encourage, and not just denigrate. Francis Maude’s current review of the Cabinet Office may provide answers to how to solve some of these problems. It would be wise if his review was extended to include the role of the now departed Sir Alex Allan, the adviser on ministerial standards.
He has held that post since 2011 and, on more than one occasion, his advice about wayward ministers has either been ignored, not sought or his role supplanted in an ad hoc way by the cabinet secretary. He has often tolerated these slights, but his resignation on Friday indicates he has had enough, and in the end he must have come to the view he is just an appendage, and not a true constraint on arbitrary prime ministerial patronage. Certainly, tensions between home secretaries and their civil servants are nothing new – though other holders of the office were never accused of resorting to bullying. Kenneth Baker, now Lord Baker, famously told Jack Straw, one of the few survivors at the Home Office: “Just remember as home secretary there will be 50 sets of officials working on schemes to undermine your government and destroy your political career, and the worst is not only will you not know who they are, but neither will they.” Straw received other warnings. Indeed on being appointed home secretary in 1997, Straw was driven to meet his new permanent secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, and taken to his seventh-floor office where Sir Richard instructed his new boss to look out the window, and then asked him to describe what he saw. “A clear blue sky,” Straw naively responded. Wilson replied: “Dangerous. Just remember in your job you can never be sure when an Excocet will come straight out of a clear blue sky,” pointing to Straw’s feet, “and explode right there.” The sense that the Home Office civil service was out to dominate its home secretary also afflicted another Labour home secretary. Roy Jenkins, appointed to the post in December 1965, spent his first months in office trying to bring to heel the permanent secretary Sir Charles Cunningham, a formidable Scot who had been in post since 1957 and believed all advice to ministers should come only from him personally, normally “in the form of two sheets of thick blue paper boiled down to a few hundred words of lucid explanation and boldly initialled CCC”. The possibility that there was an alternative policy course was excluded from the two sheets. In the end Jenkins got Cunningham removed and most of his “troglodyte” undersecretaries. David Blunkett was frustrated by what he once described as “rubber lever” syndrome, which often left him seething at how little he was achieving. “I didn’t take the Tony Benn view that the civil service was party political; that they were somehow against us,” he recently recalled. “I took the view that all major organisations have defence mechanisms which resist substantial change.” John Reid simply described the Home Office as not fit for purpose, and this after it had been broken up to make its agenda more manageable. A large part of the tension stems from the fact the Home Office – probably more than any other major department – is judged on delivery as much as policy. And the failure to deliver is often on newspaper front pages. Fiona Hill, the special adviser to Theresa May’s home secretaryship, recently explained to a Commons select committee how the home office is a department apart. “Sometimes what seems like a great policy on paper, when you try to implement that, it does not work operationally. In a funny way, I would say at the Home Office I almost became less politically aware and more operationally aware because I needed to understand what the implication of a policy or a piece of politics might be on the ground. “If it did not work, what happened on the ground would come back to bite not just the home secretary but the prime minister.”"
2020-11-20T16:54:52Z,politics,Politics,Alex Allan: the veteran windsurfing mandarin who quit over Patel row,"It might only have been two sentences long and dressed in formal language, but Sir Alex Allan’s resignation statement made his feelings abundantly clear. “I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,” said the veteran civil servant – who helped oversee MI5, MI6 and GCHQ in his former role as chairman of the joint intelligence committee – adding: “But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister’s independent adviser on the code.” His resignation on Friday came in the wake of his findings, based on a Cabinet Office inquiry, concluding that the approach of the home secretary, Priti Patel, “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying” – noting instances of shouting and swearing – and deciding that she had therefore breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. Boris Johnson, however, decided otherwise. As the sole arbiter of the rules, the prime minister stood by Patel, concluding in his view that she had not broken the ministerial code. So Allan might be off, but who exactly is he? The 69-year-old has held a long career in the civil service, according to a government profile, which lists his previous roles, including: principal private secretary to the chancellor and to the prime minister; high commissioner to Australia; the government’s ‘e-envoy’; permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice; and chairman of the joint intelligence committee.
When he was appointed to chair the joint intelligence committee in 2007, a series of details about his personal life were unearthed from his personal website in a security blunder. Among the more colourful entries, the website revealed him to be a devoted fan of American rock band The Grateful Dead, as well as disclosing that during a train strike he once windsurfed to work in Westminster wearing a bowler hat and suit. However, it emerged that the website also disclosed details of his address as well as his telephone numbers. Separately, the following year Allan fell into a coma after reportedly being found covered in blood by an artist who worked at his house. He regained consciousness after 10 days, with government sources indicating at the time there was no sign of foul play. • This article was amended on 23 November 2020 to add the credit for the photographer who took the image of Allan windsurfing to work: Ken Towner."
2020-11-20T16:00:15Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit deal close to being finalised, EU ambassadors told","A trade and security agreement with Britain is close to being finalised but the risk remains of an accidental no-deal Brexit in six weeks, with gaps on the contentious issues “slowly shrinking”, EU ambassadors have been told. With Michel Barnier in self-isolation after an EU negotiator tested positive for coronavirus, the talks will be conducted almost entirely online over the next few days. The European commission’s most senior official, Ilze Juhansone, told representatives of the 27 member states in Brussels that the majority of the 11 key negotiation issues now had “joint legal texts with fewer and fewer outstanding points”. The two sides are also zoning in on agreements on EU access to UK fishing waters and the design of a mechanism to ensure neither side can distort trade through undercutting standards. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, offered fresh cause for optimism during a press conference. “After difficult weeks with very, very slow progress now we have seen in the last days better progress, more movement on important files. This is good,” she said. “Within the frame of the level playing field, progress, for example, has been made on the question of state aid, but there are still quite some metres to the finish line so there’s still a lot of work to do. “Where the timelines are concerned, time pressure is high without any question at the moment. “There’s a lot to work on, because there is now substance where you can go through line by line, word for word. “The whole team is engaged and working tirelessly day and night to reach the natural deadline we have to be done by the end of the year.” It is understood that the UK’s insistence that it needs to be able to set its own environmental, labour and social standards without any prior approval remains difficult, as does the definition of the current standards from which both sides say they will not regress. The details of the treaty’s dispute resolution system is also proving hard to thrash out, with the UK wanting fisheries to be outside any sanctions regime. A UK official said: “Although there has been some progress in recent days, there is much work to be done and time is now very short. We now need to see more realism from the EU on what it means for the UK to be an independent state.” EU sources said they were increasingly optimistic that agreement could be found, although time was said to be a concern. One EU diplomat said: “There is tangible progress on a number of areas while gaps are only slowly shrinking on core issues like level playing field, governance and fisheries. “Growing concern that the negotiation process does not proceed quickly enough to ensure the ratification of a possible agreement until the end-of-the-year deadline. “Hope is nevertheless that negotiations can be finalised quickly if and once the necessary political decisions are taken in London. “At the same time, EU member states are in agreement that contingency planning needs to be ramped up in parallel to the ongoing and hopefully successful EU-UK negotiation process. Still the EU needs to be prepared for every possible outcome.” Such is the shortness of time, that Juhansone told the ambassadors it was likely they would not be able to translate the treaty of over 600 pages into all of the bloc’s 24 official languages. France’s ambassador insisted that the translation of the treaty into French was key for Paris to approve the deal, and called for a discussion on the legal nature of the agreement within days. If the treaty only involves EU competences, it will only need consent by the European parliament but the process is complicated when it affects areas where national parliaments have a decisive role. The deal, even if it involves both EU and national competences, could provisionally be brought into force on 1 January, with the national parliaments ratifying at a later date. But member states are seeking time at least for their MPs to debate the detail of the deal in the remaining month and a half. Officials dismissed suggestions that the European parliament could give its consent after 31 December. “It is not being considered,” said one source."
2020-11-20T15:57:59Z,politics,Politics,Ministerial code: five who did resign over breach accusations,"Boris Johnson’s adviser on the ministerial code has resigned after the prime minister backed the home secretary, Priti Patel, despite an inquiry finding evidence that she had bullied civil servants. The ministerial code she was accused of breaking is a set of rules and principles that outlines the standards of conduct for government ministers. The code should be read alongside the “overarching duty” of ministers to comply with the law and to abide by the seven principles of public life – ethical standards for all holders of public office outlined in the 1995 Nolan report. In the past there have been notable resignations by ministers who have been accused of breaching the code. Here are five of the most prominent. David Blunkett Blunkett quit as work and pensions secretary in 2005, saying he was “deeply sorry” for the embarrassment he had caused the then prime minister, Tony Blair. He had broken the ministerial code of conduct over paid work he took while out of the cabinet. Blunkett was a director of DNA Bioscience before the election in May that year, and took the job without consulting an independent committee. He was previously asked to step down as home secretary in 2004 over claims his office had fast-tracked a visa application for his former lover’s nanny. Liam Fox Fox resigned as defence secretary in 2011 over his working relationship with his friend Adam Werritty. At the time of his departure he was being investigated amid claims he had broken the ministerial code. In a letter to the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, Fox said he had “mistakenly allowed” personal and professional responsibilities to be “blurred”. Werritty, a lobbyist, met Fox on 18 foreign trips despite having no official role. He was a former flatmate of the former minister and the best man at his wedding. At meetings with Fox, he handed out business cards suggesting he was his adviser. The Labour party said Fox had not upheld ministerial standards and his departure had been “inevitable”. Michael Fallon In 2017, Fallon was forced to quit after allegations of harassment from female journalists. He had been accused of inappropriately touching two journalists and making unsuitable comments to his fellow MP Andrea Leadsom in cabinet meetings. His departure came after the journalist Jane Merrick informed Downing Street that he had lunged at her and attempted to kiss her after a lunch meeting in 2003. Following this incident and other scandals, Theresa May wrote a code of conduct that meant ministers could be sacked for bullying, harassment or “inappropriate or discriminating behaviour”. Fallon resigned on 1 November after admitting that his behaviour towards women had fallen “below the high standards” required. Priti Patel This is not the first time Patel has been accused of breaching the ministerial code. She was forced to resign as international development secretary in November 2017 over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians, businessmen and officials. Patel had spoken to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a meeting that the then prime minister, Theresa May, did not know about and with no officials present. Thirteen meetings were held in the presence of Lord Polak, an experienced Tory lobbyist. Patel conceded in her resignation letter that her actions had fallen below the required standards of transparency and openness. Damian Green In December 2017, Green was forced to resign as first secretary of state after making misleading and inaccurate statements about his knowledge of pornography found on his computer in 2008. He was found to have breached the ministerial code in an official report by the Cabinet Office, which found that public statements he had made relating to what he knew about the claims were “inaccurate and misleading”."
2020-11-20T14:47:08Z,politics,Politics,How Boris Johnson found grounds to ignore Priti Patel bullying verdict,"Boris Johnson’s decision to ignore the verdict of his independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan, on a bullying inquiry into the home secretary has been met with indignation. Allan, a public servant with a 47-year career in the civil service, was clear in his central finding that Priti Patel’s behaviour was in breach of the ministerial code, and he has resigned in the face of Johnson’s contrary ruling.
But did Allan’s statement on his findings leave the prime minister with some room for manoeuvre? Here we look at some of the key passages: ‘Justifiably frustrated’ The home secretary says that she puts great store by professional, open relationships. She is action-orientated and can be direct. The home secretary has also become – justifiably in many instances – frustrated by the Home Office leadership’s lack of responsiveness and the lack of support she felt in DfID [the Department for International Development] three years ago. Analysis Allan says civil servants – particularly senior civil servants – should be able to handle robust criticism, though they should not “face behaviour that goes beyond that”. In his advice, Allan suggests that on more than one occasion Patel was justified in being frustrated at the operation of the Home Office. The background to the inquiry is a rift between Patel and the former top civil servant at the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, who quit and launched tribunal proceedings against the minister. Allan acknowledges there were issues with the Home Office leadership – an allusion to Rutnam – and the lack of support. ‘May not be intentional’ The evidence is that this has manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing. This may not be done intentionally to cause upset, but that has been the effect on some individuals. Analysis Here Allan gives the first hint of the sort of behaviour Patel was displaying – that is, shouting and swearing at civil servants. But he appears to excuse it with the caveat that is was not intentional, a feature he returns to, as well as calling the behaviour “forceful expression”. ‘Intimidating or insulting’ The definition of bullying adopted by the civil service accepts that legitimate, reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker’s performance will not amount to bullying. It defines bullying as intimidating or insulting behaviour that makes an individual feel uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down. Instances of the behaviour reported to the Cabinet Office would meet such a definition. Analysis This passage is particularly damning, suggesting that Patel engaged in behaviour that made civil servants feel “uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down”. However, Allan falls short of concluding whether the behaviour was proven to have taken place, saying the instances “reported” to the Cabinet Office “would” meet the definition. ‘No feedback’ The Home Office was not as flexible as it could have been in responding to the home secretary’s requests and direction. She has – legitimately – not always felt supported by the department. In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed. Analysis Again, Allan criticises the Home Office and concludes that Patel “legitimately” did not feel supported by the department. He spells out that the home secretary was not given opportunity to address the criticism of her approach, which in the bureaucratic world of the civil service – where disciplinary procedures and complaint processes are followed meticulously by the book – is a crucial oversight. ‘In breach of the code’ My advice is that the home secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. This conclusion needs to be seen in context. There is no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time. The high pressure and demands of the role in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department, has clearly been a contributory factor. In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her. Analysis Despite all the caveats, and the nods towards Patel’s frustration, Allan does reach a conclusion. And that is that Patel did breach the ministerial code. But Downing Street appears to have seized on his finding that she did so “unintentionally” as a way to wriggle out of sacking her. Allan also excuses to some extent her behaviour, pinning some blame on the “high pressure” of office and lack of support from the then leadership – another nod to Rutnam. And he signs off by highlighting that Patel has shown somewhat of a turnaround and is behaving more positively since the allegations were raised."
2020-11-20T14:32:42Z,politics,Politics,What they said: three key players in the Priti Patel bullying affair,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has apologised for “behaviour in the past” in response to an investigation into bullying allegations by Whitehall’s top adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan. But Patel escaped losing her job after Boris Johnson ignored the findings, prompting the senior civil servant to resign. This is what three key people involved in today’s dramatic events have said. Sir Alex Allan
In his report, Allan said: “My advice is that the home secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. “Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. “To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally.” In his resignation statement, he said: “I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code. “But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister’s independent adviser on the code.” Priti Patel
In response to Allan’s report, Patel said: “I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people. It has never been my intention to cause upset to anyone. I am very grateful for the hard work of thousands of civil servants who help to deliver the government’s agenda. “I care deeply about delivering on the commitments we have made to the people of this country and I acknowledge that I am direct and have at times got frustrated. “I would like to thank the prime minister for his support. The permanent secretary and I are working closely together to deliver on the vital job the Home Office has to do for the country.” Matthew Rycroft
The Home Office’s permanent secretary, its top civil servant, Matthew Rycroft, said: “Sir Alex Allan’s findings make difficult reading, including for the civil service. “The home secretary and I are committed to working together to improve the Home Office and build the strongest possible partnership between ministers and officials based on support, candour, safety to challenge, mutual respect and professionalism. Relationships between ministers and officials have improved considerably. “Day in, day out, Home Office staff work tirelessly to keep the public safe, cut crime, and improve our immigration and asylum system, and we are determined that they should do so in a supportive environment that respects their wellbeing.”"
2020-11-20T13:48:21Z,politics,Politics,'Unreal': Constituents' fury grows 50 days after Ferrier broke Covid rules,"Kelly Livingstone was half-watching the 10 o’clock news on Thursday 1 October when she noticed an image of the MP Margaret Ferrier flash up on the screen. The co-owner of Vanilla beauty salon in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, immediately turned up the volume: “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she was in the salon on Saturday!’” Livingstone watched, aghast, as the report detailed how the Scottish National party member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West had travelled to London and spoken in the Commons while awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, then returned by train from London to Scotland after receiving a positive result. What was not included in the initial report was the fact that Ferrier had visited several local businesses on the day she took the test. Speaking for the first time about the immediate aftermath of Ferrier’s reckless behaviour, Livingstone told the Guardian: “All the girls started panicking; would we have to close down, or self-isolate? This was when [contact tracing] was quite new, so we didn’t know how it worked.” There followed a lengthy police interview, photographers at the door, and the understandable anxiety that a direct public association with Ferrier would deter customers from the new business, which had only opened its doors a fortnight before the UK’s first lockdown in March. Yet Livingstone’s initial reaction was remarkably generous. “We saw how much negativity she was getting and didn’t want to add to that. We issued a statement reassuring our clients that the salon was safe, and left it.” Fifty days later, she is preparing to close her business for a second time as the west of Scotland enters near-lockdown, and her sympathy for Ferrier – who continues to sit as an independent MP after the SNP immediately withdrew the whip – has evaporated. “I am gobsmacked that we are facing closure again but she is still taking a high salary and has not faced any consequences.” “Unreal” is how Livingstone describes Ferrier’s refusal to step down, despite widespread and continuing condemnation, including from her own former party leader, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Elsewhere in the constituency that sense of betrayal and frustration is felt even more sharply as the local context changes. “We’re going into lockdown again because of people like her,” said Eilidh Hamilton, who works at the flower shop on Rutherglen’s Main Street. Her anger is palpable: “I’ve signed three different petitions but she’s still here. We’re not being listened to. It’s infuriating.”
Due process, of course, works to its own timetable: while the Met police in London decided to take no further action against Ferrier, Police Scotland announced on Wednesday that it had submitted an initial assessment to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and would be carrying out further inquiries under their direction. Any police investigation takes precedence over that of the Commons standards commissioner, whose final sanction could trigger a recall petition, which would allow her constituents to decide whether they want a byelection. The SNP is awaiting the outcome of these strands of inquiry while Ferrier remains suspended from the party. However, constituents raise a practical consequence of this extended limbo: while Ferrier did appear via video link, rather bizarrely with her camera switched off, at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday to raise a case on behalf of a constituent, on the streets her absence is noted again and again. Livingstone contacted Ferrier for help when she struggled to access a business grant in March: “If I ever need help again, who do I turn to? Because the last person I want to ask for help is Margaret Ferrier.” Clare Haughey, an SNP MSP whose Holyrood constituency overlaps with Ferrier’s, recognises the phenomenon: “A number of constituents have been in touch with me on reserved issues as they have categorically refused to contact Margaret, which I think speaks volumes. People need to have trust in their elected representatives.” Like almost all of Ferrier’s party colleagues, Haughey is firm: “I have been very clear throughout – to my constituents publicly and by messaging Margaret privately – she must resign.” The local paper, the Rutherglen Reformer, likewise finds it difficult to quote the MP, and still receives angry messages from readers demanding to know why she has not stood down, and why nothing can be done about that. In early October, the Reformer published a furious open letter to Ferrier on its front page, calling for her to resign “before you become a social pariah and not just a political one”. Ged Killen, the former Scottish Labour MP who lost his seat to Ferrier in 2019 after ousting her two year earlier, is convinced it would be easy to gather the required number of signatures – 10% of the electorate – to prompt a byelection, and anticipates a cross-party campaign to do so. “People need an opportunity to express their frustration. A byelection will offer people the representation they deserve in a pandemic.” In her only interview since the initial statement of apology, Ferrier discussed how she “panicked” after receiving the positive test result in her Commons office. Those who know her well say she has been shocked by the degree of castigation, but they also identify a stubborn, unstrategic streak that may go some way to explaining why she has hunkered down rather than attempting to repair local damage. For Livingstone, “sorry” would be a good place to start. “People still say: ‘Oh, that’s the salon that MP used’. Every second client asks me: ‘Has she contacted you to apologise?’ It would have been a really nice gesture, but there’s been nothing.”"
2020-11-20T13:25:25Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel bullying inquiry: why was it held and what did it find?,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has avoided the sack despite a Cabinet Office inquiry reportedly uncovering evidence of bullying within the Home Office. The inquiry concluded that Patel broke the ministerial code of conduct, but the prime minister, Boris Johnson, ignored the findings and ruled that she did not break the code. As a result, she will not lose her position. Here we take a look at the background to the inquiry: What were the allegations? Allegations against Patel emerged in March after the resignation of Philip Rutnam, the former Home Office permanent secretary, over what he described as a “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him for challenging the alleged mistreatment of civil servants. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel, who is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. Further allegations emerged against Patel in the aftermath. An official in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) received a £25,000 payout after she alleged that she had been bullied in 2015 by Patel, who was employment minister at the time. The DWP did not admit liability and the case did not come before a tribunal. Officials in Patel’s private office at the Department for International Development allegedly accused her of humiliating civil servants in front of others while a minister in 2017. What was the process? The Cabinet Office inquiry was launched in March by Michael Gove and conducted by Helen MacNamara, the civil service’s head of ethics. The prime minister has been advised by Sir Alex Allan, Whitehall’s independent adviser on ministerial standards. The inquiry was completed at the start of the summer and forwarded to No 10. What did it find? The prime minister has not published the full report. But a statement published by Allan revealed that Patel had “not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect”. Allan added: “Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals.” The statement revealed that at times Patel had shouted and sworn at civil servants due to the “Home Office leadership’s lack of responsiveness and the lack of support”. Allan said Patel’s behaviour met the civil service definition of bullying as “intimidating or insulting behaviour that makes an individual feel uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down”.In separate proceedings, Patel is also facing the possibility of being questioned at a 10-day employment tribunal hearing next September after lawyers for Rutnam pushed forward with a claim for constructive dismissal. What is the ministerial code? The ministerial code is a government document setting out the standards expected of ministers in office. In the foreword, the prime minister writes: “There must be no bullying and no harassment.” Crucially, ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code and there are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach. It is not the first time Patel has been accused of breaching the ministerial code. The Essex MP was forced to resign from the cabinet in November 2017 as international development secretary over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. What did Johnson decide and what were his options? As the sole arbiter of the rules, the prime minister decides if there has been a breach. He ignored Allan’s findings and decided Patel did not breach the code. As a result, Allan, a public servant with a long career in the civil service, has resigned. It has been reported that Patel, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner, will be handed a written warning and was ordered to make an apology. The prime minister came under significant criticism earlier this year for failing to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, over his infamous breach of the coronavirus regulations. Critics have accused Johnson of not having the mettle for confrontation, and of bending the rules for those in his inner circle. Some reports have suggested that while Johnson may not sack Patel or ask her to resign, he could move her to a different position in a reshuffle later this year or early next year. How has Patel responded? The home secretary has issued a carefully worded apology, that does not concede any wrongdoing. She said: “I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people. It has never been my intention to cause upset to anyone.” What are Patel’s critics saying? Labour has written to the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, urging it to investigate Patel’s conduct, and allegations that the prime minister interfered with the investigation. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “These are deeply serious revelations and have all the hallmarks of a cover up from the prime minister.” What are her allies saying? Several Tory MPs have offered Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that she was popular across the party because she was “hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many”. Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said Patel was doing a “huge job”, adding: “Like many women operating in a man’s world, you have to be strong and decisive.” The Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said he was “proud that my friend and neighbour @pritipatel is leading the Home Office and delivering increased police numbers and secure borders”. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, also tweeted his support."
2020-11-19T20:41:17Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn to have Labour whip suspended for at least three months,"Jeremy Corbyn has been told he will have the Labour whip suspended for at least three months, as more than a dozen members of the party’s governing body attacked Keir Starmer, saying the decision “flies in the face of natural justice”. The Guardian understands that the chief whip, Nick Brown, wrote to Corbyn on Thursday night saying the whip had been withdrawn for three months – suspending him from the parliamentary Labour party – pending an investigation into whether he had broken the PLP code of conduct. Corbyn has been told the decision will be kept under review and his conduct during the suspension will be taken into account. He had been suspended from the Labour party as a whole in late October over comments he made in the wake of a report by the equalities watchdog about antisemitism in the party. He said the scale of the problem had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. In the most open declaration of civil war in the party yet, a letter from left-aligned members of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) said they expected the whip to be returned as a consequence of a decision by an NEC panel on Tuesday to give the former leader a formal warning and restore his membership to the overall party. “The decision of the leader the following day to withhold the whip from Jeremy Corbyn MP is an act of deliberate political interference in the handling of a complaint,” the letter to the general secretary, David Evans, says. “It defies the decision of the NEC panel, is a matter of double jeopardy that flies in the face of natural justice, it undermines the rule book and it is precisely the type of action found to be unlawful indirect discrimination by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission [EHRC] report.” The letter criticised Starmer’s statement that the Jewish community had no faith in the process of the NEC’s disputes panel, which it said was a “direct criticism of the decision reached by the disputes panel on Tuesday ... This criticism has been joined by that from other MPs, no doubt following the lead of the leader.” The letter said the NEC panel received legal advice on the day about the sanction given to Corbyn. “This is an unacceptable attack on the lay volunteers elected to uphold the rule book, it is direct political interference and it is unacceptable.” It said the party would now face legal action as a result of the decision and said it was “unconscionable” that NEC members should be put in this position. It called on Evans to reprimand Starmer for his actions, which it says were “intended to undermine confidence in the dispute process and for taking a decision that is directly contradictory to the NEC panel decision”. Corbyn’s lawyers have also written to Labour calling for him to be allowed back into the parliamentary party. It is understood his legal team have also made subject access requests to several key members of Starmer’s team and staff in the party’s complaints unit. The lawyers’ letter to the party questions whether procedures were properly followed when the decision not to restore the whip was taken. Starmer’s decision not to restore the whip to Corbyn following his suspension provoked a significant backlash. Earlier on Thursday, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, blamed a “politicised” disciplinary process for Corbyn’s readmittance, the day after a former MP quit the party in protest at Starmer’s treatment of his predecessor. Thelma Walker was a former parliamentary aide to Dodds’s predecessor as shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, but lost her seat in the 2019 election. She tweeted on Wednesday: “Tonight I attended my branch meeting and resigned my membership of the Labour party. It was a privilege to serve as Labour MP for Colne Valley, to be PPS to John McDonnell and to work with Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. I will continue to work for the many not the few.” Dodds said the EHRC had found that Labour’s disciplinary process was not fit for purpose and should be replaced with an independent system, which the party has said it will deliver. “It’s a matter of huge regret and shame to my party that it found we were wanting. We have to sort out that system. It cannot remain as a politicised system. Keir Starmer has committed to altering it and … we are now under a statutory duty,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Dodds said the decision to readmit Corbyn under the previous system “indicates that that process is not the right one, it’s not the one that we need … We have six weeks to respond to that report and a large element of the response is going to be around setting up a new process, which is completely independent, which everyone can have confidence in, including the Jewish community.”
The MP Margaret Hodge, the parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, who is understood to have told Starmer on Tuesday night she would resign from the party after the initial decision to readmit Corbyn, said refusing to return the whip to Corbyn “did a lot to restore his credibility”. “The terrible truth is that he [Corbyn] constantly makes himself the centre of the argument,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What we need to root out is antisemitism, and for as long as he is one of the individuals who refuses to accept the extent of antisemitism in the party, who constantly says that people like me have been politically motivated and are attacking him personally instead of attacking the antisemitism that he expressly tolerates, and has allowed to spread right through the party – that’s really the problem.”"
2020-11-19T20:16:13Z,politics,Politics,Barnier self-isolates and Brexit talks halt after EU official tests positive,"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was forced to go into self-isolation and face-to-face Brexit talks in Brussels have been suspended after a member of the bloc’s negotiating team tested positive for coronavirus. In a development that will put further pressure on the tight timeline for a successful outcome in the trade and security talks, Barnier shut down the talks in the Belgian capital with the agreement of his British counterpart, David Frost. The two sides had been aiming to strike an agreement by next week to allow time for the European parliament to ratify any potential deal, with a possible emergency sitting on 28 December pencilled in. In an attempt to keep to that tight deadline, the two sides said video conference negotiations would continue but British officials are expected to leave Brussels on Friday. The talks were also suspended in March when Barnier and Frost contracted the virus. It is understood that none of the 50 UK officials in Brussels will need to quarantine as they were not in close contact with the EU official. Barnier’s team has been more affected by the development. Under Belgian law, anyone testing positive should quarantine for seven days while those who have had contact with an infected person must stay in isolation for 10 days. The EU’s chief negotiator tweeted: “One of the negotiators in my team has tested positive for Covid-19. With David Frost we have decided to suspend the negotiations at our level for a short period. The teams will continue their work in full respect of guidelines.” It is understood Barnier will ask a commission official outside his senior team to brief EU ambassadors in person on Friday morning about the latest twists and turns in the negotiations. Shortly after Barnier’s announcement, Frost also issued a short statement. He tweeted: “I am in close contact with Michel Barnier about the situation. The health of our teams comes first. I would like to thank the European commission for their immediate help and support.” The negotiation is on a knife-edge, prompting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to call on the European commission to ramp up no-deal preparations to prepare businesses for the worst. The UK and EU teams have been locked in talks in Brussels since Monday. In six weeks the UK’s transition period will end and it will leave the EU’s single market and customs union. A UK government spokesman said: “With respect to the relevant public health guidance, the UK and EU teams have agreed to continue to negotiate remotely for the time being. The talks will resume in person when it is judged safe to do so. The health and welfare of our staff are our priority. “The negotiations have been conducted throughout in a way that is consistent with applicable social distancing laws and guidance.”"
2020-11-19T20:00:22Z,politics,Politics,Bullying inquiry 'found evidence Priti Patel broke ministerial code',"A Cabinet Office inquiry into allegations of bullying by Priti Patel has found evidence that she broke the ministerial code, informed sources have told the Guardian. Boris Johnson, the sole arbiter of the rules, is expected to release a decision on the inquiry within weeks but it is not likely to demand the home secretary’s resignation. Sources familiar with the inquiry said it had found evidence that civil servants were treated poorly by Patel, as well as compelling evidence of bullying. Pressure on the prime minister to sack Patel is growing as a result of claims of bullying and harassment from civil servants in three separate government departments. Speculation over the inquiry has prompted condemnation of the Cabinet Office inquiry process, which is conducted in secret and offers no recourse for complainants. Johnson has already been criticised for compromising the process by insisting before the inquiry had ended that he would continue to support Patel. Patel has denied allegations of bullying. Allies have described her as a “demanding” boss but not a bully. Allegations against the MP for Witham emerged in March after the resignation of Philip Rutnam, the former Home Office permanent secretary, over what he described as a “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him for challenging the alleged mistreatment of civil servants. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel, who is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. It also emerged that an official in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had received a £25,000 payout after she alleged that she had been bullied in 2015 by Patel, who was employment minister at the time. The DWP did not admit liability and the case did not come before a tribunal. Officials in Patel’s private office at the Department for International Development allegedly accused her of humiliating civil servants in front of others while a minister in 2017. Patel is also facing the possibility of being questioned at a 10-day employment tribunal hearing next September after lawyers for Rutnam pushed forward with a claim for constructive dismissal. The Cabinet Office inquiry was launched in March by Michael Gove and conducted by Helen MacNamara, the civil service’s head of ethics. The prime minister has been advised by Alex Allan, Whitehall’s independent adviser on ministerial standards. It was completed at the start of the summer and forwarded to No 10. It is understood that some in government will claim that Patel’s behaviour towards staff had been “unintentional”, because she was unaware of the effects of her actions. Rutnam’s tribunal claim alleges that bullying behaviour aimed at him, through anonymous briefings to the media, intensified after he had raised staff concerns with Patel about her behaviour. A sleaze watchdog criticised Johnson last week for failing to rule on the inquiry’s findings. Jonathan Evans, the former head of MI5 and now adviser on standards in public life, told the Times: “When you have got these allegations that have not really been put to bed then it’s easy to say they’ve just been brushed over and I don’t think that’s ideal for public trust and public standards. “The Priti Patel case would be an example. The Cabinet Office has done some form of investigation. It has not been published so it is very difficult to know whether there was something here or whether there wasn’t.” Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union which represents senior civil servants, said that if any substance had been found in any of the allegations against Patel, the prime minister should conclude that the code had been breached. “Having pledged his support for the home secretary when the investigation began, and now sat on the report since the summer, he has already undermined confidence in this being a fair and impartial process. “Boris Johnson now needs to make the decision to publish the report and commit to introducing a new, fully independent and transparent complaints system. This is the only way to restore any kind of faith in the process and prevent this kind of drawn out speculation in the future, which is unfair to both victims and those accused,” he said. The ministerial code says “harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour” will not be tolerated. Ministers are “personally responsible” for how they act, it says, and they can stay in office “for so long as they retain the confidence of the prime minister”. A government spokesman said: “The process is ongoing and the prime minister will make any decision on the matter public once the process has concluded.”"
2020-11-19T18:51:36Z,politics,Politics,"Christmas gatherings could wipe out Covid gains, UK experts warn","Leading scientists have expressed concern at government plans to allow Britons to see extended family members at Christmas, with one saying that with vaccinations seemingly imminent, it would be tragic to throw away gains in suppressing the virus. Andrew Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), questioned the idea of allowing older people to mix with relatives at a time of year when respiratory diseases are most prevalent. Gabriel Scally, an epidemiologist at Bristol University, and a member of the unofficial Independent Sage group of scientists, was even more blunt: “There is no point in having a very merry Christmas and then burying friends and relations in January and February. We need to think very seriously about Christmas and how we’re going to spend it,” he told ITV. Downing Street has yet to fully decide either the regional tiers of restrictions that will replace the England-wide lockdown from 2 December or what will happen at Christmas, but it is understood the default choice for the festive period is to allow several households to mix indoors. The idea is to agree unified rules across the UK for the Christmas period, and talks are taking place between Downing Street officials and the devolved governments.
Speaking in a personal capacity, Hayward told the BBC: “My personal view is we’re putting far too much emphasis on having a near normal Christmas. We know respiratory infections peak in January, so throwing fuel on the fire over Christmas can only contribute to this. “We’re on the cusp of being able to protect those elderly people who we love through vaccination and it would be tragic to throw that opportunity away and waste the gains we’ve made during lockdown by trying to return to normality over the holidays.” Hayward also expressed worry that restrictions have been too changeable. “When policies are undulating between ‘stay at home to save lives’, ‘eat out to help out’, the tier system, second lockdown and proposals for an amnesty on social distancing, it’s a highly inconsistent message. Whereas in fact the things that people need to do to stay safe and to keep their loved ones safe are relatively simple.”
It is understood other Sage members share this view, and are worried about the consequences of pushing ahead with an easing of restrictions over Christmas. Government officials say they recognise the risks, but have to take into account the realities of how people are likely to act. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has told the government it must start planning now for any change over Christmas. He told ITV that Boris Johnson must “put in the measures now, in the next few days, that make it possible for us to make a reasoned decision about what we do in the Christmas week”. He said: “If he is worried that we can’t have a relaxation at Christmas, he needs to step up the measures now. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Boris Johnson have to get together and find a basis on which we can have common rules so that people can, if it’s possible, travel to see their loved ones in different parts of the country.”
After the current lockdown ends, ministers are set to replace it with a tiered system of regional measures, expected to be tougher than the pre-lockdown three-level one. Public Health England has said modelling shows that for every day restrictions were eased at Christmas, they would then need to be tightened again for five days. A YouGov poll on Thursday which asked people how many days of looser restrictions they would want if this was the case found that 40%, by far the biggest proportion, would opt for no days off from Covid rules."

(See 4.48pm.) This may be evidence that the lockdown is succeeding in bringing the second wave of the virus under control. Other figures have shown Covid cases falling in England in most age groups. (See 2.49pm.) One group of epidemiologists studying the pandemic says that R is now probably around 1 in all regions of England and that England is probably approaching the peak for daily deaths. (See 6.05pm.) Deaths tend to peak around three weeks or so after infections have peaked. In Scotland R is now estimated to be slightly below 1. (See 12.49pm.) The former prime minister Gordon Brown has urged Boris Johnson and the devolved governments to take tougher measures on coronavirus now to allow for family get-togethers over Christmas, saying the UK cannot afford to be â€œbehind the curveâ€� in its planning. Oxford Universityâ€™s scientists have said there is no rush to publish efficacy results from their Covid vaccine trial, playing down expectations that some of the 100m doses the UK has ordered may be available by Christmas. A drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis appears to help patients who are admitted to intensive care with the most severe coronavirus infections, researchers say. One in seven businesses in Britain was teetering on the brink of collapse even before the new lockdown in England came into force at the start of November, the latest official snapshot of trading conditions has revealed. The troubled Brexit trade and security talks have been suspended at the highest level and Michel Barnier has gone into self-isolation after a member of the EUâ€™s negotiating team tested positive for coronavirus. Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to commit to maintaining UK overseas aid spending at 0.7% of GDP, in a Commons debate where he unveiled a Â£16.5bn, four-year boost to the defence budget that he said would help equip the military with â€œdirected energy weaponsâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-19T18:18:26Z,politics,Politics,Pressure grows on Jacob Rees-Mogg over MPs' remote access,"Jacob Rees-Mogg is facing intense pressure to widen virtual participation in House of Commons proceedings after senior Conservative MPs joined calls for a change in the rules, with one saying the the system was “farcical”. The former Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley said the current situation was “utterly farcical,” as she urged the Commons leader to allow any MP to join debates by video link during the pandemic, if they needed to. Bradley was launching a report by the cross-party procedure committee, which she chairs, urging Rees-Mogg to make the rules “uniform” for all parliamentary procedures. MPs can participate virtually in “scrutiny” proceedings, such as urgent questions, but not in “substantive” proceedings such as debates on legislation. Any MP can request a proxy vote. As Rees-Mogg sat on the frontbench, Bradley said: “The public will be baffled by a situation where the prime minister can answer prime minister’s questions virtually yesterday, and make a statement to the House virtually today, but cannot then take part in a debate until he has finished self-isolating. This is an utterly farcical situation.” Boris Johnson is self-isolating after coming into contact with an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus. Bradley also highlighted the case of the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, who was unable to take part in a Westminster Hall debate on cancer last week, because she is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer and cannot attend in person. Rees-Mogg blamed her inability to join the debate on the inadequacy of broadcasting equipment. Bradley was backed by several senior MPs. The mother of the House, Harriet Harman, said:“It’s the role of the leader of the House to support MPs being able to do their job and speak in debates: not for him to set up exclusions.” Rees-Mogg’s Conservative predecessor as Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, also joined calls for a change in the rules, saying: “It is absolutely unacceptable that members are still unable to fulfil their jobs properly in our parliament.” The Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone, who represents Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, said he was a carer for his wife and did not want to risk travelling to Westminster and catching the virus. “Surely this situation is extremely corrosive to our precious democracy?” he said. Tensions between senior Tories and Rees-Mogg are unlikely to please the new Downing Street team, who have made improving relations with the parliamentary party a priority after the departure of Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings, who was often scathing about MPs. Rees-Mogg tabled a government motion this week that would allow those MPs who are certified by a doctor as “clinically extremely vulnerable”, such as those with underlying health conditions, to join debates virtually. But many MPs including on his own side were furious at the lack of time allowed to discuss the issue and the limited scope of the concession. Labour’s Chris Bryant tabled an amendment calling for much wider virtual participation, which caused the government motion to fall. Rees-Mogg tabled his motion again on Thursday – and Bryant again tabled an amendment, with the Conservative MP John Baron. The two sides are now locked in a standoff. Bradley urged the government to allow a debate next week so MPs could express their views. Challenged on the issue earlier this week, Rees-Mogg said arrangements were under review – but defended his decision to move away from the full “hybrid parliament” that operated during the first lockdown. “We had to move back to a more physical parliament to ensure that we could deliver on the manifesto commitments, ensure that the government were held to account, allow for backbench business debates and get on with business,” he said."
2020-11-19T18:14:26Z,politics,Politics,Blown budgets and delays: a recent history of UK defence spending,"The era of defence budget cuts is over, Boris Johnson has declared, as he announced an extra £16.5bn is to be ploughed into protecting the UK in a “perilous” global security climate. But the bean counters in Whitehall may have cause for concern, with the country arguably having a chequered recent past when it comes to defence spending projects. Here are some notable examples: Nuclear weapons The Ministry of Defence’s poor management of the country’s nuclear weapons programme led to costs soaring by £1.35bn and lengthy delays, a damning report by the government spending watchdog found earlier this year. The National Audit Office’s report, released in January, looked at three security sites in England – known as the Defence Nuclear Estate – establishing that infrastructure projects faced delays of between 1.7 and 6.3 years. Costs increased by £1.35bn, the report disclosed, with nearly half of the sum down to construction starting too early and subsequently having to be revised. Civil servants had relied on the work of “monopolistic” suppliers, meaning contracts could not be terminated if poor performance was identified, the report said. The MoD said at the time it was carefully examining the conclusions but was committed to strengthening the management of the nuclear programme. Aircraft carriers At £6.2bn, the expected cost of two aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy is nearly double the original estimate, it emerged in late 2013. When the project was approved in 2007, costs were put at £3.65bn. But the then defence secretary, Philip Hammond, confirmed to the Commons in November 2013 that the new figure had been arrived at “after detailed analysis of costs already incurred and future costs and risks over the remaining seven years to the end of the project”. Before the increased cost was confirmed, Labour’s shadow defence secretary at the time, Vernon Coaker, labelled it as the “the latest in a series of financial fiascos in the MoD under David Cameron”. He added: “The defence secretary’s claim that he has balanced the MoD books looks increasingly nonsensical. Britain deserves better than this shambolic approach to our nation’s defence.” Warrior armoured vehicles It was meant to be at the heart of the reorganisation of the army, but last year it transpired that the Warrior armoured vehicle programme upgrade was three and a half years behind schedule and £227m over budget. Initially projected to cost £1.3bn, the vehicles’ upgrade – which is set to extend their lifespan by 15 years – was due to be completed by March 2020. But, in a letter to the head of the Commons public accounts committee last January, Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary at the MoD, reportedly set out details of the forecasted delay and overspend. The MoD said last March, when details of the overspend emerged, that “there have been initial challenges to overcome”, adding that “we have brought this project back on track”. But Labour’s then shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, said the government’s “complete failure to manage this programme properly is putting this important capability at risk”."
2020-11-19T17:19:59Z,politics,Politics,An expensive sinking feeling as Johnson seeks to rule the waves | John Crace,"It was meant to be an Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. But when you’re trying to convince the country and the US president-elect that your government isn’t in a bit of a mess after the departure of several senior No 10 advisers and that you do have some vaguely credible ideas, then you make do with what you’ve got. So from the same Downing Street basement echo chamber – this time with a hint of a union flag – that he had used for prime minister’s questions the day before, Boris Johnson gave a statement on the Unintegrated Review of Security and Defence. For too long, Johnson insisted, the UK had been in retreat. It might have come as a surprise to him that much of the retreat had been on his own party’s watch as the Conservatives have been in power for more than 10 years and it is they who had been cutting the defence budget by £8bn. But now we were entering a new era of plenty whereby the armed forces would get a £16.5bn increase in spending – over and above the 2.2% already promised – over the next four years. There was a time when such large amounts of money would have been announced with more caution. But as we’re already spending £250bn and counting on the coronavirus, a mere £24.1bn is now regarded as chicken feed. Boris has come to realise that if you don’t have the cash, then you can always print it. “The chancellor and the defence secretary believe in this as much as I do,” he said. Which is a lie. Rishi Sunak is known to have been deeply resistant to such a large departmental budget rise, but had to give in when he saw how excited Boris was about the project. But what was done was done and Rishi was happy to take the credit in another of his personalised tweets. Dominic Cummings may be gone, but there are still plenty of power struggles going on inside government and no point is too petty not to be scored. Johnson rattled through his Christmas toy list. There was going to be more money for cyber-weapons – Boris is one of the few world leaders not to have realised the Star Wars films were not documentaries – and the army was to be equipped with whatever it needed: phasers, lightsabers and special top secret communications to let them know where the enemy was. It might be handy if No 10 also got some new comms thrown in as a job lot. The sound quality of the statement was, if anything, even worse than the day before, with the prime minister frequently dropping out or failing to identify who was speaking. There were also going to be many more ships with the latest hi-tech equipment and Britannia would once again rule the waves. Johnson has always had a thing about the navy. There would be no ocean off limits to our frigates, though we probably wouldn’t be getting too close to China. Not because we were a bit frightened of the Chinese, of course: just that they were a very, very long way away. The Labour leader kept his reply short and sweet. He welcomed the additional spending but felt this was an announcement without a strategy. There was nothing on how it would be paid for and no commitment that the Tories would stick to their manifesto promise of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid. It sounded very much as if the money was going to come from cuts to the aid budget: could he give a guarantee that this would not happen? And while he was about it, would the prime minister promise not to cut the armed forces personnel once he had bought all his new gadgets? Boris was not prepared to make any such pledges. Indeed he didn’t appear to have listened to a word Keir Starmer had said. The absence of Cummings to supply even a half-decent riposte is already beginning to tell. Rather, Johnson just had a pre-cooked rant about how Jeremy Corbyn had tried to leave Nato, get rid of the armed forces and how the new Labour leader had basically been his lap dog. Not for the first time, the prime minister is a little behind the news, given that Starmer is currently locked in a battle with Corbyn and the Labour left over the direction of the party. Keir often appears surprised even when he’s not, but this time the look of surprise was entirely genuine. Like the rest of us, he must wonder how Boris continues to get away with being so shit. As if to prove the point, Johnson went through the rest of the session – the bits that he could hear and the bits that he was listening to at any rate – as if on auto-pilot. He lapped up the sycophancy from many on his own benches, even to the extent of calling Liam Fox “an expert” – not a word that’s ever been used about the minister before – and offered the vaguest of reassurances to opposition MPs that some of the benefits of the spending splurge would filter down to their constituencies. He still, though, refused to commit even to Tory entreaties not to cut the 0.7% overseas aid budget, so that looks as if it’s gone in collateral damage. There was a time when governments thought that every pound spent on aid was a pound saved on bullets. But Boris is not that kinda guy. He’s the Buzz Lightyear of No 10. The wannabe Mr Macho desperate to prove he’s writing his own scripts. To infinity and beyond."
2020-11-19T16:34:43Z,politics,Politics,UK defence now has £16.5bn coming. But where is it going?,"Such was Boris Johnson’s need to reassert himself as prime minister in the week after the departure of his chief aide Dominic Cummings, that so many details relating to £16.5bn extra boost for defence spending remain unresolved. Gone are plans to announce the extra funding at the same time as the grand outcome of an integrated review of defence and foreign policy after Brexit, which will now conclude in late January or early February, after an exit deal with the European Union might actually have been sealed. Instead, along with the promise of new money are a handful of announcements, including a long-planned National Cyber Force of military hackers, a slightly less detailed and rather optimistic-sounding Space Command plus an agency specialising in artificial intelligence whose purpose is far from clear. Even a breakdown of how the £16.5bn extra would be spread out over the four years was not immediately available, but that plus £5bn of existing commitments mean that the defence budget will surge by 10-15% a year from this year’s £41.5bn throughout the remainder of the parliament.
It might be tempting to conclude that defence always comes out on top under the Conservatives, but in reality defence spending has been falling in real terms every year since David Cameron walked into Downing Street in 2010, helped by the fact that ground forces have not been officially deployed in combat operations since Afghanistan in 2014. What is surprising, however, is that the surge in spending is for a department noted for profligacy. At one point the Conservatives had claimed its books balanced, but as the National Audit Office recently noted, its equipment budget was £13bn short and veteran Whitehall insiders despair at the ability of the navy, in particular, to overspend.
Meanwhile, Downing Street has dug its heels in on a whole range of financial commitments, at a time when the pandemic has already wreaked havoc with the public finances. It proved quicker, when Johnson put his mind to it, to spend £16.5bn more on defence than £170m for free school meals in the Christmas holidays for English children. What is unclear is what the new money is really for. Although Islamist jihadism remains a threat, the bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq is almost at a standstill. And while there are plans to deploy 300 British soldiers in Mali shortly, to combat an Islamist insurgency, this is not yet a major deployment. The prime minister told the Commons that the international situation was “now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the cold war”. That may be true because of coronavirus and climate change, but is the threat from Russia and China more serious – and more resource intensive – than before? There is no question some areas need more investment; for example, cybersecurity and countering disinformation where Russian and Chinese actors are among those engaged in persistent hacking in an attempt to steal a Covid vaccine or other trade secrets. Offensive hacking will have its uses, although more so in a wartime situation.
Nor is there any doubt that the UK will have to invest in upgrading military technology, which has the capacity to create high-quality jobs at home: in pilotless aircraft, in drones and in a smaller but more highly skilled army able to operate flexibly as easily in humanitarian relief as in combat situations. Yet it is less clear that the British public or indeed politicians have the appetite for a major Iraq-style engagement any time soon. The British army is already unable, for example, to recruit enough soldiers to meet its nominal 82,000 target. It would also be curious if the extra cash for the Ministry of Defence came at the expense of spending elsewhere; in particular, the aid budget, where the Treasury has signalled it wants to cut spending from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. Johnson swatted away questions on the topic in the Commons on Thursday – a decision is expected next week – but one of the points of appropriately targeted aid spending is to prevent or avoid conflicts."
2020-11-19T14:03:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson sidesteps calls to recommit to aid spending target,"Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to commit to maintaining UK overseas aid spending at 0.7% of GDP, in a Commons debate where he unveiled a £16.5bn, four-year boost to the defence budget that he said would help equip the military with “directed energy weapons”. The prime minister was challenged by Labour’s Keir Starmer to explain how the defence announcement would be paid for and to honour a “very clear” Conservative manifesto commitment to maintain the aid budget. Johnson said the additional defence spending represented “the biggest package of our support for our services since the cold war” and added: “There is absolutely no relation to discussions about overseas aid.” This week it emerged that the Treasury wanted to reduce the overseas aid budget from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%, cutting billions more from aid spending after a £2.9bn reduction as a result of the economy shrinking in the pandemic. Andrew Mitchell, a former development secretary, asked Johnson whether he would commit to the 0.7% target, arguing that it would stand the prime minister “in very good stead as he assumes the chairmanship of the G7”. Again, Johnson declined to publicly recommit to the figure, although he said the UK could be “very proud of our record in overseas aid”. But he added: “What I can say is … this statement is about our defence and security, and there’s no read-across to any other issue.” The spending boost will lift the £41.5bn annual defence budget by roughly £5bn a year, because the extra £16.5bn will come on top of a previous commitment to lift the budget by just above inflation. The total uplift is £21.5bn, the biggest defence increase since the early days of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership. Johnson told MPs that the budget increase would allow the British military to invest in new technology, arguing that it would help soldiers in hostile territory to “be alerted to a distinct ambush by sensors or satellites or drones instantly transmitting a warning, using artificial intelligence to devise the optimal responses”. He said the armed forces would be able to order “a swarm attack by drones paralysing the enemy with the weapons”, and that British warships and combat vehicles “will carry directed energy weapons” – a reference to emerging laser and radio frequency weapons. It is unclear how effective they are."
2020-11-19T13:30:08Z,politics,Politics,George Osborne criticised for wasting £50m on 'hi-tech' offices,"George Osborne has been severely criticised by an influential parliamentary committee for wasting up to £50m of public money on plush central London offices for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The intelligence and security committee (ISC) said the decision to acquire workspace at Nova South in Victoria, central London, was unacceptable and had “an emphasis on image rather than cost”. The then chancellor Osborne overruled advice from the national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant to force through the purchase of the office space located in property company Land Securities’ ultra-modern Nova development, a report released on Thursday has found. The offices, close to the Houses of Parliament and New Scotland Yard, will cost £96m to lease over 15 years, while a fully costed alternative in Canary Wharf would have cost £46m over the same period. ISC members Kevan Jones and Stewart Hosie said a better decision-making process would have benefited the public purse, and questioned why Lyall Grant had not sought a “ministerial direction” – a formal instruction from a minister to spend public money despite an objection from the spending officer – over the decision. “The role of ministers in the process as a whole was highly unsatisfactory, culminating in the then-chancellor overruling the then-national security adviser’s very strong advice to reject Nova South, in order to confirm what GCHQ had made clear was the only option that they would accept. In this regard we note that the then-national security adviser failed to seek a ministerial direction,” they said in a statement. The creation of a National Cyber Security Centre was announced by Osborne in 2015. It was tasked with bolstering security against the growing online threats from around the globe. A consultancy firm drew up a shortlist of 10 options for possible offices – three were taken from tech hubs, two were near Westminster, and five were newly introduced options from within the existing agency and Ministry of Defence (MoD) property portfolio. The shortlist scored Canary Wharf – a property already leased by the government – as the top option, with new-build commercial properties in Nova South and Shoreditch coming joint second, followed by an existing agency-owned building.
Shortly afterwards, GCHQ decided that Nova South was its preferred option, with Canary Wharf as the alternative fall-back option. On 26 April 2016, Robert Hannigan, the director of GCHQ, wrote to Lyall Grant to request his formal approval, as principal accounting officer for the agencies, for the draft full business case for Nova South. On 4 May 2016, Lyall Grant wrote to the chancellor, in his capacity as chair of the national security council sub-committee on cyber. He wrote: “From an accounting officer perspective, [Nova South] causes me some concern, both on value for money and deliverability grounds. I would therefore advise against agreement unless there are other considerations of ministerial and public expectation which have not been fully brought out in the business case.” Crucially – given the importance that had been placed on a launch date in October – Lyall Grant found that Nova South was not deliverable within the specified timeframe. “The letter is comprehensive and unequivocal. As principal accounting officer for the agencies – and therefore answerable to parliament for their spending – the national security adviser opposed the choice of Nova South,” the report noted. Soon after this advice was sent, Lyall Grant met Osborne to discuss this issue – but no note of the meeting could be found, which the committee said was “highly surprising”. “We are informed that no note of this meeting can be found. We find this highly surprising, given that private secretaries would routinely attend and minute meetings their ministers held. However, we have been informed that meetings between the NSA and the chancellor were not regularly minuted,” the report said. On 18 May 2016, Osborne’s private office emailed the NSA. It read: “Based on your discussion last week and the further information provided by GCHQ, the chancellor understands that the options presented in their business case are finely balanced. While [Canary Wharf] is cheaper, the chancellor’s view is that Nova South meets more of the criteria for the NCSC, in that it presents a more modern, hi-tech image and is closer to Whitehall and agency partners.” In the report, Jones and Hosie continued: “From the outset, the selection criteria used were faulty. “Locations outside London were never considered, and great emphasis was placed on finding high-end accommodation – without any case being made for that being necessary. “Even disregarding the faulty criteria, it is clear that GCHQ selected Nova South against all the evidence – and warnings that it would neither be ready on time nor receive approval from the government property unit. “Nova South was around double the cost of typical government accommodation in London: this was allowed to happen because the scoring system which GCHQ chose significantly underweighted costs and overweighted location.” The ISC said the cost of Nova South equates to more than “£21,000 per staff member per annum” – more than double the average government cost for London-based staff. The funding originally allocated for the NCSC’s office stood at £3.5m per year. Boris Johnson said the government “acknowledges there are lessons that can be learned from the procurement process” and would respond to the committee’s recommendations in due course. In a written statement he said: “ Nova South met all the key criteria required by government, including proximity to Whitehall and other stakeholders within the government secure zone. “A further contributing factor to its selection was its availability, which allowed the NCSC to be established at pace, within a year, providing a centre at a time when there was an urgent need for the government to increase its defensive cyber capabilities and respond to global cyber incidents like WannaCry. “Nova South has provided a much-needed central focus for UK cybersecurity since its procurement, hosting a wide range of government and industry partners as well as contributing to our global commitment to cybersecurity and the UK’s ranking as number one by the global cybersecurity index.”"
2020-11-19T09:27:15Z,politics,Politics,"UK defence: £16.5bn enough to modernise armed forces, says minister","The defence secretary has said £16.5bn is “enough” to modernise the armed forces but refused to say how much of the new defence funding would be taken from the overseas aid budget. Ben Wallace also said he “suspected” the UK would follow the US’s lead in reducing its number of soldiers in Afghanistan. On Wednesday the US acting defence secretary, Christopher Miller, said the US will reduce troop levels in Afghanistan from more than 4,500 to 2,500, and in Iraq from about 3,000 to 2,500. In interviews on Thursday, Wallace defended Boris Johnson’s announcement of a four-year £16.5bn surge in defence spending at a time when Britain’s public finances have been stretched by the Covid pandemic. Talking to ITV Good Morning Britain (GMB), Wallace was asked how the government could afford the defence settlement at a time of a national health and economic crisis. He said: “Let me put that in perspective: we’re getting £16.5bn over four years, we’ve spent £200bn on Covid measures, ranging from support to businesses, support to people through universal credit, etc.”
Defending the defence budget, he said the UK’s “adversaries are currently investing record sums of money and indeed in some areas overtaking our capabilities”. Talking to Sky News on Thursday, Wallace said of the £16.5bn: “It is enough, depending on how your ambition is tailored. I’ve been very clear as defence secretary that one of the failures of the past reviews was our funding never matched our ambition – that goes for most of the reviews in the last 40 years. “This means that we can have a proper discussion about what are our global ambitions and how are we going to fund it. This very large settlement for defence will allow us to fix the problems that we’ve inherited – the black hole that the NAO [National Audit Office] obviously identified – and allow headspace to modernise our forces.” But Wallace declined to say how much of the new defence funding would come from the overseas aid budget. He said the government was not “abandoning the battlefield of international aid”, but said the “decisions on the numbers” would be revealed by the chancellor next week. Wallace told GMB that spending on defence and foreign aid were “not mutually exclusive”. He said: “If you spend money on defence and our capabilities – our planners, our engineers – we have a regiment of engineers in Sudan, helping that country, that very poor country, with its infrastructure. They are not mutually exclusive … you might be spending your money differently but you are still trying to achieve often the same aim.” Wallace also suggested that the number of British troops in Afghanistan could be reduced if the US goes ahead with their own reductions in the country. “The United States have only just announced the exact number that they are going to reduce to but I suspect if they are reducing, at some stage, we will come down,” he told Sky News. “We don’t have a massive force compared to them, but we will do what we need to do to keep people safe and ensure that we do our best to ensure that Afghans are kept protected as well.” The UK currently has 1,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, in Kabul, where they take the lead within the Kabul security force. This seven-nation organisation provides force protection for UK and coalition advisers who are working with the UK’s Afghan partners to increase the capabilities and capacity across the Afghan national defence and security forces."
2020-11-18T22:30:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson agrees £16bn rise in defence spending,"Boris Johnson has agreed a four-year £16.5bn surge in defence spending at a time when Britain’s public finances have been stretched by the pandemic and a day after it emerged that billions of pounds could be cut from the foreign aid budget. Experts said the windfall represents the largest real-terms increase in the defence budget since Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and will be partly spent on a National Cyber Force of hackers and a new Space Command designed to protect orbiting satellites and launch its own rockets. It comes weeks after ministers resisted spending extra money to fund free school meals in the holidays, and days after it emerged that the overseas aid budget is set to be cut by billions, from 0.7% of of gross national income to 0.5%, triggering criticism from senior Tories. Johnson said he had taken the decision to boost spending on the armed forces “in the teeth of the pandemic” because “the defence of the realm must come first”. The prime minister is also keen to show new US president-elect Joe Biden that the UK wants a strong military capability after Brexit.
Insiders said the defence funding, which will be detailed by Johnson when he speaks to the House of Commons on Thursday, had been put together at breakneck speed as Downing Street seeks to reassert control after last week’s No 10 meltdown, which led to the departure of chief aide Dominic Cummings and his ally Lee Cain. It will see £16.5bn extra being spent on defence over and above a commitment to increase the existing £41.5bn budget by 0.5 percentage points above inflation. Taken together, the increase amounts to £21.5bn until March 2025, and defence sources said it would mean the UK remained Europe’s biggest defence spender. Aid experts said the announcement demonstrated there was no need to cut the aid budget. Simon Starling, a director at Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development, said: “What today’s announcement shows is that when the government needs to find the money for certain areas, it can.” A battle within Whitehall had been raging for about a month after Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, suddenly announced that a planned cross-government spending review would be abandoned because of the pandemic. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary and a long-time ally of Johnson, pressed for a special multi-year deal to allow the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to negotiate long-term weapons and systems contracts, which would be more expensive if bought from year to year. There had been speculation that the MoD had hoped for as much as £20bn extra but defence sources said the £16.5bn would allow for “modernisation without making painful cuts”, and claimed the final figure represented a victory for the defence secretary.
Some of the extra defence money will be spent on the creation of a long delayed National Cyber Force, a group of computer hackers who will conduct offensive operations; a Space Command which aims to be able to launch own rockets from 2022; and a new agency dedicated to artificial intelligence. Although Wallace and Cummings frequently clashed, the ousted chief aide had been a supporter of a multi-year funding settlement. But Cummings had also been a fierce critic of MoD waste, writing in a blog post last March that the procurement process “has continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public life via the revolving door of officials/lobbyists”. Malcolm Chalmers, of the Royal United Services Institute, said that the final outcome was “a much larger increase for defence than most analysts, including myself, had predicted. It is the largest real-terms increase in the defence budget since the early years of the Thatcher premiership, a rise of between 10 and 15% in real terms.” Labour said the spending announcement signalled “a welcome and long overdue upgrade to Britain’s defences after a decade of decline”. The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, added that since 2010 “the size of the armed forces has been cut by a quarter, defence spending was cut by over £7bn”. But Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, said that while “funding our military is a must … people will wonder if rightly our national security can get money, why is the government letting councils who offer child protection and social care go to the wall”. The MoD already has a shortfall of £13bn in its equipment budget, according to the National Audit Office, and would have been forced to cut back on aircraft and lose the use of its own hospital ship unless the gap had been plugged. The funding agreement had been intended to be linked to an integrated review of defence and foreign policy after Brexit but the delay in agreeing the financial settlement, coupled with the recent departure of Cummings, means the exercise has been pushed back to late January or early February. The final review is expected to see cuts to the size of the British army and a reduction in its use of rarely deployed tanks, plus commitments to invest further in armed drones and upgrading the Trident nuclear weapon system. On Wednesday the government was criticised for failing to extend the £20-a-week uplift to universal credit payments beyond April, despite the pandemic and rising child poverty. Extending the top-up would cost an estimated £9bn. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said: “If the government can find significant extra funds for defence then surely they can find money for children in crisis. It’s appalling that hard-pressed families have to rely on food banks to get by, and that the services that might stop them spiralling into further crisis are being cut year-on-year with local authorities facing bankruptcy. “We need the government to take seriously its responsibility to the next generation and have a proper strategy for investing in children.” Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, told MPs that ministers were “delaying the semi-inevitable” by refusing to signal whether they would continue with the top-up, which was introduced last April as a 12-month boost for millions of struggling families. Failure to do so would be “madness,” Bell said. Bell said much of the autumn had been spent debating the “relatively small issue” of providing food support for children on free school meals during school holidays – a campaign led by the footballer Marcus Rashford, on which the government eventually U-turned – rather than addressing the central issue of universal credit."
2020-11-18T20:08:43Z,politics,Politics,Labour in fresh turmoil as Starmer refuses to restore whip to Corbyn,"Labour was plunged into fresh turmoil on Wednesday after Keir Starmer refused to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, despite what Corbyn’s allies claim was a private deal to do so. Faced with the prospect that at least one senior Jewish MP – Margaret Hodge – could quit the party in protest at Corbyn’s return to the fold, Starmer issued a strongly worded statement saying he would not welcome his predecessor back into the parliamentary party. Starmer’s decision caused an immediate backlash on the left of the party, however, with 31 MPs from the Socialist Campaign Group calling it “wrong and damaging to the Labour party”. The decision came a day after a disciplinary panel of the party’s national executive committee (NEC) lifted the suspension of Corbyn’s party membership over controversial remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published a damning report on Labour antisemitism last month. Starmer said: “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions in response to the EHRC report undermined and set back our work in restoring trust and confidence in the Labour party’s ability to tackle antisemitism. In those circumstances, I have taken the decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn. I will keep this situation under review.” Corbyn was suspended over a statement he issued following the publication of the EHRC report on 29 October, in which he said the problem of antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”.
In a “clarification” submitted to the NEC and made public this week, Corbyn said claims of antisemitism had not been “exaggerated”. Starmer made his decision after speaking to Hodge on Tuesday evening. It is understood the veteran Labour MP came close to quitting. She told Starmer she felt betrayed at the swift lifting of Corbyn’s suspension and that it risked undoing every bit of trust rebuilt with Jewish community groups. Hodge told the Guardian: “Keir has made the right decision but a lot of trust has been undermined. I cannot tell you the anger across the Jewish community. There was a lot of trust and many people will feel frustrated and hurt by what has happened, that is devastating.” Corbyn’s allies are considering legal action as one possible next step – the former leader has assembled a legal fighting fund totalling more than £300,000. Starmer was accused of “bad faith” by the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, who allies say was involved in brokering a deal he and others believed would allow the former leader to sit as a Labour MP again. Multiple sources say conversations took place in recent weeks between representatives of Corbyn and key figures in Starmer’s office, including his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Corbyn’s side believed the outcome of those negotiations was that the NEC would issue Corbyn with a lesser punishment, and the matter would be closed. They claim that the “clarification” issued by Corbyn earlier this week was agreed with Starmer’s office.
However, a source in Starmer’s office insisted “there was no deal”. They said Corbyn had been repeatedly urged to retract his comments of last month – and his allies had merely been “lobbying” for his readmittance to the party. One Labour source also said the party leader was angered by tweets sent by people they regarded as Corbyn “outriders” on Tuesday, suggesting Corbyn had been exonerated. In fact, the NEC panel did censure Corbyn’s behaviour, issuing him with a “reminder”. Other conditions were also attached to the ruling: the Guardian understands one of these was that Corbyn take down his original controversial Facebook post, which – as of Wednesday night – he had not done. In a public statement issued on Wednesday night, McCluskey said: “I am astonished at the decision to withdraw the PLP [Parliamentary Labour party] whip from Jeremy Corbyn. “This is a vindictive and vengeful action, which despoils party democracy and due process alike, and amounts to overruling the unanimous decision of the NEC panel yesterday to readmit Jeremy to the party. “This action gives rise to double jeopardy in the handling of the case and shows marked bad faith.” Starmer’s team pointed out that the leader has no say over the makeup of NEC disciplinary panels, or their findings. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, welcomed Starmer’s decision and criticised the process that led to Corbyn’s readmission to party membership. “Labour’s disciplinary process is clearly still not fit for purpose. Keir Starmer has now taken the appropriate leadership decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn,” she said. “We continue to say that ‘zero tolerance’ must mean precisely that, whether for antisemites or their apologists.” The Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has been an outspoken critic of Corbyn’s approach to antisemitism while he was leader, said the case must be looked at by the independent process that Starmer said he would set up under the EHRC recommendations. “Keir is trying to deliver on his self-confessed first priority as Labour leader – to rebuild trust with the Jewish community,” he said. “The whip cannot be restored until the new, genuinely independent complaints process assesses this case and ensures a fair decision is made.” The NEC panel was convened with a day’s warning, though members were not told what case they would presiding over. It is understood panel members were given a “drastic” warning by party lawyers that anything more than a formal reprimand would have ended up in the high court. However, the panel did agree to attach conditions to the reprimand and the decision was eventually unanimous, after a lengthy debate. Party sources said there would be no way of the leader’s office fixing the panel decision, though it was known internally that the NEC panel’s power to sanction was restricted."
2020-11-18T19:43:19Z,politics,Politics,Tory MP will face no further action for 'Anglo-Muslim relations' tweet,"The Conservative party has said it will not take further action against a Tory MP who suggested in a now-deleted tweet that criticism of the party for allegations of Islamophobia would harm “Anglo-Muslim relations”. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) is to make a formal complaint about the message posted by Michael Fabricant on Wednesday in response to its media spokesman, Miqdaad Versi. Fabricant, the MP for Lichfield, said in the since-deleted post that it was spiteful to draw comparison between the Tories and Labour, who have been investigated by the equality watchdog about treatment of Jewish members. In the tweet to Versi, Fabricant wrote: “Your spite and unpleasantness neither does the cause of tolerance in this country nor the cause of Anglo-Muslim relations any good at all.” The tweet was later deleted and replaced with: “Your spite and unpleasantness neither does the cause of tolerance in this country nor the cause of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims any good at all.” Asked on Twitter why he had deleted the original tweet, Fabricant said it had been misrepresented. “I deleted it because some people chose to misinterpret it. I replaced it with Muslims and non-Muslims, which is clearer. Religion/no-religion and nationality are two different matters. I hope that answer is helpful,” he tweeted. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “Michael Fabricant has clarified his tweet. He is raising an important point about how it is the Labour party that has been investigated by the EHRC for racism. The Conservative party does not tolerate prejudice and discrimination.” Fabricant said in a statement released by the party: “I am clear that there is no connection between religion and nationality, which is why I have clarified my tweet accordingly.” A spokesperson for the MCB said: “Even though the Conservative party faces hundreds of allegations of Islamophobia, Tory MP Michael Fabricant attacks MCB spokesperson Miqdaad Versi by urging him to look the other way and focus on bigotry elsewhere. “In doing so, Mr Fabricant betrays his own prejudices by accusing English-born Miqdaad Versi of hindering ‘Anglo-Muslim’ relations. The implication is that Muslims are foreign and alien to the English.” The spokesman said the comment “be it inadvertent or not, betrays a view of Muslims institutionalised in sections of the Conservative party – that Muslims are not part and parcel of British society”. The MCB said Fabricant must face an investigation over his comments. “Failure to do so will only underscore that the Conservative party does not have a zero-tolerance approach to tackling Islamophobia and racism,” the spokesman said. The MCB has made repeated complaints about Islamophobia in the Conservative party and earlier this year submitted a dossier of more than 300 allegations of Islamophobia to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the same body that investigated Labour. The EHRC declined to proceed with the investigation, citing plans for an independent investigation looking into complaints of discrimination over “religion or belief and significantly Islam” in the party. The MCB has said it is concerned about the inquiry’s limited focus, only looking at the way complaints are handled, rather than the issue of racism within the party. It also claims the Conservative inquiry has been broadened to include all discrimination and is not focusing enough on anti-Islamic sentiment. It is being led by former commissioner of the EHRC, Prof Swaran Singh."
2020-11-18T19:23:51Z,politics,Politics,Northern Ireland businesses call for Brexit transition extension,"Northern Ireland businesses have called for an extension of the Brexit transition period in the region, warning they “simply will not be ready” for the mandatory border checks on 1 January. They say they are the “rope in a tug of war” between the UK and the EU and warned of a “huge black hole” in information and a “disconnect” with Westminster and Brussels over the reality of Brexit checks kicking in 43 days’ time. “There is a responsibility on the EU as well as the UK” to make sure the Northern Ireland protocol works, Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, told MPs.
While Brexit trade talks remain in the balance, the Northern Ireland protocol, which will involve border checks down the Irish Sea, is due to kick in at the end of the transition period – deal or no deal. Kelly called for pragmatism over cross-border shopping. “Selling a lasagne at an Asda in Strabane that might make its way to Donegal is not going to pollute the entire single market,” he told the Brexit select committee. MPs were also told that, if the protocol were applied to the letter, a simple ham and cheese sandwich made in Britain and sold in Belfast would need two health certificates to get through the border control posts. These issues were supposed to be ironed out by the UK-EU joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and Maroš Šefčovič but Northern Ireland traders have had “no conversations with anyone” about the at-risk goods, said Kelly.
Kelly said Northern Ireland could be a recurring nightmare for the EU unless they made the protocol work and said the bloc needed to be “generous in spirit” and grant an implementation period for the protocol. “The EU need to make it work,” he said but they needed to get businesses to “make it stick”. “We are more than a pawn in the game and say that’s a tug of war and we’re the rope and that rope is sadly being stretched,” he warned. The EU will warn of a worrying lack of progress as leaders meet at a summit via videoconference on Thursday. EU sources said Charles Michel, the European council president, would give a downbeat public assessment of the troubled talks. The two sides remain stuck on EU access to UK fishing waters, the workings of a mechanism to maintain environmental, labour and social standards over time and the details of how disputes will be resolved. After a briefing by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Wednesday, the European commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said there remained “substantial work to do”. “I will not start putting specific deadlines: this week, next week. We have seen many deadlines come and go but there’s one deadline which we’ll not be able to move – 1 January,” he said. A senior EU diplomat representing a member state said the commission had a responsibility to make further preparations for a no-deal outcome given the lack of progress in the talks. “I don’t have the impression that there is much progress,” the diplomat said. “It is time to say: we must now come up with contingency measures, 1 January is getting close. We need a safety net. Of course this sends out a political signal. But we have a business community that we want to tell in good time what to do. ” Kelly’s concerns over cross-border trade were echoed by Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, who said: “We are hugely worried” that the retail sector would not be ready as it was being asked to make “structural changes that would normally take two years” in six weeks. “We need an implementation period,” he added.
Victor Chestnutt, the president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, told MPs it was only beginning to sink in now that farmers in the region would be treated differently to those in the rest of the UK, and that “all farmers” would need special paperwork to import secondhand machinery and agri-products including grass seed and seed potatoes. At a recent webinar only five out of 140 farmers said they knew about the paperwork. There is “a huge disconnect between government and farmers on what we need to do”, Chestnutt said. “With six weeks until the day, it feels like we’re going forward with both arms tied behind our back and a blindfold on. You know if you give us clarity and give us time, we will get through it. But we do need an implementation period or honeymoon period. “We have a transition period but we do not know what we are transitioning to with six weeks to go,” he added. The committee heard there was not enough time to make the mandatory changes to food labelling. There were also concerns that the agrifood sector did not know if it faced a Brexit cliff-edge on 1 January for its thriving cross-border operations. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, told parliament during an urgent question that the “reckless approach” of the government meant “thousands of businesses still do not know the bare basics of how they will trade with Great Britain in just six weeks’ time”. About £2.6bn in agrifood produced in Northern Ireland goes to Great Britain and 60% of that transits through Dublin Port, the committee heard. “It’s a cyclical, circular, integrated supply chain across these islands,” said Connolly. The committee heard that no deal would block this trade on the island of Ireland with data showing a cottage pie has “nine border movements” and Baileys Irish Cream had five such border crossings. “If that [model] is removed it means means delays, less choice, less freshness.” The Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker told parliament the government was pursuing a “flexible” approach and the protocol was “on track” to be delivered on time. A government spokesman said that “further measures to support agrifood traders will be announced shortly” and that it was “working to resolve all outstanding issues for supermarkets and other traders through the joint committee”."
2020-11-18T18:41:13Z,politics,Politics,Johnson unable to play to gallery in remotely interesting PMQs | John Crace,"A Boris Johnson on his own is generally a Boris Johnson in bad company. With no one to rein back his narcissism, megalomania and priapism, there is nothing between himself and his own self-destruction. Yet, on the plus side, his time in self-isolation does free him up to play with his toys and keep him away from all the bits he most dislikes about the job: having to meet backbench MPs whose names he has no intention of remembering, or heaving himself into the car to get to parliament for a prime minister’s questions at which he is almost bound to come off second best, for example. When Keir Starmer was recently forced to self-isolate, there was no suggestion of the Labour leader being allowed to ask his questions remotely. But in a matter of weeks, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the parliamentary authorities have been brought up to speed on the realities of 2020, so this session was the first time a prime minister was allowed to answer questions via a video link. Not that No 10 seemed to have given much thought to how he might look. Boris appeared in front of a hastily erected Downing Street backdrop in what sounded like an echoey basement – either that or no one had thought to provide the crumpled Boris with a microphone and he had had to make do with his infant son Wilf’s baby alarm. Whichever it was, I’ve seen more professionally shot hostage videos. What had promised to be a historic moment delivered little by way of highlights. With no audience, however small, to play to, there was no arm- or willy-waving from Johnson. Rather, he just sat through the whole thing, looking rather bored, with his hands clasped together on the table in front of him. Starmer too looked as if his mind was elsewhere. Though in his case, it almost certainly had nothing to do with him adjusting to do battle with a screen. The Labour leader has a much tougher fight on his hands right now, with the party’s NEC having reinstated Jeremy Corbyn as a member and Starmer holding firm by refusing to reinstate the whip. So it felt very much like a PMQs by numbers. A collection of greatest hits, rather than a sustained series of questions building to a lethal stiletto. Starmer started well enough, targeting Johnson’s Monday night piece of idiocy in which he had described Scottish devolution as a disaster to a group of Tory MPs on Zoom. Did he stand by those remarks? Johnson naturally sidestepped the question, choosing instead to rubbish the Scottish National party for ruining devolution for everyone. It doesn’t appear to have occurred to him that the reason the SNP are in power is that they have been democratically elected. Nor that most Scots want to remain in the EU and resent being taken out of it by England and Wales. Every time he opens his mouth, he adds a few percentage points to the SNP cause. Or tens of percentage points if your maths is as good as Toby Young’s. Starmer rather left it at that as Labour has as little interest in breaking up the union as the Tories and moved on to support payments for those asked to self-isolate. Was it any surprise that only 11% of people bothered to stay at home when they were being asked to get by on either £95 or £135 per week? Dominic Cummings’s champagne bill on a Friday night after getting fired. Johnson went through the motions of pretending that Labour had only just come onboard with NHS test and trace before Starmer reminded him that the latest government lockdown had been won with Labour votes. The final two questions on the National Audit Office’s report into cronyism and lack of oversight in the awarding of PPE contracts were by far the most enlightening. For the first time, Johnson looked vaguely rattled and twice resorted to calling the Labour leader “Captain Hindsight”, a sure sign he had lost the argument. It had been very difficult at the start of the pandemic, he said, and there had been huge shortages of PPE. So it had only been thanks to Tory ministers and MPs coming through with names of friends of friends who might be able to help out for a sweetener of a few million that the country had been saved. If only Labour MPs had shown an equal willingness to compromise their ethics and come up with some suppliers who would fail to supply usable equipment then the UK might have survived the pandemic even more successfully. And that was pretty much that. A largely bloodless encounter between two leaders, both of whom appeared relieved to have got through the session largely intact. So for once it was the questions from the backbenchers that proved the more illuminating. The PM failed to commit to the government’s contribution to overseas aid remaining at 0.7% and he had absolutely no answer to why it was that the UK had the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe and the deepest recession in all the G7 countries. A look in the mirror might provide some clues. But then he would have to live with the PTSD the rest of us suffer on a daily basis. There were also potentially awkward questions from two Scottish Tory MPs. But they weren’t out to get him for his remarks on Scottish devolution: they were there to extort money with menaces in return for not mentioning the devolution fiasco. Douglas Ross said he was was grateful for the money coming Moray’s way but it would be nice if it could be phased in quicker than 15 years. Johnson nodded eagerly. As he did when John Lamont raised the topic of whisky tariffs. The cheques were already in the post."
2020-11-18T18:05:27Z,politics,Politics,UK politics: Starmer faces revolt as 27 Labour MPs condemn decision not to restore whip to Corbyn – as it happened,"Sir Keir Starmer has reignited a conflict with the Labour left by refusing to readmit Jeremy Corbyn to the parliamentary party, despite a disciplinary panel deciding yesterday that his suspension from the party should be lifted. Twenty seven Labour MPs have signed a statement describing Starmer’s decision as “wrong and damaging”. (See 5.13pm.) The UK has recorded 19,609 further coronavirus cases - its lowest daily total for more than two weeks. (See 4.45pm.) Tough restrictions on socialising will be needed before and after Christmas to keep the spread of coronavirus under control if families and friends are to be allowed to meet over the festive season, government advisers have said. Starmer has described Boris Johnson as the “single biggest threat to the future of the United Kingdom” following his comments about Scottish devolution, during a history-making prime minister’s questions in which Johnson appeared via video link. Care bosses are demanding £500m in extra government funding to make care homes safe in the run-up to Christmas, while some councils have been accused of taking infection control too far by banning tinsel or advising against trees. Johnson is expected to announce on Thursday that the Ministry of Defence has been awarded a multi-year funding settlement, after it emerged this week that several billions would be cut from the aid budget. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-11-18T16:01:07Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn's constituents reflect on latest twist in antisemitism row,"Around this time last year, Jeremy Corbyn was launching his general election campaign at the Brickworks community centre in his Islington North constituency, and talking of leading the country into a better future. On Wednesday, Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer, denied him readmission to the parliamentary party. And at Brickworks, director Colin Adams groaned in disbelief. “That’s disappointing,” he said. “Wow, that’s really disappointing. He is just a fantastic MP, he’s so important to people around here. I think there will be a sense of outrage.” Adams said that on antisemitism, Corbyn “could have done more”, but said that he was commenting first and foremost as a community activist. “For people round here, disadvantaged by finance, class, education, he is amazing. If he says he’s going to do something – pop his head into a community meeting or campaign against racism – he’ll do it come what may, whatever his commitments. He doesn’t go back on his word. For him not to be a Labour MP, it’s not going to bring the party back together.” At that 2019 launch, Corbyn said he loved “walking along the Seven Sisters Road, I have many friends around the area – the cafes, the shops.” He won 64% of the vote locally, even as he led his party to national defeat. And around the busy thoroughfare on Wednesday afternoon, most people loved him back.
“He’s a very good MP, I have nothing bad to say about Jeremy,” said Audrey Mason-Brown, a 63-year-old shop manager. “I’ve lived round here for over 30 years and Jeremy has been a rock. If he’s going past he stops and talks to you, if you have a problem you can bring it to him. He’s not one of these upmarket hoity-toity MPs, he’s an ordinary person.” Mason-Brown, a Labour member, viewed Starmer’s decision as the latest example of unfairness in the party’s treatment of Corbyn. “I even think of leaving the party,” she added. “As soon as Jeremy leaves this constituency, I’ll stop voting.” Niamh, a more recent arrival in her 20s who moved to the area a year ago, echoed Mason-Brown’s view, describing Corbyn as “thoughtful, caring, more realistic somehow – more like a normal person – than most politicians”. On antisemitism, she added: “Corbyn has been used as a scapegoat. I think Keir Starmer is using this as an opportunity to stick the knife in a little bit.” As a floating voter between Labour and the Greens, she felt disenchanted by the new leadership, she suggested. “I guess it’s more likely that Labour will get into power now, but not for the reasons I would like.” But not every constituent was on Corbyn’s side. Anna, laden with shopping as she returned to her home on the Andover estate, shook her head sceptically when asked to give her view of her MP. On antisemitism and in general, she said: “There’s something just not quite right about that man.” She has voted Labour in the area for 40 years, but “didn’t really think much about Corbyn at all” until he became leader, she said. “The more you heard about him, and the more he’s on the news, he stands up there speaking, and you think, please sit down.” Then she paused for a moment, and added: “I suppose he did good, in his way.” For Theo Clay, a charity consultant and Labour member who said he was relieved the Corbyn era was over, there was little equivocation. “I think Starmer was probably right to do it,” he said. Whatever his qualities as a local MP, he added, his reaction to the antisemitism crisis could not be dismissed. “It feels like with everything that’s happened up to this point, he can’t get away with half apologies any more. If Corbyn wasn’t willing to be fully contrite about everything that happened under his leadership, there was really no other choice if you wanted a clean break.”"
2020-11-18T15:50:15Z,politics,Politics,"'Normal' Christmas in England requires restrictions before and after, say advisers","Tough restrictions on socialising will be needed before and after Christmas to keep the spread of coronavirus under control if families and friends are to be allowed to meet over the festive season, government advisers have said. Dr Susan Hopkins, of Public Health England, said at a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that she was keen for Christmas to be “as normal as possible” but any increase in social contact over the period would have to be followed by more restrictions. She said previous advice from Sage, the government’s expert committee, had noted that for every day that restrictions were eased, they would need to be tightened up again for two days more. Public Health England later issued a correction saying the advice referred to Sage modelling that found that “for every one day of relaxation, five days of tighter restrictions would potentially be needed”. The corrected figure emphasises how little wiggle room there is for society to reopen in the run-up to Christmas. “We are very keen that we have Christmas as close to normal as possible. That requires all of us to make every effort over this national restriction period, and even in early December, to get the cases as low as possible and to reduce the risk of transmission within households and between families,” she said, adding that a final decision on families and friends mixing over Christmas lay with the government. Coming into Christmas, Hopkins said, “we need to be very careful about the number of contacts we have” to keep transmission of the virus down. “Hopefully, the government will make a decision that will allow us to have some mixing, but we will wait and see what that is. And then I think once we have got past the Christmas period, if there’s been a release on some socialisation, we will all have to be very responsible and reduce contacts again.” Prof Angela McLean, the government’s deputy chief science adviser, echoed the call for people to adhere to the latest lockdown. “What’s really important is that we go into a festive week – when you want to mix with our friends and our family – with the number of infections in the community as low as possible,” she said. Data released at the briefing showed that the R number – the number of people whom each infected person goes on to infect – had come down in England since the beginning of October, largely because of the tier 3 restrictions in place before the latest national lockdown. If R is above 1, cases will grow; below 1 they will fizzle out. The rate of new infections is still rising, but at a slower rate than in recent weeks, with marked regional variation. In the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber, the east of England and London, the percentage of the population testing positive may be falling, but uncertainties around the data mean the reality is unclear. In contrast, there are apparent rises in the south-west and south east. The number of people in hospital with Covid has risen steeply since the end of August. While the admission rate is expected to fall in the coming weeks as the effects of lockdown feed through, McLean said she did not expect it to fall as quickly as it did in the first lockdown. “During the March lockdown the number of hospitalisations, which was really all we could keep track of at that time, was halving every three weeks. I don’t think we’re going to achieve that. I do not think we will halve before the 2nd of December.”
Since England went into a second national lockdown on 5 November, advisers have made clear that the tiering system will be reviewed and probably modified to control the virus through December and into the new year. The medium-risk tier 1 is known to have almost no effect, prompting speculation that a higher tier may be introduced. McLean said Sage had submitted advice to the government over the weekend but she refused to elaborate on the recommendations. She said the tier 3 restrictions put in place in some areas before the lockdown appeared to have been effective. “When I look at the north-west and the north-east and I look at what’s happened with the Office for National Statistics surveys there, I see interventions that have worked. I see epidemics that are flattening,” she said. Hopkins said that during the latest lockdown, the increase in NHS testing capacity had allowed for a reduction in turnaround times for results, and local authorities would soon be in a better position to trace contacts of those testing positive. “By the end of this month, almost every lower-tier local authority will have local contact tracing in place, so that’s really allowed us to step up,” she said."
2020-11-18T13:57:55Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn row illustrates flaws of Labour's current disciplinary process,"The row over Jeremy Corbyn’s readmittance to the Labour party – but not as a Labour backbencher – is a messy state of affairs for Keir Starmer, who had hoped to make dealing with antisemitism in the party a cut-and-dried matter. But as a demonstration of the flawed nature of Labour’s disciplinary process, it makes a rather neat analogy.
Political parties are, by nature, political. Therefore some politicisation of the complaints process has always been inevitable. Though Corbyn as leader would protest he could have no control over suspensions of MPs or members, the reality is that when a high-profile disciplinary case emerges, the leader’s office always wants a say – and Labour staff always want a nod. Yet with the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s report giving a firm rebuke to political interference from the leader’s office in disciplinary cases, Starmer has had to make a determined public separation between church and state, in this case, the elected national executive committee panel. His choice is between interference, and going against the EHRC, or looking impotent. That fear of looking like a leader who has lost control of party discipline – and having decisions forced on them – is exactly why party chiefs have been cautious about an independent process, which the EHRC recommended. It is now seen as the least worst option, and of course must be implemented as a legal requirement after the EHRC report. Starmer was faced with an NEC panel decision to reinstate Corbyn, one rumoured to have been smoothed behind closed doors with unions acting as a deal broker, which blew up spectacularly and threatened the shaky truce with Jewish communal organisations, which had been slowly rebuilt following the EHRC report and Corbyn’s suspension for his comments after the report was published. Perhaps he and others in the party believed a swift and firm reprimand would be in the best interests of party unity. Instead, it ended up pleasing nobody. Senior party sources, as well as allies of Corbyn close to the NEC and to trade unions, believe Starmer’s decision to withhold the whip was made in panic, perhaps a late realisation it would have been better to wait the many months for the independent panel to be set up. “There are serious concerns that Starmer has panicked again,” one senior leftwing figure said. “Not great qualities in a leader.” Another said Starmer was being “badly advised and only on the basis of short-term PR considerations”. But waiting for the independent process would also have had its downsides, and Corbyn’s advisers made it clear he did not want to wait for that to happen. One source close to the party’s NEC said that independent process would be far less susceptible to public and political pressure than elected members of the party’s governing body. And more significantly, that independent process could probably not work with the oft-used disciplinary concept of “bringing the party into disrepute”, which means whatever you want it to. There is no direct reason why restoring party membership should mean restoring the whip; indeed, MPs have had the whip suspended but retained their Labour membership in the past. But as Corbyn’s former adviser James Schneider pointed out on Wednesday morning, the two usually go hand-in-hand. The difference is that decision is Starmer’s to make. With only the power left to suspend the whip, Starmer will hope that gamble will pay off to restore some goodwill among the main Jewish communal bodies, though as one communal source put it: “Maybe with this move they’ve stopped digging but they’re still in a hole.” • This article was amended on 18 November 2020 to remove extraneous text that was introduced inadvertently during the production process."
2020-11-18T13:23:44Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson is 'single biggest threat to future of UK', says Keir Starmer","Keir Starmer has described Boris Johnson as the “single biggest threat to the future of the United Kingdom” following his comments about Scottish devolution, during a history-making prime minister’s questions in which Johnson appeared via video link. The prime minister is self-isolating after a Conservative MP who attended a meeting at Downing Street tested positive for coronavirus, and answered questions from inside No 10 sitting at a desk. Starmer began by asking Johnson why, on a Zoom call with Tory MPs this week, he had described devolution as “a disaster north of the border” and “Tony Blair’s biggest mistake”. “Until now, whatever our disagreements, there has been a very broad consensus about devolution,” the Labour leader asked. “So why did the prime minister tell his MPs this week that Scottish devolution is, in his words, a disaster?” Johnson did not deny saying it, but avoided the question, arguing that “what has unquestionably been a disaster” had been the way the SNP had, he said, used devolution to push for a breakup of UK. Starmer responded: “The single biggest threat to the future of the United Kingdom is the prime minister, every time he opens his mouth on this. “When the prime minister said he wanted to take back control, nobody thought he meant from the Scottish people. But the prime minister’s quote is very clear – he said devolution has been ‘a disaster north of the border’. “This isn’t an isolated incident. Whether it’s the internal market bill, the way the prime minister has sidelined the devolved parliaments over the Covid response, the prime minister is seriously undermining the fabric of the United Kingdom.” Asked again about his comments, Johnson agreed that there were “great advantages in devolution”, pointing to his own period as the devolved mayor of London. But he appeared to back up his remarks about devolution in Scotland being problematic, saying that Tony Blair, who introduced it as prime minister, “has conceded that he did not foresee the rise of a separatist party in Scotland, he did not foresee the collapse of Scottish Labour”. Starmer used the rest of his questions to ask Johnson about the response to coronavirus, saying that the reason only about 11% of people fully abide by the 14-day self-isolation period is that many cannot afford to stay away from work.
Johnson said the measures of statutory sick pay of £95 a week, or the one-off payment of £500 available to some people, was and “outstanding and exceptional” package of support, and accused Starmer of not backing the government over Covid. Starmer replied that he was “not going to take lectures on supporting”. He said: “The lockdown measures were passed the other week with Labour votes – 32 of [the PM’s] own MPs broke the three-line whip. And I hear that about 50 of them have joined a WhatsApp group to work out how they’re going to oppose it next time round.” The Labour leader also highlighted accusations of cronyism and a lack of transparency in private contracts connected to the supply of protective equipment and other Covid measures. His comments came after the National Audit Office said PPE suppliers with political connections had access to a “high-priority” channel for government contracts, where bids were 10 times more likely to be successful. Johnson replied: “All government contracts are of course going to be published in the due way, and are already being published. But I must say it is extraordinary that he attacks the government for procuring PPE in huge quantities.”"
2020-11-18T12:54:01Z,politics,Politics,"Poor areas of England face 'permanent' lockdown, says public health chief","Some of England’s poorest areas face being trapped in coronavirus restrictions “permanently” unless the government tackles deep-rooted inequalities that are driving high transmission, according to a public health chief. Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said the government’s “pointlessly punishing” approach would keep areas such as his under strict measures up to next summer. He told the Guardian: “We do need the restrictions, but what we need is something that is going to be more effective, more helpful, less pointlessly punishing than continued controls that aren’t going to be effective, or that are unlikely to be effective in the medium term and cause continued and further economic damage.” Boris Johnson is expected to announce the planned route out of England’s national lockdown next week. The lockdown is due to end on 2 December. Areas with the highest infection rates are expected to remain in the highest tier of restrictions, meaning the continued closure of non-essential retail, pubs and restaurants. Blackburn has had more coronavirus cases relative to its population than any other part of the UK, despite having been under various forms of local restrictions since July. The Lancashire town has recorded 5,833 cases per 100,000 people since March. The next highest rates are in Oldham (5,667), Manchester (5,205) and Rochdale (5,078).
Harrison said analysis of the worst-hit areas showed that they were often more deprived, had a high proportion of frontline workers and multi-occupancy housing, and a relatively larger Black and minority ethnic population. In Blackburn, the poorest areas have had the heaviest toll from Covid-19. Residents in areas among the most deprived 10% nationally had had 2,678 cases since the pandemic began, Harrison said, while those in the wealthiest 10% had had none. “If the national strategy for controlling the virus, particularly in high-risk areas, isn’t going to address some of those issues, then it’s unlikely to be successful,” he said. “Effectively it would be sanctioning local authorities with high rates by imposing a further burden of sustained economic deprivation, which actually will exacerbate some of the causes. And we’re there because some of the thinking at national level is insufficiently matched to the challenge.” Official data shows that the tier 3 measures imposed in October helped reduce coronavirus rates in the worst-hit areas, including Blackburn, where the seven-day average of cases began to fall gradually from 23 October, a week after the restrictions were introduced. The same effect was seen in the Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester.
However, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said it expects coronavirus cases to fall more slowly in the second wave than in the first and that “there will be very limited room to relax interventions”. Harrison said a number of areas “stand a high risk of being in tier 3 permanently” unless bold initiatives are taken to address structural inequality. The government’s £500 support payment for people self-isolating was insufficient, he said, and should be replaced by a scheme that paid workers their full average wage, as in Germany. He added: “We need the tiering system or some method of control. But for a number of areas that are self-evidently much more risky because of some of those structural factors, mainly to do with inequality, we need a generational plan to help them recover from both the impact and escape the things that have been causing increased risk of higher rates of Covid.”"
2020-11-18T12:49:43Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer denies Jeremy Corbyn Labour whip despite end of suspension,"Keir Starmer has sparked a furious backlash from Labour leftwingers by refusing to readmit Jeremy Corbyn as a Labour MP, arguing that his predecessor has undermined efforts to restore the party’s reputation in the Jewish community. A disciplinary panel of the party’s nationl executive committee (NEC) lifted the suspension of Corbyn’s party membership on Tuesday after he issued a conciliatory statement “clarifying” controversial remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published a damning report on Labour antisemitism. In a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, Starmer said he would not be welcoming Corbyn back into the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions in response to the EHRC report undermined and set back our work in restoring trust and confidence in the Labour party’s ability to tackle antisemitism,” Starmer said. “In those circumstances, I have taken the decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn. I will keep this situation under review.” The decision sparked an angry response from Corbyn’s backers in the PLP, including Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Richard Burgon, who accused Starmer of jeopardising party unity. Andrew Scattergood, the co-chair of the grassroots campaign group Momentum, accused the party leader of “making it up as he goes along”. “This is not only farcical and incompetent, it is a blatant political attack on the left at a time when Labour should be united in taking on the Tories,” he said. Scattergood added that leftwing members would continue to “fight for a socialist Labour party”, adding “they can’t remove the whip from our movement”. Starmer appeared to be referring to Corbyn’s statement following the publication of the EHRC report on 29 October, in which he said the problem of antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”. In a “clarification” submitted to the NEC and made public this week, Corbyn said claims of antisemitism had not been “exaggerated”. That appeared to satisfy the NEC disciplinary panel, which party insiders said had decided unanimously to end the suspension of Corbyn’s Labour membership. However, it evidently did not satisfy Starmer, who repeatedly pledged during his leadership campaign to tackle the issue of antisemitism forcefully. A Labour spokesman said Corbyn was informed of the decision by the chief whip by phone on Wednesday morning. He repeatedly insisted the decision to readmit Corbyn as a party member had been made by Labour HQ, not Starmer’s office. Pressed on how long the suspension could last, the spokesman refused to be drawn, repeatedly saying he would not “give a running commentary”.
Corbyn’s supporters had insisted party rules meant he should be automatically readmitted to the PLP once the NEC decision was made, and the decision reignited the simmering civil war between Starmer and Labour leftwingers. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a close ally of Corbyn, said Starmer’s decision not to readmit Corbyn was obvious political interference. “Antisemitism and the threats of legal action which can follow from charging people with it forces us to abandon the make it up as you go along approach of catch-all rules about ‘bringing the party into disrepute’,” he said. “Political interference has to end. An independent process will ensure that. The EHRC recommendations, all of which Keir has undertaken to implement in full, will ensure that. Refusing to restore the whip to Jeremy is just another example of political interference, a kick against inevitable change to a rule-based approach.” The Labour’s spokesman said they did not accept that, adding: “The decision about membership is taken by the party; the decision about the whip is taken by the leader of the party.” Starmer appeared to repudiate the NEC’s decision, which was made under disciplinary rules being reviewed as part of the response to the EHRC report. He said: “The disciplinary process does not have the confidence of the Jewish community. That became clear once again yesterday. It is the task of my leadership to fix what I have inherited. That is what I am resolute in doing and I have asked for an independent process to be established as soon as possible.” Friends of Corbyn said Starmer’s actions could have left the party open to legal challenge because the EHRC stressed the importance of disciplinary decisions being independent from political interference. “Keir is a lawyer. Does he not realise what he is doing? It goes completely against the EHRC report,” one said. Leftwing Labour MPs also rallied behind Corbyn, with the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell calling it “just plain wrong” and saying it would “cause more division and disunity”. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, welcomed Starmer’s decision and criticised the process that led to Corbyn’s readmission to party membership. “Labour’s disciplinary process is clearly still not fit for purpose. Keir Starmer has now taken the appropriate leadership decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn,” she said. “We continue to say that ‘zero tolerance’ must mean precisely that, whether for antisemites or their apologists.” The Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has been an outspoken critic of Corbyn’s approach to antisemitism under his leadership, said the case must be looked at by the independent process that Starmer said he would set up under the EHRC recommendations. “Keir is trying to deliver on his self-confessed first priority as Labour leader – to rebuild trust with the Jewish community,” he said. “The whip cannot be restored until the new, genuinely independent complaints process assesses this case and ensures a fair decision is made. This is also the legal requirement under the EHRC report; the Labour party has to do this in order to avoid further inquiry. So it is the morally right thing to do as well as the only option available.”"
2020-11-18T10:31:46Z,politics,Politics,Five Labour councillors quit party in protest at Starmer leadership,"Five Labour councillors, including a council deputy leader, have resigned in protest at what they described as the party’s “move rightward” under Keir Starmer. The Lancaster city councillors said they were leaving the party “with sadness and rage” over issues including the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn, who said Labour’s antisemitism problem was overstated. It is thought to be the first significant resignation of Labour councillors since Starmer became leader in April. While the move deprives the party of five elected members on a delicately balanced council, it is not expected to alter its overall political control. Their announcement came minutes before Corbyn was reinstated to the party on Tuesday night, but Alistair Sinclair, one of those resigning, said the surprise move had not altered their position. In a joint statement, the councillors said Labour had “for a brief time” offered hope to millions of people that it would “fundamentally challenge the capitalist system that is destroying our planet”. They added: “Today under Starmer, it is offering a return to ‘business as usual’. The country and the world doesn’t have time for this. The climate extinction clock is ticking. So, we cannot in good conscience remain as representatives of this Labour party with which we now hold so little in common.” Four of the councillors – Sinclair, Faye Penny, Jack O’Dwyer-Henry and Katie Whearty – described Corbyn’s suspension as “an unjust attack on a decent man and an attack on the left”. They said it was now “clear that socialists have no credible strategy to regain control of the party, … Under this ‘New Leadership’, Labour has failed to oppose the ‘spycops’ bill, which threatens human rights, especially those of trade unionists and leftwing activists. Under this ‘New Leadership’, Labour has failed to provide effective opposition to the government in the pandemic, minimising trade unions’ concerns about the unsafe reopening of schools and universities. “Under this ‘New Leadership’, Labour has distanced itself from the radical and vitally necessary policies of a socialist Green New Deal.” In a separate statement, the council deputy leader, Kevin Frea, said he was resigning because the party’s democracy was “not fit for purpose” and it was “not going to take the urgent and necessary action needed to address the climate and ecological emergency”. The five councillors said they had formed a new grouping called the Eco-socialist Independents and planned to remain in the cooperative alliance that runs Lancaster city council, made up of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat councillors."
2020-11-18T00:01:27Z,politics,Politics,"'No documentation, no justification': NAO criticism of Covid contracts","The National Audit Office has published a report that finds multiple shortcomings in the way the UK government awarded contracts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Following are some examples of contracts that were singled out for criticism.
Public First The NAO report contains criticism of Cabinet Office procedures in the awarding of a contract under the emergency regulations, without a tender, that paid £550,000 to the policy consultancy firm Public First for polling and focus groups. The work began on 3 March, but as the Guardian has reported, no formal contract was put in place until 5 June. The NAO said that by awarding contracts “retrospectively” after some work has already been carried out, the government “increases risks, including underperformance”. Of the Cabinet Office contract with Public First, the report said: “We found no documentation on the consideration of conflicts of interest, no recorded process for choosing the supplier, and no specific justification for using emergency procurement.” Public First was founded by married couple James Frayne and Rachel Wolf in 2016. The report notes that Frayne worked as a director of communications at the Department for Education in 2011-12 when the education secretary was Michael Gove, for whom Wolf also worked as an adviser. It also notes, however, that Gove, now a minister for the Cabinet Office, was not involved in awarding or managing the contract. Frayne has told the Guardian that when the pandemic struck in March, Public First was already providing some focus group work for the Cabinet Office, and it was asked to conduct urgent research on the public’s understanding of Covid-19 and the government’s messages.
The Cabinet Office agreed to the work being carried out for some time without any formal contract in place. Gabriel Milland, a Public First partner, was also seconded to work in communications in Downing Street. Frayne has pointed out that the £840,000 stated on the contract was a maximum possible amount, and the NAO confirms his company billed £550,000 in total. He said his firm got the work on merit, and added: “We agreed a pay-as-you-go deal, where we could be terminated at any point if they weren’t happy with our work.” The Cabinet Office has maintained that its due diligence processes were robust. Ayanda Capital One of the most controversial PPE contracts involved a £253m deal with Ayanda Capital, a London-based investment firm whose senior adviser was Andrew Mills. At the time, Mills was also an adviser to the Board of Trade, part of the Department for International Trade (DIT), whose minister is Liz Truss. Mills’s “offer of support” was processed through the “high-priority lane”, which the government’s PPE team reserved for politically well-connected people and others it considered to be credible, according to the NAO report, “following a referral by an NHS official”. Mills acted as Ayanda’s representative and signed the contract with the Department of Health and Social Care on Ayanda’s behalf on 29 April 2020. The NAO said that initial due diligence by the DHSC only checked for political connections of Ayanda’s directors. A second round of due diligence in May “did not include Ayanda’s senior adviser [Mills] and did not identify any conflicts of interest”. The government paid Ayanda £155m for face masks with ear loops, but after that was agreed the NHS moved to preferring headband fixings. “The masks received will not be used for their original purpose,” the report states, “but may be able to be used for other purposes or resold”. Tim Horlick, Ayanda’s chief executive, said Mills’s role at the DIT had “absolutely nothing to do with the award of our contract”, and that he was “not aware” of a referral by an NHS official."
2020-11-18T00:01:20Z,politics,Politics,"Ban household-mixing and travel between tiers after lockdown, BMA urges","Mixing between more than two households and travel between tiers should be banned in England until a vaccine is rolled out to prevent the NHS being swamped after lockdown, the main doctors’ organisation has warned. With ministers due to announce next week a return to regional tiers of coronavirus restrictions from 2 December, the British Medical Association (BMA) said that without tough action, hospitals and GPs will become overwhelmed. A BMA report argues that robust measures will be needed until an effective vaccine is widely available, and that ministers must learn from what it called the over-lax exit from the last lockdown. As well as a two-household maximum for mixing and a ban on travel between areas in different tiers, the BMA says people should be urged to continue working from home where possible, and that guidance on Covid measures in workplaces and businesses must become compulsory. The report also calls for “wide-scale reform” of the test-and-trace system, with more funding given to local public health teams and a more effective app. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA council, said: “We must not squander the efforts of the many people who have followed the law, stayed at home, sacrificed freedoms and incurred financial loss in order to contain the virus.” The report came as a hospital in Kent declared an internal critical incident after coming under serious pressure from treating what is thought to be around 110 patients with Covid-19. The Medway NHS trust, which runs Medway Maritime hospital in Gillingham, took the action after a sharp increase in Covid cases in recent weeks, the Health Service Journal reported. It is thought to be the first trust in the south-east, which has so far seen many fewer cases in the second wave than the north and Midlands, to declare an internal critical incident. Meanwhile, public health experts said people should prepare for a low-key Christmas, or even one spent outdoors, because the second lockdown may not significantly suppress the rate of coronavirus infections. Officials and ministers are still awaiting key data on the effectiveness of the four-week restrictions imposed across England, meaning a promised update to parliament on the next steps is unlikely to happen before late next week.
Scientists said that while they accepted the economic need for shops and hospitality businesses to reopen before the crucial festive season, the advent of seemingly effective vaccines meant people could consider postponing big family get-togethers. “We really have to be careful that we don’t just focus on what is going to happen in six weeks’ time,” said Prof Catherine Noakes, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), who was speaking to the Guardian in a personal capacity. “I know it is human nature to do that, but we will be better off planning for the longer duration and thinking of, actually, can we have a more low-key Christmas and new year this year and perhaps plan to do the bigger family celebrations in the summer when the risks are likely to be far lower for all sorts of reasons,” said Noakes, an expert in the transport of airborne pathogens from the University of Leeds. Prof Gabriel Scally, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said he had little hope that the latest lockdown will quash the spread of the virus, given the spring lockdown had little effect in reducing infection levels in some parts of England. “We know that the [last] and even more severe lockdown did not get the virus under control, so how can we expect that this will bring the virus under control given that some things have not changed?” he argued. “How can we be in a good place by Christmas? I think it is impossible,” Scally said, adding that the aim should be for “a new, Covid-safe Christmas”, involving well-ventilated homes and lots of outdoor time. He suggested people could plant a Christmas tree in their garden, if they have one, and open presents underneath. But Downing Street faces intense pressure from Conservative MPs in the newly-formed Covid Recovery Group to limit restrictions. One senior backbencher who is in the group said even the pre-lockdown tier 2, which bans household mixing indoors, “would be fatal for huge numbers of restaurants, pubs and bars”. They said: “It would be crazy to go into some sort of lockdown, in tiers, that was broadly the same for large swathes of the country and cause immense damage.” One government source said that while anecdotal evidence was that infection and hospitalisation rates were “moving in the right direction”, ministers were awaiting data from the midway point of the lockdown, which falls on Thursday.
Christmas, they said, was being treated as a separate issue in terms of restrictions: “You’ve got to factor human behaviour into this. You can’t just say: ‘It’s winter, bringing elderly people indoors with high Covid prevalence and during flu season isn’t a good idea.’ You’ve got to acknowledge that it is Christmas.”"
2020-11-17T20:53:15Z,politics,Politics,Labour reinstates Jeremy Corbyn after suspension over antisemitism remarks,"Jeremy Corbyn has been reinstated to the Labour party after a 19-day suspension, in a move that was hailed by his supporters but threatened the shaky truce with Jewish Labour members and concerned MPs. The former Labour leader is understood to have been sanctioned with a formal warning by a panel of the party’s governing body on Tuesday. But it ruled that his 55-year membership could resume less than three weeks after he was suspended for saying the party’s problem with antisemitism had been overstated. The Guardian understands no decision has been made whether to restore the whip to Corbyn – a decision that would need to be made by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and the chief whip, Nick Brown. It is understood at least one Labour MP told colleagues on Tuesday night that they felt “betrayed” and were considering their position in the party. The Jewish Labour Movement (JVM) called the decision “extraordinary” and said it was the work of a “factionally aligned political committee”. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking and Dagenham, said: “I simply cannot comprehend why it is acceptable for Corbyn to be a Labour MP if he thinks antisemitism is exaggerated and a political attack, refuses to apologise, never takes responsibility for his actions and rejects the findings of the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] report.” Despite dismay from the party’s Jewish affiliate and antisemitism campaigners, the reinstatement could smooth Starmer’s efforts towards unity with the left of the party. Len McCluskey, head of the Unite union, Labour’s biggest donor, tweeted: “Jeremy Corbyn’s readmission is the correct, fair and unifying decision.” Corbyn tweeted on Tuesday evening: “I am pleased to have been reinstated in the Labour party and would like to thank party members, trade unionists and all who have offered solidarity. Our movement must now come together to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government.” Starmer said it was “another painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle antisemitism”. He said Corbyn’s statement in response to the EHRC “completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour party. This should shame us all.” In a hint Starmer hopes to move on from the controversy, he said: “I will not allow a focus on one individual to prevent us from doing the vital work of tackling antisemitism.” However, a number of MPs expressed anger at the Labour leadership’s handling of the complaint process, with some blaming “political naivety” and a mistaken belief that a compromise would satisfy both sides. Other MPs privately expressed horror at the speed of the decision and what they described as the appearance of political interference. One called it a “monumental disaster” and another said it was “the biggest own goal the NEC [national executive committee] could possibly inflict, at the worst possible moment”. Ian Austin, the former MP who quit the party over antisemitism, said: “I praised Keir Starmer when Corbyn was suspended but this decision undermines all the progress he has made. In the end, they have to decide if they want to repair relations with the Jewish community and show lifelong Labour voters who turned away in disgust at the extremism and racism that poisoned the party under Corbyn that things have changed.” Corbyn issued a statement ahead of the NEC panel that met on Tuesday to decide his fate, saying he regretted any hurt caused by his words following the report by the equalities watchdog into antisemitism. The statement is understood to have been prepared in the days after his suspension on 29 October, and submitted to the party as part of the investigation process. A spokesman for JLM, which is the party’s only Jewish affiliate, said it was “insincere and wholly inadequate” and offered no apology for the failings identified in the EHRC report. It said Corbyn’s response to the report had been “grossly offensive as it downplayed the reality of antisemitism in the Labour party”, adding: “Today’s decision will only embolden those who agreed with him. Once again we find ourselves having to remind the Labour party that Jeremy Corbyn is not the victim of Labour antisemitism – Jewish members are.” A panel from the NEC agreed to lift Corbyn’s suspension and issued a formal warning. The panel had a number of options available to it, including dismissing the case entirely, issuing a “reminder” of Labour’s values, the formal reprimand given to Corbyn, a time-limited suspension or recommending he be expelled. The panel is understood to have included Unison’s Wendy Nichols, Ian Murray from the Fire Brigades Union, Labour councillors Gurinder Singh Josan and Alice Perry, and party member representative Yasmine Dar. The swiftness with which Corbyn’s case has been heard by the party’s governing body has raised eyebrows in some Labour circles when ordinary members’ cases normally take months.
The former Labour leader was suspended for his comments, which rejected the overall conclusions of the EHRC report into antisemitism in the party and said the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. That statement set him directly at odds with Starmer, who spoke at a press conference moments after Corbyn’s statement and said those who “deny there is a problem are part of the problem … Those who pretend it is all exaggerated or factional are part of the problem.” Corbyn said on Tuesday he regretted the pain that had been caused. “We must never tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it. And that was not my intention in anything I said this week,” his statement said. “I regret the pain this issue has caused the Jewish community and would wish to do nothing that would exacerbate or prolong it.” Corbyn said he had attempted to “clear up any confusion” about his previous statement in a broadcast interview and clarifying statement on the day, though he does not directly apologise for the comments. “The publication of the EHRC report should have been a moment for the Labour party to come together in a determination to address the shortcomings of the past and work as one to root out antisemitism in our own ranks and wider society,” he said. “To be clear, concerns about antisemitism are neither ‘exaggerated’ nor ‘overstated’. The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour party members were and remain committed antiracists deeply opposed to antisemitism.” Corbyn said he supported Starmer’s decision to accept all the EHRC recommendations in full, and “in accordance with my own lifelong convictions, will do what I can to help the party move on, united against antisemitism which has been responsible for so many of history’s greatest crimes against humanity”. The initial decision to suspend Corbyn was taken by the party’s general secretary, David Evans, rather than Starmer. The party had stressed that Corbyn must go through the formal disciplinary process given that political interference in cases was one of the key criticisms in the EHRC report. The report found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cited “serious failings in the party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”."
2020-11-17T20:10:53Z,politics,Politics,Jewish Labour Movement condemns Corbyn's readmission,"The Jewish Labour Movement has condemned the decision to reinstate Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour party, warning it would merely “embolden those who agreed with him”. JLM said the former party leader’s statement – in which he said concerns about antisemitism were neither exaggerated nor overstated – was “insincere and wholly inadequate”. The movement said he had “offered no apology for his total failure of leadership to tackle antisemitism” in the party.
“Once again we find ourselves having to remind the Labour party that Jeremy Corbyn is not the victim of Labour antisemitism – Jewish members are”. Criticising the process which led to Corbyn’s reinstatement, it claimed that while allegations of antisemitism were delayed and subjected to “political manipulation”, the disciplinary process was “expedited” for Corbyn. The Labour MP Margaret Hodge, one of Corbyn’s fiercest critics, said she could not comprehend the move, describing it as “a broken outcome from a broken system … factional, opaque and dysfunctional complaints process could never reach a fair conclusion.” “This is exactly why the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] instructed Labour to set up an independent process!” she tweeted.
“I simply cannot comprehend why it is acceptable for Corbyn to be a Labour MP if he thinks antisemitism is exaggerated and a political attack, refuses to apologise, never takes responsibility for his actions and rejects the findings of the EHRC report.” The Board of Deputies of British Jews called the decision to reinstate Corbyn a “retrograde step”. Its president, Marie van der Zyl, the Jewish leadership chairman, Jonathan Goldstein, and the community security trust chief executive, Mark Gardner, said: “Jeremy Corbyn’s dismissive approach to the damning EHRC’s findings rightly saw him suspended. “For Jeremy Corbyn’s allies on the NEC to expedite his case whilst hundreds of other cases languished under his tenure, and his confected non-apology earlier today adds insult to injury. “This politicisation of the process goes against what the EHRC recommended just last month. Labour’s mountain to climb to win back the trust of our community just got higher.” Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, said he hoped the move would unite the party. “I think it will certainly help heal the divisions in the party unfortunately the divisions in the party are quite deep rooted. Anti semitism was fuelled by factionalism, and dealing with anti-semitism was also hampered by factionalism. I think suspending him made the divisions worse and I think this will heal them but there is a long way to go.” He suggested “some kind of peace and reconciliation process” to restore confidence and trust in party disciplinary processes. However, the staunch Corbyn ally Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said the readmission was “the correct, fair and unifying decision”. “As a party we now move forward … and redouble our efforts to inspire voters about Keir’s 10 pledges and the transformation of our nations into fairer places for our people. Only Labour, united and strong, can bring this about.” The MP Nadia Whittome, who had expressed solidarity with Corbyn when he was suspended, also said she was “very pleased” with the decision. “It’s time for our party to move forward: implement the recommendations of the EHRC report, root out antisemitism and come together to fight against this dangerous government. We have big battles to win,” she tweeted.
Kate Osborne, Labour MP for Jarrow, tweeted: “Delighted that Jeremy Corbyn has been reinstated! #WelcomeBackCorbyn” Kim Johnson, the MP for Liverpool Riverside, and Zarah Sultana, MP for Coventry South, also both took to Twitter to welcome the news. “He has spent his whole life fighting for peace, justice and equality,” said Sultana. “That fight isn’t over.” However, another Labour MP, Neil Coyle, suggested the EHRC “may not be done” with the party after his readmittance. “The EHRC found the Labour party guilty of unlawful discrimination and instructed us to implement a new, independent complaints process and end political interference. “That could not be more demonstrably necessary. The EHRC may not be done with Labour yet.” And Mike Gapes, one of the seven MPs who quit Labour last year over Corbyn’s leadership, policies and “the anti-Jewish racism”, said: “This has now become defining watershed for Keir Starmer and the future of the Labour party.”"
2020-11-17T19:58:40Z,politics,Politics,How did Labour resolve Jeremy Corbyn's suspension case?,"Ken Livingstone was suspended for almost two years before his antisemitism case with the Labour party was resolved. After Jeremy Corbyn’s shock suspension in the wake of a damning report by the equalities watchdog, the former leader’s case was heard within 19 days and he has been reinstated. Some in Labour have said it is a sign of a system that is working better and making swifter decisions; one of the key criticisms made by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in its report was that the process was too slow. However, others have raised questions about the speed with which it was resolved and are angry that Corbyn’s case was heard by a panel of the party’s governing body, much of which is elected by factional slates. They say it is exactly this process that was criticised by the EHRC because it is so vulnerable to political interference. The EHRC recommended that an independent process be set up, but allies of Corbyn were keen not to wait long for a resolution to his case, and that independent system may take many more months to implement. After any suspension of a Labour member, which in Corbyn’s case was made by the party’s general secretary, David Evans, the evidence is examined by Labour staff in the party’s governance and legal unit (GLU). Staff in the unit, which was expanded under Corbyn to deal with an avalanche of cases, look at the details of the case and make a formal recommendation, which can include a number of disciplinary penalties – or can recommend expulsion from the party. The final decision is made by a panel of five members of the national executive committee (NEC), who are given legal advice. In this case, the panel is understood to have included Ian Murray, from the Fire Brigades Union, the Labour councillors Gurinder Singh Josan and Alice Perry, Unison’s Wendy Nichols and the party member representative Yasmine Dar. Though some have accused the panel of being politically skewed to favour Corbyn, the factional makeup is fairly balanced between Corbynites and Corbyn sceptics. They do not have to accept the GLU recommendation, but often do. In this case, the panel is understood to have debated for four hours, and it is unclear whether the recommendation was accepted. In each case, the panel has a number of options to consider, including dismissing the case entirely, issuing a “reminder” of the party’s values, issuing a formal reprimand, issuing a time-limited suspension or recommending the member be expelled. In Tuesday’s meeting, it is understood, Corbyn was issued with a formal warning. There was no question of the panel deciding to expel the former Labour leader. The most serious cases are not resolved by the NEC. With these, the panel will recommend the case be heard by the national constitutional committee. This is an elected, quasi-judicial body, and the only body able to expel members from the party."

Full details of the announcement are here. The shock of the Covid-19 crisis has caused permanent change to the UK economy and could be the catalyst for ending a long period of low investment and weak productivity growth, the governor of the Bank of England has said. The UK government is reviewing England’s tiering system to decide which coronavirus restrictions should be put in place when the national lockdown ends on 2 December, the communities secretary has confirmed. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has refused to disclose whether he will profit from a surge in the share price of the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer Moderna, one of the biggest investments held by the hedge fund he co-founded before entering parliament. EasyJet has slumped to a £1.3bn full-year loss, the first in its 25-year history, but said bookings had been boosted by positive news on Covid-19 vaccines. The Welsh government has launched a withering attack on Boris Johnson’s dismissal of devolution as “a disaster north of the border”, calling the prime minister’s remarks “shocking” and claiming the conduct of his administration is threatening the future of the United Kingdom. The Treasury is planning to slash billions from the overseas aid budget despite the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, praising the government’s 0.7% aid target on Monday as representing UK values in front of aides to Joe Biden. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension from the Labour party could be resolved as early as Tuesday, with a panel of the party’s governing body expected to meet to consider disciplinary action against the former leader, the Guardian understands. That’s all from me for today. Our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-11-17T17:01:55Z,politics,Politics,Mark Sedwill gives masterclass in saying little of substance at some length | John Crace,"Shortly after Mark Sedwill announced he would be stepping down as the cabinet secretary and the national security adviser in September, he gave a speech in which he described his life before government. “I’ve had a gun in my face from Saddam Hussein’s bodyguards,” he said. “A bomb under my seat at a polo match in the foothills of the Himalayas; I’ve been hosted by a man plotting to have me assassinated; I’ve been shot at, mortared and even had someone come after me with a suicide vest.” So, as you might expect, what could have been an awkward two-hour appearance before the public administration and constitutional affairs select committee scarcely registered on his heart-rate monitor. Not that the committee didn’t do their best to winkle out the dysfunctionality at the heart of government and discover how and why Sedwill had been forced out. Just that Sedwill was clear from the start that everything was going to be conducted entirely on his terms and that any revelations he were to make would be completely deliberate. And he certainly wasn’t going to be drawn on last week’s meltdown in No 10 which ended with the departure of both his old enemies, Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain. Oh that, he shrugged. These things happened all the time. Advisers came and went. And he certainly wasn’t bothered by some gobshite whose only weapons were 20,000-word blogs and imaginary hand grenades. What goes around, comes around. The committee chair, William Wragg, tried to probe a little deeper. “You say you weren’t sacked, you didn’t resign and you weren’t made redundant,” he said, sounding more and more confused. “If that’s the case, why did you go?” Sedwill barely broke sweat in finding a non-answer. A civil servant’s gonna do, what a civil servant’s gonna do. It had been a voluntary agreement that he should leave in September even though he had never previously said he was planning to go at that time. It had been a spontaneous decision to leave right in the middle of the Covid pandemic and with less than four months to conclude a Brexit deal. He just wanted to give his successor as little time as possible to settle in during a national crisis. But it is true that you were consistently being briefed against? Sedwill conceded that he had had a difficult time, but as all the briefings had been conducted anonymously he wasn’t able to confirm they had largely been orchestrated by Cummings, Michael Gove and other members of the Vote Leave team who were convinced that none of the senior civil servants really believed in the Brexit project. Though he was at pains to point out that he himself had been described as a fervent Brexiter and an ardent remoaner, so he must have been doing something right. So it was all a bit of a mystery. But he had been assured by both prime ministers – Theresa May and Boris Johnson – under whom he had served that they would do their best to get to the bottom of it and prevent any more negative briefings. Though sadly, neither had been very successful at that. Like most top civil servants, Sedwill is a master of misdirection and of saying very little of substance at some length. He wears you down by attrition as much as by force of argument. So when he tried to claim there was nothing particularly unusual in so many permanent secretaries in government departments all resigning or being sacked at roughly the same time, and that they were all just coming to the end of their five-year secondments anyway, there was very little pushback. Labour’s Rachel Hopkins did ask if it should have been Gavin Williamson who got the sack over the exams fiasco in the summer rather than Jonathan Slater, his permanent secretary, but Sir Humphrey couldn’t possibly comment. These were delicate matters and the whole point of private conversations was that they should remain private. Which was as close as he could bring himself to saying that he would happily have seen the back of Williamson a second time, having persuaded May to fire him once before for leaking details of the cational security council. Sedwill did find time to land Johnson in some trouble by observing that the report into claims of bullying by Priti Patel had been gathering dust on the prime minister’s desk for some time now. Though naturally he had no idea what it contained. There are some old scores that are just too tempting not to settle and there is no love lost between Sedwill and Boris. But after that the former cabinet secretary went out of his way to present himself and government as a model of moderation. I’d hate to imagine what a bad day at the office might look like. Yes, he was sure there would be lessons to be learned about the government’s handling of coronavirus, though he was curiously vague as to how many – if any – of the proposals put forward in the Operation Cygnus pandemic planning exercise had been put in place. We did do OK on getting our fair share of PPE, he added, which was again not how many people will have remembered the events of last spring. But that’s one of the joys he’d recently discovered about no longer being cabinet secretary. Quite apart from the £250k lump sum in the pension pot and the elevation to the House of Lords, he’s no longer really responsible for anything. No more crisis meetings. No more outbursts from second-rate special advisers. No more infighting. The hard rain that Cummings had promised had arrived. And it had fallen on Dom and the rest of his crew."
2020-11-17T16:24:29Z,politics,Politics,'A disaster': Boris Johnson adds to his devolution problems,"Scotland Libby Brooks, Scotland correspondent The pandemic has exposed deep faultlines between Westminster and the devolved administrations, with the Scottish and Welsh governments expressing growing frustration about the collapse of the much-vaunted “four-nations approach”, a lack of direct communication and the recent uncertainty over whether furlough would be extended beyond England. Observers say the pandemic has opened many eyes at Westminster to the extent of the powers the devolved nations already hold, but likewise it has led the Scottish National party government to call for their extension, in particular over financial levers. In July the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accused Boris Johnson of using Covid as “a political weapon” when he used his first visit to Scotland since the general election to hammer home a message that the UK’s response to the virus exemplified the “sheer might” of the union. The UK internal market bill has likewise prompted fierce criticism from the Holyrood government since it was published in early September, with Sturgeon describing the post-Brexit plans as “an abomination which would cripple devolution”. While the SNP continues to oppose all aspects of Brexit, the party has lately focused on these proposals, which include a mutual recognition regime, requiring regulatory standards in one part of the UK to be automatically accepted in others, and which Sturgeon has argued would mean a race to the bottom over food standards and environmental protections. In October, in what remains a symbolic vote, MSPs at Holyrood rejected the bill. At a more personal level, Johnson struggles with rock-bottom approval ratings in Scotland, compared with strong public trust in the Scottish government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Wales Steven Morris The relationship between the Welsh government and Johnson has often been fraught during the coronavirus crisis. The prime minister’s devolution remarks , in which he described devolution as “a disaster north of the border”, have made it much, much worse. Welsh ministers are usually thoughtful and measured when they speak about devolution issues and the union – after all, the Labour-led government supports both concepts – but it has reacted angrily to Johnson’s comments. The Welsh counsel general and minister for European transition, Jeremy Miles, said: “The PM’s comments are shocking but sadly not surprising. It has been clear for some time that this Conservative government is not remotely interested in respecting the devolution settlements across the UK.” The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has repeatedly expressed frustration at the lack of regular dialogue between the two governments during the Covid crisis and was furious when Johnson refused to act to stop people travelling from hotspot areas in England to Wales. There is also huge tension between the governments over the internal market bill, which the Welsh government has called “an outrageous powergrab” that “seriously imperils the devolution settlement”. However, Drakeford is a firm supporter of the union and has continued to argue that, thus far at least, devolution has worked, saying the Covid crisis has shown Wales does have powers that allow it to act independently. But there is no doubt Johnson’s remarks will give the nationalists extra firepower. Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, which backs independence, said the “biggest mistake” for Wales was that it had not left the union already. The independence campaign group YesCymru, whose membership is growing, said: “People in Wales are waking up to the fact that the UK is about to end. The question for all in Wales – irrespective of politics – is what happens to Wales when Scotland leaves? Independence, or incorporation into England? Devolution won’t hold.” Northern Ireland Rory Carroll, Ireland correspondent Northern Ireland is a political minefield for Downing Street because of Brexit, Joe Biden, a dysfunctional Stormont executive and unresolved “legacy” issues from the Troubles. From 1 January the Northern Ireland protocol will require customs declarations and other checks on all goods coming from Great Britain. Business leaders have warned that trade across the Irish Sea could be paralysed. There are fears many businesses will not cope with the mandatory paperwork required for sales in Northern Ireland. Such disruption would torpedo Johnson’s promise of frictionless trade. His ostensible solution – legislation to override the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland – could lead to a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. This would dismay the US president-elect and congressional Democrats. Biden has warned the prime minister that if he undermines the Good Friday agreement he can forget about a trade deal with Washington. Stormont’s power-sharing government is fraying from divisions over Brexit and Covid-19 restrictions. Sinn Féin wants a referendum on Irish unity and none of the parties – least of all his erstwhile allies, the Democratic Unionist party – trust Johnson. A combustible mix. The prime minister has alienated almost all sides with a plan to permanently close cases of serious crimes committed during the Troubles. MPs said the plan lacked credibility and legitimacy and raised profound legal, ethical and human rights issues.
Northern England and Andy Burnham Nazia Parveen, North of England correspondent Recent fractured negotiations between the government and regional leaders have put devolution back on the agenda in the north. Just a few weeks ago the Northern Powerhouse Partnership renewed its call for a stronger devolved voice for the north-east, with other northern leaders also extolling the benefits of localised decision-making in an effort to seize power from Whitehall. It followed a public spat between the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, who was labelled “king of the north” as he highlighted the unfair treatment of northern regions during the pandemic. Burnham described Johnson’s recent comments as worrying and called for the country to adopt a more federal model of government, with those in Greater Manchester becoming “masters of their own destiny”. “The time has come for a more federal UK where we take more power out of Westminster, put it closer to people, and I think that in the long run will strengthen the country and build a better way of doing politics,” he said. Bob Buxton, the Yorkshire party leader, said Johnson’s comments highlighted Westminster’s desire to keep a tight grip on the UK. Founded in 2014, Buxton’s party campaigns for the establishment of a devolved Yorkshire assembly with powers over education, environment, transport and housing. “The prime minister’s remarks … show his true attitudes and fears – he believes Yorkshire wouldn’t vote Tory and so he hogs the power in London,” said Buxton."
2020-11-17T13:39:24Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak refuses to say if he will profit from Moderna Covid vaccine,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has refused to disclose whether he will profit from a surge in the share price of the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer Moderna, one of the biggest investments held by the hedge fund he co-founded before entering parliament. Moderna has become the latest biotech firm to announce successful trials of its vaccine, declaring on Monday that it was 94.5% effective in trials. Sunak was a founding partner of Theleme Partners, a major investor in Moderna, and one of the executives managing its US office. He left the firm in 2013, returning to the UK to pursue his political career. It is not known whether the chancellor retained any investment in the Theleme fund after leaving. Theleme is registered in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven which does not make company records public. Ordinarily, a partner in a hedge fund would own a stake in the management company and have money invested in its fund. A year ago, Sunak declared in the list of ministers’ interests that he was the beneficiary of a blind trust. The contents of the trust have not been disclosed to the public. Stock market filings show that Theleme has a $500m (£377m) investment in the US-based Moderna, which accounts for around 20% of all the money it manages, about $2.5bn. Shortly after the news of Moderna’s successful trial broke, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, revealed that the government had secured an advance order for 5m doses of the vaccine.
Theleme is reported to have invested in Moderna before the company was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2018, when it was valued at more than $7bn. Its share price rocketed this year on the hopes of a vaccine for coronavirus, and its stock market value now stands at $39bn. Sunak’s office refused to disclose whether his investments included a stake in Theleme’s fund or Moderna at the time his blind trust was created. A Treasury spokesman said: “The Cabinet Office has set out what are judged to be the relevant interests in the regular list of ministerial interests.” The chancellor appears to have retained contacts with his former firm. John Sheridan, a partner at Theleme, was reportedly asked by Sunak to build a financial model for the government’s business loans programme. The Treasury spokesperson said it was not unusual for politicians to draw on a range of expertise from outside government, and that Sheridan had access to publicly available data. Since entering parliament, Sunak has revealed almost nothing about his financial interests. His entry in the MPs’ register is among the shortest – stating only that he owns property worth more than £100,000 and receives rental income of more than £10,000 a year. In November last year, after being promoted to chief secretary to the Treasury, Sunak declared financial interests in a “blind trust/blind management arrangement”. This means that certain assets, likely to include shares, have been passed to another person to manage. Ministers using such trusts have no knowledge of decisions taken about the management of the assets, however critics of the system point out that they remain aware of which assets existed when the trust was created, which could lead to a conflict of interest. Commenting on the chancellor’s blind trust last month, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “The truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.” No other chancellor has used a blind trust since details of ministers’ interests began being published in 2009. The Treasury spokesperson said blind trusts and blind management arrangements were designed to “ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement”. They said such trusts had been used by “politicians of all stripes”, including members of the last Labour government, to avoid any conflict of interest. A government source said the chancellor had followed the process set out in the ministerial code. His interests had been reviewed by the Cabinet Office and the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan, who were “satisfied with the arrangements”.
However, the government’s decision to purchase the Moderna vaccine will intensify calls for Sunak to disclose whether he stands to benefit from the company’s success. “The chancellor must now declare these interests in full,” said Cat Hobbs, the director of the campaign group We Own It. “Anything less than a full disclosure is thumbing his nose at the British public.” Johnson’s government is facing mounting criticism over ethics and propriety. In a talk this month, the standards watchdog, Jonathan Evans, spoke of “real concern” that public trust in ministers was eroding. The former MI5 director general, who chairs the committee on standards in public life, said there was growing talk of a “post Nolan age”. Judge Michael Nolan was the committee’s founding chair, and his report set out principles for public life following corruption scandals 25 years ago. In late October, Moderna said the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had begun a “rolling review” of its product, a process designed to fast-track the approval of new medicines. Leading Monday’s Downing Street press conference, Hancock announced the deal with Moderna, saying it had been negotiated earlier that day, and that the first doses could be delivered to the UK in spring next year.
Moderna has already signed advance purchase deals with the EU and the governments of Canada, Japan and the US – which has committed to paying $1.5bn for 100m doses. Its vaccine is among the most expensive, costing up to £45 for a course of two shots. MPs are not obliged to declare minority shareholdings. The requirements are stricter for ministers, who must declare any financial interests deemed relevant to their portfolio of responsibilities. Publishing the November 2019 list of ministers’ interests, the then parliamentary secretary for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, said: “Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their ministerial position and their private interests, financial or otherwise. The list captures those interests relevant to ministers’ ministerial responsibilities.”"
2020-11-17T13:32:01Z,politics,Politics,Welsh government calls PM's devolution remarks 'shocking',"The Welsh government has launched a withering attack on Boris Johnsonâ€™s dismissal of devolution as â€œa disaster north of the borderâ€�, calling the prime ministerâ€™s remarks â€œshockingâ€� and claiming the conduct of his administration is threatening the future of the United Kingdom. While Johnson aimed his comments at Scotland, the Labour-led Welsh government argued they showed the UK government was not â€œremotely interestedâ€� in respecting devolution across the union. Relationships between Cardiff and Westminster have becomex strained during the Covid crisis and Johnsonâ€™s remarks have clearly touched a nerve. The Welsh counsel general and minister for European transition, Jeremy Miles, said: â€œThe PMâ€™s comments are shocking but sadly not surprising. It has been clear for some time that this Conservative government is not remotely interested in respecting the devolution settlements across the UK. â€œThe prime minister is also minister for the union â€“ but the conduct of his government is actually the biggest threat to the future of the union.â€� The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, was also highly critical of the comments. He said: â€œDevolution comes under the sorts of pressures that it is now under when we have a Conservative government, and where you scratch the surface of the Conservative party and all its old hostility to devolution rises back to the surface. â€œThatâ€™s what happened yesterday, when the prime minister thought that he could show off in front of a few Conservative MPs from the north of England.â€� The Welsh government has become increasingly frustrated at the sporadic contact between the UK government and the devolved administrations during the coronavirus pandemic. Like Scotland, Welsh ministers also angry at what it sees as a â€œpower grabâ€� from Westminster in the shape of the internal market bill and are worried about the way Wales will be funded after Brexit. Miles added: â€œIf they [the UK government] want to demonstrate that they are prepared to relent, and respect the will of the people in the devolved nations, they should immediately overhaul the internal market bill, with its assault on devolution, and finally commit to working with, not working around, the Welsh government when it comes to the shared prosperity fund [which is designed to replace EU funding] and future funding for Wales.â€� During a Zoom call with about 60 northern Conservative MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister described devolution as â€œTony Blairâ€™s biggest mistakeâ€�. Downing Street later said the remarks referred to Scottish National party mismanagement. In response to the remarks, which also included Johnson saying he could not â€œsee a caseâ€� for handing down further powers, Scotlandâ€™s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said they backed the case for independence. She tweeted: â€œWorth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories say theyâ€™re not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament â€“ or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers. â€œThe only way to protect and strengthen the Scottish Parliament is with independence.â€� Both Douglas Ross, who leads the Conservatives in Scotland, and Paul Davies, who leads the Tories in the Welsh parliament, insisted that devolution had not been a disaster. Johnsonâ€™s remarks were eagerly seized on by Welsh nationalists. Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, said the â€œbiggest mistakeâ€� for Wales was that it had not left the union already.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, who speaks for Plaid on health, said: â€œLetâ€™s not allow the desperate leaders of a failed UK state to dictate our future.â€�
The campaign group YesCymru, whose membership is growing, said: â€œPeople in Wales are waking up to the fact that the UK is about to end. The question for all in Wales â€“ irrespective of politics â€“ is what happens to Wales when Scotland leaves? Independence, or incorporation into England? Devolution wonâ€™t hold.â€�
The prime ministerâ€™s spokesman said: â€œThe PM has always fully supported devolution, and this government continues to put the union at the heart of all that we do. Now, more than ever, is the time for the United Kingdom to be pulling together to focus on defeating this virus.â€�"
2020-11-17T11:58:54Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's verbal incontinence a huge boost for Nicola Sturgeon,"Nicola Sturgeon’s reaction to Boris Johnson’s disparaging and dismissive remarks about devolution made to around 60 Tory MPs on Monday night neatly summed up their potency. Scotland’s first minister said to her 1.3 million followers on Twitter it was “worth bookmarking” the prime minister’s descriptions of devolution as “a disaster north of the border” and Tony Blair’s “biggest mistake”. Those comments will not just be bookmarked, but will be printed repeatedly on Scottish National party election leaflets in next May’s Holyrood election; they will be quoted in SNP political broadcasts, parliamentary debates and, said Sturgeon, every time that a Tory minister or MP insists they respect devolution. For the Scottish Tories, and those of his colleagues in the UK government trying to reverse the steady decline in support for the union during Johnson’s premiership, such as Michael Gove at the Cabinet Office, his remarks are a disaster. For his many internal critics – including some of the Tory MPs Johnson was talking to on Monday – it was another example of his verbal incontinence, his unerring capacity for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. The surge in support over the summer for Sturgeon, the SNP and Scottish independence – now reaching as high as 58% in the polls – has put the Tories on a war footing. They have been ruthless, summarily sacking their ineffectual Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, and replacing him with a young MP, Douglas Ross, in an unopposed coronation. With the polls suggesting the SNP is seven months away from winning a Holyrood majority that many believe will make the case for a second independence referendum unanswerable, Ross has one job: to stop Sturgeon getting that majority. Do that, his allies argue, and they win breathing space to avert the break-up of the UK. Ross has battled to put distance between the Scottish Tories and Johnson, seemingly with Gove’s tacit support within the cabinet, repeatedly challenging the prime minister in public over difficult policies, and forcing Johnson to pressurise the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, into spending billions more on extending the furlough scheme. Ross has supported increased devolution, suggesting Scotland might have greater autonomy over immigration policy, he has supported state-funded free school meals, extending universal credit, and he has attacked Johnson’s handling of the coronavirus crisis and his lockdown strategy. The pro-union forces inside the UK government, those trying to prove the union is good for Scotland post-Brexit, had identified a series of multi-billion pound infrastructure investment plans and economic reforms they hoped would rebuild Scottish faith in the union dividend. Those include building free ports in Scottish coastal towns and cities, spending billions on upgrading the A75 trunk road, connecting Northern Ireland via the ferry terminal near Stranraer with Britain’s businesses and shops. They hoped to show Sturgeon’s government was churlishly resisting those investments. They hoped too to point at the £8.2bn in extra funding to Scotland, asking questions about the fate of several unspent billions. With two soundbites, Johnson has instead wrecked that strategy, perhaps accelerating moves within the Tory party to replace him. Those remarks remind his internal enemies he is the primary source of their crisis in Scotland. He has said similar things before. To many Scottish voters, he embodies Brexit and English nationalism, the figurehead of the UK government’s plans to over-ride Holyrood’s devolution powers post-Brexit, and, underlying that all, showing an entitled disregard for their preferences. Attacking Blair reinforces the view that Johnson has a tin ear. The then Labour prime minister was responding to Scottish popular demands for increased autonomy when he agreed to the 1997 devolution referendum. A majority of Scots voted against Brexit. A majority of Scots rejected Johnson. He may have just written Sturgeon’s election-winning leaflet."
2020-11-16T19:07:13Z,politics,Politics,Loser’s loser Matt Hancock fulfils his role as GMB whipping boy | John Crace,"It’s the new touchy-feely government. One that will smother you with promises of love even if it can’t keep you alive. There was no coincidence in the government ending its 201-day boycott of ITV’s Good Morning Britain on the first available day after wannabe hardmen Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain had been kicked out of No 10. Nor was it a coincidence that it was Matt Hancock who was the member of the cabinet chosen to be the GMB whipping boy. To smile insincerely and nod his head from time to time as Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid humiliated him for more than 20 minutes. The health secretary is Boris Johnson’s go-to Door Matt. A person who commands almost as little authority inside the cabinet as he does outside. The harder he tries to become one of the in-crowd, the less respect he gets from his colleagues. The pathos is almost unbearable. He is the loser’s loser. “Where have you been?” Morgan asked. Door Matt insisted he had come on to the programme at the first moment his diary had allowed. He had been working so hard that he hadn’t had a spare minute for ITV. Morgan bulldozed onwards, determined to make up for lost time. Had Hancock supported the GMB boycott? “I’m here to answer your questions now,” Matt continued, apparently unaware he had omitted to answer the first one that had been asked. The two presenters then took turns to act as the battering ram, with Morgan at one point reading out a 90-second charge sheet of the health secretary’s failures over the past six months. Why hadn’t he resigned? That was just cruel. Everyone knows that Boris gets far more pleasure out of having someone he can bully in charge of the department than finding someone able to run the NHS. Door Matt tried to think of one or two things that had gone right on his watch, but little came to mind. Reid gently asked him if he was prepared to admit to having made any mistakes. For a moment it looked as if Hancock might burst into tears, but he pulled himself together and trotted out something about funerals. Really? With the UK having locked down too late, old people kicked into care homes without a coronavirus test and the UK having the highest death rate in Europe, the health secretary’s one regret was that he hadn’t allowed more people to attend funerals? The interview – AKA the pile on – continued in much the same way, with Door Matt defending his right to exist while failing to answer direct questions on anything, including whether he regretted tweeting his support for Dom’s right to roam back in May, as the list of government failures mounted. And all Hancock could do was stand – bizarrely, he appeared to have been filmed in the street outside the BBC – and take it. Praying for the seconds to tick down until he was off air. Eventually, he heard the magic words that his ordeal was over. “It’s been lovely to be on,” said Door Matt. “He said, lying,” Morgan replied. A Door Matt’s gotta do what a Door Matt’s gotta do. Weirdly, though, the health secretary would be back on tomorrow were anyone to ask. His mixture of low self-worth and masochistic tendencies are a powerful cocktail. Hancock was on much more secure ground at the Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon. Largely because he always appears most in control when he doesn’t really have anything new to say. So after insisting that it was still far too early to read anything into the fact that the number of infections had not decreased since the second lockdown was introduced, he merely reannounced various announcements that had been made earlier in the day and the day before. The creation of two new testing mega-labs, the building of 40 “long Covid” clinics and the promising results of the Moderna vaccine. “We have today secured 5m doses,” he said proudly, as the rest of us wondered why Kate Bingham, the head of the vaccine taskforce, had failed to spot Moderna as one of the six most promising drug trials. Presumably, one day we will get an answer from the PR consultants to whom she awarded a £670k contract. These were still early days, Door Matt murmured. But we must nurture the candle of hope, he said, sounding like an Elton John tribute act. Most of the questions were directed at the science, where Hancock was happy to defer to the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam – or JVT, as Matt matily called him – and Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for NHS test and trace. JVT called the Moderna trial “the second penalty in the back of the net”, apparently unaware that winning the game will at some point rely on Covid-19 missing one of its own spot kicks, while Hopkins said there was nothing in principle wrong with the country returning to regional tiers of lockdown on 3 December, providing that the parameters of each tier were rethought. Which sounded like another national lockdown by another name. But all that was for the future – a couple of weeks is a lifetime to Hancock these days – so Door Matt was just happy to waffle about the nature of love in the time of cholera and hope in the time of hopelessness. His one awkward moment came when he was asked about Johnson “bursting with antibodies”. Along with any number of other, even less attractive spontaneous emissions. The prime minister self-isolating was a sign that the rules applied to everyone, he said, overlooking that if Boris had obeyed the face mask and 2-metre rules when meeting Conservative MPs then he almost certainly wouldn’t have needed to self-isolate in the first place. As Hancock brought the presser to a close, he allowed himself a rare smile of satisfaction. The briefing hadn’t exactly been a triumph, but neither had he crashed and burned. Which these days counts as a win. And his day had certainly ended better than it had started."
2020-11-16T18:43:45Z,politics,Politics,EU vote on Brexit deal could be delayed until 28 December,"A European parliament vote to seal a Brexit trade deal could be delayed until 28 December, three days before the end of the transition period, under an emergency EU plan. With less than seven weeks to go before the UK leaves the single market and customs union, the negotiations remain troubled, with the talks on fishing rights in UK waters not progressing significantly since the summer. The negotiations were “not in a good place” on fishing rights, Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said as the two sides re-engaged in the discussions. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is understood to want to be able to report positive news to the bloc’s 27 heads of state and government at a videoconference summit on Thursday. But the timeline for a deal has repeatedly slipped, with agreement now more likely to be found next week or even later, putting in jeopardy a scheduled European parliament vote on the deal on 16 December. MEPs have said they need six weeks for the deal to be translated, scrutinised and passed through committees and the final full plenary vote. Sources in the European parliament said there had been discussions about holding an extraordinary sitting of the chamber after Christmas – on 28 December – as a senior EU diplomat conceded that Brussels might need to be “creative” to get the agreement ratified. The parliament’s vote is likely to take place in Brussels rather than Strasbourg due to measures in place to control the spread of Covid-19, although the French government has been lobbying for a return of MEPs to Strasbourg. “We really are in the last week to 10 days of this,” Coveney said. “If there is not a major breakthrough over the next week to 10 days then I think we really are in trouble and the focus will shift to preparing for a no trade deal and all the disruption that that brings.” “I think the British government understand only too well what’s required for a deal this week, the real question is whether the political appetite is there to do it. I think we will [get a deal], that’s been my prediction for a while, but I won’t be shocked if it all falls apart.” The outstanding issues remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeted on Sunday that there had been “some progress in a positive direction in recent days”. But he insisted that his negotiating position on the most contentious issues would not soften in light of the departure of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, the former campaign director for Vote Leave. It is understood that common ground is being found on the shape of a deal for how both sides will regulate domestic subsidies. But there is no agreement on a mechanism for maintaining similar baseline environmental, labour and social standards in the years to come. The UK insists it will not tie itself to the Brussels rulebook.
Coveney particularly emphasised the danger posed by the issue of fishing rights to blow up the negotiations, despite its comparatively small economic value. “It’s a lot more emotive, and a lot more political, quite frankly,” he said. “What the British government has promised to their fishing industry, versus Michel Barnier’s negotiating mandate from the EU is a very, very wide gap.” He continued: “It’s not good … the negotiations are not in a good place when it comes to fishing. There hasn’t really been any success in closing the gap between the positions of either side and until we find a way of doing that there isn’t going to be an agreement, so we’re in the same place in fishing, as we were in mid-summer. “Neither side really has budged from their position. There’s been minor concessions discussed on both sides but really it hasn’t moved anywhere.”"
2020-11-16T18:31:50Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: what happens to the UK on 31 December, deal or no deal?","A “major breakthrough” will be needed to seal a Brexit deal in the coming days. But the public and businesses face significant changes and disruption to day-to-day life and trade from 11pm on 31 December, deal or no deal. Back in January the UK committed to a “hard Brexit”, quitting the customs union and the single market. The new year will see the end of 30 years of trading conventions, easy tourist travel and French or Spanish retirement dreams. It also creates potential gaps in policing, funding nightmares for science and a mountain of red tape for heavy industries. 1. What won’t be in the deal? We will not know until the 500-600 page document detailing a potential deal is published. We know that a deal will mean continued tariff-free and quota-free access to each other’s markets, but little else. Questions remain over key related sectors, aviation and haulage, and whether there will be enough time to secure detailed agreements. So what will change from 1 January? 2. Borders between Great Britain and Northern Ireland erected from day one. From 11pm on 31 December the Northern Ireland protocol will be implemented requiring customs declarations and other checks on all goods coming from Great Britain. Many fear that many ordinary businesses in Great Britain will not be aware of the mandatory paperwork required for sales in Northern Ireland. This controversial solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland will be in place for six years. These special Brexit arrangements make it a guinea pig for the government, which has opted to phase in similar checks on EU goods coming into Dover and other British ports over six months. Business leaders warned last week that trade across the Irish sea could be paralysed as the new software being developed for Brexit, known as the Customs Delivery Service (CDS), will not be ready on time. Supermarkets including Sainsbury’s have warned that supplies of some meat, dairy and fish products will be restricted unless the EU agrees to waive controls for big trusted traders. 3. Immigration and borders elsewhere in the UK Immigration rules will change from day one, with Priti Patel’s points-based system applying for all new arrivals. Tourist travel is likely to be visa-free in both directions for 90 days but the European health insurance card, allowing emergency cover on holiday, may lapse, subject to negotiations. The most immediate impact of the new immigration rules will be felt far away from the border. From next year employers and landlords will be required to check that EU citizens are entitled to work or live in the UK, or they will face penalties. Campaigners predict that many EU nationals legally entitled to be in the country will be rejected for interviews, jobs or flats because of a lack of awareness of the post-Brexit laws. There are also fears for British citizens settled in the EU who may want to return home – to look after an elderly parent or retire – with a non-British spouse, who will be subjected to Patel’s points-based system after March 2022. Those on low incomes or pensioners fear they could fail the means test, leading to unwarranted emotional upheaval for families. 4. How will it affect policing? Theresa May made her contempt for the government’s approach to policing known last month when she was seen to mouth “utter rubbish” as Michael Gove told the Commons the UK would be better without joint law enforcement. Police fear key weapons against terror, fraud and other crime will be lost including the European arrest warrant (EAW) and real-time passenger data exchanges. Interpol is the backup policing plan but it would be “slower, not as effective”, according to Richard Martin, a deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police and the lead for Brexit and international criminality for national police forces. It would take as many as 60 days to get criminal records from the EU compared with six days currently, he told a parliamentary committee. The National Crime Agency head of operations, Steve Rodhouse, has said his No 1 “Christmas wish” is that Brexit negotiators keep the European arrest warrant. 5. Science and education collaboration Leading science representatives including Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage committee advising the government on Covid, fear the UK’s membership of the £80bn EU research programme, Horizon Europe, may be about to end.
The UK has an option to pay into Horizon Europe as an associate member , but scientists fear Brexiters in government would prefer a clean break from all EU institutions. Educational institutions are also deeply concerned about the Erasmus exchange programme, which the UK can continue to pay into, and the future of tuition fees for EU nationals. Already reeling from a financial hit from disappearing overseas students because of Covid, they now fear the loss of EU citizens who may also have to pay foreign, rather than home, fees because of Brexit. 6. Road chaos in Kent Gove has warned of queues of up to 7,000 lorries a day trying to get on to ferries and Eurotunnel trains in Kent in the worst-case scenario. Lorry drivers will be required to have a special Kent access permit, dubbed a “Brexit passport”, to get into the county, demonstrating they have completed the paperwork required by the EU on arrival in Calais and other ports. Fears are fuelled by the fact that 145,000 UK businesses will be completing customs formalities for both import and export for the first time. 7. Food prices and availability If a deal is struck, none of the threatened tariffs on beef, cheese or other food stuffs will apply. But prices are still expected to rise on some staples because of the extra red tape importers face, with mandatory customs declarations and health controls on both sides of the border. Some 40% of Britain’s agriculture and food products come from the EU, which has led to concern over higher prices on many staples such as tomatoes, oranges and fruit and vegetables out of season. There are also fears for the trade of fresh shellfish and day-old chickens from Scotland, the so called “fish and chicks” sector. Scottish producers fear their stock will get held up, and perish, in queues in Dover or in Boulogne, the designated port for health checks on fish imports. 8. Trade of high-end products – cars, planes and chemicals The car industry has been one of the most vocal opponents of a hard Brexit. Tariffs may be waived on much of their components, but the tariff barriers that disappeared when the single market was established in 1993 will be back. This will cause friction in supply chains and could ultimately destabilise the manufacturing base and jobs in the Midlands and north-east, with the likes of Nissan already questioning their future in the country. The aerospace and defence industry has warned that post-Brexit trade will be a “day-to-day struggle”, with dual certification (of the UK and the EU) for state-of-the-art parts as well as finished products needed for the first time. “It is not a happy place to be,” says Paul Everitt, chief executive of the ADS group representing aerospace, defence, security and space industries. The chemicals industry has warned it is facing £1bn of extra costs to import compounds if the UK comes out of the EU’s system for registering chemicals, Reach (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals). BASF, one of the largest chemical manufacturers in the EU, said it would cost between £50,000 and £60,000 to go through the compliance process for each of its 1,300 unique chemicals."
2020-11-16T18:15:49Z,politics,Politics,"England tier system may need to be strengthened after lockdown, health chief says – as it happened","A senior health official has said that, when the English lockdown ends on 2 December, restrictions will have to be tighter than they were before. The government is planning on the basis that after that date England will return to the three-tier system in place before the lockdown started. At a news conference in Downing Street, where she was speaking alongside Matt Hancock, health secretary, Dr Susan Hopkins, a deputy director of Public Health England and medical adviser to NHS test and trace, said that in December the three-tier system in England would have to be strengthened. The pre-lockdown version was not tough enough, she suggested. (See 5.52pm. Hopkins has said that, if the lockdown is working, coronavirus cases in England should start declining this week. Speaking at the press conference she said: We expect if the lockdown is working ... that we will start to see cases decline over the next week. We expect it will be longer to see hospital admissions, another week or so, but I think as long as we start seeing cases decline then we can start making a judgment about what are the right decisions that we make and what the opening up decisions that happen on 2 December. Hancock said that over the last week UK Covid case numbers have been going up, rising from an average of 22,443 per day a week ago to 25,329 per day now. (See 5.08pm.) Todayâ€™s figures have still not yet been posted on the governmentâ€™s dashboard.
Britain has rapidly secured a deal for an initial 5m doses of a new US vaccine which has nearly 95% effectiveness in interim results, after fears earlier that the UK had missed out on supplies. A string of Conservative MPs are self-isolating following a meeting in Downing Street that has forced Boris Johnson to spend a potentially crucial week holed up inside No 10. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has said that unless the government comes up with an immediate anti-poverty programme it will face a rebellion from a deeply divided Britain. Hull has been â€œforgottenâ€� by central government as the cityâ€™s coronavirus cases have increased at an â€œastonishing and terrifying rateâ€� to become the highest in England, its council leader has said. The governmentâ€™s Â£100bn Operation Moonshot mass Covid testing scheme is like â€œbuilding a Channel tunnel without asking civil engineers to look at the plansâ€�, experts have warned. Brexit negotiations on a trade deal resume in a crucial week, as it emerged talks on the issue of EU access to British fishing waters have not progressed since the summer. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-16T17:50:32Z,politics,Politics,Covid in Downing Street: who has been affected by the virus?,"With Boris Johnson forced into self-isolation once more after his encounter with the Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who has tested positive for Covid-19, No 10 has again been hit by the virus. Here, the Guardian recaps those linked to Downing Street who have either had a confirmed case of coronavirus, experienced symptoms or had to isolate in recent months. Tested positive or had symptoms Boris Johnson The prime minister was struck down with the virus at the outset of the pandemic in March and, after his condition worsened during isolation in Downing Street, was admitted in April to St Thomas’ hospital in London. He ended up spending three nights in intensive care and, after recovering, revealed it “could have gone either way”. Carrie Symonds While Johnson was suffering from the virus, his fiancee, who was pregnant at the time, disclosed she was recovering after experiencing coronavirus symptoms. The 32-year-old tweeted on 4 April: “I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend.” Matt Hancock The health secretary tested positive in late March at the same time as Johnson. He said he had only mild symptoms and was continuing to work from home while self-isolating. In a video message confirming his positive case, he said: “Fortunately for me the symptoms so far have been very mild so I’ve been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response.” Dominic Cummings From late March the prime minister’s most senior aide – who left his job in Downing Street last week – battled Covid symptoms in Durham, having travelled, the Guardian later revealed, more than 260 miles to get there despite the country being in lockdown. Prof Chris Whitty England’s chief medical officer reported Covid symptoms in late March and said he was self-isolating. He tweeted on 27 March: “After experiencing symptoms compatible with Covid-19 last night, in line with the guidance, I will be self-isolating at home for the next seven days. I will be continuing to advise the government on the medical response to coronavirus, supported by my deputies.” Sir Mark Sedwill In May it emerged that Sedwill, then the UK’s most senior civil servant, had Covid-19 at about the same time as Johnson, Hancock and Whitty. Sedwill, who stood down in September, was working at home throughout his illness but No 10 did not reveal at the time he had tested positive in April. Prof Neil Ferguson The epidemiologist, whose modelling helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy, self-isolated in March after developing Covid symptoms. “Sigh. Developed a slight dry but persistent cough yesterday and self-isolated even though I felt fine. Then developed high fever at 4am today. There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster,” he tweeted on 18 March. In May, Ferguson quit as a government adviser after flouting lockdown rules by receiving visits from his lover at home.
Had to isolate from this weekend Boris Johnson (again) The prime minister, 56, has had to self-isolate again after holding a 35-minute meeting at No 10 on Thursday with Tory MPs including Anderson, who tested positive over the weekend. Johnson has said he is fine and that his body “is bursting with antibodies”. Lia Nici On Monday morning the MP for Great Grimsby confirmed she had been contacted by NHS test and trace after being at the same meeting. She tweeted: “As a result I will be self-isolating in line with the rules. I currently have no symptoms and will be working from home.” Brendan Clarke-Smith The MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, which had the biggest swing from Labour to the Tories in the country last year, confirmed he was self-isolating. He retweeted the prime minister’s message announcing he was self-isolating, adding, in reference to a line from the 1990 film Ghost: “In the words of Patrick Swayze ... ‘Ditto’.” Andy Carter The MP for Warrington South, who was also at the No 10 meeting, confirmed on Twitter he was self-isolating, writing: “I had a call from test and trace yesterday following a work meeting at 10 Downing Street last Thursday. In line with the rules I am self-isolating.” Katherine Fletcher Writing on Facebook, the MP for South Ribble in Lancashire wrote: “I have been contacted by NHS test and trace following a work meeting in 10 Downing Street with the prime minister last week. I will now self-isolate at home in Lancashire in line with the rules.” Chris Clarkson The MP for Heywood and Middleton added his name to the list of Tories self-isolating, tweeting: “Yesterday I was contacted by NHS test and trace following a work meeting in 10 Downing Street with the prime minister last week. I will now self-isolate in line with the rules.” Maria Miller The former Tory minister, who sat next to Anderson in the House of Commons chamber on Wednesday, is also reportedly self-isolating. Jacob Young Separately, the MP for Redcar, who the prime minister’s spokesman has confirmed was not at Thursday’s meeting, announced on Monday that he was self-isolating. He wrote on Facebook: “Yesterday, I got an email from NHS test and trace saying I have to self-isolate until next Wednesday (25th) as I am a contact of someone who has tested positive. I will continue to work for my constituents during my isolation. But rather than asking questions from the green benches, I’ll be doing it from my kitchen.” Matt Vickers The Conservative MP for Stockton South, in Cleveland in the north-east, confirmed that he was self-isolating. He said he had been contacted by NHS test and trace after coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid-19, without specifying who it was. He tweeted on Monday: “I must self-isolate in line with the rules but will continue to work from home.”
Marco Longhi The MP for Dudley North, in the West Midlands, also indicated he was self-isolating. On Monday Longhi shared a video on his Facebook page from the prime minister explaining he had been instructed to self-isolate by test and trace, adding his own message: “I’m afraid I had the same text, but will carry on working from home. #keepgoing”."
2020-11-16T14:59:52Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's meeting with Covid-positive MP: how did it happen?,"Boris Johnson is being forced to self-isolate after meeting a Conservative MP, Lee Anderson, who later tested positive for coronavirus. The prime minister’s colleagues insist there was no breach of Covid rules. So how did it happen? Should Johnson and Anderson have met, and not wearing masks? Johnson’s spokesman said on Monday that the prime minister “has been having a mix” of in-person and online meetings. He did not say why this meeting could not have been held online. Johnson and Anderson were photographed, maskless, standing about a metre from each other. The spokesman said the distance was mitigated by the fact the pair were side by side, not face to face. What do workplace rules usually set out? According to Johnson’s spokesman, staff do not wear masks while walking around No 10, but that there is a one-way system in place to prevent over-proximity. In parliament, MPs and others who do attend in person are strongly encouraged to wear masks in communal areas – although not all do – but can take them off inside the Commons chamber, and in their offices. The more general government advice for Covid-secure offices states that where people spend time less than 2 metres away, there should be an attempt to mitigate the risk, for example with screens or by ventilating the room. The windows shown in the photo of Johnson and Anderson appear to be closed. Aren’t people meant to work from home? During the temporary lockdown in England, yes, where possible. However, being prime minister is a role in which, as Hancock said, meeting people is inevitable. Parliament is sitting, although in a hybrid format, with some MPs appearing virtually. No 10 is arguably almost Johnson’s home anyway – he lives in the larger flat above 11 Downing Street. Does anyone else have to self-isolate, and is everyone OK? Tory MPs who said they had been at the meeting and were now self-isolating included Brendan Clarke-Smith, the MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire; Andy Carter, the MP for Warrington South; Lia Nici, the MP for Great Grimsby; Katherine Fletcher, the MP for South Ribble in Lancashire; and Chris Clarkson, who represents Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester.
As Johnson has already had coronavirus, the expectation is that he will not have symptoms again. His fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and their son, Wilfred, do not have to self-isolate, but Johnson is expected to try to stay away from them “as much as possible”. In a brief Facebook post, Anderson said that on Friday he had lost his sense of taste and his wife had a bad headache, and that a test on Saturday brought positive results for both of them. Anderson said he felt well, but “my biggest concern is my wife, who is in the shielded group”. How did Johnson find out about it? While this has not been officially confirmed, it appeared to be because both Anderson and Johnson were using the test-and-trace app on their phones, which tells you if a recent close contact has tested positive. In a video message posted to Twitter, Johnson said: “Hi folks, the good news is that NHS test and trace is working ever more efficiently, but the bad news is that they’ve pinged me and I’ve got to self isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid.” How long does Johnson have to self-isolate? The rules stipulate this must last for 14 days from the last contact with the infected person. The meeting with Anderson took place on Thursday morning, meaning the PM has 10 more days to go. Have any other government figures had to self-isolate? This month a staffer in the private office of Alok Sharma tested positive for coronavirus, shortly before the business secretary went on a visit to South Korea. However, Sharma was not asked to self-isolate. His officials said that while the staffer had been in a meeting with Sharma a few days before the positive text, the pair were not in close contact. Is the 14-day self-isolation period under review? The two-week period was set as the last likely day for people to develop symptoms if they have become infected. But since then, the provision of testing has expanded, and newer, near-instant tests are emerging. With figures showing only a small proportion people fully stick to the 14 days of isolation, it is expected the time could be cut, possibly to 10 days. Will the antibodies from Johnson’s previous Covid infection protect him? It is unclear how long antibodies from coronavirus can protect against reinfection. A recent study suggested five months, but there is no definitive answer. People have contracted Covid-19 twice but, worldwide, these cases have been few and far between. Among such cases there has been no consistent pattern as to the severity of the infection the second time round. In most cases the reinfection has been no worse, but there have been instances – in the Netherlands, Ecuador, India and the US – where it was more severe."
2020-11-16T14:43:31Z,politics,Politics,Covid: Boris Johnson and Tory MPs forced to self-isolate after No 10 event,"A string of Conservative MPs are self-isolating following a meeting in Downing Street that has forced Boris Johnson to spend a potentially crucial week holed up inside No 10. The prime minister, who was seriously ill with coronavirus in April, has insisted he is fine and that his body “is bursting with antibodies” after he was ordered to self-isolate following a 35-minute meeting with a group of Tory MPs from the Midlands and north of England on Thursday. Lee Anderson, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, showed some coronavirus symptoms on Friday and received a positive test result on Sunday. A photograph of him and Johnson at the meeting showed them seemingly less than 2 metres apart, and neither wearing a mask. Since then, five more Tory MPs who were at the event have said they are self-isolating, raising questions about why the meeting was not held virtually and whether proper coronavirus guidelines were followed. Two Downing Street political aides also attended and were now self-isolating, Johnson’s spokesman said. The aides were not named, but the spokesman confirmed they were not Dominic Cummings or Lee Cain, the PM’s former chief adviser and communications head respectively, who both left Downing Street amid bitter infighting at the end of last week. In a video posted to Twitter, Johnson said: “Hi folks, the good news is that NHS test and trace is working ever more efficiently, but the bad news is that they’ve pinged me and I’ve got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid. “It doesn’t matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn’t matter that I’m fit as a butcher’s dog, feel great – so many people do in my circumstances. And actually it doesn’t matter that I’ve had the disease and I’m bursting with antibodies. We’ve got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by test and trace.” Downing Street later confirmed that Johnson had had at least one antibody test for Covid. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The PM has had an antibody test. He had that following the serious level of infection that he had earlier in the year.” Asked whether he had received subsequent antibody tests, the spokesman said: “I don’t know when the most recent test was.” The five other Tory MPs who said they had been at the meeting and were now self-isolating are: Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw), Andy Carter (Warrington South), Lia Nici (Great Grimsby), Katherine Fletcher (South Ribble) and Chris Clarkson (Heywood and Middleton). Clarke-Smith and Carter posted very similar photos of themselves with Johnson to that taken with Anderson, appearing to be closer than 2 metres and not wearing face coverings. Separately, the former Conservative minister Maria Miller, who sat next to Anderson in the Commons on Wednesday, is also reportedly self-isolating. Meanwhile, Jacob Young, Matt Vickers and Marco Longhi were also among MPs who indicated they were self-isolating.
Johnson’s spokesman insisted no distancing rules had been broken, despite the photos showing maskless MPs standing near Johnson. “Social distancing was observed at the meeting. It’s also the case that No 10 is a Covid-secure workplace,” he said. Asked to explain the small distance between Johnson and the MPs, the spokesman said this was in part because they were stood side by side, not face to face. Asked why the meeting was held in person, he said: “Meetings for work are possible and are taking place. The PM has been having a mix of meetings.” Johnson, who must isolate for 10 more days – the 14-day self-isolation period begins with the last contact with the infected person – has been working in his Downing Street office rather than staying inside his flat in the building. His spokesman said Johnson was able to reach the office via a garden, with no contact with staff, and that this had been cleared by medical advisers. The advice for Johnson to self-isolate comes at a difficult moment for the government. He is expected to continue to make public statements from inside No 10, including on the government’s green plans. This is also a pivotal week for Brexit, as negotiations with the EU reach their final phase. Downing Street said officials were in “advanced discussions” with parliamentary authorities about Johnson taking part in prime minister’s questions and other House of Commons proceedings remotely. Under the “hybrid” parliament arrangements, MPs can take part in some proceedings by video link.
In a Facebook post, Anderson said he had developed coronavirus symptoms on Friday and received a positive result by Sunday. He added: “I feel absolutely fine and my biggest concern is my wife who is in the shielded group.” Johnson contracted the disease himself in late March, shortly after announcing the first nationwide lockdown. He initially continued to work in Downing Street before his health worsened and he was taken to intensive care. Others who tested positive or suffered symptoms included the health secretary, Matt Hancock; England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty; the former cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, and Cummings."
2020-11-16T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings' media approach often more bark than bite,"During last year’s election campaign, Dominic Cummings made clear what he thought of the accredited lobby journalists who cover Westminster politics for mainstream publications. “Wait til the glorious new government SMASHES the lobby and replaces it with truth and light,” Cummings told the Guardian at the time, following an inquiry about an unrelated story. He was promising that a victorious Johnson government would go to war with the BBC, Channel 4 News and all manner of other news outlets deemed to represent the views of the metropolitan elite and not the 52% of the country who had voted for Brexit. Root-and-branch reform of government communications was the order of the day and journalists who didn’t like it would have to deal with it.
Instead, as he leaves Downing Street, his approach to the media – often backed by the outgoing director of communications, Lee Cain – appears to be in the process of being partially unwound, their half-finished cultural revolution having often been more bark than bite. Proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee, announced last December, have been kicked into the long grass. A boycott of Radio 4’s Today programme was meant to last until “they better understand the country” but was dropped after a few months. When the full scale of the coronavirus pandemic became apparent, Cain gathered journalists together and promised a more cooperative attitude to fit the times. Which is not to say that No 10’s aggressive attitude towards the media has not had an impact. Staff at the BBC’s Millbank political unit describe how Downing Street would regularly complain about tweets by BBC staff that they felt showed bias, contributing to the imposition of a new social media code of conduct at the corporation. Tony Hall’s departure as BBC director general was hastened by the realisation in January that the corporation was facing a fight for its future. His successor, Tim Davie, has already adopted a series of policy positions that have pleased the government. As one government insider observed, the threat of action against individual institutions is often more effective and faster than passing legislation. One of the ironies of Cummings’ time in Downing Street was his insistence that day-to-day press coverage doesn’t matter – only to find his position undermined by a prime minister who was nervous about increasingly negative headlines. There was fury at the inability to get ahead of looming scandals on everything from pandemic testing capacity to Marcus Rashford’s campaigns for free school meals. Cummings, whose drive to Barnard Castle became one of the most damaging news stories of Johnson’s premiership, also gained a reputation for regularly briefing stories to friendly journalists at the same time as threatening to sack junior special advisers who leaked material. It was one of the attempts by Cummings and Cain to radically reshape the relationship between the government and the media that ended up playing a key role in their downfall. Cain was a strong proponent of introducing a new daily televised press conference live from Downing Street, opening up the traditional off-camera briefings given to the political lobby. But Boris Johnson rejected Cain’s suggestion that they should appoint the BBC journalist Ellie Price to the role of on-camera spokesperson. Instead, the prime minister offered the job to the well-connected Allegra Stratton, who made clear she would not work for Cain, helping to prompt his departure. Now Stratton has emerged victorious from this particular power battle, there is a final irony: if she succeeds in attracting a large audience to the press conferences, unmediated by traditional media outlets, it could be a partial vindication for Cain and Cummings’ approach."
2020-11-15T17:00:39Z,politics,Politics,Labour criticises lobbyist's involvement in Covid strategy calls,"Labour has accused the government of having “one rule for lobbyists and their paying clients and another rule for the rest of us” after it emerged that a Westminster lobbyist was quietly taken on as an adviser and joined coronavirus strategy calls with health ministers. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, urging him to investigate the roles of George Pascoe-Watson, director of the PR consultancy Portland Communications, and his colleague James O’Shaughnessy. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has conceded that Pascoe-Watson gave unpaid advice on communications to NHS Test and Trace. He attended daily calls on communications chaired by the Conservative health minister James Bethell, a hereditary peer who formerly ran Matt Hancock’s Tory leadership campaign. The Sunday Times reported that shortly after Pascoe-Watson’s temporary role ended, Portland partners wrote to its clients warning them to prepare for a nationwide lockdown, and said Boris Johnson would “announce next week that he is prepared to ‘sacrifice November to save December’.” The message was sent several days before details of a potential national lockdown for England began appearing in newspapers. On the back of the story, the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) lodged a complaint against Portland Communications under its professional charter and code of conduct. Francis Ingham, the PRCA director general, said: “We have well-established independent procedures for investigating such complaints, and those procedures will now be put into action.” Rayner asked Case to investigate “how lobbyists and their clients benefited from this vital information before the public knew, as the rest of the country waited anxiously for government announcements about lockdown … and whether they could see their families, friends and loved ones.” Questions posed by Rayner in her letter to Case included whether other lobbyists had been used as paid or unpaid advisers; whether civil servants’ concerns about their role had been ignored; and whether they had been asked to sign confidentiality agreements. The government has repeatedly faced criticism for alleged cronyism and for blurring the lines between the public and private sectors – including in Dido Harding’s role. As a Conservative peer, Lady Harding votes with the government in the House of Lords while also running NHS Test and Trace, a government body that would usually be expected to be led by a civil servant. Meanwhile, several lucrative contracts relating to the pandemic have been handed to firms with connections to the prime minister’s departing chief aide, Dominic Cummings, and other senior government figures. Emergency legislation allowed the usual tendering process to be bypassed. Pascoe-Watson, a former Sun political editor, said: “I was honoured to be asked to serve the NHS Test and Trace service in my personal capacity as an unpaid adviser.” He insisted he had declared his professional interests to the department and had no role in daily calls after 7 October. “To be clear, the information shared with [Portland] clients on 15 and 29 October was in no way connected to the Test and Trace calls, in which I was no longer a participant.” He said the information had come from “multiple conversations had by our consultants”. There are also questions about the role of O’Shaughnessy, a member of the advisory council at Portland, who was a paid adviser to government until August. The Sunday Times reported that O’Shaughnessy took part in a call with Lord Bethell and Boston Consulting Group, a Portland client. It emerged last month that some Boston Consulting staff are being hired out to the government to work on test and trace for as much as £6,250 a day. O’Shaughnessy said: “Earlier this year I was asked to support the government as part of the national effort to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, something I was proud to do. This role, which involved providing policy advice to DHSC ministers and officials around testing innovation, was approved by the permanent secretary and declared in my register of interests. It did not involve responsibility for procurement decisions.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic, we rightly have drawn on the expertise of a number of private-sector partners who provided advice and expertise to assist in the government’s vital work. This included helping establish the largest diagnostic network in British history and a test-and-trace system used by tens of millions of people. “As a result of public – and private – sector organisations working together at pace, we were able to strengthen our response to the pandemic so we are better prepared for the challenges of the coming months.” The spokesperson added that any role O’Shaughnessy played in procurement decisions would have gone through relevant sign-off procedures."
2020-11-15T16:44:58Z,politics,Politics,"Empty offices must not become 'rabbit hutch' homes, say English councils","Councils have warned that offices left empty by the coronavirus pandemic must not be turned into sub-standard “rabbit hutch” homes, after a government climbdown indicated a shift in housebuilding targets away from the southern shires and toward towns and cities. Thousands more homes are set to be built in urban areas, particularly in the Midlands and north of England after the government said it would adjust a housing targets algorithm that had sparked a rebellion from MPs and council leaders representing Conservative heartlands. Targets in areas such as Hampshire and Surrey were increased significantly, and now the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) reportedly wants to make the system “fairer”. The move has raised fresh fears about the standard of housing that may result. Officials plan to use the new strategy to reshape town and city centres hit hard by the pandemic, repurposing some vacant offices and shops as homes. “We have opposed the algorithm on the basis housing has to be built where it is needed and councils are best placed to decide,” said David Renard, the Local Government Association’s housing spokesman. “It is helpful to focus on towns and city centres as we know retail is shrinking and we need to repurpose these places. At a high level this could be a good policy, but converting offices into poor-quality housing isn’t something we want to see.” Planning rules currently allow builders to turn offices into homes without planning permission, which has led to some cramped developments with tiny flats – sometimes with almost no natural light. Martin Tett, the leader of Buckinghamshire county council, said the permitted development right (PDR) must be scrapped in order to guarantee “decent” homes. “You can convert these [office blocks] into what have been described as ‘rabbit hutches’, so we need to get rid of the PDR and make everything subject to planning permission,” he said. The move to “rebalance” housing targets comes after a rebellion by Conservative county councils and backbenchers, including the former prime minister Theresa May and the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Bob Seely, the Isle of Wight MP, told parliament: “The biggest housing increases will be to rural shires and suburbs, and the biggest falls are in the urban north and Midlands.” The MHCLG confirmed the change, first reported in the Sunday Telegraph, which will lead to targets being adjusted to create a “fairer formula”. The move stops short of meeting demands from councils for the government to abandon the algorithm altogether and allow local areas to determine their own housing targets according to need. Andrew Howard, the managing director at the planning consultant BECG, said: “A U-turn now is better than the dead-end algorithm that so upset Tory heartlands. It was a poorly judged, quick-fix solution to a long-term problem. “The government needs to stop digging and take the time to reconsider this in the light of responses to the planning white paper. We need a home-building policy that delivers for the shires and our urban areas and also helps town centres and high streets that have been devastated by Covid.” There has been widespread anger at the government’s planning reforms, which also propose to reduce local decision-making on individual development proposals. The planning white paper sets out to give local people and politicians a say over strategic plans, but after that developers will be free to build. It also makes it easier for open land not currently protected as green belt, a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty to be built over."
2020-11-15T15:56:23Z,politics,Politics,Foreign Office resists release of files on support for UK mercenaries in Sri Lanka,"The Foreign Office is resisting publishing files relating to its diplomatic support for British mercenaries in Sri Lanka in the 1980s, despite the Metropolitan police launching an unprecedented inquiry into potential war crimes by those individuals. Phil Miller, an investigative journalist, is taking the Foreign Office to an information tribunal over the release of files dating back to 1985 on Keenie Meenie Services (KMS), one of Britain’s first mercenary companies. The files relate to the extent of UK diplomatic support for the training of Sri Lankan security forces by the company. The Met launched a scoping exercise in March into allegations of war crimes committed by the firm , and this has now been elevated into a fully fledged inquiry – the first of its kind. Miller, the author of a book and film on British involvement in the Sri Lankan civil war, said the Foreign Office had been obstructive throughout his attempts to gain information and access to UK files. “They have sat on this evidence for years. You have to ask yourself why the UK government wants to keep a file about Keenie Meenie hidden from the Tamil community until 2046.” The UK government is citing international relations and information provided in confidence for keeping the 1985 files secret. Its decision has been endorsed by a national advisory body at the National Archives based in Kew. The government’s own rules say diplomatic files should normally be released after 20 years, not 60 as stipulated with this file. The file relates to the extent of UK government support for the mercenaries training Sri Lankan security forces, and the roles they were asked to undertake.
The Met inquiry may be seen to weaken the case for suppression of the file. Geoffrey Howe was the UK foreign secretary at the time, while the Asia minister was Janet Young, a former leader of the House of Lords. Both have since died. Over the past two weeks, Miller has crowdfunded money to take the Foreign Office to the information tribunal. The case is now likely to be heard next year. “If we win, the full file will be made public, allowing you to read the real story about the relationship between Thatcher’s government and British mercenaries,” said Miller. The Met’s initial scoping exercise followed inquiries by the UN and the publication of a book written by Miller, who works for Declassified, a news outlet specialising in investigations into UK foreign policy. The book details how KMS, at the suggestion of Thatcher-era politicians, trained a Sri Lankan police unit called the Special Task Force, which used ruthless methods during the civil war, including a 1987 massacre at a prawn farm in Kokkadicholai, eastern Sri Lanka, in which 85 Tamil civilians died. It also allegedly provided or flew helicopter gunships that took part in massacres. One of the diplomats who appears to have been aware of KMS’s role was Sir Anthony Parsons, a former British ambassador to Tehran and later a part-time special adviser to Margaret Thatcher. He died in 1996. The UK was concerned that many of the Tamil separatists had communist sympathies and would be open to Russian influence. A UK human rights group, the Tamil Information Centre, sent the book’s findings to the UN working group on mercenaries, the body that monitors private military companies. The centre also contacted the Foreign Office to ask what it was doing to investigate and ensure there was no impunity for those that had advocated the privatisation of UK military involvement in Sri Lanka, a former UK colony. The UN wrote to David Walker, a director of Saladin Security, a private security firm described as a predecessor to KMS. Walker, 78, a British special forces veteran, ran KMS in the 1980s while serving as a Conservative councillor in Surrey. In its letter to Walker, the UN set out human rights concerns about his former company, noting that “a KMS employee regularly co-piloted an armed helicopter, including during operations in which civilians were allegedly killed”. It is thought that many other KMS staff have now died. Saladin, in a letter to the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, said it had cooperated with the UN inquiry, and its training was designed to inculcate a philosophy of winning hearts and minds. KMS was dissolved in 1988, the letter said adding that all the key figures in the organisation were now dead. It said Saladin specialised in kidnap and ransom services as well as providing security to Saudi Arabian ministers and diplomats. It said it was fully compliant with modern human rights requirements. The role of mercenaries is often seen as a throwback to a previous era, but in fact unregulated private security firms are playing an increasing and sometimes decisive role in modern warfare, often deployed by Turkey and Russia in Libya and Syria. The Foreign Office has said it is cooperating with the police inquiry and “takes very seriously allegations raised in relation to the activities of Keenie Meenie Services in Sri Lanka in the 1980s”. It said it was not a subject of the Met investigation but had given the police a copy of the files that it has refused to release to the public."
2020-11-15T14:57:29Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain departure: what really happened?,"One account had them swapping jokes and reminiscing about better times, another depicted a furious showdown. Just what went on this week between Boris Johnson and his senior aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain as they departed Downing Street has been subject to intense speculation. What actually happened? The Guardian has attempted to unpick the competing versions apparently briefed by warring factions in Westminster. The furious row v the good-natured farewell chat On Friday, Johnson held a 45-minute meeting with Cummings and Cain in which, the Financial Times reported, he confronted the pair with text messages forwarded to his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, showing they had briefed against her. “In tense exchanges,” the paper reported, “Mr Johnson accused his aides of briefing against him and his partner Carrie Symonds and criticised them for destabilising the government in the midst of tense Brexit negotiations.” It added: “Mr Johnson … told them to get out and never return.” A very different atmosphere was described in the Sunday Times. “Both [Cummings and Cain] told friends the meeting was ‘warm with lots of laughter’ as the trio recounted their battles together. ‘When you split up with a girlfriend, it’s best to move out quickly,’ a friend said.” It also quoted a senior No 10 source as saying the PM said the briefings had to stop. The report added: “Having ousted his key aides … Johnson, typically, sought to minimise the confrontation, telling officials: ‘I told them we should get the gang back together’ to fight the next election.” Johnson is said to have visited Cain in his office, signed a pair of “Get Brexit Done” boxing gloves, and made a farewell speech. “He’s the only one of my staff who always answers the phone calls … day or night,” Johnson reportedly said, adding: “I sometimes wait for days for Dom to return them.” What’s clear is that, despite Cummings’ claim that he was always planning to leave at the end of the year (on which, more below), the dramatic and public nature of his and Cain’s departure was not what they or the prime minister had envisaged. All parties may have put on a good-natured front on Friday, but anger, shock and hurt on both sides are difficult to deny. Symonds calls Johnson more than 20 times a day and has been nicknamed ‘Princess Nut Nut’ v she gives much-needed advice as ‘one of the few around the PM who understands the Tory party’ One ally of Cain and Cummings claimed Johnson’s fiancee calls his private office “more than 20 times a day demanding that he leave meetings to call her back”. This was dismissed as untrue by Symonds’ allies and civil servants – the latter described as “impartial” by the Sunday Times. The Mail on Sunday reported on a nickname for Symonds apparently circulating among Cummings loyalists: Princess Nut Nuts, or Princess Nut Nut (there is division over this, too), sometimes expressed in emojis. The Daily Telegraph, citing sources, reported that the prime minister was particularly riled by the nickname. A source told the Guardian that neither Cummings nor Cain themselves used this expression, though someone perceived as being in their camp did. The Sunday Times, which also highlighted a former cabinet minister’s concern over Symonds’ influence in non-ministerial appointments, quoted a friend of Symonds hitting back: “Carrie was deliberately dragged into it at a key moment to damage her and to undermine the case she was making. They want her to look like Lady Macbeth. She is one of the very few people around the prime minister who understands the Conservative party.” There were also claims that misogyny lay behind the attacks. It is notable that Symonds’ position on Cain – which led to Cummings’ exit – was echoed by Allegra Stratton, the new No 10 press secretary, and Munira Mirza, director of the policy unit. Johnson has previously been accused of presiding over a “blokey” government. The prime minister is ‘indecisive’ v Cummings is ‘trying to blame everyone else but himself for his demise’ Cummings left No 10 with a broadside against his boss, the Daily Telegraph reported, telling allies that Johnson was “indecisive” and that he and Cain had to rely on the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, to provide direction. This allegation was backed by a source speaking to the Guardian. However, the Telegraph carried the counter-claim from “sources loyal to the prime minister” that complaints of dithering were simply “the occasions when the PM won’t do what he [Cummings] wants him to” and accusing Cummings of “trying to blame everyone but himself” for his demise. The paper quoted a source as saying: “The truth is that Dom will pay no attention to something for months, then he will get interested in it and expect it to happen in two or three days. That’s not how government works. When he says Boris is indecisive, what he actually means is that Boris won’t do something he wants. That’s not the same thing.” Those whose memories go back four years will recall Johnson admitting that he penned two articles on Brexit – one for and one against staying in the EU – though he described the former as “semi-parodic”. So indecision is not new to him, it seems. Cummings was always planning to go by the end of the year v he was given the boot While it has been widely reported that the prime minister ordered Cummings to leave Downing Street on Friday, Johnson’s top adviser sought to spin a different version of events a day earlier. In a series of tweets, the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, reported late on Thursday evening that Cummings was off. She wrote: “Senior No 10 source says Dominic Cummings is out by Christmas – after hours of speculation HE tells me ‘rumours of me threatening to resign are invented, rumours of me asking others to resign are invented’…” She added: “He said ‘tonight’s rumours that somehow the Brexit negotiations are involved are invented and comical to anybody who knows whats happening in no10’ but when asked about rumours he would quit at Christmas Cummings said … ‘My position hasn’t changed since my January blog’ – when he planned to make himself ‘redundant’ by the end of 2020 – he’s off.” In fact, his lengthy January blog – in which he infamously said Downing Street wanted to hire “weirdos and misfits” – was not quite so explicit about when he would go. Cummings wrote at the time: “We want to improve performance and make me much less important – and within a year largely redundant.” On Friday the Guardian was told by two sources that Johnson had ordered Cummings and Cain to leave Downing Street with immediate effect rather than stay until Christmas. That account stands."
2020-11-15T13:48:38Z,politics,Politics,Richard Leonard: Labour must keep left onside in broad coalition,"The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, has said his party must keep the “Bernie Sanders” faction onside and build the broad coalition of support needed to win a general election, as it ramps up campaigning before May’s elections. He also called for a “swift resolution” to the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn over the former leader’s response to an equalities watchdog investigation into antisemitism in the party. Leonard, who has faced challenges to his leadership and whose party is polling as low as 12% in Scotland, is aligned with supporters of Corbyn. In an interview with the Guardian, Leonard said he believed his party could overtake the Conservatives in Scotland, and the SNP would face a “reckoning” over the coronavirus pandemic. He said Labour could learn lessons from Joe Biden’s victory in the US, both in terms of party unity and in campaigning. “I think it is clearly about trying to bring together a coalition. It seems to me that the Biden coalition was pretty wide and was able to encompass the Bernie Sanders faction, which I would probably identify myself more closely with,” he said. “But he clearly got a huge response from parts of American communities that hadn’t voted Democrat for some time.” Leonard said the “vote early” message of postal voting was also a key lesson. “In the midst of a pandemic, how you organise is going to necessarily be different. And having such a controversial opponent really helped solidify people’s resolve to do something to make a change.” He urged Labour to come to a resolution over Corbyn’s suspension so that the party could focus outwards. “The Labour party just needs to get over some of its differences. I make no secret of the fact that there have been challenges to me and to my leadership,” he said. “The Labour party should always be looking outward. It’s always been a danger of being caught up in inward-looking debates.” He said the party’s procedures for dealing with complaints and grievances was “extraordinarily slow”, adding: “I think one of the comments of the EHRC [antisemitism] report was about inaction and delay … I think the swift resolution of Jeremy’s suspension would be extremely helpful for everybody.” His call for an inclusive coalition within Labour will raise eyebrows among his critics. When a small group of MSPs called for him to quit and tried to force a leadership contest in September, Leonard said they could face deselection or be barred from standing in May’s Holyrood election. Leonard will face a test in the run-up to the Scottish parliamentary elections in May, where the SNP are expected to make sweeping gains and drive momentum for a second independence referendum. He admitted that Sturgeon’s gamble to make herself the face of the pandemic had paid off, with a surge in support for the SNP and for independence. But he said this popularity masked huge errors and called for a Scotland-focused public inquiry. “They see her [Sturgeon], you know, frankly, in juxtaposition to Boris Johnson. That is boosting their ratings and, indeed, boosting support for independence,” Leonard said. “She’s decided that she is going to be the face and the voice of Scotland’s response to the pandemic. “I think that there will be a point of reckoning on things like what happened in Scotland’s care homes. For a lot of the summer, 50% of all Covid-related deaths were in care homes. And that wasn’t just something that’s happening all over Europe, as Nicola Sturgeon claims. This is something which happened at the … guidance, issued by the Scottish government.” He said Sturgeon and Johnson were “two sides of the same coin” in terms of fuelling support for independence, and he described Johnson as an “English nationalist” whose own support for the union was in question. “We don’t underestimate the Boris Johnson effect,” he said. “I have to say to people: you couldn’t possibly take a decision as profound as whether you want to separate out from the rest of the UK or remain in the UK based on the fact that Boris Johnson is the prime minister, because he’s transient. This is a huge decision, which has got massive long-term consequences, economic, social and otherwise.” Labour is likely to face a dilemma in the face of an overwhelming SNP victory over whether it should support calls for a second referendum – something Leonard does not yet want to concede. “Our position going into the election next year is that we are not for a second referendum. Even amongst people that support independence, many of them say that’s not the priority,” he said. “In the next five years the parliament should really be focused on dealing with real and existing crises that we face. Even if it were to happen that the referendum parties got a majority, do people want, you know, three, four years of a wrangle with Boris Johnson about that? “We need to see urgent action on the issues of the day. We just do not see the case for further big constitutional debate, division and upheaval.”"
2020-11-15T11:30:29Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings' exit won't affect Brexit talks, says UK minister","The UK environment secretary, George Eustice, has denied that the departure of Dominic Cummings – one of the architects of Vote Leave – will have any impact on Brexit negotiations. As the Brexit deal deadline approaches, Eustice sought to downplay Cummings’ exit from No 10 by arguing it would not alter discussions with Brussels as UK negotiations are led by David Frost. Downing Street was rocked last week by the departures of Boris Johnson’s most senior aide and his director of communications, Lee Cain, another veteran of Vote Leave, who lost out in a power struggle involving Boris Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds. With Brexit talks due to resume this week before an EU summit on Thursday, viewed in Brussels as a deadline for a draft deal, Eustice was questioned on whether it was easier to get a trade agreement with the EU without Cummings. Eustice told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The negotiations have been led by David Frost from the beginning. He’s got a very talented, experienced team of technical experts around him. “He’s led these negotiations from the start and obviously remains in place and continues to do so. So I don’t actually think the departure of Dominic Cummings makes any particular impact on the negotiations, since Lord Frost has been leading those.” Amid reports of counter-briefings between warring factions in No 10, Eustice was pressed on whether the prime minister needed to take responsibility for his staff “tearing strips off each other”. Eustice said: “I’ve known Dominic Cummings myself for many years. He’s got many great strengths and one of them is winning campaigns. And he tends to apply himself in short bursts, short tours of duty, on big strategic changes such as the 2016 referendum result, such as the 2019 general election. “And he’s very talented at that. But look, it’s always the prime minister’s prerogative who will be their key advisers. The prime minister has to have a team around him that he’s comfortable with, that works well to get the right balance. And it’s always the case the prime ministers can change their advisers and change the mix of their advisers.” The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown painted a complex picture of splits within the Conservative party. “Well, you’ve got 27,000 new [Covid] cases yesterday, 500 deaths, you’ve got a million young people looking for work, you’ve got people without savings planning for Christmas,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “Really, we should not be in this factional fighting at the moment. And I see no end to this factional fighting because you’ve got a soft Brexit faction, a hard Brexit faction, you’ve got a libertarian faction in relation to health restrictions, a communitarian faction, you’ve got a northern faction wanting spending rising, a southern faction wanting spending cuts, you’ve got a devolution faction and a centralisation faction.
“This is not simply a problem of a dysfunctional Downing Street, this is a dysfunctional UK and we really will need a wholesale root-and-branch constitutional review to bring people together at a later stage.” Asked if he thought the departure of Cummings would have any effect on how the government dealt with trade talks, Brown said: “I think the arrival of Joe Biden has made all the difference. “I see a trade deal coming pretty soon. The government simply cannot afford to be at war with America on the one hand and Europe on the other at the start of the new year. So if he [Johnson] doesn’t change his internal market bill he’s at war with America, if he doesn’t get a negotiation settled with Europe he’s at war with Europe. I think he’s made up his mind already that he’s going to get a settlement and there will be a settlement soon, I think.”"
2020-11-15T10:30:32Z,politics,Politics,A real party island: Keir Starmer's desert discs have Stormzy and soul,"It is a music collection that has something for the former heartlands, the masses and the hundreds of thousands of youthful members who joined the party under Jeremy Corbyn – but Sir Keir Starmer has insisted focus groups had no role in a Desert Island Discs selection that appears to reach out to different Labour wings. The Labour leader speaks of his love of northern soul and his euphoria at singing an England football anthem at Wembley, during his appearance on today’s edition of the BBC Radio 4 programme. He also chooses a song featuring Stormzy, the grime artist who backed Corbyn’s leadership. Starmer selected northern soul classic Out on the Floor by Dobie Gray as one of his tracks. “I love northern soul,” he says. “And this reminds me … of my early days in London, with a group of friends in a really grotty flat above a sauna or a massage parlour that kept interesting hours.” He says he would “not be foolish enough now” to try to dance to it. He also selects the football anthem Three Lions by David Baddiel, Frank Skinner and the Lightning Seeds, citing his love of football. “In order to really appreciate this song you had to be in Wembley in the crowd – I was in the upper tier – for the semi-final of Euro 96 when we’re playing Germany and for the whole stadium to be jumping up and down, rocking to this.”
His final selection was a cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water by Artists for Grenfell, featuring Stormzy. He says that despite party politics, it is “a reminder about what politics is really about”. He adds: “I chose Stormzy because my children love Stormzy and so it will remind me of my children.” Labour is having to fight to win back support in northern seats after the last election and has been accused of becoming too metropolitan and liberal. Meanwhile, Starmer has been warned by the left that he faces losing huge numbers of Labour members attracted by Corbyn’s politics. Asked if advisers had seen his list, he said: “These are entirely my own choices. If you run into anybody I’ve known for a long time, they will tell you this is the genuine Keir Starmer list.” Starmer, who was central to Labour backing a second referendum at the last election, acknowledged that the Brexit position “came up in a very negative way” in many northern and Midlands seats. “I’ve got to accept that,” he says. “And that’s a fair challenge. Obviously, it was differently received in Scotland – there was never an easy position for our party in that election.” He admits he said a lot of “daft” things as a young political radical, writing for a socialist magazine and failing to convince voters in east Surrey to back nationalisation. “I started by thinking I had all the answers. And as I’ve grown up, I’ve learned the power of saying, ‘I don’t know, let’s have a look at that’. And that’s been a very important lesson for me.” He becomes emotional as he recounts his mother’s struggles with severe illness and says he regrets not being close to his father. Starmer says his book choice would be “a detailed atlas, hopefully with shipping lanes in it, so I can get myself off this island” and that he would also take a football, which he still plays each week. Starmer’s selections
Three Lions by Baddiel, Skinner and the Lightning Seeds The song composed for England’s doomed attempt to win Euro 96, the country’s last home tournament, was selected by the football-loving Labour leader to remember his time at Wembley watching the semi final defeat to Germany. Like Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is an Arsenal fan. He says he has played football each week since his youth.
Out on the Floor by Dobie Gray A classic of northern soul, which Starmer says reminds him of his early days in London, where he built “lifelong friendships”. The song was first released in the UK in 1975, when it reached number 42 in the charts. A second release in 1983 saw it reach number 95.
Bridge Over Troubled Water by Artists for Grenfell Starmer says the version of the song reminds him that “in the end, politics is about people”. He said that the Grenfell tragedy “brought a shudder to everybody”. He adds that he had chosen a track featuring Stormzy because his children loved his music."
2020-11-15T08:15:29Z,politics,Politics,Howezat! The day a ‘dead sheep’ turned into a roaring lion,"What makes a truly great speech? The ancient Greeks – who knew a thing or two about oratory – reckoned the most important thing by far was timing. They even invented a specific word for it: kairos. Defined by the dictionary as “the perfect, critical or opportune moment”. The Geoffrey Howe resignation speech which destroyed Margaret Thatcher’s political career precisely 30 years ago last week had kairos by the bucketload. But then it needed to. Delivery was never Howe’s strong point. As his political rival Denis Healey famously noted, an attack from Geoffrey was like “being savaged by a dead sheep”. Without the all-important kairos, the speech would have languished in the footnotes rather than being hailed by the editor of Hansard in 2015 as the greatest parliamentary speech of all time. I came to appreciate just how exquisite Howe’s timing was when researching my play called – what else? – Dead Sheep. Tuesday 13 November 1990 was indeed the perfect, critical, opportune moment for him to drop his oratorical bomb. Thatcher had been in power for 11 years and her political instincts were fraying. More specifically, timing wise, Howe made his speech just two days before the closing date for nominations for leadership of the Conservative party. Had he made it six months earlier, Thatcher would probably have ridden it out. By attacking her so spectacularly so close to the deadline, Howe blew the contest – eventually won by John Major – wide open. But for Howe’s speech, she would almost certainly have remained unchallenged or, at worst, faced a stalking horse. The final bit of kairos came via television cameras, which had been allowed into parliament three months earlier. Thatcher’s humiliation was thus rendered fatally public.
Kairos was crucial then, but there were other factors. The speech was utterly unexpected. No one anticipated anything more than the usual long-winded pomposity. Howe had been Thatcher’s chancellor, foreign secretary and finally, deputy PM, and was thought too loyal to rock the boat. And, as the Guardian’s Hugo Young put it: “Sudden departures have become such a hallmark of the Thatcher years that Howe’s is no longer one capable of shaking the Thatcher world.” Then there was the rhetoric. In 15 electrifying minutes, the pompous, dumpy, bespectacled Captain Mainwaring of the Tory party demolished Thatcher in a very British way: using understated brutality. “It is a conflict of loyalty with which I have perhaps wrestled too long,” said Howe, a passionate pro-European, referring to Thatcher’s Eurosceptic grandstanding. “How on earth are … [we] … supposed to conduct complex negotiations in good faith with our European partners against that kind of background noise?” When Howe sat down to a stunned, silent Commons, everyone knew Thatcher was gone. Nine days later, she resigned. Over the years, myths have developed around the speech. One is that Howe didn’t write it. It was, said detractors (that is, furious Thatcher loyalists), the work of his wife, Elspeth, a campaigner and former head of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, a 1980s version of Ofcom. Elspeth certainly had the motivation to write it: she couldn’t stand Thatcher and vice versa. Tory grandee John Biffen said the two women were like “wasps in a jam jar”. Elspeth loathed Thatcher’s belittling of Howe in cabinet and in public; Thatcher suspected Elspeth of insurrection and was threatened by her (relatively) hardcore feminism. In fact, Howe did write it, with input from his adviser Anthony Teasdale. Elspeth inspired it though: she gave him the courage to act. And she must get credit for the speech’s most quoted passage. When Howe was fine tuning, Elspeth alerted him to Thatcher’s rabble-rousing at the lord mayor’s banquet the night before when she had boasted of dispatching critics, Ian Botham-style: “The bowling’s going to get hit all round the ground,” crowed the PM. “That’s my style!” Elspeth, who had been captain of her school cricket team, suggested Howe develop the metaphor to show the consequences of being repeatedly undermined by your boss in public.
He did so, brilliantly: “Mr Speaker. I believe the chancellor and the governor [of the Bank of England] are cricketing enthusiasts, so I hope there is no monopoly of cricketing metaphors. It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find, the moment the first balls are bowled, that their bats have been broken before the game, by the team captain.” It was brilliant because it was brutal – the bit about breaking bats – but also subtle: the “monopoly” reference being a sly dig at his boss’s insufferable imperiousness. Thatcher thinks she’s the only one who can do putdowns, Howe was saying, but guess what? I can, too. And I’m better. Other theories concerned Howe’s motivation. During my research, I saw several dramas trotting out the received wisdom: Howe was simply a mediocre home counties Judas who wanted revenge on Thatcher for demoting him to the non-job of deputy PM. That’s very reductive. But partly true. It’s impossible to nail down Howe’s motives definitively – who knows what really goes on in the hearts and minds of men? – but it wasn’t just about vengeance. It was about honour. And ambition. Honour first. Although patriotic, he was a genuine, committed Europhile and believed that Thatcher’s anti-EEC bile was harming the national interest. Europe wasn’t a convenient peg to hang his political ambitions on, Boris Johnson-style. As for ambition, he admitted it in his autobiography, saying: “Every soldier has a field marshal’s baton in his knapsack.” He also wrote of his embarrassment when Thatcher belittled him. Towards the end of their working relationship she would shout in cabinet “Speak up Geoffrey!”, and joke about his ponderousness. He didn’t admit to wanting revenge. But you don’t have to be a psychiatrist to divine a subconscious element of payback. What can be said definitively, however, is that Howe’s story was a gift to a playwright, with its enticing dramatic arc: the journey from dead sheep to roaring lion. What’s also undeniable is that the play – which is being published this week to mark the speech’s anniversary – portrays events which are still uncannily relevant and resonant.
This was remain v leave a quarter of a century before its time. This was unglamorous statesman v play-to-the-gallery populist: Starmer v Johnson, Biden v Trump. It was also the story of a man and his two marriages: Howe’s long, happy one to Elspeth and his political one to Thatcher. I thought a lot about Howe when Teresa May was going through her Brexit bill traumas last year. If only someone with Howe’s heft – Labour or Tory – had grasped that kairos moment and made a truly great speech, May’s deal could have passed, she would have survived, and we wouldn’t be enduring the most tragically incompetent, ideologically vacuous PM of modern times.

2020-11-15T07:45:28Z,politics,Politics,No-deal fears rise as Boris Johnson 'least willing to budge on Brexit',"Boris Johnson remains the “hardest in the room” in his unwillingness to budge to secure a Brexit deal, government insiders said this weekend, amid warnings that just days remain to finalise an agreement. After a torrid week for Downing Street which saw two former Vote Leave figures quit the prime minister’s senior team, ministers in favour of a deal said they hoped their departures would boost the chances of finally signing an EU trade agreement after months of brinkmanship. However, sources familiar with the government’s deliberations said that, at repeated meetings, it had been the prime minister himself who had been the most hardline in wanting to hold out for better terms. They said the departure of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s senior adviser, and Lee Cain, his communications chief, would not change the fact that Johnson himself remained determined and hard to read. “The prime minister is always the hardest in the room on Brexit – more so than perhaps other ministers and advisers,” said a senior Whitehall source. Another insider said they were “still hopeful of a deal”, but there was a willingness among cabinet ministers to back the prime minister should he decide on a no-deal outcome. “To be frank, this is one issue where the cabinet is completely united – like no other policy,” said a person familiar with the deliberations. “[After the election], the prime minister has a lot of political capital on this.” It comes ahead of a week in which Johnson faces a mammoth decision over whether or not to back a Brexit deal that will inevitably require compromises on the British side. Senior figures such as Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister overseeing Brexit preparations, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, are said to be advocating a deal. While progress has been made, persistent problems have emerged around fishing rights and level playing field rules that may prevent Britain from using state aid in the way it wishes. There are also outstanding issues over so-called “regression clauses” that would prevent the UK undercutting the EU in some areas. Talks continue on Monday, with a potential deadline set for a EU leaders’ video conference on Thursday.
However, there are also huge political pressures on Johnson, with some fearing that any sign of Brexit compromise will create yet another opening for Nigel Farage and his new Reform UK party. Farage has said it has already received over 3,000 expressions of interest from supporters over the prospect of running for the party in widespread local elections next year. However, the party is currently focusing its campaigning on opposing the government’s lockdown measures. Pro-Brexit donors who funded Johnson’s leadership campaign are also becoming nervous over the government’s direction. “It’s been astonishing, actually. I’ve never seen a government that has been less in touch with any of its fingers – any of its extremities,” said one donor. “It’s the end of the fellowship. The fact is [Cummings and Cain] are leaving before the end, which tells you they’re not going to get the deal that they want. Boris is now in a hard place, as he wants to deal at any price.”
Downing Street denies the departures mean a Brexit deal, and compromise with the EU, are now more likely. The donor added: “I would walk away [from Brexit talks]. There isn’t a lot to lose from doing that, given the deal on offer is essentially only for the traded goods sector. It does nothing for our large services sector anyway.”"
2020-11-14T22:14:10Z,politics,Politics,Attacks by PM’s ousted aide left new press chief in tears,"The woman appointed by Boris Johnson to lead his daily press operations was left in tears on Saturday after she claimed to have been the subject of negative briefings by a former No 10 official who resigned last week and made a dramatic exit from Downing Street. In an extraordinary escalation of feuding involving new and departing aides to Johnson, friends of Allegra Stratton, the new press secretary to the prime minister, said she had been “in tears all morning” as a result of what she believed were critical briefings by Johnson’s former director of communications, Lee Cain. Stratton, who will be the public face of the government, believes Cain told numerous journalists over the previous 24 hours that she was not the first choice for the job and had not been top of the list of a panel chosen to make the high-profile appointment. Cain is a close ally of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former closest adviser, who also resigned last week and was asked to leave on Friday. The news came as allies of Cummings and Cain said their enemies in government were “determined to set fire to [Johnson’s] premiership” with a “tsunami of toxic briefings” that would ultimately undermine the government. Another government figure said: “It’s a bloodbath, isn’t it?” Stratton, a former Guardian and television journalist who was working for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, before being appointed by Johnson, was said to be deeply distressed, as her reason for taking the job was to help restore civility and some order to Downing Street. A close friend of Stratton said: “Allegra is very upset. It was the prime minister who asked her to do the job multiple times. She did not apply to do it, but Johnson appealed to her sense of public duty. “She wants to broaden the appeal of this government. She likes and respects Johnson. But she thinks that this government has to date managed to make enemies and crossed the road to pick fights, that this government has narrowed its appeal and should be doing better.” Stratton later told the Observer: “Yes, I am upset because I was only ever trying to do the right thing by the country. And the country does not want to be run by people in No 10 who treat people discourteously and unpleasantly.” Her decision to break cover follows an extraordinary week in which Cummings, the closest but most controversial adviser to Johnson, and Cain, the PM’s director of communications, both resigned and were urged by Johnson to leave Downing Street without delay on Friday. The move followed rows over leaks of government announcements and premature claims – reported in some media – that Cain was to become Johnson’s new chief of staff. Another friend of Stratton said she believed Cain “was telling journalists that she was not first in line for the job … that they did not want her. There has been this tug of war between her and Lee and Dom”. Stratton is understood to have made clear throughout discussions on her appointment that she would not serve under Cain, because of what she saw as his abrupt style and treatment of junior advisers. Her decision to make a public statement before the daily briefings even begin is evidence of how serious the internal warfare inside No 10 has become. Allies of Cain said on Saturday night that he had “never briefed against anybody” and added that the former director of communications “had always been clear that Allegra had been the first choice of the prime minister”. However, Cummings and Cain’s supporters pointed out that she had performed less well than other candidates in interviews and did not impress focus groups as much as others. Senior sources in No 10 made clear on Saturday night that the prime minister is now preparing for big changes to his teams both in Downing Street and the cabinet, with a ministerial reshuffle “in January, or maybe earlier”.
“We have got to strengthen the cabinet and fill posts that are vacant so there will be changes,” said one. According to one government source, Johnson was warned that Stratton’s appointment would represent “cronyism” because of her friendship with Carrie Symonds, the prime minister’s fiancee and former Tory communications director. An opponent of Stratton’s appointment said Ellie Price, the BBC journalist, was “head and shoulders” above the other candidates during an official selection process for the job. Despite the departure of Cummings and Cain, Johnson is understood to have told a group of officials in Downing Street that he wanted to get “the band back together” for the 2024 election. Cain handed in his resignation following the fallout from Stratton’s appointment. The prime minister is understood to have attempted to reverse the decision and offered him the role of chief of staff, but Cain quit after news of the job offer leaked. Insiders said there was visible upset among the prime minister’s team as the fallout continued, with aides desperately ringing around to make sure there would not be further resignations. “This is bloody even by Westminster standards,” said one Whitehall figure. “It’s almost embarrassing. The person who suffers is the prime minister, who’s a good man trying to do very difficult things. This is a huge distraction.”"
2020-11-14T20:45:15Z,politics,Politics,Nightmare on Downing Street,"Almost a year ago, Boris Johnson threw a big party in Downing Street for his staff and the press. It was billed as the prime minister’s annual Christmas drinks but there were many more reasons for good cheer inside No 10. Johnson had just won a stunning general election victory the week before, securing an 80-strong parliamentary majority, and he was still on cloud nine. So, too, were former leading lights of the Vote Leave team who had delivered Brexit for Johnson, then played key roles in the election win. These advisers, whom the prime minister had brought into No 10 after Theresa May’s departure, knew they had real power at last, in the form of a thumping mandate delivered by the people. As the guests crammed in, the man hailed by many Tories as a campaigning and strategic genius behind both Brexit and the election triumph, Dominic Cummings, leaned against a table and held court with journalists. The wine flowed. Johnson swept in and made a jokey, triumphal speech from a stage before departing through a crowd, saying “thank you, thank you” while waving his arm, as if he were a Roman emperor. Other Vote Leavers who had been installed at the heart of power kept proud watch over the PM as he made his exit, including director of communications Lee Cain and Robert Oxley from the press department, while Cleo Watson from the private office and Oliver Lewis, both formerly of Vote Leave, also enjoyed the moment. On Friday, however, just 11 turbulent months since the general election win, the optimism and joy of the early post-election days in No 10 had given way to bitterness and acrimony on a tragic scale. After days of extraordinarily vicious infighting, into which Johnson’s own fiancee Carrie Symonds had been drawn, the prime minister summoned the two biggest beasts of his former Vote Leave team – Cummings and Cain – to a meeting to tell them in no uncertain terms the party was over. Both men had already announced in the previous 24 hours that they were resigning and would leave – soon after an unseemly power struggle over jobs, access to the PM, and influence that they feared was slipping away from them. But by late on Friday feelings were running so high that Johnson wanted them out not in days or weeks but within the hour – to clear their desks and go. Accounts of the 45-minute meeting differ but what is certain is that the PM had become incensed by their behaviour over the previous few days, was furious at leaks from No 10 of key announcements on Covid-19 that he had wanted to make himself, and was enraged by the way his wife-to-be was being briefed against on social media and elsewhere by people linked to the Vote Leave brigade. Over the previous 48-hours Symonds, who had long taken exception to Cain’s brutal style and Cummings’s abrasive, wild ways, was said to have worked hard on Johnson to block Cain’s appointment to a new role of chief of staff, triggering the director of communications’ resignation followed by that of his ally, Cummings.
As the Friday evening meeting began, some say Johnson was barely able to contain his rage as he confronted the two men, and that he showed them texts that he said proved they had briefed against Symonds. Cain and Cummings deny this and say it was a calm meeting and that they accepted why the PM wanted to see the back of them. Another senior No 10 source said on Saturday that it was “overdoing it” to say that the PM had pointed directly to texts about Symonds, “but he did confront them forcefully about leaks and made clear he was angry”. When Cummings later walked out of the front door of No 10 in full view of the TV cameras, carrying a large box of his papers, government advisers present and past, MPs and ministers all struggled to comprehend the scale of the explosion that had just happened. “I thought Lee would go but I didn’t expect Dom to blow himself up too,” said one. If these were ordinary times, then the loss of two aides, one of whom few outside Westminster had ever heard of before last week, would have been easy to move on from. But these are not ordinary times. Downing Street was in meltdown, officials were turning to drink and some were in tears, at a time of national crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic was still raging, and deaths were rising again at alarming rates with the country a week into a second lockdown. Brexit talks on a free trade deal were on the brink of collapse at the very moment the country and the economy could least afford a no-deal outcome. No 10 and the Foreign Office were trying to reset relations with the US after Joe Biden’s election win – no small task, given the president-elect’s antipathy to Brexit and fears for its effects on the Irish peace process. Johnson was also planning a major green speech but was still at odds with the Treasury over the scale of any financial commitments he could make, days before he was set to make it. Yet the media headlines were all about the war in Downing Street. One very senior Tory MP who had been planning on Friday evening to issue a grand healing statement on how to repair the damage and mend relations with MPs, who had long felt ignored by the Cummings-led No 10 operation, abandoned his plan, saying he daren’t go anywhere near the hornets’ nest of Downing Street. “It’s gone crazy. I’m keeping quiet for now,” he said. Many with bitter experiences on the inside of government in recent times said the way Vote Leave people were going for Symonds was shocking, even by their standards. “It is unbelievable that they did not see how attacking the PM’s fiancee would backfire on them. All this stuff about her being the first lady of Downing Street,” said one ex-adviser who had recently been sacked by Cain. “And they are saying how undemocratic it is her wielding power. What do they know about democracy? They are just thugs. It is vile, pathetic, schoolboy shit.” A former cabinet minister who still has the prime minister’s ear summed up the conflicted feelings of many in the parliamentary party on Friday night: “Obviously it is a source of celebration that we have got rid of such unpleasant people but I do worry about the damage that has been done.” Another former minister asked: “How did we allow these people to rule the roost in the first place? What does that say about certain people’s judgment? With everything that is going on, all this is the last thing we need.”
The roots of the immediate crisis go back many weeks, even months. Since the summer, and as big announcements on Covid-19 were being made without No 10 choosing to consult MPs, senior Tories had asked Johnson to rein in Cummings and his allies and stop what they called “government by diktat”. But while the prime minister listened, he did not fully heed the requests. Cummings had already declared war on the civil service. Now he was bypassing parliament and being allowed to get away with it. But at the beginning of September, something shifted. Johnson began to feel, and show, his own frustrations. After a session of prime minister’s questions in which the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, demanded that the PM withdraw comments he had made about Labour leader Keir Starmer and the IRA, Johnson blew fuses both outside the Commons chamber and when he returned to No 10, accusing his aides of leaving him appallingly unprepared at the dispatch box. During the same period Johnson was also growing increasingly angry at the number of leaks from the heart of government, particularly over policy on Covid-19. Friends of Symonds say she, too, was urging the PM to put his foot down and control the leakers and disrupters.
These festering tensions deepened when the Times revealed a fortnight ago that there was to be a second lockdown within days. Johnson had wanted to keep the announcement under wraps and tell the country and parliament himself. He feared that early disclosure could lead people to gather together for one last un-socially distanced hurrah, with disastrous consequences. As the leaks continued, insiders say the PM began to suspect forces inside Downing Street – his own people – were doing the leaking themselves. “I know for sure it was the leaks that changed things. Boris had fucking well had enough,” said a senior Tory MP with the prime minister’s ear. Then came more. In the early part of last week, No 10 sources briefed the Times that Cain was about to be promoted to a job as chief of staff in Downing Street. Cain was known to have been angered that Johnson had given the new role of press secretary with responsibility for fronting up daily briefings to Allegra Stratton, a former Guardian and TV journalist with liberal inclinations, rather than to one of his preferred choices. Cain is said to have feared Stratton would have greater access to the PM than he would, and wanted the chief of staff role to cement his power base. After the Times story broke, however, all hell broke loose as Symonds, Stratton and others inside No 10, including head of the policy unit Munira Mirza, all made clear to Johnson their opposition to Cain getting the role. Amid extraordinary levels of intrigue and confusion, it then emerged that the offer – if it was ever definitively made by Johnson – had been withdrawn. Sources say the true story is “complex” and that the offer was not “nailed on”. Cain resigned and Cummings threw tantrums. “Dom threw his toys out of the pram and threatened to go,” said one source. Then on Thursday evening, Cummings did resign. To add to the sense of chaos and plotting, MPs and advisers then began to put it around that Cain had in fact briefed the Times himself, saying that he had been offered the job of chief of staff before it was definite, in order to bounce the prime minister into giving it to him. “That is how they have always operated,” said an MP. “They did it at Vote Leave. They leak stuff to get it announced. Then they blame others for it. It is the way they work. That is what it looks like this time too.”
Cain denies this. In a meeting on Thursday evening, Cummings had tried to rescue the situation before deciding what to do himself – by suggesting that the prime minister should appoint Cleo Watson, one of his Vote Leave allies, to the chief of staff role. Johnson refused in a tense encounter. The ground was falling away from beneath the Vote Leave grouping and even from beneath Cummings. There are plenty in the Tory party who this weekend are trying to see the bright side, to view the demise of Cummings and Cain and the eruptions of last week as a turning point, one that will allow Johnson to move into a calmer, more collegiate phase of his government. Writing in the Observer, the MP and vice-chair of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs Charles Walker is savage about the “fractious macho culture” that had prevailed too long under Cummings and Cain and the “impenetrable iron curtain” they erected around the PM to shield him from his MPs. With them gone, Walker writes, there is now a “fantastic opportunity” for greater harmony and better relations. The former cabinet minister Damian Green told the Observer that Johnson should now return to where he was most comfortable, on the One Nation wing of the party. “Boris has always wanted to be a One Nation prime minister, so this is a good time to reset the priorities,” he said. Tobias Ellwood, Tory chair of the defence select committee, said Joe Biden’s win in the US presented “an opportunity for Britain that’s yet to be fully appreciated” and that upgrading the UK’s defence capabilities and securing a Brexit deal had to be part of that process of re-projecting the UK on the world stage. “First and foremost we must secure an EU deal, for without it we have little chance of being in the room,” Ellwood said. But hope is one thing – realising it is another entirely. There are also many pessimistic Tories who say that the fact that Johnson allowed Cummings and his gang to occupy such positions of power in the first place, against the advice of many, and then the way he resisted pressure for so long to rein them in, shows a fundamental lack of judgment on the prime minister’s part that does not bode well. “It is not that he was not warned,” said one senior Tory MP. “Cummings was always an accident waiting to happen on a grand scale,” said another MP. “We were all just waiting for the day.” Cummings’s past should have been the guide, Johnson’s critics say. Yes, he had provided a brilliant campaign strategist in both the Brexit referendum of 2016 and the 2019 general election. But planting him at the heart of government was a mistake, most Tories would now admit, even Brexiters. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, says Cummings had good ideas, including on reform of the civil service. “But he did not need to go to war with the whole of Whitehall,” he said. Constant war, constant revolution is, however, all Cummings seems to know. Duncan Smith had to get rid of him as an adviser when he was leader because he was so disruptive. David Cameron’s early head of communications, Andy Coulson, banned Cummings from becoming a special adviser because he thought he was a liability. When Coulson left and Michael Gove employed Cummings it was not long before Cummings was sending emails to others in government saying how ineffective Cameron was as prime minister. Cameron called him a “career psychopath”. The evidence was there for all to see that Cummings would bring turbulence as well as strategic guile and ideas, but Johnson still planted him and his acolytes at the heart of his operation – with what many believe were inevitable results.
This weekend Johnson has remained in Downing Street as recriminations continue. They have reached extraordinary levels even by the standards of Cummings. Stratton, say friends, spent Saturday morning in tears after what she said were savage briefings against her by Cummings and Cain and their friends, who she insists have been saying she was not the first choice for the job. Stratton counters saying she may not have been “their” first choice but that the PM asked her eight times to take the job. Johnson is said to be determined to use this crisis to turn a corner. He is preparing to carry out a reshuffle of both his cabinet and his No 10 team in January, or in the words of one senior adviser “maybe earlier”. What Cummings does next is less clear – but whatever it is could have a profound effect on Johnson’s premiership. Will he publicly turn on the prime minister, revealing secrets from the heart of the government’s coronavirus response? And will he turn his loyalties back to Gove, with whom he had the closest relationship in government?"
2020-11-14T19:16:05Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings' relationship with Boris Johnson 'fell off cliff', says ex-minister","Dominic Cummings left Downing Street after his relationship with the prime minister “fell off a cliff”, a former cabinet minister has said. Cummings left his role as chief adviser on Friday after a power struggle that has rocked the Boris Johnson administration just as Brexit talks head into a crucial phase next week, with London seeking a trade deal with Brussels before the end of the transition period on 31 December. The prime minister’s official spokesman insisted Johnson was not being distracted by the row and was “focused … on taking every possible step to get this country through the coronavirus pandemic”. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said Cummings’ “relationship with the prime minister fell off a cliff” and his departure was a chance to reset the government. And a senior Tory backbencher who supported Cummings over his coronavirus lockdown breaches said on Saturday he had been wrong to do so. Crispin Blunt said he should not have supported Cummings after his controversial trips to Durham and Barnard Castle at the height of England’s first lockdown were exposed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. Blunt said the lockdown journeys “stank”. Blunt was not one of the 45 backbenchers who called for Cummings to go at the time, but speaking on Times Radio he admitted the aide’s behaviour had “gravely undermined” the government’s message on coronavirus. Asked if he had been right to back the adviser, Blunt said: “With the benefit of hindsight, no. However, you’ve got to make a call about what is seen to be fair and proper in the circumstances, and Boris made a call on that.”
During their visit to the north of England, Cummings drove with his wife and son to the picturesque town of Barnard Castle, 30 miles from his parents’ home, which he said was to check his eyesight was in good order. Blunt said that while he felt Cummings had done the “right thing for his family”, it had eroded public trust in the government and its messaging over the Covid crisis. “The politics of it obviously absolutely stank, and once it had been alighted upon by people it was a very bad example and it gravely undermined, obviously because of the huge attention it received, trust in the government’s policy,” he said. Davis said on Saturday that Johnson had been “very dependent” on Cummings for a long time, and called on the prime minister to “put right” the marginalisation of MPs over the past 11 months. “The whole attitude to parliament has been pushed, has been sidelined, and similarly, it is said, and I am not in a position to know, but it is said that cabinet has been sidelined too,” Davis told Times Radio. Davis said Cummings’ decision to leave his job through the front door of Downing Street, when his office was elsewhere in the building and there were several other exits, was “entirely deliberate” as he wanted to leave an “image”. He told BBC Breakfast: “He could have walked out the back door, which is almost sort of underground, not visible, or he could have walked out of the entrance out of Whitehall; out of the Cabinet Office – either would have been possible. “He chose to leave that image walking out with a box. He could have perfectly well put his coffee mug or whatever else was in it into his rucksack, but he didn’t.”
Saturday’s papers were awash with claims and counterclaims over the events of the past 48 hours that led to the departure of both Cummings and the director of communications, Lee Cain, ending the grip of Vote Leave’s cabal on Downing Street. Cummings denied he was pushed, telling the Telegraph that stories that Johnson had held him responsible for negative briefings were “invented”. It reported that Johnson was unhappy with the characterisation of his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the media. He was “particularly riled by newspaper reports of Symonds being referred to by nicknames including ‘Princess Nut Nuts’ by Cummings loyalists”. A former special adviser to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told of the coercive and bullying nature of the Cummings and Cain operation, branding them a “schoolboy mafiosa” who had warned him that if leaks over coronavirus travel corridors didn’t stop “we are going to have to start shooting people”. Neil Tweedie, who was not found to have been responsible for any leak, said of Cummings and Cain in the Daily Mail that “fear was their tool”. “The Vote Leave mob, drunk on their success in the referendum and the election, believed they were untouchable,” he wrote. He told how Cummings, who demanded utter loyalty from special advisers to other ministers, held egotistical “spad school” Zoom meetings delivering monologues while “sitting at the end of the cabinet room table, the union flag draped behind him”.
Others with knowledge of the inner workings of Downing Street came to Cummings’ defence on Saturday. One former Downing Street adviser told the Guardian Cummings’ departure would leave Johnson’s inability to lead exposed.
“All these imitation ERG [European Research Group] groups that are springing up, the Northern Research Group, the Covid Research Group, are a symptom of non-existent party management. “The contempt for MPs does not come from Dominic Cummings, he’s just a harder version of the smiling frontman. The basic contempt comes from Boris Johnson. This is not a guy who does the Commons tearooms, who fraternises with fellow MPs. This is a guy who gets blown around by whatever storm; he has no political compass. “Cummings was his ultimate human shield, the lightning conductor for all the hostility from Whitehall and politicians, but it is Johnson’s leadership that is the problem. He doesn’t like making decisions, he doesn’t like upsetting people, he barely had any experience around the cabinet table before becoming leader,” they said. “He is an outsider, a personality. There’s very little seen of him building a support base within the party.” However, Dominic Grieve, former attorney general and a longtime critic of the outgoing adviser, said Cummings had “created mayhem in government”, with his period at No 10 “marked by a slide in standards”. Grieve said: “This year it’s difficult not to say that he’s created nothing except chaos with the prime minister.” Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell told Radio 4’s Today programme the departure of Cummings and Cain was an opportunity for “more harmonious and more effective” communications, and “to rebuild relations with Conservative MPs, the parliamentary party. And, perhaps, to set a less confrontational and more unifying tone, that is maybe more in tune with [Johnson’s] natural instincts.” Cummings did not answer any questions as he left his north London home on Saturday afternoon, only speaking to reporters to ask them to move out of his way before getting into a Toyota Prius which then drove away."
2020-11-14T13:13:22Z,politics,Politics,Labour NEC elections return mixed results as both sides claim victory,"Labour’s internal elections have returned mixed results, with seven of the 15 positions won by Momentum-backed candidates, while a prominent critic of the party’s previous leader was swept to power as a constituency representative with the most votes. The national executive committee (NEC) elections on Friday represented the latest face-off between the party’s factions after Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension last month. Influential voices on either side of the party’s divide claimed victory on the party’s ruling body, with Corbyn critic Luke Akehurst coming first place in the constituency Labour party (CLP) vote, while former MP and Momentum pick Laura Pidcock won the second highest number of votes in the same race. Akehurst is the co-founder of the Labour To Win ticket, which describes its aims as building the “broadest possible coalition with everyone of goodwill”. The faction gained three seats, with Johanna Baxter and Gurinder Singh Josan winning alongside Akehurst. The pro-Starmer wing also gained another voice with the election of former Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones, who won the Welsh Labour representative post. The two representatives of Labour councillors – who are largely supportive of the party’s leader – kept their posts. As well as five Momentum-backed candidates winning CLP posts, candidates backed by the faction also took the disabled members’ representative and youth members’ representative. Although candidates from the party’s left did better than some expected, Keir Starmer’s supporters have a working majority on the ruling committee. The vote returned Baxter, Josan and Yasmine Dar to the party’s ruling body, as well as reinstating former NEC members Akehurst and Ann Black. The latter ran on the soft-left Open Labour ticket.
Labour To Win said the results had “finally given Keir the solid majority on the NEC he needs to transform Labour and win the next election”, adding that it now needed to “make that dream a reality in CLPs up and down the country”. Momentum responded to the results by tweeting: “These results are a huge victory for the socialist left. Grassroots Voice is by far the single largest slate in the members’ section of the NEC. Members want Labour to back a transformative, socialist programme – and that is exactly what these representatives will fight for.” Several MPs on the party’s left saw the victory of the faction’s Grassroots Voice slate as a vindication of Corbyn’s political vision, with Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, writing on Twitter: “Winning the overwhelming majority of positions, it’s clear the left is a significant part of the party. That needs to be respected, starting with Jeremy’s reinstatement to the party.” Richard Burgon, the MP for East Leeds, expressed a similar sentiment, urging that “Corbyn should be reinstated and we must unite to fight the Tories”. The NEC moved away from first-past-the-post voting to members ranking candidates in order of preference – a change that had been backed by organisations such as Open Labour, which said it would minimise “hyper-factionalism” and “one-slate-takes-all” results. The election followed controversy earlier in the week when concerns were raised that the votes of those who had quit the party in reaction to Corbyn’s suspension would be discounted. The party clarified that all votes would be counted, as long as members who have resigned cast their ballots before quitting."
2020-11-14T09:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Andy Burnham: ‘The real me comes out when I’m angry’,"It is a Tuesday afternoon in October and Andy Burnham has just got off the phone with Boris Johnson. After two weeks of negotiations over how to deal with Greater Manchester’s soaring Covid rates, talks have collapsed, and as the region’s mayor, it is his job to tell the public why. He leaves his office and walks round the corner to Bridgewater Hall to be greeted with the biggest press pack he has faced in years. The press conference was sold to me, the Guardian’s North of England editor, as a “select event”, but it is nothing of the kind. I am standing in line behind national reporters, with well-wishers shouting, “Go on, Andy, lad!” as Burnham begins to speak. I’m not used to having to queue for the mayor. We last met in August when, sick of screens but banned from meeting indoors or in gardens, he suggested a walk around Leigh, the part of Wigan he represented in parliament for 16 years. Back then, it felt like things were getting back to normal; he was delighted when one of his old constituents lent me 50p for my parking, and we walked unremarked past young lads smoking weed by the canal. But with Covid’s second wave, Burnham, 50, has become box office: dubbed the “king of the north” after a stirring speech in a cagoule on the steps of Manchester’s Central Library, and inspiring a Vogue article headlined, “Suddenly, Inexplicably, We All Fancy Andy Burnham”. The venue today feels significant. Bridgewater Hall stands opposite Manchester Central, a conference centre requisitioned to become one of the Nightingale hospitals. Perhaps more importantly, it is in full view of the Peterloo memorial, a reminder of the bloody 1819 massacre in which an estimated 18 working-class Mancunians were crushed to death by government-backed yeoman as they peacefully protested for a vote, starting the long battle for universal suffrage. Much of Burnham’s speech is stuff I’ve heard him say countless times before. There’s a familiar dig at Westminster – those who will suffer most in tier 3 are “people working in pubs, in bookies, driving taxis, people too often forgotten by those in power” – followed by a bit of Mancunian exceptionalism: “This city region has never walked on by, and it never will.” But the numbers are striking. Burnham is saying the government’s final offer of £60m in support falls £5m short of what he’s willing to accept. Suddenly, Kevin Lee, Burnham’s aide, rushes to show Burnham something on his phone. It’s a text from Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, who is providing updates from a call she and other local MPs are having with Matt Hancock, the health secretary. They’ve just been told there is now no guarantee that the region will get even the £60m. The only thing assured is £22m, the £8 a head automatically offered to all tier 3 areas for enhanced test and trace and enforcement.
Burnham looks winded. He seems uncharacteristically stuck for words, so Sir Richard Leese, his deputy and the longtime leader of Manchester city council, does the talking. The government plans to “pick off individual councils”, Leese says. They want to break Greater Manchester’s united front, an unlikely coalition of some rightwing libertarian Tory MPs and some of the most leftwing council leaders in Britain. “It’s a disgrace!” shouts a man in his 60s – a Tory voter, it later turns out. He is part of a swollen crowd who earlier booed Newsnight political editor Nick Watt when he accused the mayor of showboating. “It’s brutal, to be honest, isn’t it?” says Burnham. “This is no way to run the country in a national crisis.” That night, Boris Johnson gives his own press conference. He refuses to confirm or deny whether the £60m is off the table, a punishment for Mancunian intransigence. Viewed from the north of England, it is not a good look for the former mayor of London who, shortly after becoming prime minister, gave a speech in which he vowed to give more power to the regions. “I know the transformative potential of local, accountable leadership,” Johnson told the Convention of the North in Rotherham last September. This, he said, meant “trusting people to take back control and run things the way that they want to”. Later that night, I think about Watt’s showboating comment. Burnham clearly enjoys the limelight, and knows how to get a headline – but none of it felt manufactured. Those who rarely leave Westminster made much of his outfit – no tie, black shirt under a navy jacket, Clark Kent specs – suggesting he was trying to look more like an educated football casual than a former cabinet minister. But these days he is more often in that get-up than a suit. And as for wearing cagoules when it isn’t raining? He is a Britpop fan. Everyone knows that Manc frontmen like to rock a waterproof whatever the weather. Even so, the questions remain: is there more to Burnham’s rocketing profile than the economic survival of Mancunians? The man who (twice) failed to become Labour leader is currently putting more pressure on the government than he ever could on the opposition frontbench. Will he be content with his new role as a de facto leader of northern England – or is this the beginning of a more significant political rebirth? *** When I catch up with Burnham on the phone a few days later, he sounds knackered. It has been a completely “bewildering” few weeks, he says. His daughters, Annie, 15, and Rosie, 18, are used to the rumours that their dad wears mascara or dyes his hair (he doesn’t). But the idea of him being a sex symbol went several steps too far. “I just want all that stuff to pass,” he says, hurriedly.
He insists he wasn’t showboating. “I’ve never in any way felt that, in the job I am doing, I am raising my profile,” he says. “In leaving Westminster and the national stage, I always felt I was leaving that side of it behind, and I was happy about that. I thought, I’ll be well known in the region, but not outside it. I lived in the media spotlight for all those years, and I was almost deliberately downgrading my profile.” The Andy Burnham who raged outside the Bridgewater Hall is authentic, he insists. “My mum always says the real me comes out when I am tired and angry… I just thought, what’s the point of my role if this is the way we are treated?” There seems to be little gap between Burnham’s public and private personas. In all the years I have covered his political career, I have never seen him turned “off”. On our walk in August, he told me how his 20-year-old son Jimmy, now at university in London, complained in the run-up to the 2010 election that driving anywhere together took ages because Burnham was always too courteous to other cars. “I was flashing my lights at someone, saying, ‘You first,’ and he said, ‘Dad, stop election driving.’ The kids roll their eyes if they ever come shopping with me.”
Unlike many MPs, Burnham has never had to fake his attachment to the areas he represents. Coming back north permanently (he still lives in the mining town of Golborne) was always part of the plan, he says. He never made London his main home, “despite being told by so many people in Westminster, ‘You’ve got to base your family down here.’” He says that when he met his wife, Dutch marketeer and brand strategist Marie-France van Heel, he told her: “Don’t stay with me if you want to live in London, because I won’t be doing that.” *** Andy Burnham’s job has only existed since May 2017. He can thank George Osborne for it: in 2014, the then-chancellor declared a new dawn of devolution in what came to be known as his “northern powerhouse” speech, delivered at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum. Osborne said he wanted to make the cities of the north “a powerhouse for our economy again – with new transport and science, and powerful city governance”. I rolled my eyes at the time, 18 months into my tenure in the north. The Guardian was founded in Manchester in 1821, in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre, but I was by then the last reporter in the paper’s original home. Washington DC and New York felt far more important to the national media than Leeds or Newcastle. To some, my job looked like a punishment posting. Before taking it, I had been on track to become a foreign correspondent, having done stints in Berlin and Delhi. Truth be told, it did not feel like a promotion. But I was fed up with living in a one-bedroom flat with no garden, and as a Lancastrian felt strongly that my home region was poorly served by an almost exclusively London-based media. (The Guardian now has five Manchester-based reporters.) I didn’t take Osborne’s northern powerhouse idea seriously at first. My spellchecker found the phrase as ridiculous as I did, defaulting to “northern powerhose”. And whatever he says now, Burnham was not an early convert to devolution, either. He was shadow health secretary when Osborne began negotiating a deal with Greater Manchester – one that would see the region entrusted with limited spending and decision-making powers, in return for the imposition of a mayor. It was far from a universally popular idea, particularly among the region’s existing 10 council leaders. Osborne loved the idea of mayors, believing they had the power to transcend traditional party politics. Burnham was less convinced. He was particularly incensed when Greater Manchester started negotiations to devolve health and social care from Whitehall. “He was genuinely furious,” remembers a colleague: “He kept saying, ‘This isn’t national Labour policy,’ and, ‘This is denationalisation of the National Health Service, and we can’t have it.’” In 2015, Burnham was the early favourite in the ballot to succeed Ed Miliband as leader of the Labour party. But after many of his supporters decided to lend Jeremy Corbyn their vote, in a somewhat patronising bid to “get the left on the ballot”, Burnham finished a very distant second, winning just 19% of first preference votes to Corbyn’s 59.5%. It had been his second stab at the top job; his 2010 leadership campaign, which vowed to listen to Labour voters’ concerns about immigration, was dismissed as dog-whistle racism. (Not unrelatedly, his former constituency of Leigh is now represented by a Brexiter and a Tory, for the first time in its 135-year-history.) I followed Burnham around quite a bit on that 2015 leadership campaign. I even met his parents at their bungalow in Culcheth, four miles from his family home. Burnham was late, so his mother, Eileen, offered me a bacon butty, while his older brother, Nick, a headteacher, and their father, Roy, watched cricket in the spare room. I felt immediately at home. The senior Burnhams operate the sort of open house where anyone who knows their three boys, or their eight grandchildren, is immediately offered a brew. Eileen is the boss, with a Judi Dench white crop and pearl earrings; Roy, a retired telecoms engineer, is a little quieter and more scouse, with a full, dark head of hair well into his 70s. When Burnham arrived, he seemed unperturbed to find I had made myself comfy on the sofa. We already went back a fair way. Burnham first phoned me, out of the blue, in December 2009, when I was a junior reporter in London. He’d noticed I had been writing about international child abduction and wanted to tell me about one of his constituents, Sarah Taylor, whose six-year-old daughter, Nadia, had been taken by her father to Libya. Burnham had just been promoted to health secretary. I was impressed by the lengths to which he had gone to bring Nadia back to Leigh, using his own money to buy a plane ticket to Tripoli to personally plead with Muammar Gaddafi’s government. I put him in my “good egg” basket. Months before that, as Labour’s culture secretary, he’d had the guts to go to Anfield and tell thousands of Liverpool fans that the government accepted there had been an injustice at Hillsborough. All the same, I wasn’t convinced by his leadership bid. Sitting in his parents’ back room, he hammered away at his theory that the Labour party was too London-centric: Westminster bubble this, Whitehall that… I remember pointing out that, although he was born in Liverpool and went to a state school in the north-west, he had spent almost his entire working life in London-based politics. After graduating from Cambridge, he had started out as a researcher for Tessa Jowell, going on to become a spad (special adviser) for the then culture secretary, Chris Smith. Now, he seemed to be trying too hard to play a typical northern bloke. Asked by Mumsnet that year to name his favourite biscuit, he replied: “I don’t have a sweet tooth and don’t eat biscuits. But give me a beer and chips and gravy any day…” It wasn’t that he was putting it on; he was just over-egging the pudding. Perhaps his biggest flaw is an overriding need to be liked, which can force him to be too many different things to too many different people. I listen to his weekly Radio Manchester phone-in, and he agrees with almost everyone – though not the chap from Rochdale who suggested it was time for him to resign, because he was no longer “flavour of the month” with people down in “that there London”.
He now positions himself on the left of the party, but as health minister Burnham defended the Labour government’s use of PFIs (private finance initiatives), which have saddled hospitals across Greater Manchester and beyond with crippling loans. But if his views have evolved, so what, shrugs Jamie Reed, the former MP for Copeland in Cumbria, who served in Burnham’s shadow health department: “It’s a pretty old-fashioned view of politics to say that people shouldn’t change their minds.” Burnham wasn’t focused on the geographic imbalance in government when he was working for Blair and Brown, Reed concedes. But by 2010, when Labour was back in opposition, it was a genuine concern. The pair used to talk about the London-centric nature of British politics, and the cultural divide that had opened up between the Labour party and their traditional voters in rugby league towns like Leigh and Whitehaven, where Reed lives. “There wasn’t a massive amount of interest in the way power was centralised in the UK, in the way that there is now, and Andy was sincere in his criticisms of it,” he says. Despite these contradictions, Burnham stormed to victory in the inaugural Greater Manchester mayoral elections by promising to end rough sleeping and improve transport, winning 63% of the vote. He immediately signalled his independence from the Labour leadership by shunning a photocall with Corbyn that night, preferring to celebrate with his family. An army of young Corbynistas had been summoned for the picture, and waited awkwardly for half an hour until someone noticed that Burnham’s team had posted a photo on Twitter of him getting stuck into some bubbly. While Corbyn battled with his parliamentary party and a hostile media, Burnham forged his own path. Three years into the job, he had almost halved rough sleeping in the area, encouraging local celebrities such as Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany to dig deep into their own pockets. He has led by example, donating 15% of his own £110,000 salary to his homelessness fund each year, and going out regularly at dawn to help count the number of people asleep on the streets.
Burnham treats the job like a ministerial position, spending all day in meetings and taking a dispatch box home to work late into the night. If he has an evening off, he goes to gigs (his last was local heroes the Courteeners in February). He says he always comes away better informed. “I pick up straws in the wind when I’m at a gig, and someone comes over and says, ‘Know what, have you not thought about X?’ The style of politics I have more and more enjoyed is just being out and about, and letting people come and chat to me, rather than the Westminster thing.” David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, has been a Burnham supporter from the start, plucking him from the 2001 parliamentary intake to become his private secretary, and chipping in to fund both his leadership bids. “I thought he had incredible potential. He thinks deeply and agonises over whether he’s really representing the people and the causes he cares about,” Blunkett explains. And so what if he used to be a Westminster animal? “The real test is whether you have lost touch with your roots. Do people feel you belong to them, and they belong to you?”
After his government standoff, Burnham was widely feted as a hero in Manchester, with pubs putting up signs to offer him free pints before they were forced to close, and one selling Burnham burgers (multiple tiers of fillings). I sometimes wondered what Keir Starmer made of it all, plugging away in the Commons in his forensic way while Burnham hogged the spotlight. Burnham says the two are friends, but stresses, “I don’t toe a line. I do what I think is right for Greater Manchester.” On our summer walk, he admitted he had voted Starmer for the leadership, rather than Lisa Nandy, his fellow Wigan MP. “Keir is a brilliant man. The fact he was a former DPP [director of public prosecutions], and came to work in my shadow Home Office team with no airs and graces says a lot about Keir Starmer,” he says. It probably suits Starmer to have Burnham leading from the heart, while he leads from the head. The two complement each other, often saying the same thing but in very different ways. Before the pandemic hit, I had started working on a project in Leigh. I wanted to find out why voters had turned their backs on Labour since Burnham relinquished the seat in 2017, and what it would take for the party to win it back. The new Tory voters I met still spoke fondly of Burnham, whether he had visited their school or hospital, or joined in at the bingo. They just hated Corbyn for a whole cocktail of reasons. The Leythers (as those from Leigh call themselves) seemed to be enjoying the attention, and it felt good for me, too, having a reporting patch that was now of national interest. This had been building for a few years, after the Brexit result awoke a flurry of interest in the “left-behind areas” of the north and east. When someone came up with the idea of referring to the longtime Labour seats facing Tory challengers as a semi-mythical “red wall”, I started to get calls from the BBC asking me to tell them how things looked “from the north”. I did my best not to sound like a fraud as I gave a two-minute soundbite on behalf of 14 million people. Ultimately, though, political journalism still sees everything through a Westminster lens. For many with a lobby pass, the big question is not how we devolve more power to mayors, and allow cities and regions to control their own destinies, but whether Burnham would ever go back to Westminster and try to become the first prime minister with a northern accent since Huddersfield’s Harold Wilson in the 1970s. After all, the Leigh constituency party has not yet chosen its candidate for the next general election. Burnham insists he doesn’t fancy it, telling Radio Manchester after the Bridgewater Hall standoff that he thought being mayor of Greater Manchester would probably be his “last job in politics”. But on our walk in Leigh two months earlier, I had asked him if he still wanted to be prime minister, and he said: “There’s no point me saying no, because I have tried to lead the Labour party in the past, and therefore I wanted to be prime minister.”
Blunkett thinks Burnham has moved on from Westminster, and that his next role is to “unite the north”, and force Labour to think seriously about redistributing power. Burnham agrees. He is unrepentant about the stand he took, noting that the government has since promised everything he asked for, and more. Two days after the talks collapsed, Rishi Sunak announced he would, after all, be compensating businesses in Greater Manchester and other parts of the north that had suffered since local lockdowns were enforced. And 11 days later, Johnson declared a month-long national lockdown, together with a promise to extend furlough at 80% of wages, as Burnham had demanded. For the mayor, now is the time for the government to come good on its commitment to “level up” – the phrase used by Johnson in his rebranding of Osborne’s northern powerhouse. “This is the moment really to see: is devolution real or is it not? If we are going to have a form of devolution where everyone is having to bite their tongue, that isn’t devolution, is it? That’s everyone bowing down before Westminster, and being grateful for whatever they give us… The frustrations felt by people outside London really needed to be vocalised by somebody, and I just don’t think MPs will ever be those people.” Will he continue to be the lightning conductor for resentments that seem likely to play out for years to come? He must be the likeliest contender. The way this government has treated my part of the world during this crisis will not be quickly forgotten. The north remembers. • This article was amended on 16 November 2020 to correct the collective noun for people from Leigh to “Leythers”, and to add text stating that the Guardian now has five Manchester-based reporters."

“PM’s team torn apart by Feud” says the i, which adds that Johnson had lost patience with his “controversial adviser”.
The Guardian declares the “End of Cummings era”.
The Telegraph says “Cummings exits No10 with parting shot at PM” – that being a claim the Barnard Castle enthusiast and his circle had begun briefing against Johnson and accusing him of “dithering”.

2020-11-14T06:32:22Z,politics,Politics,'Most of us are sick of the attention': Barnard Castle residents on the end of the Cummings era,"The legacy of Dominic Cummings is clear to see in the town of Barnard Castle – if you have good eyesight – with locally branded eye test posters on sale in shops dotted along the pretty market square. The County Durham town found itself at the heart of the story when Boris Johnson’s senior adviser finally confessed to making a lockdown-busting trip there “to test his eyesight” after suffering from suspected Covid-19 in April. On the high street, locals have grown used to directing tourists to the town’s Specsavers, where they pose for a selfie before heading to the Welcome to Barnard Castle sign (which some say benefited from a spruce up amid the national attention). “I think most people in Barnard Castle are sick of the negative attention,” said Trevor Brookes, editor of the 166-year-old Teesdale Mercury, on Friday following news of Cummings’ resignation. “Most people have grown weary of the negative attention, although there have been reports of more visitors.” Cummings’ lockdown voyages led global news bulletins when they were revealed in May but only merited a small mention on the front of the Teesdale Mercury, beneath a story about an upgrade to the A66. The weekly paper, whose newsroom of five journalists sits above a newsagent in the market square, is owned by the aristocratic Vane family who live in a medieval castle nearby.
“He’s the laugh of the place – he’s a great joke,” said Vivian Guy, 65, a retired nurse, who welcomed Cummings’ resignation – “the sooner the better”. “He got away with it because he’s one of Boris’s cronies.” Not everyone is keen to see the back of the prime minister’s aide. Ian Kirkbride, a town councillor, told the Guardian he had written to Cummings inviting him to switch on the town’s Christmas lights. “I was looking for a celebrity and it occurred to me as a bit of black humour. It didn’t work.” (Cummings has not responded to the invite.) While many have enjoyed seeing “Barney” in the news, the joke is wearing thin. Pauline Connelly, 55, the owner of Connelly’s Toyshop, has lost her father and one of her oldest friends, aged 56, to Covid-19. Her father, who had underlying health conditions, was in a care home so she was unable to see him for 14 weeks before he died.
“My dad was already unwell but the nature of not being able to see him for 14 weeks, whereas before I saw him once or twice a day. We had FaceTime but that’s not the same,” she said, growing close to tears. That, she said, was what made Cummings’ lockdown trips difficult to stomach. “You can’t have one rule for one and one for the others. He didn’t have the guts to go but Boris should’ve got rid of him.” Outside the toy shop, a 76-year-old woman who did not want to give her name said she was cross with Cummings for the lockdown trips and for getting away with not paying council tax on a family property in Durham. But, she said, it would not stop her from voting for the Conservatives: “It wouldn’t make a bugger of difference.”
At Artisan Corner, a Barnard Castle eye test hangs on the wall alongside craft beers, sourdough bread and posh chutney. The owner, Robert Dunbar, 62, said he was happy to oblige the influx of tourists and hoped that they would return long after Cummings had left Downing Street. “He shouldn’t have come in the first place – no man in his right mind throws his kids in the car when his eyes aren’t right – but it has been good for the town,” he said. “We do pander to it a bit and we’re not too proud to turn those people away, no matter which way you lean.” Alan Gowland, 62, a Conservative-voting former GlaxoSmithKline engineer who spoke publicly after spotting Cummings in nearby woods, said on Friday: “He shouldn’t have been in Barnard Castle. Should he have gone earlier? He’s a very clever man. He’s the brains behind Boris. If he’s packing it in, where do the Tories go from here?” That is the big question."

2020-11-13T23:18:47Z,politics,Politics,"PM accused Dominic Cummings of briefing against him, sources claim","Boris Johnson accused Dominic Cummings of briefing against him and Carrie Symonds, his fiancee, during a tense 45-minute showdown before the adviser’s departure, according to sources. The prime minister’s senior adviser left Downing Street with his belongings in a cardboard box on Friday evening. Lee Cain, Downing Street’s director of communications, was also told to leave.
Johnson held a meeting with Cummings and Cain to discuss their “general behaviour” where he is understood to have accused his aides of briefing against him and his partner. The prime minister also accused the pair of destabilising the government in the midst of Brexit negotiations ahead of a crucial phase in talks in Brussels next week, the Financial Times reported. Government sources have denied the fractious talks took place. Cummings told the Telegraph that claims the prime minister had accused him of briefing against him as “an invention” and said: “We had a laugh together.” However, the tenor of Cummings’ dramatic ousting by Johnson will raise fears that the adviser may not display the discretion expected of a former aide. A government insider told the FT: “I won’t be surprised if there’s an explosive stunt between now and Christmas.” A colleague of Cummings said: “It’s not Dom’s style just to quietly drift away.” Conservative officials said Cummings and Cain would continue to be employed by No 10 until mid-December but were expected to work from home. Cummings’ “work from home” project is expected to focus on Covid-19 mass testing for the next six weeks.
Cummings’ theatrical exit on Friday through the No 10 black door, having formally resigned on Thursday, came despite his office being at 70 Whitehall. Downing Street said that Cummings’ departure would not impact Brexit talks. The prime minister’s official spokesman, James Slack, insisted suggestions the government could compromise on key principles in the wake of Cummings’s decision to leave were “simply false”. Cummings was widely perceived as the mastermind behind the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Sources told the Daily Telegraph that Cummings told allies that the prime minister was “indecisive” and that he and Cain had to rely on Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, for leadership. Johnson’s allies accused Cummings of “trying to blame everyone but himself”."
2020-11-13T19:06:23Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson boots out top adviser Dominic Cummings,"Boris Johnson has ordered Dominic Cummings to leave Downing Street with immediate effect, in a dramatic end to a tumultuous era which leaves a void at the heart of Downing Street. Cummings and his ally Lee Cain – both ardent Brexiters blamed by MPs for a macho culture and a series of communications crises – were asked to step down on Friday instead of staying in place until Christmas. One source said the prime minister told Cummings to go following accusations he had briefed against Johnson. Special advisers were said to be delighted by his departure. The prime minister was immediately urged to appoint an MP as his permanent chief of staff to help heal deep divisions with backbenchers amid warnings that his parliamentary party risked becoming ungovernable. Sir Edward Lister, Johnson’s chief strategic adviser, would become interim chief of staff until there was a permanent appointment, No 10 said. Cummings and Cain will continue to work for Downing Street until mid-December, with one source saying Cummings would be “working from home for six weeks”. The turmoil comes in the middle of a pandemic whose official UK death toll surpassed 50,000 this week, and days from a looming Brexit deal deadline.
On Friday morning it was confirmed that Cummings was planning to leave by the end of the year following a bitter row over his close ally Cain. Cain’s promotion from head of communications to chief of staff was blocked by Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and other staffers this week, leading him to quit. But soon after 5pm, government sources said Cummings had left his post with immediate effect following a discussion with the prime minister. He was filmed leaving through No 10’s famous black door brandishing a large cardboard storage box. His exit came after 16 months when Cummings rose to become perhaps the most high-profile and notorious adviser of recent times in UK politics. Five months ago Johnson was accused of wasting enormous political capital in refusing to sack Cummings for travelling from London to Durham in lockdown – as exclusively revealed by the Guardian and Daily Mirror – causing a headache for MPs who were bombarded with constituents’ angry protests. On Friday night backbench MPs said a full reset was now needed to get a handle on the government operation, which has been left in tatters less than a year after Johnson won a resounding victory in the general election. Sources close to Johnson’s new press secretary claimed the departure of two of the prime minister’s closest aides marked a fresh direction for Downing Street and a reset of its chaotic communications strategy. Allies of Allegra Stratton, the former ITV journalist and Treasury adviser who will be the face of government TV briefings, said she had fought “a lonely battle” against Cain before he quit on Wednesday. Stratton is understood to have objected to Cain’s approach, arguing he wanted to cut journalists out of proceedings, making the briefings “cosmetic and pointless”. A Whitehall source said: “Cummings was not planning to go in this abrupt manner, but he was planning to go [at some point]. He had made that clear to several people in No 10 over several months.” One former official echoed this: “I think it was always predictable that there would be a big bust-up and Dom would leave. He’s done that in most jobs he’s been in.” Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said Cummings was leaving because both the mass testing programme and Brexit were “on the near-term horizon now”. He told Sky News: “He will be missed, but then again we’re moving into a different phase.” Conservative MPs have almost unanimously cheered the news, and are pressuring No 10 to use the departure to restructure Downing Street, with a well-respected and organised chief of staff at the heart of things. Sajid Javid, the former chancellor who quit in anger at Cummings, was being touted as a potential new chief of staff. “It has been made plain to the PM that there will have to be major changes,” one senior backbencher said. “I want to see an MP as chief of staff and a second-to-none political operation which stops walking into traps laid by Labour. We [also] need a parliamentary relations unit to transform relations with MPs.” However, a Labour source said: “The prime minister can rearrange the deckchairs in the Nasa-style command centre all he wants – the fact there is no plan and no focus in the government’s response to Covid is entirely down to him.” Another Tory backbencher said some new MPs had not had an opportunity to get to know Johnson or No 10 and were already beginning to abstain or vote against the government. “They have spiralled off into orbit, and if the party isn’t careful, they will become serial rebels, never to be seen again,” they said. “Because of coronavirus, they have not been able to attend parties and functions with the PM and see his good side. They need to be shown some love and attention by Boris, he has to let them know that he needs them on board, and show us all the old campaigning Boris instead of the new, tired, depressed Boris.” Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, welcomed what she called “a good opportunity for a fresh start”. She said: “Clearly there are concerns about the dismissive attitude sometimes shown by Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings towards people in government and MPs on the backbenches. This is an opportunity to move on from that and to have a more collaborative approach.” Sir Bernard Jenkin, the senior Tory backbencher who chairs the Commons liaison committee, which scrutinises the work of government, said there was a chance to restore “respect, integrity and trust” between No 10 and Tory MPs. “It’s an opportunity to reset how the government operates and to emphasise some values about what we want to project as a Conservative party in government,” he said. The exit of Cummings and Cain marks the end of an apparent internal hegemony of Vote Leave alumni and their supporters. There had been predictions that another key Downing Street adviser, Oliver Lewis, could also resign, and even Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost. But one ally said they did not expect any more departures: “I think people took a deep breath and decided to get on with it.” They said the atmosphere inside Downing Street had soured amid the intense pressures of Covid and Brexit: “These things would test the most stable of relationships. It’s a weird world where you’re basically arguing with each other via WhatsApps to journalists to print in newspapers, rather than just sitting in a room.”
A number of Tory MPs have been openly scornful about the eruption of infighting during such a difficult period for the country, with the government beset by a series of policy U-turns. A YouGov poll earlier this week had Labour ahead by five points and Johnson’s approval ratings slumping, with 34% approving of his performance but 59% disapproving. One former adviser said Johnson faced a crucial decision about who to appoint as chief of staff: “The important thing is restoring a sense of order. Boris always outsources a sense of grip and direction to key lieutenants. Until we know who that is, it’s difficult to say how it will work.” But a former Downing Street staffer warned that MPs expecting a permanent shift towards more collaboration with backbenchers would be left disappointed. “The contempt for MPs does not come from Dominic Cummings,” they said, “he’s just a harder version of the smiling frontman. The basic contempt comes from Boris Johnson. This is not a guy who does the Commons tearooms, who fraternises with fellow MPs. This is a guy who gets blown around by whatever storm; he has no political compass. “Cummings was his ultimate human shield, the lightning conductor for all the hostility from Whitehall and politicians but it is Johnson’s leadership that is the problem. He is an outsider, a personality. There’s very little seen of him building a support base within the party.”"
2020-11-13T18:29:37Z,politics,Politics,The going of Cummings seems not to be the triumph he expected,"The usual maxim for political advisers is a simple one: you go when you become the story. For Dominic Cummings, inevitably, the rules are a little different. During the Barnard Castle affair, in the face of popular disgust and days of disastrous headlines, he clung on to his job. Until Friday night, that is. Now somebody else will become Boris Johnson’s best known adviser. Uncharacteristically for Downing Street press briefings, the source for this news had a name. “My position hasn’t changed since my January blog,” Cummings told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Thursday night, referring to the lengthy online post in which he said that he intended to be “largely redundant” within a year. But while his leaving may technically adhere to that declaration, it could hardly be said to follow its spirit. The condition of his redundancy, as he explained it then, was nothing less than a transformation in how Downing Street works, a revolutionary replacement of stuffed shirts and mandarins with “weirdos and misfits”. That change would simply free him up to focus on the decisions that lay within his “circle of competence”, not quit altogether. Instead, coronavirus happened. And the inciting incident for Cummings’ exit appears to be not his own triumph – but the arrival of a new press secretary. “He’s nowhere near done,” said Jill Rutter, senior fellow at the Institute of Government. “Yes, he’s chopped off the heads of quite a few civil servants, but he’s replaced them with fairly conventional people, by and large. And if you want to be a serious government reformer, you don’t go after a year. Even if you’ve planted the seeds, you don’t know if anybody else is going to water them.”
Those who are sceptical that Cummings was ready to go point to the fact that he only took up his place in a grandly titled “mission control” centre in the Cabinet Office in September. “It hardly seems plausible to suggest that the aim was to set up the office and barely sit in it,” one former minister said. Many backbenchers are pleased to see Cummings leave – with the 1922 Committee vice-chair Charles Walker telling the BBC: “There has been unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time. Members of parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that’s no secret.” But the former minister expressed dismay at the fact that Boris Johnson had stood by his man after the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed in May that he had broken lockdown guidelines to visit his parents in Durham – only for Cummings to leave within six months regardless. In the aftermath of that story, confidence in the government in England plummeted, a major Lancet study found. Senior police leaders reported that those breaking lockdown would often cite Cummings when confronted by officers. “To think of the bridges burned and the damage done in the service of keeping this one rather brutal individual in a job, and to think that he is now leaving anyway, is just astonishing,” the former minister said. “It confirms what we have known for a long time: Boris only knows what he wants to do for the next 10 minutes. There is no serious plan.” Other have noted that the abrasive approach Cummings has exulted in – and the accompanying lack of alliances outside of his closest circle – may have finally cost him. As the backbencher Andrew Bridgen said earlier this year: “They say if you want a friend in politics, get a dog – well, Cummings would kick the dog as well.”
James Graham, author of the Channel 4 drama Brexit: the Uncivil War, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Cummings and arguably cemented him in the public imagination, suggested that his subject might have met the limits of his ruthless style. “He’s a curious mix politically of the sophisticated and the thuggish, which I think is what Benedict tried to play,” he said in an email. “Winning a campaign that has a start and an end point is one thing. A campaign is a fight. But government can’t be a constant fight … I suspect against the backdrop of a pandemic, the party, and even the public’s appetite for politics that divides and provokes rather than unites and soothes has worn increasingly thin.” The events that finally forced Cummings out are more office politics than ideological struggle. They began with the appointment of Allegra Stratton as the prime minister’s new press secretary. They accelerated as a move to install Cummings’ ally Lee Cain to a new position as No 10 chief of staff was thwarted, apparently at the behest of Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds – a sequence of events that ended in Cain’s departure. Stratton is said to have advocated a less confrontational style in dealing with the press than the venomous off-the-record briefings which have been the norm in the Cummings-Cain era – and is expected to demand a direct route to the prime minister, rather than working through his senior advisers. Johnson, for his part, also wants to turn the page on the “culture war” that has become his government’s dominant mode of engagement on subjects other than the pandemic. “[Cain and Cummings’] downfall was their failure to work through a pretty easy piece of logic that if you appoint somebody to be the prime minister’s public face, they will require a lot of access to the prime minister,” said Rutter. “Nobody taking that job would put their reputation on the line repeating whispers permeating through a couple of layers of people who do get access – and if you couldn’t see that coming you are nuts.”
A former adviser to Theresa May argued that Cummings’ style had built “high-functioning and loyal” units throughout his campaigning career, and that “sometimes you can build really strong teams by doing that Alex Ferguson ‘us against the world’ thing”. But, they added, “maybe part of the reason he’s going is that he can see that that is beginning to fracture”. The adviser said that a confrontational approach “can work in a campaign, but in the daily grind of government, you’re bound to need quite a transactional relationship with the media”. And with MPs widely celebrating the news of Cummings’ exit, they added drily: “[The minority May government] was always going to have problems with party management. What is interesting, without any schadenfreude, is that they are having some of the same problems with a majority of 80.” If his redundancy does mark the end of his career on the political frontline, “nobody can doubt that Cummings has been consequential”, said Polly Mackenzie, chief executive of the thinktank Demos and director of policy for Nick Clegg during the coalition. Few dispute that “Take Back Control” and “Get Brexit Done” were among the most ruthlessly effective political slogans of the era, and, as a campaign mastermind, even Cummings’ opponents view him with grudging respect. “The reality is that he was extremely effective persuading people to vote leave,” Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s director of communications, told the BBC. “He was also extremely effective in the last election, there are real achievements to him.” But, said Mackenzie: “He’s just not suited to government, and the enormous complexity of the centre of it, where you have to keep 93,000 plates spinning. There is a place for mavericks, and they’re completely essential. But Dominic is just wrong about what that place is.” Cummings could also be contrasted to the model set out by Mario Cuomo, governor of New York from 1983 to 1994, who said that “you campaign in poetry; you govern in prose”. It is one of the idiosyncrasies of Cummings that he campaigned in three-word slogans, and governed in lengthy blogposts that almost nobody could understand.
As Graham said: “He can write a 5,000-word thesis on the applicability of the Apollo space programme to civil service reform, and yet this is the also the author of ‘Get Brexit Done’ – which is the rhetorical equivalent of a shrug and middle finger.” With his revolution unfinished, and the special advisers who were once told “I’ll see half of you next week” now able to dream of a calmer working environment, the question of Cummings’ legacy remains open. “It will depend on the prime minister,” said Rutter. “How much of this was [Cummings’] agenda, and how much of it was Boris Johnson’s? Or did this all just hang on Cummings’ sheer personal chutzpah?” If the answer to that question is yes, his time in government may soon seem more like a blip than a rupture. That outcome would mean the unlikeliest epitaph of all: in the end, Dominic Cummings was just another adviser."
2020-11-13T18:27:05Z,politics,Politics,End of macho era: what to expect now Dominic Cummings has gone,"Out will go open hostility towards journalists, centralised power around Boris Johnson’s office and the ruthless dispatch of those who oppose the prime minister. In, or so it is suggested, will come an attempt to win over the media, a collegiate approach to government and meaningful contact with the parliamentary party. In Whitehall, every spin doctor has a story to tell. And those close to No 10 were insisting there will be a marked change following confirmation that Dominic Cummings has finally left the building. His sudden and theatrical departure on Friday – photographers snapped him carrying boxes out of Downing Street – will undoubtedly create a significant hole in the middle of the No 10 machine.
What has been described as the “Vote Leave model”, which was fashioned around Cummings and his close ally Lee Cain, will leave with them. Their methods – tough messages and discipline, and the sidelining or sacking of ministers and officials who stood in their way – helped them make many enemies around Downing Street and parliament. Those tasked to fill the vacuum are still to be finalised, but they will include James Slack, the prime minister’s official spokesman and the former political editor of the Daily Mail, who is set to take over Cain’s role as director of communications. Recruited by Theresa May, softly-spoken Slack survived the tricky transition to Johnson’s government. He is respected by lobby reporters and No 10 officials, although he continues to be vilified on social media for writing the Daily Mail article about judges that appeared beneath Paul Dacre’s notorious “enemies of the people” headline. Allegra Stratton, a former ITN, BBC and Guardian journalist, has joined No 10 to front the new daily televised press briefings, and will be influential in defining Downing Street’s attempts to win over the media. Her appointment was said to have sparked the decision by Cain to threaten to resign, after she was employed above his head, and it was made clear that she would only answer to the prime minister. Sources have confirmed that Stratton and Cain clashed over how to handle the White House-style briefings, with Stratton insisting that they had to be seen to attempt to answer queries and be seen to be open to questions. Friends of Stratton said she has had to mount a “lonely battle” against Cain’s ideas, which cut journalists out of the proceedings. “It would have been cosmetic and pointless,” the friend said. It remains to be seen what role Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, will play in the new operation. Sources have claimed that she persuaded Johnson to let go of his Vote Leave allies, Cummings and Cain. She blames them for isolating him from his own MPs, turning the media against the government and for overseeing a series of missteps on the Covid-19 pandemic. Her role in the future refashioning of No 10 is an intriguing one. Former Vote Leave advisers claimed that she could cement her position as a significant force. “She has moved the PM’s political position on several occasions,” said one. Few inside government doubt a change is urgently required. Ministers and MPs have become exasperated by a series of U-turns around the managing of the coronavirus pandemic: on NHS staff visa charges, MPs’ voting procedures, school openings and the failure to build an effective £12bn test-and-trace app. Perhaps most damaging, the free schools meals fiasco forced MPs to make climbdowns following a campaign led by the footballer Marcus Rashford and an intervention by the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer. Conservative commentators blame an over-centralisation of power as one of the reasons for avoidable scandals and gaffes. But will this trend be reversed? And will other changes be anything more than cosmetic? Fraser Nelson, the Spectator’s editor, wrote that there could be a return to a cabinet-led government, with a restoration of powers to secretaries of state. “Attempts to suck power to the centre always fail: you end up with U-turns and resignations. This means restoring the independence of the Treasury and having power centres in each government department,” he wrote in the Telegraph. Some ministers are also expected to lobby for a return to a system which allows them to recruit and retain their own special advisers. Since Cummings’s intervention in September 2019, the Cabinet Office has required advisers to sign new contracts, which say the responsibility for their conduct and discipline will be jointly held between the appointing minister and the PM’s chief of staff. Conservative MPs say they have been assured there will be greater attempts to bring them closer to the orbit of the prime minister in the new year. One said: “I want to see an MP as chief of staff and a second to none political operation which stops walking into traps laid by Labour. We need a parliamentary relations unit to transform relations with MPs.” Sir Bernard Jenkin, the senior Tory backbencher who chairs the Commons liaison committee, which scrutinises the work of government, said he hoped Cummings’s departure was a chance to restore “respect, integrity and trust” between No 10 and Tory MPs. “I’m not surprised in a way that it is ending in the way it is. No prime minister can afford a single adviser to become a running story, dominating his government’s communications and crowding out the proper messages the government wants to convey. Nobody is indispensable,” he told the BBC. On Friday morning, Cummings was expected to stay until Christmas. By Friday afternoon, he had gone. Before the last twist in this drama, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told Sky News: “He will be missed, but then again we’re moving into a different phase.”"
2020-11-13T16:47:00Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street denies internal crisis has harmed Brexit talks,"Downing Street has been forced to deny Boris Johnson has lost control of the Brexit negotiations as French ministers warn of weeks more talks amid “upheaval” in London, and senior Brussels figures claim the chaos had led to a standstill. France’s minister for EU affairs, Clément Beaune, appeared downbeat on Friday about the chances of an imminent breakthrough on a UK-EU deal. There has been scant progress in the last week of the trade and security talks, while No 10 has been shaken by infighting that led to the news that Dominic Cummings would quit as the prime minister’s chief adviser. Beaune said: “We have never set a fixed, scientific deadline for an agreement to be reached, but objectively, rationally, if it happens after the end of November we will be in trouble. “I think a deal is possible; both parties want one. It will require several days, possibly two to three more weeks, of negotiation.” He said of the Downing Street fallout: “This is not the first such development. We have watched all such upheavals over the past four years with interest, but for us a Brexit deal can never be allowed to depend on the vicissitudes of what’s going on in London. “We have to remain calm, courteous but also determined – so we watch, with interest of course, but as people and as politicians, not as negotiators.” Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest party in the European parliament and a political ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also lamented the “chaotic situation” in No 10. He said: “We can see this as a quite chaotic situation where we don’t have an idea what is really the line in Great Britain. So don’t tell us we should be ready for compromise. “We need a clear idea from Boris Johnson now and I think it’s now time for leadership – having all the developments in America in mind, where London understood it will be not so easy with Joe Biden [as US president-elect] to achieve an easy trade deal now. “It’s time to take over responsibility and come to a common understanding. Britain has red lines, we have red lines, let’s now come to a compromise.” Downing Street responded by insisting that the British negotiating team, led by David Frost, had been unaffected by the recent developments. A UK official said: “David and the team are completely focused on the negotiations. The prime minister has been clear that he wants a deal if there is a deal to be done. We’ve been negotiating constructively and with creativity. “I guess the reason the EU feel the need to say these sorts of things is that they are starting to realise that we meant it when we said there were fundamental principles from which we couldn’t move. We need to see some realism and creativity from their side if we are to bridge the significant gaps that remain.” Brussels had hoped the outlines of a deal could be put before EU leaders at a summit on Thursday but the stasis on the most contentious issues, and the apparent chaos in Downing Street, has prompted anxiety. Sources have warned of a lack of engagement for days from No 10 on the EU’s demands for “level playing field” provisions that will ensure neither side can achieve a competitive advantage through lowering regulatory standards over time or subsidising failing businesses. Cummings, the former campaign director for Vote Leave, confirmed on Thursday evening that he would leave Downing Street by Christmas. However, on Friday night he left with immediate effect. It followed the resignation of Lee Cain, Johnson’s director of communications, who quit after being offered the job of chief of staff by the prime minister before having it rescinded following pressure from people including Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds. Cummings has dismissed as “comical” claims that a dispute over how to manage the final phase of the Brexit negotiations was to blame for the crisis in Downing Street. There have, however, been concerns raised in the past by EU officials and diplomats that the prime minister was being “held captive” by former Vote Leave members. One senior EU diplomat said Cummings’ departure offered hope that the UK government’s resistance to agreement with the EU on a future domestic subsidy regime might slacken. “His flawed concept of state aid has held the negotiation hostage,” the diplomat said. Cummings has championed the UK’s future ability to subsidise the tech industry as a major Brexit dividend. Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said he believed Cummings’ departure was “probably the sign that Johnson has begun his U-turn and will, in the end, accept EU conditions”. A Downing Street spokesman denied the claim. “Absolutely not – simply false,” the spokesperson said. “The government’s position in relation to the future trade agreement negotiations hasn’t changed.” The EU negotiating team will leave London on Friday and re-engage with their UK counterparts in Brussels on Monday."
2020-11-13T15:08:46Z,politics,Politics,What has Dominic Cummings actually achieved in No 10?,"Dominic Cummings arrived in Downing Street with big plans, and the stated intention to only stay long enough to get them rolling. So what has Boris Johnson’s chief adviser and policy touchstone actually achieved? Reforming the civil service Perhaps Cummings’ most resonant quote from No 10 – albeit delivered at second hand – was the idea of a “hard rain” landing on complacent civil servants. Revolutionising a hugely complex organisation of more than 400,000 people was never going to be simple, especially within a year of a pandemic. The main changes have been at the top, with a series of permanent secretaries – the lead official in a department – being ousted, along with Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. Verdict: not achieved. Centralising authority in Downing Street Many of the Conservative MPs who cheered the news of Cummings’ departure in the hope it will result in a more open No 10 would certainly agree this has happened. Much of the tighter grip has been based on centralising advisers, all of whom had to report to Cummings, an innovation that led to Sajid Javid resignation as chancellor. Given this revamped operation has presided over a series of mishaps and U-turns, whether it can be deemed a success, or will last, is another matter. Verdict: yes, but at a cost – and could be reversed by a successor. A data-led government Another obsession of Cummings, who – while a history graduate – is known for lamenting the grip of dilettante generalists on government. In an unusual recruitment drive, Cummings used his personal blog in January to appeal for data scientists and other “assorted weirdos” to sign up. Government data is yet another area brought into No 10 under Cummings, and in July it advertised for a data expert to set up a largely autonomous data “skunkworks”. Verdict: some change achieved. Finalise Brexit As one of several Vote Leave veterans inside No 10, Cummings had arguably less direct impact here than in other areas, instead being more part of a consensus. It is fair to say that his presence helped keep Johnson’s feet to the fire in terms of threatening Brussels over a UK walkout without concessions on a trade deal from the EU, even if the PM’s allies argue this would have happened anyway. Could Cummings’ departure see Johnson again achieve a deal by suddenly giving ground but nonetheless claiming a great victory? Perhaps – but then again, this might have happened anyway. Verdict: he has played a role in the UK’s tough Brexit stance Operation Moonshot Allies of Cummings say that the main reason he is staying at No 10 until Christmas is to oversee the rollout of mass coronavirus testing, based around innovative and near-instant tests. The most ambitious iteration of this would see millions of daily tests, meaning that even before the mass rollout of a vaccine, people could be certified Covid-free before going to work, or mass events such as at sports stadiums. A first try-out, in Salford, was some way from being a success, but ministers are more bullish about the new version, kicking off in Liverpool. Verdict: needs work – and could be overtaken by a vaccine. Planning reforms While successive government have talked up the need to liberate planning processes so more homes can be built, they have generally done little. Cummings’ experience illustrates why. A planned change to the system, based on an algorithm to allocate new homes to certain areas, has prompted open revolt among many Tory MPs, who argue the scheme is overly blunt and will dump large numbers of badly-built homes in the wrong places. Nimbyism is ubiquitous in planning matters, but the Cummings proposal has prompted genuine anger, and would very possibly struggle to get through parliament. Verdict: unlikely to happen, as it stands."
2020-11-13T15:00:34Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces bumpy path back to respectability in the White House,"Tommy Vietor, a feisty former spokesman for Barack Obama, made a little news last weekend by describing Boris Johnson as a “shapeshifting creep”. It added fuel to the fire of those who say the UK prime minister is likely to struggle to charm himself into Joe Biden’s inner circle, leaving a shunned UK bobbing uneasily in the mid-Atlantic The global reaction to his remark, Vietor said, was a timely reminder that dumb tweets by washed-up ex-Obama staffers – his own description – can carry greater significance now that Obama’s vice-president is set to move into the White House. “I did not intend to suggest I spoke for Joe Biden, I don’t, but I stand by every word,” he said. “We will never forget his racist words about Barack Obama,” he added, citing Johnson’s claim that Obama had a Churchill statue removed from the White House because he had a Kenyan ancestral hangup about British colonialism. The episode left open the question of to what extent the Biden White House regards Johnson as a “physical and emotional clone” of Donald Trump – Biden’s assessment last year – and whether it will matter. Ben Rhodes, a former Obama national security adviser and now a co-host with Vietor of the Pod Save the World podcast, took a more analytical approach to Johnson’s plight. “At the end of the day, I actually do not think most of the incoming Biden people – certainly Joe Biden – are going to be looking for revenge on Johnson,” he said. However, he added that Johnson did face a problem. “In these Brexit negotiations, the most sensitive issue is Northern Ireland. The Democratic party, and Joe Biden especially, cares a lot about the Northern Ireland accords. Donald Trump could not care less about it, and he was a political ally of Johnson and a huge supporter of Brexit. Johnson is now going to have a US administration that will looking negatively at any efforts to mess around with the Northern Ireland status, so his biggest job [negotiating Brexit] just got harder.” Rhodes said Johnson’s wider challenge was that he is viewed as part of a trend. “Everybody equated Brexit and Trump as one trend, and Joe Biden’s election seems to suggest that the political winds in the west, and globally, hopefully, are shifting against this brand of thuggish rightwing nationalist populism, and that could be problem for him. “If Trump had won, there would have been a sense [that] ‘no, no, the equilibrium has shifted and the future is with these guys like Johnson, Trump, Viktor Orbán and [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan’.” An ex-Obama staffer lumping Johnson along with Erdoğan might seem bizarre, but it also reveals how much ground the prime minister has to make up. It was illustrated when Johnson was caught in a dilemma as his great ally refused to concede defeat. Johnson did not want to desert Trump, but nor could he afford to be behind other leaders in the scramble to congratulate Biden on the clear fact of his victory. In the end, the Foreign Office congratulated Biden but added a reference to “some processes playing out” – a euphemism for Trump’s fruitless quest for evidence of a stolen election. The episode encapsulated Johnson’s awkward metamorphosis. The dog-whistling nativist urgently needed to be replaced by a green multilateralist. Both personas coexist inside Johnson, but faced by Biden, one side urgently needed more foreground. The chaotic staff war inside Downing Street may help Johnson press this particular reset button and turn a new leaf. For many Democrats it was noticeable that immediately after the 2016 election result, Johnson went the extra mile to ingratiate himself with Trump’s advisers. It was on a visit to Trump Tower in New York in January 2017, before the inauguration, that Johnson – then foreign secretary – started his journey to becoming personal friends with Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner and, most controversially, Steve Miller, the combative architect of Trump’s immigration policies. Phone numbers and email addresses were exchanged. Johnson was prevented from meeting Trump himself partly because Theresa May did not trust him.
Miller was evangelical about Trump, describing him as “a political genius that had tapped into something magical in this country”. If Johnson thought this baloney, he did not say so. Some UK diplomats thought it high-risk that Johnson went so all in. “At embassy parties and meetings we were fawning,” one former diplomat said, “yet it was obvious from the start that Trump was not going to be traditional Republican president, and we should have been more cautious before getting so close.” Sir Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador to Washington, observed how “fascinated” Johnson seemed by Trump. He was particularly intrigued, Darroch said, by Trump’s use of language. “The limited vocabulary, the simplicity of the messaging, the disdain for political correctness, the sometimes incendiary imagery, and the at best intermittent relationship with facts and the truth,” he wrote in his autobiography. It is of course the duty of any British foreign secretary to be as close to the US administration as possible, and the Foreign Office also felt under pressure to marginalise Nigel Farage, who at that point was causing mayhem by touting himself as Trump’s true friend in Brexit Britain. But as time wore on and Trump revealed his unsuitability for public office and his disdain for America’s old allies, Johnson did not distance himself. The fawning only grew worse. US notes of a meeting between Johnson and the US ambassador to the UK in August 2017 show Johnson saying that Trump was doing “fantastic stuff” on foreign policy issues such as China, Syria and North Korea. Before Trump’s 2019 state visit, Johnson told Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, that the president was increasingly popular in the UK. Pompeo was quoted as responding: “We’ll put him on a street corner of Piccadilly. He can shake hands with people. That would be great.” Johnson said: “That would be crazy.” This flattery worked as Trump took Johnson under his wing, regarding him as a fellow disruptive force willing to break up the EU protection racket, unlike the over-cautious May. Indeed, the more he cooled on May, the more he warmed to the ebullient Johnson. Quite whether Bannon or Miller truly thought Johnson was “one of them” is not clear. John Bolton for one claimed Johnson had the upper hand. Trump’s former national security adviser said: “I think he’s got a good sense of humour and I had the sense that behind those twinkling eyes he was playing Trump like a fiddle.” Either way, it is hard also to underestimate how across the board the Washington foreign policy elite, led by Biden, are on record as describing Brexit – for which Johnson takes prime responsibility – as a historic error and part of a populist trend that has only benefited the enemies of the west. Hillary Clinton said Brexit “may go down as one of the greatest and most unnecessary self-inflicted wounds in modern history”. A former under-secretary of state, Nicholas Burns, said recently: “Brexit is going to weaken the UK and diminish its standing in the world, and I say that as a friend of the UK.” Tom Donilon, tipped for Biden’s state department, warned at the time of the 2016 referendum that leaving the EU was going to make the UK less powerful, weaker and more isolated, and the only beneficiary was Vladimir Putin. Tony Blinken, Obama’s chief foreign policy adviser, described the Brexit saga thus: “This is not the dog that caught the car. This is the dog that caught the car, then the car goes into reverse and runs over the dog. So many young Brits having the rug pulled out under them.” Julianne Smith, a national security adviser to Biden in Obama’s second term, said Brexit was a crushing blow to European unity and jeopardised the special relationship.
How Johnson handles the Brexit endgame will be critical to his path back to respectability in the White House. Some say Biden, who has the strongest links to Ireland of any president since JFK, would intervene only if the departure destabilises peace on the island of Ireland. Dublin views his commitment as an ace card in Brexit talks. Biden is on first-name terms with leading Irish politicians and turned the sod on a hospice in County Mayo that has a plaque honouring his late son, Beau. He discussed Gaelic football in an early phone call with the taoiseach, Micheál Martin. “Ireland is in a very comfortable position with the new administration,” said Bobby McDonagh, Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009 to 2013. “Biden’s Irishness is significant.” British officials and Biden advisers admit that if the internal market bill goes forward in any form that creates a border between the two Irelands, the issue will dominate US-UK relations for the first months, if not year, of the Biden administration. But if a deal is struck with the EU, there is a good chance for the US-UK relationship to improve quickly, in part because Britain has been fortunate with its timing. It will preside over the UN security council in February, chair the G7 and host the Cop26 climate conference later in the year. Johnson’s call for assembling a group of 10 major democracies, D10, as a new international forum, could also merge with Biden’s stated intention to convene a summit of the world’s democracies. “The UK has, for its own reasons, stumbled into initiatives which seem to run parallel to some of the thinking in the Biden team, which is good,” said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. “Look, I hated Brexit, but I don’t wish the UK ill, for God’s sakes. We’ve got to make the most of it.” The prospects for a US-UK free trade agreement (FTA) in the near term, however, now look bleak. The negotiations were facing serious obstacles, such as agricultural goods, animal welfare and digital taxation, and are now on the backburner until the new administration comes in. Biden has made clear that trade deals will not be a priority as he wrestles with an out-of-control pandemic and its economic consequences. UK negotiators are under no illusions that the sticking points will get any easier. I think those are difficult full stop. It’s difficult no matter who is in the White House, especially as it will be difficult with Congress,” said a source close to the discussions. A trade deal with the US has for Brexiters developed a symbolic status way beyond its actual value to either country. Biden will be less bothered by that than by Johnson’s broader journey, and whether on issues such as China, climate change, Iran, global health and European security, the British have something to contribute. The adults are back in the room and it is up to Johnson to show, somewhat late in life, whether he has the maturity to join them."
2020-11-13T12:15:44Z,politics,Politics,"Cummings 'should have resigned in May', say Barnard Castle witnesses","Those who blew the whistle on Dominic Cummings’ lockdown journeys have said his resignation has come too late and vowed to continue campaigning to hold him to account. Cummings’ family trip to Barnard Castle on his wife’s birthday was first exposed by Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher from the town, after an investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror in May. Lees, who also put in a complaint to the police about the journey, said on Friday: “He should have gone six months ago.” Rosalind Evans, a retired council worker who also reported seeing a man she believed to be Cummings in the town on 12 April, said: “He should have resigned in May when this came out. He should have taken responsibility and apologised for what he did then, I don’t see any of that happening now.”
After a three-day investigation, Durham police concluded that Cummings may have breached health protection rules by travelling to Barnard Castle but they decided not to take any further action and made no ruling on his decision to leave his London home for Durham while suffering from suspected Covid-19. Evans said: “He should still be properly investigated. As a individual in the position he was in at that particular time, there is absolutely no reason he why he did what he did. He needs to be called to account as an individual person, and that doesn’t go away with time. That’s not the way things works with other people.” Dave and Clare Edwards, two of four people who claimed to have seen Cummings make a second trip to Durham, despite his denial, are also carrying on their fight for a further investigation by Durham police. Dave Edwards said: “We have nothing against him and if he wants to resign that is his choice. However, it will not stop us from wanting to know why the police did not investigate our complaint and establish the facts.” In his statement, Cummings claimed he had evidence to prove he was not in Durham on 19 April when the Edwardses claim to have seen him. When challenged by the Commons’ liaison committee, Boris Johnson said he had seen this evidence and claimed Cummings had done nothing wrong. But Downing Street has refused repeated requests to release this evidence for public scrutiny. Clare Edwards says. “Establishing the facts is still important because if he was in Durham on the 19 April, Boris Johnson lied to the liaison committee to protect him.” Last week the high court rejected an attempt to challenge the director of public prosecutions against the decision not to investigate Cummings over the alleged lockdown breaches. This week, Martin Redston, the engineering consultant who brought the case, lodged a challenge against that decision in a letter to the court of appeal. He said: “We will carry on fighting this even if Cummings resigns. If he stops being part of Johnson’s coterie he is still in my opinion guilty of a lockdown breach and should still be investigated in the same way any private citizen would have been.” Nazir Afzal, a former regional chief prosecutor, will also continue with a campaign to get Cummings investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice over his statement in the Downing Street garden in May. He said: “Our investigation has been shared with police and [the] Crown Prosecution Service and we await their decisions. We remain determined to see this to a conclusion.” On Thursday it emerged that Cummings was given a preview of the Durham police statement about its investigation into his lockdown journeys. A Freedom of Information request by the Metro newspaper uncovered that Cummings was given the statement before it was made public. The force said this was done out of courtesy and it was the only contact it had with Downing Street over the affair. It said: “At no point in the decision-making process did the investigating officer have any contact with the government or office of the prime minister or any agent thereof. The only contact with Downing Street was one-way contact to inform Mr Cummings of the outcome of the investigation and to provide a copy of the press release out of courtesy shortly before the press statement was released.” Redston said: “I’m appalled that he was given early sight of the press statement. The police didn’t tell Cliff Richard what was going on before they raided his house, out of the blue. So again there seems to be one law for one person, and another for the rest. This whole thing suggests preferential treatment.” Durham police have been approached for comment."
2020-11-13T11:47:24Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs hail Dominic Cummings' departure and look for 'reset',"Conservative MPs have hailed Dominic Cummings’ departure from Downing Street, saying they hope it could mark a change of approach in No 10. Following the resignation of Lee Cain as Boris Johnson’s head of communications, Cummings denied he would immediately follow his close ally and fellow veteran of the Vote Leave campaign out of the door. Cummings told the BBC that “rumours of me threatening to resign are invented”. However, he also said his “position hasn’t changed since my January blog”. In the 2 January post, which announced the intention to hire data scientists and “assorted weirdos” to work inside No 10, Cummings said the recruitment drive was intended to “improve performance and make me much less important – and within a year largely redundant”. One source confirmed Cummings’ departure, saying he had “started talking about it a couple of months ago”. They said: “I think it was always predictable that there would be a big bust-up and Dom would leave. He’s done that in most jobs he’s been in.” It is understood that rather than resigning voluntarily or being forced out, the departure appears to be a combination of the two, with Cummings accelerating plans to leave amid deteriorating relationships and a fear he could be sidelined. Cummings has proved a hugely controversial figure in No 10, remaining doggedly in his post even after being accused of breaking coronavirus lockdown rules, and seen as the figurehead of a Downing Street operation that many Tory MPs view as over-centalised, reluctant to listen and lurching from crisis to crisis. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the senior Tory backbencher who chairs the Commons liaison committee, which scrutinises the work of government, said his departure was a chance to restore “respect, integrity and trust” between No 10 and Tory MPs. “It’s an opportunity to reset how the government operates and to emphasise some values about what we want to project as a Conservative party in government,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I’m not surprised in a way that it is ending in the way it is. No prime minister can afford a single adviser to become a running story, dominating his government’s communications and crowding out the proper messages the government wants to convey. Nobody is indispensable.” Cummings, like Cain, is expected to stay until Christmas. His focus will be on overseeing the “moonshot” plan for mass coronavirus testing, in which he is heavily invested. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said Cummings was leaving because both the mass testing programme and Brexit were “on the near-term horizon now”. He told Sky News: “He will be missed, but then again we’re moving into a different phase.”
The infighting in No 10 has dismayed many Conservative MPs. Cain decided to leave after other aides and Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, blocked his promotion to chief of staff. The senior backbencher Sir Roger Gale said Downing Street should be “concentrating all of its efforts on the pandemic and on the endgame of Brexit”, and called for Cummings to be ousted in favour of a proper chief of staff. “Frankly, this is a distraction that cannot and should not be allowed to take place, and the prime minister has got to get a grip on it,” he said. One MP who asked not to be named said: “They’re children. Ideologues and self-obsessed fools.” Another, also speaking anonymously, said the prime minister should shoulder the blame for internal rows at such a pivotal time for the country. “The view from a lot of colleagues today is that we are witnessing the end of hope in Boris as a second-term PM,” they said. “He has left a vacuum at the centre of government and that is being filled by Cummings, who does not like the Conservative party, and his fiancee, who lives above the shop. It’s like the script from a bad soap opera.”"
2020-11-13T10:34:45Z,politics,Politics,Brexit standoff blamed on No 10 infighting over Cummings' departure,"A standoff in the Brexit negotiations has been blamed on the factional infighting in Downing Street, as Dominic Cummings confirmed he will leave the government by Christmas. Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest party in the European parliament and a political ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, lamented the “chaotic situation” at the heart of No 10. Cummings, Boris Johnson’s most powerful aide and former Vote Leave campaign director, confirmed on Thursday evening after days of speculation he would leave Downing Street. Weber, an MEP in the German Christian Social Union, a sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there appeared to be a lack of a clear steer from the heart of government at a crucial juncture in the talks. The Brexit talks are deadlocked over two main issues: future EU access to UK fishing waters and the “level playing field” provisions to ensure neither side can achieve a competitive advantage through lowering regulatory standards or subsidising failing businesses. Weber said: “There are fair questions we are asking … If you want to change in the future, with your background of sovereignty, your subsidies, regulations, then we must have an option an opportunity to react to stop to limit your access to our market … “I see what is happening now in Downing Street. We can also see this as a quite chaotic situation where we don’t have an idea what is really the line in Great Britain. So don’t tell us we should be ready for compromise. “We need a clear idea from Boris Johnson now and I think it’s now time for leadership – having all the developments in America in mind where London understood it will be not so easy with Joe Biden [as US president-elect] to achieve an easy trade deal now. “It’s time to take over responsibility and come to a common understanding. Britain has red lines, we have red lines, let’s now come to a compromise.” The claim was immediately rebutted by UK government sources, who pointed out that David Frost, a former British ambassador to Denmark who is now the prime minister’s special adviser, is leading the UK’s negotiating team. “David and the team are completely focused on the negotiations,” an UK official said. “The prime minister has been clear that he wants a deal if there is a deal to be done. We’ve been negotiating constructively and with creativity.” The official added: “I guess the reason the EU feel the need to say these sorts of things is that they are starting to realise that we meant it when we said there were fundamental principles from which we couldn’t move. We need to see some realism and creativity from their side if we are to bridge the significant gaps that remain.” Downing Street has been in chaos following a report that Lee Cain, Johnson’s loyal director for communications and a former Vote Leave ally, had been offered the role of chief of staff. The news was heavily resisted within government and Cain has since resigned. Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser and former Vote Leave campaign director, told the BBC on Thursday night that “rumours of me threatening to resign are invented”. However, he confirmed that he had not changed his plans since writing a January blog in which he wrote that he hoped to make himself “largely redundant” by the end of 2020. Cummings dismissed as “comical” claims that a dispute over how to manage the final phase of the Brexit negotiation was to blame for the recent crisis in Downing Street. There have been concerns raised in the past by EU officials and diplomats that the prime minister was being “held captive” by former Vote Leave campaign members. One senior EU diplomat said Cummings’ planned departure offered hope that the UK government’s resistance to agreement with the EU on a future domestic subsidy regime might slacken. “His flawed concept of state aid has held the negotiation hostage,” the diplomat said. Cummings has championed the UK’s future ability to subsidise the tech industry as a major Brexit dividend. However, the recent developments are not viewed by EU officials close to the talks as being hugely significant to the outcome. A deal must be secured within weeks to allow time for parliamentary ratification. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted a picture of himself on a London football pitch on Thursday, citing the logjam over standards and subsidies. He tweeted: “Short break from intense negotiations in London. Went looking for level playing fields … ” The EU negotiating team will leave London on Friday and re-engage with their UK counterparts on Monday in Brussels. It is hoped significant progress can be made ahead of a summit of EU leaders next Thursday."
2020-11-13T08:49:02Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings: time running out for PM's controversial aide,"While some people may not have been very familiar with Dominic Cummings before his trip to Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight” in the spring, many will be familiar with his work. Before joining the government, the longstanding Eurosceptic was the mastermind of the successful Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU. He was responsible for the red bus plastered with the disputed figure of £350m a week for the NHS, targeted Facebook ads to reach voters, and the clarion call to “take back control”. His role in the campaign was dramatised for Channel 4 in Brexit: The Uncivil War with Benedict Cumberbatch as Cummings.
He has gained notoriety for a characteristic determination to forgo rules and conventions. Vote Leave was found by the Electoral Commission to have broken electoral law over spending limits, and Cummings was found in contempt of parliament in 2019 for refusing to give evidence to MPs investigating misinformation. It was Cummings who devised the winning formula for the Conservatives’ election strategy in 2019. “Get Brexit Done” helped the party sweep into Labour’s heartlands. Cummings went on to become one of the most powerful unelected political figures in the country, after Boris Johnson brought him into the heart of government and appointed him as his de facto chief of staff last summer. He grabbed headlines again at the beginning of this year when he posted an advert on his personal blog for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to work for the government. In the same blog in January, he set out the plans for his own redundancy. “We want to improve performance and make me much less important – and within a year largely redundant.” He set in motion a contentious plan to shake up the civil service, issuing a recruitment call for mathematicians and data scientists to be given more prominence in Whitehall. In April it emerged that Cummings had been present at meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), coordinating the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, raising concerns over possible political interference in science-based advice. But Cummings became more of a household name in late May amid public uproar over revelations that he had driven 260 miles to his parents’ home in Durham while the country was in lockdown. He was forced to address the media in an extraordinary and unprecedented press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden. He denied any wrongdoing and refused to resign. Maybe the timing just wasn’t part of his timetable. Now Whitehall sources have confirmed that the prime minister’s chief adviser will step down at the end of the year."
2020-11-13T08:10:11Z,politics,Politics,Navalny and climate on agenda in first Russia visit by UK minister since 2017,"The first visit by a UK government minister to Moscow since 2017 will go ahead next week in what is being presented as an attempt to maintain a dialogue with Russia while stopping short of a normalisation of UK-Russian relations. The Foreign Office minister Wendy Morton will undertake a three-day visit, with government officials stressing that the points of difference with Russia are if anything growing rather than receding. The UK has imposed sanctions on six senior aides to Vladimir Putin, in common with France and Germany, and so far there have been no countermeasures from Russia. The sanctions were imposed by the UK in response to the poisoning of the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. At a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Morton is expected to tell her opposite number, Vladimir Titov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, that the UK has seen no evidence to suggest anyone but the Russian state was responsible for the use of the nerve agent novichok to poison Navalny. The Russian dissident is still recovering in Germany, and has said he wishes to return to Russia. His organisation’s offices in Moscow were raided last week. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Wednesday suggested sanctions would be imposed on Germany and France but made no mention of the UK. It was not clear if this was deliberate or an oversight. Morton’s meeting is part of an annual set-piece ministerial dialogue that was cut off in 2018 the wake of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal by Russian secret service agents in Salisbury in March that year, and the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats from the UK. Last February, the Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan met Titov on the margins of the Munich security conference. The timing of next week’s meeting allows British officials to test the Russian response to the election of Joe Biden as US president. Although Donald Trump took a lenient approach towards Putin, many British officials feel the US administration overall did not follow the president’s lead. The UK has held high-level talks with the Ukrainian government and offered a military and economic package to assist the Ukrainian resistance to Russian interference in the east of Ukraine. The UK regards the annual dialogue as a way of communicating British concerns directly, and overall regards the trend in the rest of Europe as one of a hardening attitude towards Russia. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had suggested a possible opening towards Moscow, but then came the Navalny poisoning. Morton will also meet Putin’s climate change adviser as part of preparations for the UK hosting the UN climate change conference. postponed to next year. She will also meet civilian human rights campaigners."
2020-11-13T07:15:56Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings to leave Downing Street role by Christmas,"Boris Johnson’s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, is to leave his Downing Street position by the end of this year in a signal of a major change of direction for the government. Whitehall sources confirmed he will follow Johnson’s communications director, Lee Cain, in leaving No 10. It follows reports that Cummings told the BBC that “rumours of me threatening to resign are invented”. However, he said his “position hasn’t changed since my January blog”, when he wrote that he hoped to make himself “largely redundant” by the end of 2020. The BBC also quoted a Downing Street source as saying Cummings would be “out of government” by Christmas. On Thursday, a number of Conservatives said Cain’s resignation – after Johnson’s fiancee and inner circle had blocked his promotion to chief of staff – epitomised a No 10 riven by factions, cut off from backbench MPs and lurching from crisis to crisis. One senior Tory MP openly called on Johnson to “get a grip” on the situation. Others expressed despair at a spectacle in which Carrie Symonds, Johnson’s fiancee and a former Tory party press adviser, joined those protesting at Cain’s promotion at a time when the government is battling Europe’s highest coronavirus death toll and a looming Brexit deadline. One MP, who asked not to be named, said: “They’re children. Ideologues and self-obsessed fools.” Another, also speaking anonymously, said the prime minister must shoulder the blame for internal rows at such a pivotal time for the country. The government under Johnson has performed a series of U-turns in the pandemic, involving national lockdown measures, furlough support, exam results and free school meals. “The view from a lot of colleagues today is that we are witnessing the end of hope in Boris as a second-term PM,” they said. “He has left a vacuum at the centre of government and that is being filled by Cummings, who does not like the Conservative party, and his fiancee, who lives above the shop. It’s like the script from a bad soap opera.” Official figures showed a record 33,470 UK daily coronavirus cases on Thursday. At a Downing Street press conference, the medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, said the number of Covid-19 inpatients had more than tripled in a month to more than 12,700. Appearing alongside him in Downing Street, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, insisted the internal battles had not distracted ministers. “I can tell you that all of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and protecting livelihoods,” he said. The senior backbencher, Sir Roger Gale, said Downing Street should be “concentrating all of its efforts on the pandemic and on the end game of Brexit”, and called for Cummings to be ousted in favour of a proper chief of staff. “Frankly, this is a distraction that cannot and should not be allowed to take place, and the prime minister has got to get a grip on it,” he said. “For my money Cummings is a liability and what the prime minister needs and deserves is a first-rate chief of staff who is a serious heavyweight. I think the expression currently in use is ‘big boy pants’.” Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, told the Guardian that Downing Street was “overdue a wider shakeup” and struggling to get on top of the wider policy agenda. Johnson was “facing an unprecedented series of challenges, the scale of which we’ve not seen since the war”, including Covid, Brexit and an economic downturn, Ellwood said. “With the new US president focusing on re-establishing western resolve and tackling climate change we should be also seeking to play a more active role on the global stage,” Ellwood said. “The machine of government must adapt otherwise it will be overwhelmed.” Downing Street declined to comment on reports that Cummings had threatened to resign in fury over the way Cain, his close ally, is perceived to have been forced out, or that Johnson is still aiming to appoint a new chief of staff to get a grip of the No 10 operation. It confirmed that James Slack, currently Johnson’s lead spokesman, would take on Cain’s job. Unlike Cain, he will remain as a civil servant rather than a political appointee. One strongly pro-Brexit MP said he hoped the changes would mark a “reset” but warned time was running out for Johnson to steady the Downing Street ship. “I’m not driven by any animosity towards Dominic Cummings. I just think it’s an operation which is failing,” the MP said. “You don’t put the guru in charge of management. If you throw out all these ideas, it’s for others to see if they are actually workable. We need a chief of staff who makes it their business to talk to people. “This is really important. If this reset doesn’t work, and we have a bad set of elections in May, it’s just going to get worse.” Another was more blunt: “There’s a cabinet revolt against Dom’s reign of terror. Reducing the power of the Vote Leave gang is desirable and hopefully a turning point.”
A source close to a cabinet minister said: “The problem with Downing Street is they have remained in campaign mode since winning the election. They are warring with everyone in Whitehall and that’s down to Cummings. “They just don’t seem to know how to govern. Eleven months in, they should be leading a united front but they are still working in the image of Vote Leave.” A number of backbenchers said they had virtually no contact with Cain or Cummings but despaired about both government messaging and the lack of liaison with MPs. “It ends up with all these flawed bills, requiring endless U-turns, and MPs don’t feel listened to or appreciated,” one said. “We didn’t come into this job to be a glorified chorus.”
News of Cain’s departure, which will happen at the end of the year, emerged in a statement from Downing Street sent out late on Wednesday. Johnson is understood to have offered him the chief of staff role last week, prompting significant pushback inside No 10, with Symonds heavily involved, as well as Munira Mirza, head of the No 10 policy unit. The infighting has in part been sparked by the arrival at Downing Street of Allegra Stratton, a former journalist and adviser to Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. Stratton is to be the face of planned daily televised Downing Street media briefings. Cain had devised the idea, but is known to have opposed Stratton getting the job. He had also clashed with Symonds previously. Keir Starmer described the scenes as “pathetic”. The Labour leader told LBC radio: “I think millions of people will be waking up this morning scratching their heads, saying, ‘What on earth is going on?’ We’re in the middle of a pandemic, we’re all worried about our health and our families, we’re all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10.”"
2020-11-13T07:00:10Z,politics,Politics,How Cummings and Carrie Symonds vie for Johnson's attention,"The imminent departure of Downing Street’s head of communications, Lee Cain, has uncovered a clash of cultures, styles and politics, pitting two unelected officials vying for Boris Johnson’s attention against one another. In one corner is Dominic Cummings, the pugnacious chief adviser to the prime minister, seen by Tory MPs as the leader of a group of predominantly Vote Leave veterans who have dominated key positions within No 10 since December’s election. Under him, a macho culture is said to have developed. In the other corner is Carrie Symonds, the former Conservative party press officer, Johnson’s fiancee and mother to his newest son, Wilfred, whose rising influence has variously shocked and delighted many in the parliamentary party. The clash means Johnson and his party could move away from the confrontational style favoured by Cummings and Cain. For the Vote Leave faction, including Cummings, it means they may lose their grip on government.
Allies of Cummings who are believed to have considered their positions include Lord Frost, the UK’s Brexit negotiator who is said to be close to Cain, and Oliver Lewis, an adviser nicknamed Sonic. Briefings have claimed that some loyal allies could yet leave the prime minister and government for good unless they are allowed to maintain their handle on the policy levers. Several sources said Symonds was pivotal in ensuring that Cain, a state-educated journalist who once dressed as a chicken for the Daily Mirror to pursue David Cameron, did not get the job as Johnson’s chief of staff. A former special adviser and head of media in the Conservative party, Symonds has previously voiced concerns about the combative culture of No 10 under Cummings and Cain. Some claim she has grown increasingly concerned by reports of a macho culture which has sidelined female special advisers. She is also said to be baffled by Cummings’ obsession with reforming the mechanisms of government and the civil service. Her supporters among MPs say that, unlike Cummings, she has wanted to pull the parliamentary party closer to No 10. Some MPs have grown increasingly angry at Downing Street’s dismissals of their concerns over lockdown, the failings of test and trace and the levelling-up agenda. One said: “Who would have thought that Carrie Symonds would be the one to pull the plug on the failings of Cummings, Cain and co,” adding: “Chapeau.” Cummings, who became a household name after the Guardian disclosed that he had travelled to the north of England with suspected Covid-19 and driven to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, had pushed for his ally, Cain, to be promoted to chief of staff. Reports claimed that Symonds then warned that it would be “a mistake” following a series of communications errors by the government during the pandemic. She was backed by Munira Mirza, a Johnson aide from his time as London mayor. A former member of the Revolutionary Communist party, she was said by the Times to have made her opposition to Cain’s appointment clear. Symonds’s opposition to Cain was also said to be backed by the incoming press secretary Allegra Stratton, the former ITN, Newsnight and Guardian journalist who will front daily televised briefings as press secretary. When recruited earlier this year, Stratton reportedly insisted that she would be answerable to the prime minister, not Cain. Sir Lynton Crosby, the pollster and campaigner who oversaw Johnson’s mayoral victories in London, was also said to have told the prime minister to think again. One Conservative backbencher said Symonds could lead what amounted to an alternative power base within Westminster, lined up against Michael Gove and Cummings and allied to Stratton, who – against the wishes of Cain – is to become the face of the government’s new briefings. “Carrie is very much pushing on this,” they said. A passionate conservationist who is close to Zac Goldsmith, she could push the government towards offering more support for environment-friendly policies. She has already had an impact on government policy after a badger cull in Derbyshire was called off, a move that saved thousands of the animals. As a result of the clash and its subsequent fallout, the government has been left floundering amid a rising death rate from coronavirus and with a Brexit deadline looming without a deal. Leading Tory backbenchers said there had been growing concerns about the Downing Street operation. Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, told the BBC: “I think there has been unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time. Members of parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that’s no secret. “The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative party and its representation in the House of Commons.” Some who know Cummings believe he will stay on, determined to see the Brexit process through by the end of the year. But they make clear that “he will walk” if he doesn’t like who Johnson appoints as chief of staff, particularly if it means restricting his influence. Observers say that since the general election, Cummings has gradually moved away from an interest in the press operation and is now concentrating on test and trace schemes, Brexit and reforming procurement. It remains to be seen who will win the battle between his allies and influence, and that of the prime minister’s partner."
2020-11-13T06:52:29Z,politics,Politics,Special adviser sacked by Dominic Cummings to receive payoff,"A special adviser who was escorted out of Downing Street by police on the orders of Dominic Cummings has been given a five-figure payoff by the government. Sonia Khan, a former adviser to the then chancellor, Sajid Javid, is expected to receive the substantial sum after arguing in legal papers that the behaviour of Boris Johnson’s most senior aide was pivotal to her claim of sex discrimination. The disclosure of a payoff weeks before a tribunal was due to be heard will be seen as an attempt by the government to protect Cummings from further controversy. He is set to leave his position at the end of the year, after his close ally Lee Cain resigned as head of communications on Wednesday amid bitter No 10 infighting. Cummings, who sacked Khan last year after claiming she was leaking information, was identified in tribunal documents despite attempts by government lawyers to remove his name. He was also at the centre of a £25,000 payoff to a civil servant in 2012. In a statement released to the Guardian, Khan said: “Following 14 months of negotiation, I have today reached a settlement with the Treasury, my former employer, and as a result I am no longer pursuing my employment tribunal claim, which was due to be heard in London in December.” Khan was Javid’s media adviser when in August 2019 she was escorted from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event. At an employment tribunal hearing in central London, a judge set the case for a five-day hearing in December at which the relationship between Cummings and Johnson would be scrutinised. Khan’s barristers named Cummings as a respondent in the case, which also included an unfair dismissal claim. It is understood the government’s solicitors attempted to argue that his name as a respondent should be removed and replaced with that of the Cabinet Office. Counsel for Khan, who was being supported by the FDA union, argued that Cummings was pivotal to the case and that what he had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He was expected to be summoned as a witness. The hearing ruled that the Cabinet Office could be added as a respondent but Cummings would also remain. Johnson could have been asked to give evidence to the tribunal. At the time of Khan’s dismissal last September, the terms of employment for special advisers made it clear that only the prime minister had the power to sack them. This was changed after Khan left, giving Cummings ultimate “responsibility for disciplinary matters”. Khan, 29, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond’s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. There were no other witnesses to Khan’s sacking by Cummings, who spoke to her in an office in Downing Street close to the prime minister’s. In a meeting days after Khan’s departure with Johnson’s team of special advisers – known as spads – Cummings is said to have remarked: “If you don’t like how I run things, there’s the door.” In 2012, a senior civil servant received £25,000 from the Department for Education in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove’s team when Cummings was a special adviser in the department. An internal investigation found no grounds for disciplinary action. Cummings also drew criticism for hiring Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who resigned over comments about eugenics and race. Khan thanked the FDA and its legal advisers, Slater and Gordon, as well as the Metropolitan police, “for their support during intense scrutiny and pressure for myself and my family”. She also thanked her current employer, Cicero/AMO, for its “wholehearted backing”. She added: “Having reached a settlement of these issues, I am now moving on with my life and career. I have a fulfilling job as a consultant, I maintain great affection for the Conservative party and remain a committed Conservative. The party took me under its wing when I was a teen and I feel hugely privileged to have served as a special adviser under the last two prime ministers.”"
2020-11-13T06:00:09Z,politics,Politics,Local councils advised to push ahead with traffic reduction schemes,"The UK government is to push ahead with a new wave of traffic reduction schemes to help more people walk and cycle, telling councils that while they must properly consult on new projects, they should also not be derailed by a minority of noisy opponents. Announcing the new £175m tranche of money, part of wider plans to adapt travel to the impact of coronavirus, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, pointed to polling which shows significant support for such measures across England. The money will be allocated to councils partly for new bike lanes and better pedestrian facilities, but also for so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which seek to dissuade short car trips by stopping motor traffic using some residential streets as rat runs. The first wave of LTNs, primarily in London but also set up in a series of other cities, has proved controversial in some places, with residents’ groups saying they can merely push traffic on to other roads, or were imposed without notice. Announcing the funding, part of a wider £2bn allocation for walking and cycling unveiled in May, Shapps acknowledged the opposition, warning councils that new schemes must show proper engagement, including with businesses and emergency services, and also have prior consultation. Local authorities, Shapps said, should also produce reports on LTNs after six to 12 months, and adapt them based on feedback. But in a pointed message to some councils which have abandoned LTNs or other walking and cycling schemes following protests, Shapps stressed they are generally popular, with one poll showing 65% of people across England back the reallocation of road space to cyclists and pedestrians in their local area. In London, where the anti-LTN campaigns have been most prevalent, an independent poll showed that while 19% of people oppose the schemes, 52% support them and 25% are neutral, Shapps said. Shapps is sending a letter to all councils receiving the money to remind them that consultation on LTNs and other schemes should involve objective gauges such as polling, rather than “listening only to the loudest voices or giving any one group a veto”. He wrote: “Very few changes to anything will command unanimous support, and we do not ask it for these schemes. But there is clear evidence that for all the controversy they can sometimes cause, ambitious cycling and walking schemes have significant, if quieter, majority support.” In the letter, Shapps does acknowledge that some ideas introduced to assist with social distancing amid Covid have not been a success. In particular, he said, barriers to temporarily extend pavement widths have often not been used, while preventing people from crossing the road and narrowing the street. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist who is now cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, said communities which prioritise cycling saw cleaner air, less congestion, a boost to businesses, and their streets are “happier places to be”. Supporting the call for more consultation, he said: “If we get this right, many of these pop-up routes and low-traffic neighbourhoods will become a permanent and valued part of people’s daily lives. The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain, now we should lead the green revolution.” Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for Cycling UK, said councils should heed Shapps’s words on not just listening to opponents. He said: “It really shouldn’t be news the majority of people support quieter and safer roads for cycling and walking. Survey after survey say exactly this. Hopefully this time councils will take note, because in recent weeks far too many have underestimated support for these schemes, removing cycle lanes the minute a local MP or vocal minority of people raise concerns.”"
2020-11-12T20:07:30Z,politics,Politics,'What goes around comes around': the intrigues behind Lee Cain's departure,"It was a resignation that few saw coming, but it had been brewing for months. Dominic Cummings and his ally Lee Cain had been increasingly dominant figures in Downing Street after December’s election win. But Cummings’ authority had been badly damaged by his lockdown flight to County Durham and, from the late summer, the government lurched from crisis to crisis: A-levels, the rows over the introduction of city and regional Covid restrictions and the surprise imposition of a second nationwide lockdown in England.
Insiders said Johnson appeared to be losing patience with Cummings in meetings, and referred regularly to his chief aide’s lockdown-busting trip. “He was making it clear that he still hadn’t forgotten about it,” one Conservative source said. A reorganisation of Downing Street was being planned. The growing number of critics of Cummings in the Conservative party believed he was too stretched. The nominal chief of staff, Eddie Lister, at 71 was increasingly winding down and Cain, the director of communications, was the man that Cummings – who tolerated little authority – was prepared to work with.
Other changes were in the works. Cain had persuaded Johnson to appoint a spokesperson for television to take journalist briefings every afternoon in the style of the White House, with the hope of seizing the agenda of the early evening news bulletins. Cain initially alighted on Allegra Stratton, a former Guardian and ITV journalist, who had recently joined the team of high-flying chancellor, Rishi Sunak. But Cain became less keen on Stratton following focus groups and screen tests, sources said, and hoped instead to appoint the lesser-known BBC journalist Ellie Price. Johnson, however, wanted Stratton and she was appointed in early October, reporting not to Cain but directly to the prime minister.
If that was a defeat for Cain, it may not have mattered. To the spinner’s surprise, the prime minister asked him to become chief of staff about 10 days ago, according to one ally. Cummings, the same source said, would then be allowed to focus on “the two or three things that mattered to him. He’s very focused on issues like civil service reform and he’s been showing a lot of interest in test and trace. It makes sense to free up your most effective special adviser to focus on key issues, but then your chief guy doesn’t have the bandwidth to look at the rest”.
Except it started to look like the final stages of a Vote Leave takeover of Downing Street. Cummings was well known as the chief strategist in the successful 2016 pro-Brexit campaign. Cain, a former journalist, started his political career there, working as head of broadcast before moving on to work for Boris Johnson. Some believe news of the move was leaked to the Times on Tuesday night with the intention of killing it. It was presented as a done deal. Yet, extraordinarily, it was not. A last-ditch operation to undo the apparent appointment began, with the prime minister’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, among those involved. Symonds is a former special adviser and Conservative party head of press who considers herself a seasoned political operative. Her friends, many of whom are former special advisers, view Cain as being too close to Cummings and part of a regime under which a string of advisers were abruptly kicked out of government. Many were women and close to Symonds. “What goes around comes around,” a former Whitehall insider said.
Concerns were also raised that Cain was too confrontational. He was seen as unwilling to, or too slow to, back down from the row over the provision of free school meals during holidays, which pitted Downing Street against the Manchester United star Marcus Rashford, and encouraged councils, charities, restauranteurs and other organisations to plug the gap until, eventually, the government was forced into a U-turn. There was no love lost on the other side. Cain had sought to run a disciplined press operation for Johnson dating back to his safety-first leadership campaign, relentlessly checking quotes that appeared in the newspapers and pursuing leaks. But Symonds, as Johnson’s girlfriend and later fiancee, was able to circumvent Cain, irritating him in July 2019 with the release of a photograph apparently showing the couple making up in the Sussex countryside. It came just days after the Guardian revealed police had been called to her south London flat after an explosive row between Symonds and the prime minister-to-be.
Perhaps surprisingly given his background as a journalist, Johnson also hates leaks and gossip from Downing Street. Few dare to speculate or inquire about Symonds’ opinion or intentions, and her own press advisers insist they have nothing to say about Cummings or Cain. Sources at Westminster, however, say she was in touch with a handful of journalists on Wednesday demanding to know how the pushback against the chief of staff appointment was going. “PM’s fiance, Carrie Symonds, however, said to be deeply unhappy about the plan,” the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, tweeted at lunchtime on Wednesday. Suddenly Cain’s elevation was not as certain as it seemed. It was a cue for others to bombard Johnson and No 10 to try to lobby against the appointment, in effect pressing the prime minister for a fuller reset. Cain himself was in two minds about taking the job, exhausted after more than two years of intense work for Johnson, from his apparent downfall after he resigned as foreign secretary to his becoming prime minister a year later. But even in the late afternoon allies were convinced he would accept it. “You don’t turn down the prime minister,” one said. By 9pm, however, after further conversations with Johnson, Cain had chosen to quit. Unusually he felt the need to spell out that he had been “asked to serve as the prime minister’s chief of staff” in case anybody had doubted him. Special advisers who thought they were close to Cain were stunned, believing him to be one of Johnson’s most loyal officials, but the last-ditch revolt had put paid to his appointment. Some say Johnson withdrew the job offer, leaving Cummings deeply unhappy and waiting to see who he may try to appoint next."
2020-11-12T18:34:51Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 33,470 people test positive in a day; NI lockdown extended by a week - as it happened","The UK has recorded 33,470 further coronavirus cases - a new daily record, and more than 10,000 more than the total for yesterday. (See 4.58pm.) Todayâ€™s figure is also more than 6,000 above the previous highest daily total. At a No 10 press conference Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS England medical director, was unable to give an explanation for the striking increase, but he stressed that the seven-day rolling average was a better guide to the trend than a single daily figure. The seven-day average for new cases is now running at 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago. (See 5.06pm.) People with learning disabilities are dying of coronavirus at more than six times the rate of the general population, according to â€œdeeply troublingâ€� figures that have prompted a government review. People from Black and Asian backgrounds are at substantially greater risk of contracting coronavirus than white people, according to a study that highlights the disproportionate impact of the disease on different groups in society. The governmentâ€™s struggling test and trace system for England was hit by â€œhugeâ€� IT issues that delayed calls to some of the most vulnerable coronavirus patients last month, NHS emails show. Britainâ€™s economy grew at a record quarterly rate of more than 15% as lockdown restrictions were eased in the summer but the recovery was losing momentum even before new curbs came in, the latest official figures have revealed. There has been â€œunhappinessâ€� about Downing Street operations for some time, a leading Tory backbencher has said following the resignation of one of Boris Johnsonâ€™s most senior aides. Iâ€™ve corrected the post at 4.05pm, about the Imperial College React survey, because originally the paragraph with regional prevalence figures was in the wrong place, making it look as if they were R numbers, not prevalence rates.

2020-11-12T17:03:21Z,politics,Politics,Who is in the running to become Boris Johnson's chief of staff?,"It is a sign of the uncertainty over Boris Johnson’s search for a new chief of staff that so many people have been tipped for the job, often inaccurately, even when it was unclear whether a formal vacancy existed. Many Conservative MPs say privately that they want someone able to correct the sense of drift inside No 10, clamp down on factional squabbles and improve messaging from the centre of government. Here are some of the potential runners and riders for the chief of staff role.
Isaac Levido If the aim of the appointment is successful strategy inside No 10, then the young Australian has the ideal pedigree, given that Tories widely credit him as the ultimate mastermind of the 2019 election victory. A former employee of Lynton Crosby’s consultancy, Levido has also worked on campaigns in the US and Australia. Moving back to No 10 would involve him taking a break from the strategy consultancy he co-founded last year, which might be tricky. Alex Burghart Being an MP might appear an obstacle to taking on another full-time job – Burghart has represented Brentwood and Ongar since 2017 – but there are some who argue this could better connect No 10 to backbenchers.
If so, Burghart would seem a good fit as a former parliamentary private secretary to Johnson. He also worked for Theresa May on social justice issues, so he knows his way around the Downing Street machinery. Munira Mirza Mirza is far less high-profile than Dominic Cummings or even the departing communications director, Lee Cain, but she is arguably just as integral to Johnson’s No 10 operation, and her judgement is similarly trusted.
She was a Revolutionary Communist party member at university but has since traversed the ideological spectrum, and as No 10’s chief she is a notable and controversial voice in areas such as institutional racism.
Henry Newman A seasoned Westminster and Whitehall insider, Newman has served two stints as an adviser to Michael Gove, interspersed with a period running the Euroseceptic thinktank Open Europe.
Cummings is another alumnus of Gove’s employ, and as a Cabinet Office special adviser Newman is already at the centre of decision-making. David Canzini Like Levido, Canzini is a product of the Lynton Crosby academy. He formerly worked for Crosby’s CTF Partners consulting firm and played a key role in running Johnson’s bid to become Conservative leader. He is also a long-time Conservative activist and helped Tory MPs agitate against May’s Brexit deal. Paul Stephenson Another integral member of the Vote Leave team, Stephenson was its communications head and is close to Cummings and others from that era.
Many of them have ended up in No 10, but Stephenson – also a former ministerial adviser – is now a partner with the PR consultancy Hanbury and is perhaps unlikely to leave for an uncertain future in Downing Street. Andrew Feldman The grandee candidate. Baron Feldman of Elstree, as he has been since 2010, is a businessman and veteran Tory fundraiser who chaired the party for six years under David Cameron.
Someone from the Cameron era might seem unsuited to Johnson’s No 10, but there are reports the prime minister offered Feldman the job – and he refused."
2020-11-12T14:52:23Z,politics,Politics,No 10 insider row viewed as turning point for Boris Johnson,"Brexit is fewer than 50 days away. Many would have expected that come 1 January, when the “oven ready” departure from the EU is finally served up, the influence of the Vote Leave operation within Downing Street would inevitably fade and decline, paving the way for a new era of leadership by Boris Johnson focused on a sovereign and global Britain. After all, he spoke in February of the “great voyage” the country was embarking upon, warning other countries not to underestimate’s the UK’s determination to make its mark on the world with an “independent voice”. But the extraordinary infighting in the Downing Street administration that led to the sudden departure of the director of communications on Wednesday night shows the Vote Leave camp is very much clinging on to power. Johnson’s inner circle is made up of fewer than half a dozen people, most of them more or less on the ardent Brexit side, led by Dominic Cummings but including the Brexit negotiator David Frost and his de facto deputy – and the former head of research at the Vote Leave campaign – Oliver Lewis. Speculation that Cummings and Frost were going to follow Lee Cain out the door was quickly put to bed, but spoke volumes, according to one highly respected commentator on Brexit. “The briefings were highly significant, suggesting that the Cummings faction owed their loyalty to itself rather than the PM,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the European managing director of the Eurasia Group.
“Cummings is staying, for now at least. If he did quit while the EU negotiations are still in play, that would slightly reduce the chances of Johnson adopting a no-trade-deal stance, though insiders say Johnson rather than Cummings is often the most Eurosceptic figure round the table when the issue is discussed,” Rahman added. His analysis chimes with that of another former Downing Street adviser, who noted that Cain’s promotion to chief of staff would not have changed the composition of the inner circle, merely given him a new job title. In other words it was the threat of a consolidation of power for the Vote Leave campaign that upended Cain’s career move. In the short term the row won’t have any impact on Brexit negotiations which are 10 days away from conclusion. But many have said it is a turning point for Johnson’s leadership and will affect key decisions in the new year on the makeup of his cabinet, economic recovery and the many battles to come over the dividing up of the billions that used to go into the EU’s coffers. The commentator Daniel Finkelstein told the BBC that in the medium and longer term there will be a point when Johnson will have to ask and answer the question of what kind of prime minister he wants to be. Does he want to be leader of Vote Leave or does he have a different vision of himself as prime minister? There are also questions of party discipline and leadership, with solid factions emerging including the Northern Research Group led by the MP and Johnson ally Jake Berry and the Covid Research Group led by the Brexiter MP Steve Baker. Charles Walker, vice-chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, told the BBC on Thursday he thought the vacant chief of staff position presented “a real opportunity” for Johnson to appoint someone who could heal the wounds with the parliamentary party. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a senior member of the 1922 Committee, said Johnson needed someone who could act as a link with the party in parliament. “I think it is essential for the prime minister to have a chief of staff. Somebody we can get hold of if we really need to,” he told PA Media. Cummings’ open contempt for MPs has earned him many enemies in the Tory party, but one former cabinet minister who served under Theresa May predicted he would remain at Johnson’s side. He recalled how May “completely fell apart” when her former advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill left. “Without him Johnson would be nothing,” said the source."
2020-11-12T13:57:33Z,politics,Politics,Lee Cain fallout: Tory MPs 'unhappy for some time' at No 10 set-up,"There has been “unhappiness” about Downing Street operations for some time, a leading Tory backbencher has said following the resignation of one of Boris Johnson’s most senior aides. Lee Cain announced he would step down as director of communications on Wednesday after ministers, advisers and the prime minister’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, are said to have protested over his planned promotion to chief of staff.
Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, said MPs had felt excluded from decision-making processes. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday morning: “I think there has been unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time. Members of parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that’s no secret. “The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative party and its representation in the House of Commons.” Cain’s departure has thrown into doubt the future of one of his close allies, Dominic Cummings, who is Johnson’s most senior adviser. An insider told the Guardian that Cummings could also leave No 10. Cummings is said to have been furious that Cain, a fellow Vote Leave campaigner who was partly credited with bringing him into Downing Street, had in effect been forced out. There has been speculation about other potential resignations from within Johnson’s inner circle. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, described the internal wrangling as “pathetic”. He told LBC on Thursday: “I think millions of people will be waking up this morning scratching their heads, saying, ‘What on earth is going on?’ We’re in the middle of a pandemic, we’re all worried about our health and our families, we’re all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10. It’s pathetic. Pull yourselves together, focus on the job in hand.”
The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, denied there was a rift, saying No 10 was focused on handling the pandemic and its economic repercussions. “The prime minister has a strong team around him and all of us, whether it’s his advisers or the cabinet, are focused on the big task,” he told the Today programme. He said Cain had been “a highly valued member of the prime minister’s team” and that Johnson had expressed regret at his resignation. “In my experience the prime minister has good relations with his colleagues in parliament,” he said. “What the public are interested in is our focus on the virus and that I can assure you is the sole focus of the government. “Charles Walker and our colleagues in parliament would agree that the party and the government have a singular national mission, which is to support the public through this challenging period.” Cain is due to step down next month. The chief of staff post is yet to be filled as part of a wider reorganisation of No 10 in which the former journalist Allegra Stratton will become the face of new daily televised press briefings. The prime minister’s official spokesman, James Slack, refused to be drawn on questions about the circumstances of Cain’s departure, instead pointing towards the statements issued by Cain and Johnson. However, Slack confirmed he would move into Cain’s post in the new year, taking up the role as a civil servant rather than a political appointee. He defended Downing Street’s handling of communications during the pandemic. “We’ve been responding to what’s been an unprecedented global pandemic, which has been a significant challenge for countries all across Europe and throughout the world,” he said. “I think what we’ve worked hard on is promoting clear messages about the need to wash hands, wear face coverings, keep distance from other people. And working with the media … on promotions to make sure the public have access to the information that they need to protect themselves from this virus, and that work continues.”"
2020-11-12T13:47:29Z,politics,Politics,"Starmer should apologise for Labour's Brexit position, say ex-shadow ministers","Keir Starmer should apologise for Labour’s promise to seek a second referendum on Brexit, three former shadow ministers have argued, saying the policy had left many of the party’s leave-backing traditional supporters “in a rage”. Ian Lavery, Jon Trickett and Laura Smith, all of whom held frontbench posts under Jeremy Corbyn, have produced a report into attitudes to the party among its supporters, based on discussions at 50 virtual events. Before the launch of the document, titled No Holding Back, the trio said a considerable element of Labour’s falling away in support among working-class voters in 2019 was due to its approach to Brexit. The party went into the election promising a second referendum, a stance seen as largely led by Starmer, who was shadow Brexit secretary. He replaced Corbyn as party leader in April. Lavery and Trickett are still MPs, while Smith lost her Crewe and Nantwich seat in December. In a joint article for HuffPost UK, they said: “Labour got it wrong on a second referendum. The party went against one of the only times in recent history that people felt they could finally express their justified anger at the present political system. “To rebuild trust that has been lost and restore people’s trust in politics, Labour should say sorry. This is not only about Labour winning elections but restoring faith in democracy. We do not believe that the party can move on until it has put this issue behind us.” They went on: “The country, our voters and our activists all deserve an explanation and perhaps an apology by the party for our actions in the years after the referendum up until the December election.” The Brexit policy led by Starmer is seen by many Corbyn-inclined Labour MPs as one of the major reasons for the party’s crushing defeat in the election, although others in the party query its significance amid polls showing Corbyn’s unpopularity with voters. Since becoming leader, Starmer has sought to stress that Labour’s focus is now based around acknowledging Brexit has happened, and holding the government to account over the way they handle it. In their article, Lavery, Trickett and Smith said even many remain-backing traditional Labour supporters were baffled by the Brexit policy, as they “accepted that the country had voted to leave and just wanted to get on with the job”. They wrote: “And, of course, there were many tens of thousands of Labour-inclined leave voters who were the angriest of all. They felt that their arguments had won the referendum vote and were often in a rage at the idea that our party had betrayed that vote. “But the truth is that the Brexit vote was symbolic of a wider breakdown. We had lost the trust of very many voters. “At a time when many people think politics is broken and trust in the establishment is at a very low ebb, it is critically important that we reset the relationship between the party and the electorate. It may be that in order to do this we will need frankly to accept that we were mistaken.”"
2020-11-12T12:11:19Z,politics,Politics,Post-Brexit lorry queues could make Kent 'toilet of England',"Kent could become the “toilet of England” in less than eight weeks unless dedicated loos are provided for thousands of lorry drivers who could be held up in the county for hours by post-Brexit border checks, campaigners have warned. They say Kent’s main roads and laybys are already littered with bottles of urine and bags of excrement and the problem could become much worse after 31 December. “It has got the potential to be disgusting,” said Phil Silkstone, a regional official for Unite, which represents many lorry drivers.
Mike Sole, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Canterbury who has been campaigning on the issue of human waste being discarded in laybys near the A2 motorway, said: “I’m worried Kent is becoming the toilet of England, not the garden of England. And we’re all braced for it getting much much worse.” The government has promised drivers there will be portable toilets if an anticipated 7,000 lorries are held up by new checks and controls in Kent’s ports if there is no Brexit trade deal. But Unite says these will not be enough to prevent fouling of Kent’s hedgerows on a scale that will horrify local residents. “If all the government does is supply a few Portaloos then drivers are likely to take the other options – and that’s use the bushes,” Silkstone said. He warned that the biggest problem would be around four lorry parks currently being built in Kent to cope with the anticipated increase in vehicles held at Channel ports. Silkstone said: “The main concern is the welfare of our drivers, but also the welfare of local residents. It won’t be nice having thousands of lorry drivers potentially using the bushes around lorry parks. All we need is proper toilet and washing facilities. The time to start installing them isn’t in January, it’s now.” He added: “It is not a threat from us, but inevitably if drivers are forced to use bushes and parkways, the environment will be damaged in those areas. I’m hoping the government will listen.” On Wednesday, Silkstone wrote to every MP in Kent and hundreds of councillors across the south-east of England warning of the problem ahead. He said: “Presently all we are aware of is that portable toilets will be used which I am sure you will agree is not acceptable for drivers under normal circumstances but even more so in the middle of this Covid-19 crisis, this brings potential health risks to all concerned including local residents.” Sole, one of the recipients of the letter, described the fouling at a layby in his ward east of Canterbury. “You’ve got bottles of urine just thrown everywhere. And also toilet paper and all others sorts of mess that people on footpaths are going to find. Whilst there is annoyance and disgust at the behaviour there is also sympathy with drivers. It is imperative that the government assist in providing adequate facilities for lorry drivers who do such an important role in keeping the economy going.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport referred questions to Highways England. A spokeswoman for Highways England said: “We are working with a number of partners to put contingency plans in place.” But she referred questions about toilet facilities for lorry drivers back to the department and to Kent county council. A Kent county council spokesman said waste clearance was the responsibility of district and borough councils. He added: “Local partners are working together to plan a traffic management system that will best fit with sites available from the government for freight parking and checks. As part of that ongoing work, government has ensured there will be toilet provision for drivers at those sites around Kent.”"
2020-11-12T09:02:26Z,politics,Politics,Nobel laureate urges Boris Johnson to commit to £80bn EU science scheme,"Fears are growing the UK is on the verge of losing its place at the heart of Europe’s prestigious medical and scientific research programmes because of a Brexit row. One of the country’s leading scientists has written to Boris Johnson warning of heightened concern over the EU’s flagship £80bn Horizon Europe programme, which pools talent and ideas that have produced breakthroughs on everything from leukaemia treatments to hydrogen cells that fuel zero-emission buses. Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel prize winner and president of the Royal Society, has urged the prime minister to commit to the next seven years of the programme as a paying-in associate member to help secure his vision for the UK to be a “global science superpower”. The future of the UK’s participation is hanging in the balance with sources in the science community in despair that they will be collateral damage in an argument over a financial formula they say can easily be solved. Ramakrishnan’s letter comes days after a similar last-ditch attempt to influence the outcome of Brexit talks was made by some of the country’s best-known science leaders, including Sir Paul Nurse, the director of the Francis Crick Institute and Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the Sage committee advising the government on Covid. “We urge you to use the final stages of talks to find common ground,” they said in their letter to Johnson. Talks have foundered over the EU’s one-way formula for the UK’s financial contribution. They have suggested the UK pay in 18% of the budget.
The UK has rejected this as a “one-way” formula, which would oblige London to invest top-up finance if it got more than the 18% of the overall funds but no rebate if it got less. A two-way financial correction formula was proposed by the Wellcome Trust but there is little optimism in the science community that a deal will be struck. The Royal Society has urged Johnson to think about the benefits that go beyond direct science funding including the pooling of talent that leads to scientific breakthroughs such as this week’s Covid vaccine, which has emerged from a collaboration between Pfizer and the German company BioNTech. “Without a commitment now, we risk eroding the sensitive ecosystem of people, infrastructure, and ideas that spans borders and enables the UK to punch well above its weight,” Ramakrishnan said. He said remaining in the EU programme was vital to ensure the UK that “talented individuals” remained in the country and Britain retained its influence globally in science. He added: “Critically, this will help avert major disruption to our science capability in the coming months as we respond to Covid-19.” The Royal Society points out that the UK has received more than £1.5bn from Horizon programmes with another £776m coming from Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions grants with breakthroughs. The UK and the EU are in the last stages of trying to thrash out a deal with a 19 November deadline for a final outcome looming. Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, is in London until Friday but sources say “talks are not going well this week at all”. They say the UK is being consistent with its past by putting “its bazooka on the table” with the expectation that it can seal a deal at the last minute.
A government spokesperson said: “Negotiations are ongoing. We’ve been clear that where it’s in the UK’s interests, we are considering participating in EU programmes, including Horizon Europe, where they represent a real benefit to British people and industry, provided the UK can secure participation on acceptable terms.”"
2020-11-12T07:12:03Z,politics,Politics,Lee Cain: Johnson's senior aide resigns amid infighting at No 10,"A row has broken out at the heart of Downing Street as one of Boris Johnson’s most senior aides – and a close ally of Dominic Cummings - resigned amid bitter infighting. Lee Cain announced he would step down as director of communications on Wednesday night after ministers and advisers including Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, are said to have protested over his planned promotion to chief of staff. Cain’s resignation also threw into doubt the future of Cummings, Johnson’s most senior and high-profile adviser, with one insider telling the Guardian that he could depart No 10 alongside Cain. Cummings was said to be furious that Cain, a fellow Vote Leave campaigner who was partly credited with bringing him into No 10, had in effect been forced out. There was also speculation about other potential departures from Johnson’s inner circle. Meanwhile some Tory MPs were buoyed by the turmoil, with one claiming it was a chance for Johnson to get “out of the grip of these people”. The row appears to reflect internal turmoil and dysfunction in No 10 at a time when the UK surpassed 50,000 deaths from the coronavirus, according to official figures. Critics of the government have repeatedly cited how tensions between senior members of Johnson’s team – and his refusal to sack Cummings earlier this year – have hindered the country’s efforts to get on top of the pandemic. As the internal rows were thrown into the public spotlight on Wednesday, the extent of division and disagreement within Johnson’s senior team emerged. About a week ago Johnson offered the new chief of staff position to Cain, 39, who was regarded as one of his most loyal and low-key longstanding staffers, and the adviser had been considering whether he should accept. Friends indicated that Cain had been thinking about leaving Downing Street “once the government had got over the hump of Covid” – partly because of the relentless nature of the job and also because of clashes with the incoming Downing Street spokeswoman Allegra Stratton – until Johnson made his unexpected offer. Cain is known to have been uneasy with the choice of Stratton, also 39, for press secretary and he had previously clashed with Symonds. His pugnacious style with MPs and special advisers meant a number expressed outrage to No 10 at his potential promotion, which would have made him one of three key people in the prime minister’s inner circle, along with Cummings and cabinet secretary Simon Case. Allies of Cain said he had been acting as an effective chief of staff for some time, taking part in major strategic decisions including a Chequers summit in April about easing lockdown. Special advisers’ WhatsApp groups were “nuclear” on Wednesday night, one Whitehall source said, with a number speculating about what Cain’s departure could mean for the planned communications shake-up across Westminster. A number of Conservative MPs expressed delight at the row. One MP said it was “a chance to get the old Boris back and out of the grip of these people”. Another said MPs would be “over the moon” if Cummings also departed. One senior MP said they believed it was a sign that the battle for influence with the prime minister was being slowly won by Symonds and her allies, rather than Cummings. “Boris must take this chance to pivot back to being the liberal unifier, sack a chunk of these cabinet no-hopers and start a new team, but it does look like tonight that Carrie and those urging a more inclusive Boris are winning.” Cain will leave No 10 at the end of the year, saying he had made the decision “after careful consideration”. It is understood he met Johnson in Downing Street on Wednesday evening but ultimately decided to go. “It has been a privilege to work as an adviser for Mr Johnson for the last three years – being part of a team that helped him win the Tory leadership contest, secure the largest Conservative majority for three decades – and it was an honour to be asked to serve as the prime minister’s chief of staff,” he said. “I would like to thank all the team at No 10 – including the many unsung and incredibly talented civil servants – for their hard work and support during the last 18 months. “And most of all I would like to thank the prime minister for his loyalty and leadership. I have no doubt that under his premiership the country will deliver on the promises made in the 2019 election campaign and build back better from the coronavirus pandemic.” James Slack, the prime minister’s official spokesman and the former political editor of the Daily Mail, is set to take over as director of communications. Allies of Cain said he had taken time off over the past few days to consider his position, described by one friend as a “circuit breaker”. The comment was meant jokingly but was also a nod to the pressures Cain had been under. Cain is a longtime adviser to Johnson, including during his time as foreign secretary and while on the backbenches after his resignation. The pair are particularly close, with Cain staying loyal to Johnson even when the former mayor of London’s star appeared to be fading among Tories. A former Daily Mirror journalist who once dressed as a chicken to taunt Tory prime minister David Cameron, Cain is close to Cummings from their time working on the Vote Leave campaign, and is partly credited with bringing him into Downing Street. A new chief of staff is set to take over the day-to-day running of the Downing Street operation, currently overseen by Cummings, to allow him to step back and focus on key policy objectives, such as Whitehall reform. Cummings’ journey to Durham from London at the height of lockdown in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic – and Johnson’s refusal to sack him as a result – became one of the biggest government crises of the year. It was revealed following an investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror. Critics said the prime minister was so dependent on Cummings, who has vowed to overhaul the civil service and hire “weirdos and misfits” to join the No 10 team, that he risked the wrath of the public and Tory MPs rather than lose his most senior aide. One former Whitehall colleague of Cain’s said: “The backbenches will be heartened to see a broader group of people influencing the prime minister and Number 10. Lee Cain was a divisive figure although I don’t think anyone will cheer that there is this upheaval in the middle of a pandemic. James Slack is well liked and, with Allegra Stratton’s appointment too, people will be reassured by this change in direction.” Johnson paid tribute to Cain and said he would be much missed. “‘I want to thank Lee for his extraordinary service to the government over the last four years,” he said. “He has been a true ally and friend and I am very glad that he will remain director of communications until the new year and to help restructure the operation. He will be much missed.” A Labour spokesperson said: “On the day the UK became the first country in Europe to report 50,000 coronavirus deaths and the public endure another lockdown, Boris Johnson’s government is fighting like rats in a sack over who gets what job. “It is precisely this lack of focus and rank incompetence that has held Britain back. The public deserve better than this incompetent and divided Conservative government.”"
2020-11-11T22:45:10Z,politics,Politics,Lee Cain: Johnson loyalist who turned down chief of staff role,"Lee Cain was the loyal Boris Johnson adviser who chose to resign just as it looked like he might become the prime minister’s chief of staff. While his friend and ally Dominic Cummings dominates Whitehall, the 39-year-old Downing Street director of communications had remained resolutely low key, preferring to brief journalists rather than be written about. Cain’s loyalty to Johnson was considered stronger than Cummings, making his sudden departure all the more surprising. “While others in No 10 have their own opinions or agendas and are frankly not thinking of the PM, Cain works hard to channel what Johnson wanted,” said a former special adviser who departed after last December’s election.
Insiders added that Cain’s role had been strategic for some time. A key period, it is said, was in April, when Johnson was hospitalised with coronavirus and Cummings was also off sick. Cain had to cover for Cummings and was “running the show in many ways”, the former aide said. But his closeness to the abrasive Cummings created problems as the government struggled with the pandemic crisis. There was speculation of tension with Carrie Symonds, another former special adviser, now engaged to the prime minister. But when asked, Cain would confidently dismiss the issue, saying “me and the boss are tight”. Johnson values loyalty and Cain has displayed it, although, unlike many Tory apparatchiks, he arrived on the scene relatively late. Cain went to Ormskirk grammar school in Lancashire and Staffordshire University, before starting a career in journalism working first for local papers, including the Gloucester Citizen, before moving briefly to the Sun and then the Labour-supporting Mirror. He spent time as the Mirror Chicken during the 2010 election campaign, taunting Conservative leader David Cameron in feathered fancy dress. “Malcolm Clucker,” the paper read when it broke the story last year. The spinner saw the funny side of the improbable episode; a framed copy of the front page is in his Downing Street office. Cain’s journalism career had stalled and he was working as a legal PR when he applied to join Vote Leave as head of broadcast in early 2016. His political career took off. After the surprise Brexit vote, Cain was rewarded with a special adviser’s job and went to work for Johnson at the Foreign Office, where the two became close.
When Johnson resigned and joined the backbenches over Brexit, Cain stayed on as his adviser. He even worked without pay for a while, telling reporters he believed “the boss would come good”. As Theresa May’s grip on power weakened, Cain worked reporters on the left and right in Westminster’s tearoom and at nearby bars, often briefing against the then prime minister. Yet the clubbable nature comes with a pugnacious streak. Frustrations with the media coverage at the beginning of Johnson’s premiership led to Cain banning ministers from Radio 4’s Today programme, Channel 4 News and other outlets. Critics described the approach as Trumpian but Cain was happy to pick the fight, arguing that Today had a pro-remain bias, as demonstrated by recording programmes from university campuses. “The ban will stop when they better understand the country,” he said. It was ultimately Covid-19 that forced Cain to make peace with the BBC, although there are ongoing feuds with others such as Piers Morgan at ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Friends said the relentless, combative nature of the job led Cain to contemplate leaving Downing Street “once the government had got over the hump of Covid”. About a week ago, Johnson asked him to become chief of staff, presenting the loyalist with an unexpected dilemma. Few, though, expected him to quit: that he did so suggested the change on offer struck him as less of a promotion than it might have first appeared."
2020-11-11T20:40:22Z,politics,Politics,Vote Leave's Lee Cain tipped as next Downing Street chief of staff,"One of Boris Johnson’s most loyal allies, Lee Cain is considering an offer to be Downing Street’s chief of staff, in a move that would consolidate the power of former Vote Leave officials around the prime minister. Cain’s appointment, which is not confirmed, will cause ructions in Westminster, including among special advisers and ministers who had been hoping for an outsider to be appointed to the key role. It is understood that Johnson offered Cain, currently director of communications, the position around a week ago, and the adviser has been considering whether he should accept. Friends indicated that Cain had been considering leaving Downing Street “once the government had got over the hump of Covid,” partly because of the relentless nature of the job, until Johnson had unexpectedly made his offer. In his current role, Cain has been increasingly centralising government communications in Downing Street and will oversee the new Downing Street spokeswoman, Allegra Stratton, who will be the face of Downing Street’s new daily televised press briefings. Cain is known to have been uneasy with the choice of Stratton for press secretary and he has also previously clashed with Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. Other Whitehall sources said Cain’s appointment as chief of staff, first reported by the Times, was a long way from being certain. A number of government sources expressed surprise at the idea that Cain would be considered.
Cain – currently No 10’s director of communications – is a longtime adviser to Johnson, including during his time as foreign secretary and while on the backbenches after his resignation. The pair are particularly close, with Cain staying loyal to Johnson even when the former mayor of London’s star appeared to be faltering amongst Tories. A former tabloid journalist, Cain is close to the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings from their time working on Vote Leave, and partly credited with bringing him into Downing Street. A new chief of staff is set to take over the day-to-day running of the Downing Street operation, currently overseen by Cummings, to allow him to step back and focus on key policy objectives, such as Whitehall reform. Should Cain accept role, Johnson’s inner circle would be Cain, Cummings, as well as Edward Lister, the chief strategic adviser and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. Runners and riders who have been tipped for the role including Isaac Levido, the Australian protege of Tory elections guru Lynton Crosby, who ran the 2019 election campaign, Johnson’s foreign policy adviser John Bew, Paul Stephenson – another Vote Leave veteran – and Gabriel Milland, a former spad and close to Cummings who now runs the agency Public First. However, a number of those rumoured to be in demand for the role by No 10 run their own lucrative communications operations and would need some convincing to join government. Andrew Feldman, the former Tory party chairman, has reportedly turned down any overtures to persuade him to apply for the role. Cain caused a stir earlier in the year when political journalists boycotted a Downing Street briefing after he banned selected reporters from attending. The confrontation took place inside No 10 after Cain tried to exclude reporters from the Mirror, the i, HuffPost, PoliticsHome, the Independent and others from an official government briefing. Labour accused Johnson of deploying Donald Trump-like tactics to avoid scrutiny. Among those who refused the briefing on the UK’s trade negotiations with the EU were the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston and political journalists from Sky News, the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, the Sun, the Financial Times and the Guardian. The briefing was due to be given by government officials, who are meant to be politically neutral, but did not happen because of the walkout."
2020-11-11T19:31:10Z,politics,Politics,Dissatisfied Tory MPs flock to ERG-inspired pressure groups,"Conservative MPs who see the government as remote or lacking a policy agenda are flocking to backbench pressure groups in the hope of forcing Downing Street to listen to their concerns. After the success of the European Research Group in shaping Brexit policy, a string of new groups have been set up in recent months with a remit on issues from migration to criticism of “the woke agenda”. They claim they have their finger on the pulse of the subjects which voters in the party’s treasured new “red wall” seats care about. One MP who is a member of two of the new groups told the Guardian: “I would say we are ready for a culture war, and we are confident that our policy agenda will help win it.” The latest of the groups, the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), was announced on Tuesday and appears to pose the most direct threat of rebellion over the government’s policies on lockdown. It is led by the ERG veteran Steve Baker, who one member said was “the best whip in Westminster”. It launched with 50 members and at least 10 more have joined its ranks in the last 24 hours, the Guardian understands. The Common Sense Group, which launched quietly in the summer with about 40 members, was the subject of a front-page story in the Daily Telegraph this week after it accused the National Trust of being “coloured by cultural Marxist dogma” and in the grip of “elite bourgeois liberals” over a report acknowledging links between its properties and slavery. It now has 59 MPs and 7 members of the House of Lords in its ranks. Sir John Hayes, the founder of the group, told the Guardian: “The ERG has served an important role, but it has very largely done its work. The government has to decide what its defining purpose is beyond Brexit. There’s a thirst in the party to have an open debate about what the direction should be now. There’s a different kind of Conservative family emerging.” One member of the group, Jonathan Gullis, posted a “CULTURE WAR ALERT” on Facebook last month telling his followers that research by Greenwich Maritime Museum into the Royal Navy’s links to slavery was “leftwing ideological nonsense”. Members have met with Priti Patel to discuss their views on immigration. “We had a Zoom meeting with Priti within two or three days of forming, and I hope we did have some influence, help to shape the thinking,” Hayes said.
On Wednesday, members of the Northern Research Group (NRG) used a Westminster Hall debate to call on the government to set out a “northern economic recovery plan”. One member, Southport MP Damien Moore, told the minister Kemi Badenoch: “We can’t just hope our way out of this crisis.” Henry Hill, news editor at the Conservative Home website, said that the groups had formed because “whereas with Thatcher or Cameron you had a coherent ‘-ism’, with Johnson you don’t really have one of those. There are just whole areas of policy where Johnsonism isn’t a thing.” The CRG has been modelled on the ERG, which was tightly organised, commissioned in-depth reports, had official briefings for journalists and MPs, and employed a staff researcher who handled communications. The new group has already engaged the services of Ed Barker, a seasoned Tory PR professional and former parliamentary candidate who worked for the pro-Brexit group Global Britain and for Esther McVey’s short-lived leadership campaign. Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, who was one of the first “red wall” group of Tories to be elected, in 2017, is a member of the Common Sense Group and the NRG. He said the spate of new groups reflected the priorities of a new kind of Tory MP, drawing comparisons with some of the thinktanks that emerged under Theresa May, like the free-market group Freer, and Onward, run by former May advisers Will Tanner and the MP Neil O’Brien.
“When we got in in 2017, there was this proliferation of new groups,” Bradley said. “In 2019, there are also a lot of new ideas coming from seats that have new priorities, levelling up the north, immigration. “This is a mechanism of getting that across. But this time there is senior leadership who are invested too, big guns on the backbenches like Jake Berry, around John Hayes in Common Sense, there’s Esther McVey in [another group] the Blue Collar Conservatives. It’s very much a 2019 viewpoint that has found a wider reception.” Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, cautioned against groups “being amplified because if a mouthy backbencher is said to represent something it lends them legitimacy”. But he said the “turning of the page” from Brexit had helped create space for such voices. “The energy almost needed somewhere else to go within this closed system,” he said, noting of the CRG that “the journey from Euroscepticism to lockdown scepticism is fairly easy ”. A Tory MP who is part of the CRG said that the new groupings were all viewed as “adversarial” by Downing Street. “The fundamental reason for this is that No 10 is so dominant,” they said. “It’s clear that if you want to be heard, you have to shout. Johnson has no views beyond Brexit. We’re in a particularly odd place where access is limited to a very narrow faction and so it’s hardly surprising if real conservatives are trying to find a way to act.” Some backbenchers on the left of the party are concerned about a new factionalism. One who is aligned with the One Nation Group of soft-right Conservatives said they feared the emergence of multiple “parties within a party”. The MP added: “I’m wary of some of these endeavours, given the grief they wrought on the party last year. But it should be said that you don’t have to be a headbanger to think that the sphere of influence in No 10 is too small and that groups that put pressure on things that Tory voters care about is not necessarily a bad thing.”"
2020-11-11T19:28:07Z,politics,Politics,Government review urges major overhaul of capital gains tax,"A tax raid on buy-to-let properties and other forms of wealth could raise up to £14bn to help repair the government’s battered finances, after a report commissioned by the chancellor recommended a major overhaul of capital gains tax. Flagging a tax squeeze on the well-off to help pay for coronavirus, the maximum capital gains tax (CGT) rate of 28% could be raised by Rishi Sunak closer to income tax rates, where the top rates are 40% and 45% in England and Wales.
Under the proposals, there could also be deep cuts in the profits that share investors can make without paying tax, and other technical adjustments that could, in effect, push up inheritance tax bills. The findings of the review come as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed Britain’s national debt to more than £2tn, or more than 100% of GDP, as spending has soared and tax receipts have collapsed dramatically. The budget deficit – the annual shortfall between spending and tax income – is expected to balloon to reach than £400bn this year, amid forecasts that the pandemic will push the country into a double-dip recession. The proposals are contained in a report from the Office of Tax Simplification, which was set up by the former chancellor, George Osborne, and was asked by Sunak in July to compare CGT with other taxes and make proposals in order to iron out distortions. The changes called for by the OTS are similar to plans laid out by the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn ahead of the 2019 election, as part of proposed reforms to reduce soaring levels of wealth inequality in the UK. About £8.3bn of capital gains tax was paid in 2017-18, compared with £180bn of income tax by 31.2 million individual taxpayers. Bill Dodwell, tax director of the OTS, said: “If the government considers the simplification priority is to reduce distortions to behaviour, it should consider either more closely aligning capital gains tax rates with income tax rates, or addressing boundary issues as between capital gains tax and income tax.”
Currently there are four different rates of CGT. For basic rate income tax payers, the CGT levy is 18% on second homes and buy to lets, and 10% on other assets. For higher rate taxpayers, the rates are 28% and 20% respectively. The OTS said: “A rough static costing suggests that alignment of CGT rates with income tax rates could theoretically raise an additional £14bn a year for the exchequer.” However, it also noted that the final figure could be substantially less, due to “behavioural effects” such as people choosing to delay the sale of a property. The OTS stressed it was not calling for higher taxes, as setting rates was government policy. Landlords who have made large profits since investing in buy to let in the mid-1990s would likely to be among the big losers from any rise in CGT. However, rather than triggering a CGT charge by selling a buy to let, landlords may instead choose to hold on to the property. Alternatively, there could also be a rush to sell before higher CGT rates come in. The annual CGT allowance, called the annual exempt amount (AEA), could also be under threat. The allowance means that the first £12,300 of profits from trading in shares and property is currently free of CGT. But the OTS said the government “should consider reducing its level” to between £2,000 and £4,000. The report said: “The AEA clearly distorted investment decisions. Around 50,000 people report gains annually close to the threshold and so ‘use up’ the annual exempt amount as if it were an allowance – which is particularly easy for holders of listed share portfolios.” Robert Palmer, the executive director of Tax Justice UK, said polling by the campaign group had found Britons would support higher levies on wealth. “A hedge fund manager earning millions from their wealth should pay higher tax rates than a nurse. But the current rules mean some people earning millions can get away with rates as low as 10%,” he said. “As we build back from coronavirus, this should be a no-brainer for Rishi Sunak.” The Resolution Foundation urged the government to raise £40bn by launching a health and social care levy and imposing a windfall tax on pandemic profits to fix the public finances after the Covid-19 outbreak recedes. It said a special tax to pay for the health service would consist of a 4% annual flat tax rate on all incomes, including capital gains, over £12,500. There would be offsets for people earning below £19,500. A pandemic profits levy of 10% on supra-normal profits of the small minority of firms that have done better than normal in 2020, such as big technology firms, could also be used to raise raising a one-off £130m. Warning that the government was on track for a £400bn deficit this year, the thinktank said wealth taxes should also be used in response, and that corporation tax should also be increased to raise billions of pounds for the exchequer. However, it called on the chancellor to delay the task of repairing the public finances until the economy has fully recovered from the pandemic – expected to be 2023 at the earliest – to avoid the mistakes made following the 2008 financial crisis when George Osborne undermined the recovery by launching a decade-long austerity drive."
2020-11-11T18:28:55Z,politics,Politics,Emma Thompson backs launch of UK political fund for women,"A political support fund for women that aims to emulate the success of the influential Emily’s List in the US has launched with the financial backing of actor Emma Thompson. Announcing the first list of candidates from the Activate Collective, Thompson said women, particularly women of colour, disabled women and women on low income, needed financial backing to overcome multiple barriers to entering politics.
“Our political system was built for men who – generally – had women to do everything else for them – caring for the elderly and the infirm, sustaining the domestic environment and all the endless and unpaid work that that entails,” said Thompson, who donated £50,000 to kickstart the first round. “We need women from all backgrounds and experiences to get elected in order to make the system work for most people and not just a few.” Sophie Walker, former leader of the Women’s Equality party, who co-founded the fund with former special adviser Vanessa Pine said it hoped to emulate the success of groups such as Emily’s List, which backs pro-choice Democratic female candidates for office in the US. “One of the things I discovered as a total novice politician, was the extent to which the amount of money you have makes a difference to the extent to which your voice can be heard,” she said. “I feel very strongly that there is a massive dearth of women’s voices in politics, and that we particularly need to support women from minoritised communities.” According to research by the organisation, less than a third of MPs are women in the UK, while black and minority ethnic (BAME) women make up 4% of MPs, compared with 6.5% of the population. Just two female MPs identify as disabled. There are no female metro mayors, while nine in 10 seats in devolved cabinets are occupied by men. Walker and Pine paid tribute to the #AskHerToStand campaign by 50:50 Parliament, but said that without practical and financial support women would struggle to succeed. Activate, which receives funding from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, has also created a Community Activist Fund to form a pipeline for future candidates, and is working with academics to research the barriers to better representation. Its first list of candidates includes Labour’s Jessie Joe Jacobs, who hopes to become England’s first metro mayor in Tees Valley, Mandu Reid, Women’s Equality party candidate for London mayor and Molly Samuel-Leport, Conservative candidate for the Greater London Assembly. The list includes eight women of colour, one disabled woman and one care leaver, while seven of the 11 identify as working class.
“As a black woman, I don’t see or think there are enough people from my background in politics,” said Molly Samuel-Leport, who is standing for the London assembly. “Without this financial support or encouragement for women like me, none of this would be possible.” With the UK facing an uncertain future and women at risk of facing the sharp end of an economic downturn, the need for more women in parliament was more pressing than ever, said Walker. “At a time when politicians are really scrambling to get answers to the vast questions we are facing about how we support different communities, how we balance work and family life, how we support carers … we need these different perspectives and solutions injected into our politics,” she said."
2020-11-11T18:17:54Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: nearly 600 new deaths in Britain; Manchester appears to have passed second peak - as it happened,"The UK has become the first country in Europe to record more than 50,000 coronavirus deaths according to its main headline measure. With another 595 deaths recorded today, there are now 50,365 people who have died within 28 days of testing positive. If all deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate are included, the total passed 50,000 some time ago and is now over 65,000. (See 4.30pm.) On 17 March, in the week before the first full lockdown was announced, Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, said that a death toll of less than 20,000 deaths would be â€œa good outcomeâ€�. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said that Covid infections seem to have peaked in his region - although hospital cases are still rising. (See 3.45pm.) A vaccine that potentially does not work as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate is still likely to be given to people in the UK in the interests of saving lives at speed, government scientific advisers have said. Students will return to campuses in January using mass testing of the sort to be deployed next month before they go home for Christmas during a travel window, the universities minister has said. A decade of public spending cuts meant the north of England was hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than the rest of England, scientists have said. The ONS has published research showing that 83% of disabled people say they are worried about the effect the pandemic is having on their life, compared to 71% of non-disabled people. One of Boris Johnsonâ€™s most loyal allies, Lee Cain, is in contention to become Downing Street chief of staff, in a move that would consolidate the power of former Vote Leave officials around the prime minister. Boris Johnson has distanced himself from Donald Trump, until recently a close ally, telling MPs that he found it â€œrefreshingâ€� being able to discuss shared values with Joe Biden. (See 1.59pm.) But Labour has said Johnson should condemn Trumpâ€™s refusal to concede defeat in the US election. A summit of EU leaders on 19 November is now viewed in Brussels as the final deadline for a draft Brexit deal, with negotiations on Britainâ€™s future trade and security relationship with the bloc set to go to the wire. Parliamentâ€™s joint committee on human rights has said that it is a matter of â€œintense frustration and concernâ€� that the government is failing to ensure that black people have their human rights protected as much as white people. (See 5.38pm.) Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-11T17:29:18Z,politics,Politics,PMQs truce proves brief as Starmer goes on PR offensive | John Crace,"For a moment it seemed that peace might have broken out between the two party leaders at prime minister’s questions. That after months of slugging it out over the government’s handling of the coronavirus, there was to be a brief period of detente as both parties allowed themselves to enjoy the possibility of an end to the nightmare. True, Boris Johnson hadn’t been able to bring himself to congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but he and Keir Starmer had been able to agree the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trials represented real hope and that war veterans’ charities did great work and needed all the help they could get. That’s about as long as the truce lasted, because the Labour leader then went on the attack. How come Help for Heroes got just £6m from the Treasury when the government had handed out £670k in PR contracts to the vaccine taskforce and £130m to other PR companies over the past year? Boris blustered and feigned surprise that anyone should question his government’s integrity. Obviously it made sense to award contracts initially to friends of friends as it saved all the hassle of having to put them out to public tender. Much like appointing Tory MPs’ wives Kate Bingham and Typhoid Dido to key roles had speeded up the recruitment process for Covid jobs. Why bother to interview someone you’ve already spoken to over dinner? Besides, Johnson continued, the £670k had proved to be money well spent because if it hadn’t been for PR consultants like the ones we had in the UK, then the drug companies would never have got anyone to participate in their trials. It didn’t appear to have occurred to him that this was a job most interns could have done in under a day. Just a quick, no frills 30-second government information film recorded on a mobile phone and broadcast on all channels at prime time (almost certainly at no cost) asking for volunteers to take part in vaccine trials would probably have hoovered up at least 100,000 willing applicants. Hell, I got a request via one of my Covid apps and signed up on the spot. But let’s for a minute consider the possibility that no one would have thought of a public service information film. In which case, a few billboards with some choice slogans should have done the trick. “Would you like the chance to help save a member of your family from Covid-19?” might have hit the spot. Or if that wasn’t hard-hitting enough, then just play a bit dirty with: “How many of your friends and family are you prepared to watch get ill or die before Christmas next year?” That should get people calling in. See, that wasn’t so hard. And because I’m feeling in a giving mood, I’ll let the government have that for mates’ rates of just £150k. Just send it to the usual offshore account. Starmer wasn’t prepared to let Johnson get away with that kind of waffle and started talking about knowing the value of the pound in your pocket. Shades of Harold Wilson there. Keir then went on to ask just how many usable face masks the private contractor Ayanda had delivered to the NHS for £150m (the answer: none) and whether an extra £374m handed out to Randox, the company that recalled 750,000 of its unused testing kits earlier this summer, was money well spent? At which point Boris went off on a long ramble about boxing gloves that didn’t land a knockout blow – most of us were under the impression that the whole point of the vaccine was that it would deliver a knockout blow and life could return near enough to normal – and to accuse Starmer of just being against private business as a matter of principle. Now it was the Labour leader’s turn to look bemused. Nobody had anything against private business. He just wanted to know that what he was getting actually worked and offered value for money. By now Starmer appeared bored by Johnson – a feeling shared by many in the chamber: the man who was supposed to be the great communicator who could reach out to the public has turned out to have the repertoire of an emotionally stunted Bullingdon Club boy – and used his last three questions to address the chancellor, the man he regards as the prime minister-in-waiting. “I know he’s not here,” Keir reminded everyone, “so I suppose you are the next best thing.” That putdown stung Boris – a narcissistic wound too far – and he never really recovered. He had no answer to the Labour leader’s accusations that lives, jobs and money could have been saved if thegovernment had followed both his and Sage’s advice and acted more decisively. There was just time for Labour’s Angela Eagle to ask Johnson if he had any words for Donald Trump and to give him a second chance to congratulate Biden. This time Boris didn’t sidestep the issue. He referred to Trump dismissively as “the previous president” – loyalty and Boris are not close bedfellows and he can spot any lame duck other than himself – and after a few token words about getting on with any president, he went on to say how much he had enjoyed talking to Biden about Cop26. Curiously, Brexit seems to have been not mentioned in the conversation. And that was that. It hadn’t been a vintage PMQs but they seldom are these days. Boris knows he’s going to come out of the half-hour session looking a little shabbier than before and his only goal is to muddy the waters and keep the damage to a bare minimum. And he’d just about managed it. His expectations of himself are now as low as those of his own backbenchers, who have come to dread his public performances. It’s one thing for Johnson to embarrass himself; they had learned to live with that. It was quite another to embarrass the entire government. • This article was amended on 12 November. An earlier version said that Keir Starmer asked Boris Johnson “how many face masks [Ayanda] had delivered for £150m”; this has been amended to make clear that he asked how many “usable” masks had been delivered to the NHS under the contract. Around 50 million masks supplied by Ayanda were later deemed unsuitable for NHS workers because they had been purchased by the DHSC with ear-loops, rather than head-loops."
2020-11-11T16:01:12Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit uncertainty may cause sugar shortages in Northern Ireland, warns firm","Tate & Lyle Sugars, a prominent corporate backer of Brexit, has warned of sugar and syrup shortages in Northern Ireland in the new year, due to lack of clarity over the UK and EU trade relationship. The company is the largest cane sugar brand in the UK and supplies the main supermarkets in Northern Ireland. It has advised retailers to draw up contingency plans to source sugar and syrup from elsewhere, because it will struggle to get its products to them next year, according to ITV News. Tate & Lyle Sugars, which was sold by Tate & Lyle plc to American Sugar Refining in 2010, said the uncertainty over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol was likely to cause significant outages in Northern Ireland. The company owns the Thames Refinery in London, the biggest sugar refinery in Europe. Tate & Lyle Sugars, one of the few large companies that have publicly backed Brexit, has also donated to the Conservatives. It is in line to save £73m from a post-Brexit trade overhaul, after a long lobbying campaign by the firm. Gerald Mason, the senior vice president of Tate & Lyle Sugars, said: “As a responsible supplier, we have been working with our Northern Ireland customers on solutions that will allow us to continue supplying Northern Ireland shoppers after 1 January. “To support that, we need the EU and UK to agree commonsense rules that prioritise the Northern Ireland consumer by recognising there is little risk from allowing existing trade to continue. We know officials on both sides are working hard to negotiate exactly this to ensure security of supply.” The firm took part in a conference call organised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, alongside other manufacturers, retailers and distributors. Associated British Foods (ABF), the company behind Twinings and Ryvita, is also thought to have expressed concerns at the lack of clarity about the future trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. It has a factory in Belfast.
An ABF spokesperson said: “Along with many other participants of the food industry, we are engaged in an open and constructive discussion with officials to identify potential issues, so that solutions can be identified well in advance.” Under the protocol, Northern Ireland will remain in the UK when the transition period ends on 31 December, but will also continue to be part of the single market and enforce the EU’s customs rules from next year. The UK government has promised Northern Ireland businesses “unfettered access” on goods going to the rest of the UK, but this does not apply to goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A government spokesman said: “The UK and the EU have committed to an intensified process of engagement to resolve all outstanding issues with the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol which includes securing the flexibilities we need for trade from Britain to Northern Ireland. “This is particularly important for supermarkets, where we have been clear specific solutions are required. We will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland executive as discussions continue with the EU through the joint committee process.”"
2020-11-11T15:37:17Z,politics,Politics,"UK government must condemn Trump denial of defeat, says Labour","The government should condemn Donald Trump’s refusal to concede defeat in the US election, a stance that poses a danger to democratic values around the world, Keir Starmer’s spokesman said. No 10 has so far refused to criticise the actions of the US president, who has refused to acknowledge the victory of his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and has continued to make baseless claims of voter fraud. “Donald Trump’s actions are wrong and the British government should say so,” a spokesman for the Labour leader said. “Any attempts to undermine democratic process should not be left unchallenged. We call out that in other countries across the world. And we should be able to do so with our friends and allies in America. The actions are deeply concerning.”
Starmer’s spokesman said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had “seemed a bit concerned” about criticising the president’s actions. Johnson and Raab have been repeatedly pressed on whether they believe the president is acting unreasonably. During prime minister’s questions on Wednesday the Labour MP Angela Eagle said Trump’s “continuing refusal to accept the result is both embarrassing for him and dangerous for American democracy”. Johnson said: “I have had a good relationship with the previous president, I do not resile from that. It is the duty of all British prime ministers to have a good relationship with the White House. But I am delighted to find the many areas in which the incoming Biden-Harris administration is able to make common cause with us.” Speaking on Sunday, Raab said: “We really don’t want to get drawn into the cut and thrust, the controversies, the claims, the counter-claims, either in the election or in the immediate aftermath. We respect Americans’ rights to choose for themselves and we respect the checks and balances in the American system which will produce, as they have, a clear result.” The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told ITV’s Peston programme last week that the refusal to criticise Trump was hypocrisy. “If he had been the leader of any other country in the world then the foreign secretary and the prime minister would have called it out. [Trump] is behaving like a tinpot dictator … and it’s not acceptable and it should be called out.”"
2020-11-11T12:11:25Z,politics,Politics,Harry Dunn death: family begins court case against Foreign Office,"The family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old motorcyclist killed outside a US airbase, have begun their court case seeking a ruling that the Foreign Office acted unlawfully in granting diplomatic immunity to the American driver of the car that killed him. Dunn was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car being driven on the wrong side of the road by Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August last year. Sacoolas, whose husband, Jonathan Sacoolas, worked as a technical assistant at the base, left the country two weeks later after the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) accepted a US claim that Sacoolas had immunity on the basis that her husband worked at RAF Croughton, a CIA listening post in Northamptonshire. Subsequent UK government efforts to seek her extradition have been rejected by the US Department of State. The claim for immunity turns on a secret agreement signed between the UK and the US that gave immunity to the staff working at RAF Croughton but only for activities in relation to their work. It was silent on the immunity status of the families of staff. The Foreign Office and the US state department interpreted the silence in the agreement as giving families full immunity. Lawyers acting for Dunn’s family claim it is a perverse interpretation of the agreement to suggest that staff members at the US base had less diplomatic immunity than their family. The FCDO argued that the silence in the secret agreement about the status of staff families was an anomaly, but nevertheless gave these family members immunity. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, subsequently announced that “the US waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction is now expressly extended to the family members of US staff” at the base, “ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements”. The Crown Prosecution Service has charged Sacoolas with death by dangerous driving, and sought her extradition. Lawyers acting for the Dunn family argue that the FCDO breached human rights law by advising Northamptonshire police that Sacoolas had immunity and then keeping key facts from the police, including her imminent departure from the UK. Sacoolas has acknowledged that she was driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Dunn. She had only been in the UK for a few weeks when the collision happened. The two-day judicial review by remote video link is in front of Lord Justice Flaux and Justice Saini. Representing the family, Geoffrey Robertson QC said: “Since family members are not members of the mission and they have no duties, Anne Sacoolas was never entitled to any derivative or implied immunity from criminal jurisdiction.” He added that it would be “absurd” for family members to have “greater privileges and immunities” than the staff at RAF Croughton “from whom their immunity flows”. In written submissions, the FCDO’s barrister Sir James Eadie QC said: “As a matter of international and domestic law, Mrs Sacoolas automatically had diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a member of the administrative and technical staff of the US mission.” He argued the FCDO “plainly did not obstruct the police investigation”, adding: “On the contrary, the secretary of state sought to assist the police investigation, including by requesting a waiver of Mrs Sacoolas’s immunity.” Sir James told the court the US “expressly waived the immunity from the UK’s criminal jurisdiction of ‘employees’ or ‘staff members’, but that “at no point is there a waiver of the immunity enjoyed by the families of such individuals”. But Roberston argued that the FCDO “took upon itself the authority to resolve the question of immunity and ultimately and unlawfully decided to accept the US embassy’s decision that Anne Sacoolas had immunity”. He said in written submissions that the decision “obstructed the police by preventing any effective further progress in its investigation into Harry’s death and likely prosecution of Anne Sacoolas”. Robertson argued the FCDO “tacitly accepted the Sacoolas family’s departure from the UK”, referring to a text message sent to a US embassy official on 14 September 2019 – a day before Sacoolas and her family left the UK. The message read: “I think that now the decision has been taken not to waive [immunity], there’s not much mileage in us asking you to keep the family here. “It’s obviously not us approving of their departure but I think you should be able to put them on the next flight out.”"
2020-11-11T11:41:06Z,politics,Politics,EU summit on 19 November seen as deadline for draft Brexit deal,"A summit of EU leaders on 19 November is now viewed in Brussels as the final deadline for a draft Brexit deal, with negotiations on Britain’s future trade and security relationship with the bloc set to go to the wire. Negotiators working in London had hoped to be able to pass on a deal to MEPs for scrutiny by 18 November to allow time for parliamentary ratification but the talks remain difficult, according to sources on both sides. Next Thursday’s video conference summit of the 27 heads of state and government, arranged to discuss the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic, is being seen as a key moment in the Brexit saga. “If there isn’t good news by then, then you really have to say that time is up – it just isn’t possible,” said one senior EU diplomat. “The leaders will need to see that it is there.” A final arbitration session between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is also a possibility should the negotiators move closer to each other’s positions on the outstanding issues. The thorniest problems to resolve remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, how to maintain fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. UK sources have complained that Brussels has as yet failed to show enough “realism” about the scale of the change to the level of fishing opportunities the EU member states’ fleet will have in Britain’s exclusive economic zone from next year. On ensuring a “level playing field” for businesses in the UK and the EU, progress is being made on how the two sides’ domestic subsidy regimes would operate but difficulties remain in establishing a mechanism whereby a baseline of environmental, labour and social standards would develop in tandem for both sides. Downing Street has insisted the UK needs to be able to diverge its rulebook, while the EU has said it will not grant a “zero tariff, zero quota” deal if British companies are not operating under rules that are at least equivalent to those set by Brussels. A UK source said: “We have a different view from the EU on what is appropriate on level playing field issues. We have been clear that we can look at common principles for our different subsidy systems and perhaps even at the ability to act if a major subsidy genuinely distorts trade. “What we can’t agree to are arrangements which would require us to operate systems of laws equivalent to the EU’s and make us pay a penalty if we moved away from them. We need policy space to decide what is in the UK’s interest in the future. That is the very essence of what Brexit is about.” Despite the difficulties, the prime minister said on Sunday that a trade and security deal was “there to be done” and that the broad outline was already “pretty clear”. Johnson spoke to Von der Leyen on Saturday. The sliding Brexit timeline will be a cause for concern in the European parliament, where MEPs had insisted they would need to have the agreement in front of them by next Monday to start the ratification process. It was hoped that the parliament would vote on the deal on 16 December. Sources in the European parliament said an extraordinary sitting of the chamber may need to be arranged for 28 December – three days before the end of the transition period when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he believed a deal would be struck despite the differences between the two sides. He said: “I think we may well be likely to go into next week on these negotiations. We’re not there yet. What I would say is the UK government understand only too well what’s needed for an agreement here. I don’t believe the EU ask is unreasonable and the EU also needs to show some compromise to accommodate many British asks. “If we can overcome those issues, in particular fish which is very emotive and very political then I think we can get a deal done. If we can’t get a deal done it will represent an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy.””"
2020-11-11T00:01:22Z,politics,Politics,Inquiry raises concerns over how £3.6bn towns fund was distributed,"An inquiry by parliament’s spending watchdog into how ministers distributed £3.6bn to help deprived towns has raised serious concerns that funding decisions were politically biased. The cross-party public accounts committee said it was “not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others” when the towns fund was distributed by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, (MHCLG) last year. Justifications offered by ministers for selecting individual towns were “vague and based on sweeping assumptions” and raised concerns over the decisions being politically motivated, the committee said. The highly critical report comes after the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, earlier this year denied having any role in selecting his constituency, Newark, for a £25m grant under the scheme, despite having boasted about it during last year’s general election. Jenrick said the award had been signed off by the then communities minister Jake Berry, while he had approved a grant for Darwen in Berry’s constituency. Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, said the system gave “every appearance of having been politically motivated”. “MHCLG must be open and transparent about the decisions it made to hand out those billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money, and what it expects to deliver,” she said. The scheme was originally launched “at pace” in July 2019 to support struggling towns across England. Officials in the department then drew up a ranked priority list of 541 towns based on need and potential for development for ministers to select from. While the top 40 “high priority” locations were all confirmed, ministers then picked another 61 “medium and low priority” communities from across the rest of the list including one ranked just 536th. Although the department was supposed to record the “rationale” for choosing some towns and not others, the committee said it was “not convinced” by some of the reasons given. “The selection process was not impartial,” they concluded. The committee also complained that the reasons given by the department for not publishing more information about the selection process were “weak and unconvincing”. It said concerns had been heightened by press statements which wrongly claimed the National Audit Office had concluded that its procedures were “robust”. While the department’s permanent secretary, Jeremy Pocklington, said he was satisfied the requirements of “propriety and regularity” had been met, the committee said it was “disappointed” that a summary of his assessment remained unpublished. “This lack of transparency has fuelled accusations of political bias in the selection process, and has risked the civil service’s reputation for integrity and impartiality,” it said. The MHCLG responded to the report with a statement rejecting the main conclusions. A spokesperson said: “We completely disagree with the committee’s criticism of the town fund selection process, which was comprehensive, robust and fair. “The towns fund will help level up the country, creating jobs and building stronger and more resilient local economies.”"
2020-11-10T21:17:18Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson phones to congratulate Joe Biden and discuss 'close' relationship,"Boris Johnson has spoken to Joe Biden to congratulate him on his victory over Donald Trump and allay fears Brexit could damage the Northern Ireland peace process, as world leaders lined up to speak to the US president-elect. Johnson was the second world leader to reveal he had spoken to Biden, after the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, did so on Monday. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said they had also received a call on Tuesday. “I just spoke Joe Biden to congratulate him on his election. I look forward to strengthening the partnership between our countries and to working with him on our shared priorities – from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic,” Johnson tweeted. Johnson and Biden are understood to have spoken for around 25 minutes from 4pm on Tuesday in a wide-ranging conversation on trade, Nato and democracy. Biden’s transition team said he thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and expressed his desire to “strengthen the special relationship” and “reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday agreement”. Downing Street said Johnson “warmly congratulated” Biden on his victory and “conveyed his congratulations to vice-president-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement”, but the official account did not specifically mention Brexit. However, a No 10 source said: “They talked about the importance of implementing Brexit in such a way that upholds the Good Friday agreement, and the PM assured the president-elect that would be the case.” Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has criticised Johnson’s intention to renege on parts of the EU withdrawal agreement in new Brexit legislation, and said that a US-UK trade deal was contingent on upholding the Good Friday agreement. Theresa May was 10th in line when Trump was elected in November 2016, after Ireland, Turkey, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Israel, Australia and South Korea. Trump told May casually that “if you travel to the US you should let me know” – far short of an official invitation. Downing Street said the president-elect had been invited to attend the Cop26 climate crisis summit the UK was hosting in Glasgow next year, and the G7 Summit, also being hosted by the UK next year.
Johnson and Biden have never met, although Biden allies have been disparaging about the prime minister. They include a former aide to Barack Obama, who said Democrats had not forgotten about Johnson’s suggestion the “part-Kenyan” former president held an “ancestral dislike of the British empire”. However, Downing Street has emphasised that the two leaders have much in common, in particular a commitment to tackling the climate emergency, which was not shared with the Trump administration. Over the weekend, Johnson said there was “far more that unites the government of this country and government in Washington any time, any stage, than divides us”. He added: “I think now, with president Biden in the White House in Washington, we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change. And the UK, as you know, was the first major country to set out that objective of net zero by 2050. “We led the way a few years ago. And we’re really hopeful now that president Biden will follow and will help us to deliver a really good outcome of the Cop26 summit next year in Glasgow.” Senator Chris Coons, a close friend and ally of the president-elect, said he hoped Biden would look beyond the caricature of the UK prime minister. “In my meetings with the prime minister, he’s struck me as someone who is more agile, engaging, educated and forward-looking than perhaps the caricature of him in the American press would have suggested,” he said. “I found an engaging person to meet with and speak to and it’s my hope that president-elect Biden will have a similar experience.” The UK foreign office permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton, rejected claims that Britain was trying to have it both ways by congratulating Biden but saying that some processes were “still playing out” in the US, a reference to Trump’s refusal to accept the election result. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the committee, accused Barton of relying on inertia and presiding over a half-hearted and incompetent congratulation. He said he did not see any of the necessary flair coming from the Foreign Office to build the personal relationships on which successful diplomacy rested. PA Media contributed to this report"
2020-11-10T20:08:22Z,politics,Politics,UK trade department faces race to get £80bn of trade agreements ratified,"Liz Truss’s Department for International Trade (DIT) is scrambling to meet a Wednesday deadline for tabling £80bn of trade agreements before parliament, in time for them to come into force in January under standard procedures. Truss’s department has signed a string of “continuity agreements” to ensure the UK can go on trading with non-EU countries on similar terms, when the Brexit transition period comes to an end on 31 December. Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (Crag) passed in 2010, international treaties have to be laid before parliament for 21 sitting days before they can be ratified.
With parliament due to rise for Christmas on 17 December, as of this Thursday only 21 sitting days remain before the new year. DIT published parliamentary reports on two deals, with Ukraine and Ivory Coast, on Monday, and details of the Japan deal struck in September have also already been published for MPs to scrutinise. But talks are not yet completed with 15 countries, including Canada, Turkey and Singapore. The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, has written to Truss, urging her to explain the delay, and demanding she update parliament on the process. In the letter, Thornberry said that during 2019 there was “clear momentum behind this process”, with 20 continuity agreements made. “However, as your department’s focus switched in 2020 to the talks on potential new free trade agreements with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the [comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership] CPTPP, as well as an enhanced continuity agreement with Japan, last year’s momentum appeared to die out,” Thornberry said. “Not a single additional continuity agreement was secured in the first eight months of 2020, and in their correspondence with the shadow international trade team, representatives of countries ranging from Cameroon to Montenegro have reported that no formal talks were even conducted in that period.” Thornberry said that while Truss had promised agreements would be shared confidentially with the Commons international trade committee, this had not happened for in-progress deals with Ukraine, Ivory Coast and Kenya, and would be now impossible with the 15 outstanding examples. “What makes this abysmal and shambolic state of affairs all the worse is that when we look at the length of time your department has had to get these agreements in place, ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny, and protect our continued free trade, it has been so totally avoidable,” the letter said. “In many cases, your department has had more than four years since the Brexit referendum to secure the 15 outstanding continuity agreements.” Without a continuity agreement in place, trade with these countries would revert to less favourable World Trade Organization terms. However, DIT argues that it is not uncommon for countries to use a provisional application, meaning a renewed trade deal would come into force before the 21-day period begins or is completed. But Thornberry’s letter argues that it would be “very regrettable” to do this, or to use an “exceptional cases” provision under the Crag law: “Those provisions exist to cater for unusual circumstances, not to cover for entirely avoidable incompetence.” The DIT said: “We are considering all possible options to maintain continuity of existing trade terms and will look to sign further agreements in the coming weeks. “We are working with our partners to ensure that signed continuity agreements with all 52 partner countries are able to enter into force after the end of the transition period.” Its spokesperson added: “It is misleading to say there’s a hard deadline on this,” claiming Truss had not promised to share deals with the committee 10 days in advance of laying them before parliament. Truss told the House of Commons last month: “We will always endeavour to make sure the committees have at least 10 sitting days to read through these on a confidential basis, as we are doing for this deal.”"
2020-11-10T18:40:12Z,politics,Politics,Typhoid Dido proves fluent in management bollocks and contradiction | John Crace,"Towards the end of his interview on the Today programme, Matt Hancock was asked if Kate Bingham, the head of the UK vaccines taskforce, was right to hand out £670,000 in PR contracts to some of her old muckers. Of course, the health secretary insisted, because she had done a great job in procuring possible vaccines. Then Matt doubled down. “I would go out of my way to thank Kate Bingham,” he said. The £670,000 in unnecessary media advisers was just a sideshow. A political distraction. “She has given up six months of her life to help the government,” he concluded with a flourish. It would be nice if everyone received such gratitude from a government minister just for doing their job. But I guess you win some and you lose some. And to be fair, not many people have gone out of their way to praise Hancock for the job he has done. There again he hasn’t always done it that well.
Which brings us nicely on to Dido Harding, the chief exec of the misnamed NHS test and trace, given that most contracts have been outsourced to private companies. Fair to say that test and trace has failed on even the mediocre metrics it has set itself under Harding’s leadership. And yet she is somehow untouchable. If anyone else had presided over this mess they would have been on a last warning at the very least, but Typhoid Dido continues on serenely. It probably helps that, like Bingham, she is married to a Tory MP – there must be a lot of Conservative partners upset to have missed out on this avenue for preferment – but what most counts in her favour is that she at least is doing it for nothing. Call it charity work. And it’s hard to moan too much if someone is useless when they are paid nothing to be useless. Nevertheless, Typhoid Dido still finds herself accountable for what is one of the most important strategies for controlling the spread of coronavirus and she today found herself giving evidence to the health and science select committees on progress so far. Or rather the lack of it. To her credit, Harding is at least a trier. She has the appearance of someone prepared to put the hours in, even if they aren’t always put to much obvious use. The session started with some quibbles over numbers. How much of the test and trace was done nationally and how much locally, asked Greg Clark. “We have a team of teams,” replied Harding, “and are locally led but nationally supported”. If nothing else Typhoid Dido is fluent in management bollocks. Clark tried to press her on the exact figures. “I’m afraid I don’t have the exact numbers to hand,” she shrugged. This was to become a constant refrain throughout the two hours she was before the committee. Jeremy Hunt was next to press Harding on the details. By his estimates, test and trace ought to be making contact with 177,000 people per day but was scrabbling around near the 5,000 mark. This was success rate of just 3%. Typhoid Dido thought this was a little unfair – people would be more inclined to isolate if they were paid to do so – and that her organisation was achieving a hit rate of between 10-20%. Hunt pointed out that even this was nothing much to boast about and could explain why Sage had described test and trace as having a marginal effect back in September. For most of the rest of the time Typhoid Dido seemed to do her best to contradict herself. Yes, they had known a second wave was coming but it had been impossible to predict how severe it would be even though every person and their dog had foreseen mayhem when the schools and universities went back. She also tried to lower the expectations of test and trace – “we’re only a small part in the national effort” – before claiming she had built an organisation bigger than Asda. The difference being that Asda does deliver. If the supermarket had been run like test and trace it would have gone out of business years ago. Labour’s Graham Stringer was one of the few to attempt to point out the obvious flaws in Harding’s answers. If it was taking three days to get test results back then the system was dead in the water. Even Harding’s claim that more than 60% of results came back in two days was hardly anything to crow about. Typhoid Dido went silent. “If you want to be effective then you have to provide some answers,” Stringer observed. Though that rather assumed that Harding had ever remembered to ask the questions in the first place. Predictably, the meeting ended with no one much the wiser about anything. Was test and trace an inherently flawed, badly designed system or was Harding just a hopeless chief exec? Or both? Over in the Commons, Hancock was in an unusually good mood. But then he often is when he’s come to the chamber with nothing much to say, as there’s not much that can go wrong. He swore on his life that not one Danish mink would infect a single Brit, before repeating the news about the vaccine that the prime minister and others had released the day before and ending by re-announcing that the quick result lateral flow test being piloted in Liverpool was going to be extended to 67 other regions. Not even the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, could quibble with that and basically just gave Door Matt the thumbs up. As did everyone else. After months of nothing but bad news, MPs from all sides could do with something vaguely positive. No one knew if the vaccine would work or if the lateral flow tests would be of much value, but just for today they were going to take time off from the shit hitting the fan and allow themselves a moment of hope. However slender."
2020-11-10T18:03:50Z,politics,Politics,"No need for border checks on Northern Ireland supermarket food, Foster tells EU","Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s first minister has written to the EU urging it to think twice about risking daily food supplies to local supermarkets with mandatory Brexit health checks from 1 January. J Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer have warned that certain lines of meat, fish and dairy products may be restricted because of the checks that will be imposed on food and animals entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain from 1 January. The DUP leader and Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minster, said they have “urgently asked the EU to consider the serious implications and impact on our essential food and produce supply chains”. They argue it is “simply not credible” to impose health checks at ports on “goods [that] are sterling packaged by well established companies”, which pose “zero risk that they would use a backdoor” into Ireland and thereby the single market.
In a recent memo on the state of the Brexit talks, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that he does not want a “food scandal there in a few years”, suggesting the EU has yet to agree to waive checks on supermarket suppliers. The EU is concerned over the possibility of infections or outbreaks of diseases such as salmonella crossing the invisible border with the Republic of Ireland if it does not have rigorous checks at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland. The exact nature of these checks is still being discussed at the EU-UK joint committee tasked with implementing Brexit and chaired by Michael Gove and Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the European commission. The confidential update on talks suggests Gove and Šefčovič have yet to agree on the frequency of the checks and the requirement that every product coming in from Great Britain has a health certificate. Last week Sainsbury’s chief executive, Simon Roberts, said the trade needed something akin to a “trusted trader status” to help the free flow of goods. “Customers expect to have access to a full range but [it] won’t be possible to make that available unless something changes.” In a statement Foster said: “It is simply not credible nor in good faith with what the EU committed to on NI to maintain a position that well established supermarket chains such as Iceland, M&S, Tesco or Sainsbury’s cannot be trusted to send goods to NI for circulation in NI.
“It is simply not reasonable for the EU to insist these goods are treated as ‘at risk’ putting food and produce supplies to NI on 1st Jan at risk.” EU representatives said they had received the letter from Foster and O’Neill and were aware of the issues facing supermarkets. The health check rules “are there to protect the health and safety of consumers in the single market, including consumers in Northern Ireland. We are aware, of course, of the concerns raised regarding supermarkets and the import of food products into Northern Ireland”."
2020-11-10T17:53:17Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Hancock to consider using rapid-result tests for people told to self-isolate - as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs he will consider a proposal to use rapid-result testing for people who have been told to self-isolate for 14 days after being in contact with someone testing positive. Hancock spoke after Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and a member of the government’s vaccine taskforce, told MPs that the current self-isolation policy was “massively ineffective” and that the new lateral flow tests, which deliver results very quickly, made it more sensible to test people in this category instead. (See 1.47pm and 12.50pm.) Boris Johnson has had his first call with Joe Biden, the US president-elect. Although not first in the queue for a call with Biden, who spoke to Canada’s Justin Trudeau yesterday, Johnson got to speak to Biden around the same time or ahead of other major European leaders. Fears that he might be snubbed because of his close links with Donald Trump proved unfounded. (See 5.13pm.) Dedicated GP clinics are being established to each deliver nearly 1,000 Covid-19 vaccines a week in England, according to an official document. Dido Harding, the head of the NHS’s test and trace programme, has acknowledged it failed to predict the scale of demand for coronavirus testing as schools and universities returned this autumn. The UK government is under pressure to reconsider cancelling exams in England next summer after Wales called off end-of-year GCSE and A-level tests for its students. The government’s furlough scheme and a recovering economy failed to prevent record redundancies in the period before tougher lockdown restrictions were imposed, according to the latest official data. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-11-10T15:48:44Z,politics,Politics,PR firm hired by UK vaccine tsar linked to Dominic Cummings’ father-in-law,"The UK’s vaccine tsar is to pay almost £700,000 in taxpayers’ money on a team of boutique PR consultants whose secretary is a long-time business associate of Dominic Cummings’ father-in-law. Over the weekend, it was reported that Kate Bingham, the head of the vaccine taskforce, who reports directly to the prime minister, was to spend more than £670,000 hiring PR consultants from a firm called Admiral Associates. The owner and founding managing director of Admiral Associates is listed in companies house as Georgie Cameron, whose husband Angus Collingwood-Cameron is also listed as secretary. He is also a park manager for Chillingham Castle Wild Cattle Association, and a director since 2004 along with Humphry Wakefield, father-in-law of Cummings.
Eight of Cameron’s freelance consultants are overseeing Bingham’s media strategy. There has been growing disquiet after it was claimed Bingham disclosed confidential data about government investment priorities to US financiers before it emerged that she could personally profit from the launch of an investment fund bankrolled by UK taxpayers. Appearing before a joint select committee hearing last week, Bingham denied any wrongdoing and described the report as “nonsense”, “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. On its LinkedIn page, in the only post during the last five months, Admiral Associates appeared to announce it was hiring for the roles to support the UK pandemic response and that they required people skilled in crisis communications. It said experience of working with or within a healthcare or research setting and/or a government department was an advantage and that remuneration would be “excellent for the right candidates”. The overarching company last year reported tangible assets of £2,884 and total equity of £194,065. The company filing said: “The director of the company has elected not to include a copy of the profit and loss account within the financial statements.” The association between Wakefield and the PR company is likely to reignite accusations of a so-called “chumocracy” at the centre of British politics after a number of contracts amid the coronavirus crisis were awarded to allies of the prime minister’s chief of staff without tender. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “These revelations raise yet more serious questions about how taxpayer money is being spent during the pandemic and how government is being run. “The public deserve urgent answers as to how a small PR agency with close links to the PM’s closest adviser was simply gifted such a large contract – and what exactly was delivered for such a price tag. “We know Dominic Cummings doesn’t think the rules apply to him, but this is no way to treat taxpayer money. The prime minister must be transparent about the processes he has put in place to allow such potential breaches of public trust.” According to the Sunday Times, £500,000 has already been spent on the team, which is contracted until the end of the year, suggesting each consultant is on the equivalent of £167,000 a year. There was not been an open procurement process but this is not unusual practice in some circumstances. Bingham, who is married to the Conservative minister Jesse Norman, is herself in a temporary role and had always been expected to step down later this year. The role was not advertised and it has been reported she may have been headhunted by Johnson, from whom she won praise for her work on procuring coronavirus vaccines. It was reported those assisting Bingham, who reports directly to the PM, are helping her prepare for media appearances, drafting statements and overseeing a vaccines podcast on Spotify, which has broadcast eight episodes since August. The preamble for one episode reads: “Developing a vaccine is one thing, but manufacturing it in very large amounts is a significant challenge in itself.” Another episode discusses how to reassure people who may be reluctant to take a vaccine. The apparent PR push comes as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Tuesday he had asked the NHS to get ready for a rollout of the vaccine as soon as next month. The Collingwood-Camerons and Admiral Associates did not return requests for comment. A No 10 spokesperson said: “It is ridiculous to make such an imaginary and tenuous link. Dominic Cummings has never heard of Georgina or Angus Cameron. “Specialist communications support was procured by the Vaccine Taskforce in line with proper practice.”"
2020-11-10T14:36:02Z,politics,Politics,"Major's Scottish independence remarks should be 'wake-up call', says SNP","A Scottish National party MP has said comments by the former prime minister John Major, who said Scots should be allowed another vote on independence provided it is followed by a confirmatory ballot, should act as a “wake-up call” for Boris Johnson. Giving a blistering summation of the “unforgivable” consequences of the Brexit vote at a Middle Temple lecture on Monday, Major warned the UK government that refusing a referendum – with polls showing a consistent majority in favour of independence for the first time – could boost the nationalist cause. The former Conservative leader suggested that Westminster could agree on the basis of two linked votes, the first to vote on the principle of negotiations, and the second on the outcome of them, adding that such a system might have delivered a different result on Brexit.
“The purpose of the second referendum would be that Scottish electors would know what they were voting for, and be able to compare it to what they now have. This did not happen with Brexit; had it done so, there may have been no Brexit,” he said. Responding to Major’s proposals, the SNP’s deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said: “The remarks from the former Tory prime minister must serve as a wake-up call for the current prime minister over his undemocratic stance – straight out of the Trump playbook – to attempt to deny the results of a democratic election by trying to block the people of Scotland from having the right to choose their own future in a referendum”. Last week Johnson’s Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, made clear the UK government would refuse any request for a section 30 order, which would devolve under the Scotland Act 1998 the power to hold a referendum, “for a generation”, even if a pro-independence majority was returned at next spring’s Scottish parliament elections. Asked to define a generation, Jack replied: “Is it 25 years or is it 40 years? You tell me. But it’s certainly not six years, nor 10.” SNP activists will bring an amendment to their party conference at the end of November intended to debate in public the action the party could take if a new section 30 order request is denied. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, has always insisted that any future referendum must be “legal and legitimate”. The SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who brought last year’s prorogation action against the UK government, argued that it was still not clear in law whether Holyrood required the approval of Westminster before a new independence referendum could be legally held, and warned: “Scotland had her fill of Westminster gerrymandering in the 1979 devolution referendum and we are way beyond being fooled again.”"
2020-11-10T13:19:16Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's Biden win tweet contains hidden Trump congratulations,"Downing Street’s congratulatory message to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on winning the US presidential election contains a hidden message congratulating Donald Trump for winning a second term in office. The message, posted on Twitter as an image a few hours after the US TV networks called the election for Biden, congratulates the president-elect on his election, and Harris “on her historic achievement”. But the image, a simple white-on-black block of text, is more than it seems. A simple colour adjustment reveals a second message hidden in the background. Above and behind the words “Joe Biden on his election”, the shadow of the words “Trump on” become faintly visible. Where the main message reads “the US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together”, the words “second term” appear. And below the words “shared priorities” is the phrase “on the future of this”. The message, first reported by the Guido Fawkes blog, suggests that No 10 was preparing for the possibility of congratulating Donald Trump on a re-election long after it had become clear that Joe Biden was winning the count in key battleground states. But the baffling decision to alter a pre-existing image rather than create an entirely new one, let alone to not then fully delete the original message, looks likely to create more friction between the UK government and the incoming administration. A UK government spokesperson said: “As you’d expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic.” The revelation comes amid a relationship already troubled by Biden’s memorable description of Johnson as the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump”. Even before the hidden message was revealed, Tommy Vietor, a former Obama speechwriter and podcaster viewed as a campaign surrogate for Biden, reacted to No 10’s message of congratulation with disdain. “This shapeshifting creep weighs in,” Vietor tweeted. “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump but neat Instagram graphic.” The hidden message suggests No 10 was uncertain until the very end about who the winning candidate was, even as Biden’s lead in key states grew and the Trump campaign began its increasingly frantic legal efforts to frustrate the conclusion of the count. Even after the election was called on Saturday afternoon, UK government ministers continued to hedge their message. On Sunday morning, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, declined to agree with the statement “every vote should be counted in a democratic election”. “What you’re really trying to do is to drag me into the legal claims about whether or not all the votes have properly been counted,” Raab told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge. Ridge noted that it was not only Raab who had sidestepped the question: the prime minster’s own spokesperson had given a similarly evasive answer last week.

2020-11-09T23:39:14Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Lords inflict huge defeats on government in votes on internal market bill — as it happened,"Following the defeat of key parts of proposed Brexit legislation in the Lords, a government spokesperson said: We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted to remove clauses from the UK internal market bill, which was backed in the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256 and delivers on a clear Conservative manifesto commitment. We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons. Weâ€™ve been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UKâ€™s internal market and the huge gains of the peace process. We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances. The comments come after the government suffered a major defeat on controversial Brexit legislation as peers rejected a bid to give ministers power to break international law. Thanks for following along this evening - thatâ€™s all for today. Take care."
2020-11-09T23:28:39Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to press on with Brexit bill despite Lords defeat,"Boris Johnson has put himself on a collision course with the Joe Biden administration in the US after Downing Street said it would press ahead with legislation designed to override the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Peers inflicted a huge defeat on the government after voting overwhelmingly to remove measures that seek to “disapply” parts of the Northern Ireland protocol – measures that Biden has said would put the Good Friday agreement at risk. Lords voted 433 to 165 on the amendment tabled by Lord Eames, the former primate of all Ireland, who spoke movingly of the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. Northern Irish peer Lord Empey blamed the “mess” on Boris Johnson’s decision to opt for the border down the Irish Sea last year, a decision Ken Clarke said was one of the most “inferior” options available to the government, which, he said, was now acting like a dictatorship to remedy its errors. No 10 reacted to the defeat by saying: “We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons.” Just before the vote result came in Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned that there would be no Brexit trade deal if the UK passed a bill “designed to break international law”.
He later told BBC’s Newsnight programme he thought a deal was still possible but said the bill had damaged trust with the EU and Britain’s reputation internationally. “Anybody who is suggesting that this has been a successful or a good tactic ... doesn’t understand the conversations that are happening across the EU right now. This is a tactic that has backfired I think in a significant way,” he said. Lord Judge, a former chief justice of England and Wales, opened the Lords debate on the amendment on Monday by describing the Brexit clauses as “pernicious, lamentable provisions” that had no other purpose than to give unilateral powers to Downing Street to “nullify” international law. The government has previously said the clauses would break international law in a “specific and limited way”. Judge said the clauses had not been inserted as “guardian angels, pure and unsullied” into legislation aimed at smoothing trade between Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England after Brexit. “The executive is seeking powers that parliament should never have been asked to give,” said Judge, predicting an “overwhelming” majority for the amendment to demonstrate the Lords’ discontent with the government.
Downing Street and senior cabinet members including the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Monday, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Sunday, reiterated their insistence that the clauses were necessary to give domestic power over the EU if it threatened the Good Friday agreement. In a pre-recorded lecture to Middle Temple on Monday evening, the former prime minister Sir John Major urged parliament to resist aspects of the bill, which he said threatened fundamental liberties and allowed ministers to break the law – a “slippery slope down which no democratic government should ever travel”. He added that the bill had “damaged our reputation around the world” and warned of the “corrosive” impact of placing ministers above the law. Lord Clarke, the former home secretary and chancellor, told the House of Lords there was no evidence for the supposed EU threat to the Good Friday agreement – describing the Brexit clauses as a “Donald Trump like gesture” born of “panic” by a government acting like a dictatorship. Michael Howard, a former Tory leader and an ardent Brexit supporter, said he was “dismayed” that a party he had “supported for so long” had “chosen as one of the first assertions of its newly won sovereignty to break its word, to break international law, to renege on a treaty signed barely a year ago”. In a sombre speech, Robin Eames, a former primate of All Ireland, who authored the amendment, said peace in Northern Ireland and mutual understanding of previous warring communities was “still a tender plant” that was being put at risk by the bill. Margaret Ritchie, a former SDLP leader, said Raab had “totally misrepresented” the situation in comments on the BBC on Sunday when he claimed that the EU was trying to undermine the Good Friday agreement. It was “the EU that sought and is seeking to protect the Belfast agreement through the NI protocol”, she said. As recently as September, Biden said the Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of bloody conflict in the region, could not be allowed to become “a casualty of Brexit”. He said then: “Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.” The UK government has admitted the legislation breaches part of the Northern Ireland protocol as set out in the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. The clauses would hand sweeping unilateral powers to ministers in two key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January. It would give ministers the power to change or disapply export rules for goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, and also give them power over whether to notify Brussels of any state aid decisions. Eustice confirmed again on Monday that the government would reinstate the clauses that enable ministers to break international laws if they are rejected by the Lords. Downing Street said it was acting responsibly in order to allow a smooth transition should no deal be reached with the EU. “Any Lords amendments will be considered when they return to the Commons but we do consider these clauses to be a vital safety net,” Johnson’s spokesman said."
2020-11-09T20:38:44Z,politics,Politics,PM channels his inner John Wayne in vaccine metaphor meltdown | John Crace,"Shortly before 5pm in the UK, president-elect Joe Biden gave a press conference. The results of the trials were very promising, he said, but there was still a long way to go before a vaccination programme could be rolled out nationwide. So it was now more important than ever not to let your guard down and to carry on wearing masks. It was coherent, informative and in less than five minutes Biden had told Americans just about everything they needed to know. Boris Johnson likes to do things rather differently. Almost to the second after Biden had finished speaking, the prime minister stepped out into the Downing Street briefing room, flanked by the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, and Brigadier Joe Fossey, dressed in full camo gear that had the reverse effect of drawing attention to himself. A new form of anti-camo perhaps. After a few introductions, Boris went on one of his long rambles. He didn’t really have anything to say that couldn’t have been wrapped up in minutes but he considers a press conference not to have taken place unless he’s wasted the best part of an hour of everyone’s time. Perhaps it was the excitement of having a real life soldier standing next to him, but Johnson’s explanation of the new vaccination was relayed in a series of metaphors straight out of the movie Stagecoach. The arrows were in the quiver! The cavalry was on its way, the toot of the bugle – Michael Gove’s presumably – was getting louder but still some way off. Having a prime minister who manages to trivialise something really important is getting extremely draining and it’s hard not to zone out within moments of him starting a sentence. So much for the great communicator. Next up was the brigadier who is in charge of the mass testing in Liverpool and looked uncomfortable throughout. “Two thousand troops have answered the call,” he said, making it sound as if the soldiers had had some say in their deployment rather than been told they were off to Liverpool for the next four weeks. He then pulled out a piece of plastic from his pocket. “You know what a swab is,” he continued. “Well this is the lateral flow that gives you a result within an hour.” And that was all he had to say. He didn’t seem at all sure what the lateral flow actually was or how it worked but then he was only following orders. If he’d had his way, he’d have saved the taxpayer a return train ticket from Liverpool to London. There was no slideshow this time – obviously No 10 has started to wonder if they are more trouble than they are worth after recent events – so Van-Tam was left to ad lib on the vaccine trial. Even though he had no more information than Boris, so all he could do was repeat the fact that it was exciting but we shouldn’t get carried away just yet. Try to think of it as a penalty shootout, he said – Boris’s crap analogies are as contagious as the coronavirus. We’ve scored the first goal, so we know the keeper can be beaten, but there was a long way to go before the match was won. No one seemed to have told Van-Tam that the expectation in a shootout was that the penalty-taker would score. Things carried on in much the same vein when questions came in from the media. The brigadier tried to make himself as inconspicuous as possible – merging into the background was part of his SAS training – and so the only other thing he had to offer was that he was just on day four of his deployment so it was hard to tell whether things were going well or badly. Van-Tam desperately hunted around for new ways of saying the vaccination trials were still at an early stage, but things were looking more hopeful for next year. Try to think of yourself as being on a railway station on a wet and windy night, he said, doing his best to channel his inner Fat Controller. You could see the lights of the train two miles away. Then the train pulled into the station and you didn’t know if the door was going to open. Next you couldn’t even be sure of whether there would be enough seats for everyone. The UK had only ordered enough vaccine for about a third of the population, so unless more doses came online most people were going to miss out. It didn’t sound quite as hopeful as he had suggested. But maybe that’s just the way he tells them. Boris, meanwhile, just looked relieved to only get one question on the US presidential election. And that wasn’t even on if he had spoken to the president-elect – he hadn’t as Biden has been too busy taking calls from Micronesia – or if he had any reaction to being called a “shape-shifting creep” by a former adviser to Barack Obama. The Democrats still haven’t forgiven Boris for his remarks about Obama’s part-Kenyan ancestry giving him a dislike of the British empire. “I congratulate the president-elect,” said Johnson, sidestepping a suggestion he give Donald Trump a call to persuade him to throw in the towel. The US and the UK had had a close relationship in the past and no doubt would do so in the future. He had nothing to say on Brexit. Rather he chose to accentuate the shared climate change objectives of Cop27. Or Cop26 as the rest of the world knows it."
2020-11-09T19:41:32Z,politics,Politics,UK vaccine taskforce chief Kate Bingham expected to quit,"Kate Bingham, the beleaguered chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, is expected to leave her post at the end of the year, according to a government source. Bingham, a venture capitalist married to Treasury minister Jesse Norman, has come under fire for her use of expensive PR consultants and allegations over a presentation to a private investors’ conference. She is set to leave her post when her contract runs out in January 2021, with the source saying it “had always been clear” that was her intention. Labour had asked the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to investigate claims that Bingham disclosed sensitive information about potential targets for the government’s vaccines push to a $200-a-head private conference. According to a video of the event obtained by the Sunday Times, Bingham showed financiers a detailed list of vaccines which the UK government was closely monitoring and could later invest in. Bingham reportedly told the event: “We haven’t necessarily signed contracts with all of them so far. But they’re all in our sights.” Several of the vaccines are owned or funded by publicly traded companies.
Appearing before a joint select committee hearing last week, Bingham denied any wrongdoing and described the report as “nonsense”, “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. She insisted her presentation had relied “on publicly available information and said little that expert delegates at the conference could not deduce themselves”. Bingham, who reports directly to the prime minister, has spent more than £600,000 of taxpayers’ money on hiring PR consultants from a firm called Admiral Associates, rather than rely on civil service press officers, according to leaked documents also obtained by the Sunday Times. Speaking on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio the £670,000 bill for spin doctors could not be justified. “You cannot justify that sort of money being spent,” he said. “If only it was the only example. There are lots of examples of lucrative contracts going without any due process and I think the public mood on this is very, very clear.” A Downing Street spokesman said the decision to hire the PR advisers was signed off by officials at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). “Specialist communications support was contracted by the vaccine taskforce for a time-limited period in line with existing public sector recruitment practices and frameworks,” the spokesman said. Asked whether the prime minister had full confidence in her, the spokesman said: “Yes. The work of the vaccine taskforce is obviously of great importance and we have secured agreements for 350m doses overall of six leading vaccine candidates.” The government has repeatedly been accused of cronyism in its management of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dido Harding, who was selected to run the £12bn NHS test-and-trace programme without an open appointments process, is married to Conservative MP John Penrose. Harding is not taking a salary for her role, and an advertisement for her permanent replacement is expected to be placed shortly. A BEIS spokesperson previously said: “As we have already made clear, Kate Bingham’s role as chair of the vaccine taskforce includes appearing at conferences, speaking to media and liaising closely with wider stakeholders.”"

Van-Tam We’ve seen the swallow but this is very much not the summer. It would be a colossal mistake for any of us to relax at this point. Johnson I remain buoyantly optimistic about the prospects of this country next year. I just don’t want to let people run away with the idea that this development is today is necessarily a home run, a slam dunk, a shot to the back of the net, yet. Van-Tam This, to me, is like a train journey where you’re standing on the station – it’s wet, windy, it’s horrible – and two miles down the tracks, two lights appear and it’s the train. And it’s a long way off. We’re at that point at the moment. That’s the efficacy result. Then we hope the train slows down safely to get in to the station. That the safety data. And then the train stops. And at that point the doors don’t open. The guard has to make sure it’s safe to open the doors. That’s the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency], that’s the regulator. And, when the doors open, I hope there’s not an unholy scramble for the seats. The JCVI [joint committee on vaccination and immunisation] has very clearly said which people are going to need the seats most and they are the ones who should get on the train first."
2020-11-09T09:15:47Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: UK risks being 'international pariah' under Biden, says Labour","The UK risks becoming “an international pariah” and endangering relations with the US under Joe Biden, Labour has said, after ministers pledged to press ahead with a plan to break international law by potentially rewriting parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal. Lord Falconer, the shadow attorney general, said the government was “in a big hole” over its internal market bill, which the House of Lords is expected to amend this week to remove the contentious proposals. George Eustice, the environment secretary, reiterated on Monday that if this did happen ministers would ask MPs to reinstate the relevant clauses. The government was “committed to the spirit of the withdrawal agreement”, he said. Biden, who has Irish roots, has expressed concern about the UK’s proposal to unilaterally amend an international agreement, and the potential impact on the Good Friday agreement if there ends up being a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Falconer, told Sky the government should “stop and think”. He said: “What on earth is the point of making the United Kingdom an international pariah, just at the moment a new president of the United States emerges saying, not only do I want the British government to comply with the Northern Ireland protocol, but I want a law-abiding world?
“To make ourselves an international outsider, somebody who will become low down the list of the people who the United States will want to do business with, is a very big mistake for the United Kingdom. “The House of Lords is doing the government a favour by seeking to take out these lawbreaking provisions. It gets the government off the hook. I would suggest the government stop digging – they’re in a big hole.” Pushing ahead with the plans would mean Biden was “not going to entertain negotiations” over a rapid post-Brexit US-UK trade deal, Falconer said. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said Biden would prefer the UK to have stayed in the EU. Brown said: “He is also worried about the Good Friday agreement – he is not going to allow a trade deal with Britain to happen if we in some way breach the Good Friday agreement.” Eustice told Today that any worries about the internal market bill in the US would be unfounded. He said: “If it was understood exactly what this bill was about, rather than how it is sometimes caricatured – this is about about providing legal clarity, legal certainty, and protecting the internal market in the UK, and crucially, standing behind the Belfast agreement.” Eustice denied the government was reneging on the agreement to carry out some checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK so as to keep the Irish border open. “We’re not,” he said. “Northern Ireland officials are working on the facilities that will be needed to do those checks, particularly on agri-foods goods, as they enter Northern Ireland. A lot of work is being done as well on the customs procedures that will be needed for goods at risk of entering the EU market. “We are absolutely committed to the spirit of the withdrawal agreement, and we’re already implementing it.” But Eustice stressed the government would seek to reinstate any elements of the bill removed by peers. He told Sky News: “We will. The UK internal market bill is not about undermining the Belfast agreement. It’s about standing behind it, and making sure that it works, and looking after the interests of Northern Ireland, making sure that the peace and stability that’s been hard won there can carry on.”"
2020-11-08T18:30:47Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer urges Labour to learn from Joe Biden's 'broad coalition',"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has urged his party to learn from Joe Biden’s “broad coalition” which won back voters who turned away from the Democrats four years ago, pointing to the president-elect’s emphasis on “family, community and security”. Starmer, an enthusiastic supporter of Biden’s bid who shares a WhatsApp group with his staff called “Let’s Go Joe”, said the victory of the former vice-president and his running mate Kamala Harris would “fill the void in global leadership” and was a vote “for a better, more optimistic future”. Writing in the Guardian, Starmer suggested he intended his party to emulate the Democratic strategy of winning back US “blue wall” states like Michigan and Pennsylvania lost to Donald Trump in 2016, just as Labour lost its “red wall” of northern seats in 2019. “This election had stark lessons for those of us who want to see progressive values triumph over the forces of division and despair,” Starmer wrote. “The Democrats’ path to victory this week was paved by a broad coalition, including many of the states and communities that four years ago turned away from them.” Starmer said it “takes time” to win back trust of voters who abandoned their traditional parties, and suggested it involved talking about issues for which his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn had been criticised such as security. “It takes political leaders who listen, learn and renew. President Biden spoke to the soul of the nation, with a focus on who people are and what they value: family, community and security,” he wrote. “One election victory does not mean that work is now finished for the Democrats; for us in the Labour party, it is only just beginning.” His appeal for his party to emulate the Democrats’ appeal to a broad base comes as his leadership faces its biggest test yet to party unity, with the suspension of former leader Corbyn over his response to the equalities watchdog’s report into antisemitism in the party sparking an outraged response from the left. Starmer said Biden’s election was time to “reset that partnership” with the US, urging the government to seize the opportunity by abandoning its much-criticised move to renege on parts of the EU withdrawal bill, set to be debated in the House of Lords this week. “We will soon have a president in the Oval Office who has been a passionate advocate for the preservation of the Good Friday agreement,” Starmer wrote. “He, like governments across the world, will take a dim view if our prime minister ploughs ahead with proposals to undermine that agreement. If the government is serious about a reset in its relationship with the United States, then it should take an early first step and drop these proposals.” Boris Johnson has said he intends to press ahead with the bill’s controversial clauses, despite facing near certain defeat when the House of Lords votes on measures on Monday. The internal market bill gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite elements of the withdrawal agreement with the EU. Starmer said a new US leadership could also lead to a more joined-up approach in global coronavirus vaccine research, as well as responding to security threats and the climate crisis. “Equally, when our allies are wrong, Britain should be prepared to speak out and say so. We are at our best when the world knows we have the courage of our convictions and a clear moral purpose,” he wrote. “In recent years, this has been absent. For the United States of America and for Britain, this is the time to return to the world stage. This is the time for us to lead.” Starmer has not met Biden personally, but the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, said Labour was on good terms with high-profile Democrats. “Of course we are comparing notes, talking to one another, how do we defeat those with this sort of populist tradition, how do you move forward against the backdrop of culture wars?” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “I think that the Labour party in this country wants to be a party for the whole nation and not just one tribe. That’s what we’ve seen in the United States which Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and of course we will seek to replicate that.” He said Labour and the Democrats were “sister parties in a sense”, and added: “I’ve got longstanding relationships with Democrats … my friendship with the former president Barack Obama is well documented.”"
2020-11-08T17:40:03Z,politics,Politics,Farage party's relaunch marked with low-key anti-lockdown protest,"Nigel Farage and his allies have relaunched their political party, encouraging people to walk past their local war memorial on Remembrance Sunday in a low-key anti-lockdown protest that marks a fresh attempt to restore their political relevance. The leaders of the Reform UK party – renamed from the Brexit party – hope to occupy a political space until now dominated by a few rebel Conservatives at Westminster, and by conspiracy theorists on the streets and online. The party chairman, Richard Tice, and a few dozen others stood to watch an official wreath-laying ceremony at the Royal Artillery memorial on Hyde Park Corner in central London on Sunday morning, joined by curious joggers and walkers, to the surprise of those officiating who had not expected any more than a handful to turn up. Tice said those attending were engaged in “a demonstration of respect and commemoration in line with the government regulations”, adding that “it was encouraging to see so many people here”. Meanwhile, around 600 protesters gathered in central Manchester against the national lockdown. People started to congregate in Piccadilly Gardens from around 1pm with numbers swelling as the day went on. Social media footage showed a large crowd, many carrying placards, objecting to the government’s decision for a second national shutdown. There appeared to be little social distancing, with few protesters wearing masks as they chanted “rise up” and “freedom”. Greater Manchester police condemned the gathering and said a number of officers had been injured. In a statement on Sunday night the force said four people had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences and and it had issued 24 £200 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). It said: “Enquiries are ongoing to also issue an FPN to the organiser.” It added: “Enquiries have established that one group of attendees travelled to Greater Manchester from Cumbria via coach. The driver and the company they work for have both been reported to the relevant industry regulator.” Cllr Pat Karney, Manchester city council’s spokesman, criticised the protesters. “I can completely condemn this disgraceful gathering in Piccadilly Gardens. These people should check out the ambulances going in and out of our hospitals at the moment to see the massive health crisis we are all facing,” he said. “If you disagree with the restrictions, write to your MP but don’t endanger people’s health.” Others present at the London protest included the actor Laurence Fox, who is trying to launch his own political party to “reclaim” British values from politicians, and the London assembly member David Kurten, originally elected under the Ukip banner but now leading his own party. Farage and Tice have been looking for new issues to exploit as the Brexit process draws close to a conclusion, a search with a fresh urgency after the defeat of Donald Trump, who had been their most high-profile overseas supporter. Party insiders said the new direction had been “under consideration for several months”, but the timing appears opportunistic given the second England-wide lockdown was announced only a week ago. Farage had tacked to the right in the summer, highlighting the issue of migrant Channel crossings in tiny, dangerous boats. At that time, he said by autumn he wanted to switch to campaigning on crime and even focus on Gypsy and traveller communities. A spokesperson said the latest redirection had been driven by “the government’s badly handled Covid response”, a belief that “the opposition won’t do any better”, and that the second lockdown was an overreaction. “The lockdown doesn’t seem to gel with lived reality,” said Gawain Towler, a spokesperson for Reform UK. “Yes, we all know people who have been ill or even those who have died. But how many of those have died have been under 60? Meanwhile, we all know people who have been furloughed or are out of work, and that really is a problem for the nation going forward.” Reform UK aims to run candidates in the London, Scottish and Welsh elections next spring. Farage is thought unlikely to stand to be London mayor, but Tice has shown interest in seeking the Conservative nomination in the past. It is unclear how much support there is for an anti-lockdown party in practice. David Lawrence, a researcher with Hope Not Hate, said: “There is potentially a pool for Farage to draw upon, and he has shown with Brexit that he can campaign effectively around an issue.” He pointed to a mushrooming of anti-lockdown groups during spring and early summer, rapidly gaining in popularity even though they were often linked to radical or far-right sentiment or conspiracy topics, anti-vaccination or anti-5G. “Part of the problem is that people are stuck indoors, spending more time online,” he added. Two protest events in London in August and September attracted upwards of 10,000 attendees. Pollsters, however, are less convinced there is significant public sentiment for anti-lockdown politics. A poll by YouGov at the beginning of the month showed 72% of English adults supported the second lockdown, although that was down from 93% at the time of the first lockdown. Deborah Mattinson, from pollster BritainThinks, said: “I think this is attractive to a tiny bunch of people, particularly a niche group of older voters. At the moment we find most people are more fearful about the health than economic risks.”"
2020-11-08T15:58:48Z,politics,Politics,Biden win plus no-deal Brexit could leave Johnson in a 'lonely place in the world',"Boris Johnson faces a catastrophe in terms of future relations with Washington if he pursues a no-deal Brexit, the former head of the Foreign Office and a succession of ex-ambassadors have said. The calls add pressure on the UK to revise its internal market bill, currently in the Lords, that includes clauses enabling the UK to breach international law and set up a hard border on the island of Ireland, a move deeply opposed by Joe Biden’s foreign policy team. Johnson congratulated Biden on his victory on Saturday evening. But Dominic Raab said “some processes still needed to be complete” in an oblique reference to Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in the courts. Speaking on Sky TV, the UK foreign secretary avoided answering when asked: “Do you think all votes should be counted in a democratic election?” But overall it was a blow to Trump that his closest personal transatlantic ally had endorsed Biden’s victory before any formal concession statement from the White House.
The British endorsement followed four days of Foreign Office silence, contrasting with calls from the German foreign ministry for Trump to tone down his claims the election had been stolen. Some of Biden’s allies – not official aides – made clear their hostility towards Johnson, regarded by certain Democrats as a shallow mini-Trump populist willing to use lies to pursue nationalist and divisive goals. After Johnson congratulated Biden, Tommy Vietor, a former Obama press aide and now a leading figure on the influential Pod Save America franchise, referred to the prime minister’s previous comments about Barack Obama’s “part-Kenyan” heritage. “This shapeshifting creep weighs in,” he tweeted. “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump.” Biden, a Catholic with strong moral views and deep foreign policy experience, is not a natural soulmate for Johnson, and the two men have never met. But Biden’s allies said he is by instinct a bridge-builder prepared to work across the aisle, suggesting he would give the UK prime minister a chance. The importance of alliances, after all, is one of Biden’s foundational principles. Downing Street is banking on the importance of the intelligence relationship, and a close common agenda on issues ranging from the climate crisis, the Iran nuclear deal, modernising the Nato defence alliance and a continued ideological pushback against China and Russia. Downing Street’s foreign policy chief, Prof John Bew, is also a past participant in the D10, an informal multilateral grouping of democracies that has echoes in Biden’s plans for a summit of democracies. The UK chairs the big UN climate crisis summit and G7 this year, and UK aides see opportunities for a way of meshing Biden’s summit and the concept of a D10. No 10 will also welcome the US back into active engagement in multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organisztion and the UN human rights council. The UK will also be hoping that the US will pledge to make any coronavirus vaccine available to all. Figures such as the former head of M16 Sir John Sawers claim British diplomacy has been adrift around the world because of the absence of consistency and values from its first partner. But Johnson is being urged by diplomats to recognise that pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be regarded as a serious error by the US, and undermine this wider agenda. Sir Simon Fraser, the foreign office permanent secretary until 2015, said Biden’s rise was “problematic for our government. This is a government that was born of the disruption of Brexit in 2016 just as Trumpism was a reflection of that. Trump supported Brexit. My understanding is the relationship between London and the Biden team is not that strong.”
Speaking at Chatham House, he added: “The British government will be looking for areas where it can have influence with Washington and with Europe, and to find a role. If we have a no-deal Brexit with a Biden administration, it is going to be a catastrophe for that agenda so I hope the government realises that it redoubles the argument for some sort of deal if the UK wants to have some sort of influence … We will shoot ourselves in the foot both in Washington and Brussels and beyond Brussels if we pursue a no-deal Brexit option.” The former UK ambassador to the US, Sir Nigel Sheinwald also said Biden regarded Brexit as a significant mistake. “After a Biden victory, and a failure to reach a trade deal with the EU, the UK would occupy a lonely place in the world,” he said. A UK-EU trade deal is seen by the Biden team as symbolic of the UK’s willingness to cooperate with rather than disrupt the EU. Only last week the EU set out proposals for how the UK and other third parties could join EU defence projects. Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU foreign affairs group, also urged the UK to lift its sights. He said: “Great Britain has to realise that it would be good for the Brexit negotiations to be finished because the Biden administration will concentrate more on the EU, and the more we are aligned together, the better it would be better for both for the US and for Europe.” Biden, proud of his Irish ancestral roots and close to the Irish diplomatic machine, has said any Brexit that threatened the Good Friday agreement by hardening borders within Ireland would end the chance of a UK-US bilateral trade deal. Kori Schake, foreign policy lead at the American Enterprise Institute said Biden was anyway unlikely to see a prospective deal as a top priority. “My advice to the UK is to join the transpacific trade partnership and get what they want from the US market that way.” The UK is also aware that the EU is preparing to offer its own partnership with the Biden team, one that risks brushing the UK to one side. The German government is likely to be Biden’s first interlocutor, according to Kim Darroch, the previous UK ambassador to the US. Fraser said: “I expect when he is working with Europe, Biden will probably look to France and Germany. So the UK, despite our deep and instinctive relationships – which are very powerful – is going to have to work hard to forge a relationship in a new context.” The UK’s relative influence may depend partly on whether the EU can resolve its own internal differences and make a coherent offer to the US on defence, trade and China. There will be relief across Europe according to Dominique Moïsi, special adviser to Institut Montaigne. He said: “Trump’s tactical bullying will be replaced by strategic empathy – the natural style of Biden.” But many in Europe believe the US has fundamentally changed in the past decade, shown by the record turnout for Trump last Tuesday, and as a result the foundations of the old transatlantic alliance is dead. Benjamin Haddad, director of the Future Europe Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said: “To European leaders who still question European strategic autonomy [the ability to act alone if necessary], do you really believe the decision of a few thousand voters in Pennsylvania should decide the security of your citizens every four years?” Others, especially in Germany, believe the US alliance remains indispensable to Europe, and autonomy is a pipe dream. The German foreign ministry immediately issued a statement saying it planned to make an offer to revive the transatlantic partnership and would put forward concrete proposals on “how we can close ranks as an international community be it with regard to players such as China climate change protection and the global fight against Covid-19”. Germany will be pressing for Biden to lift tariffs on steel and cars as a symbol of a new start, but Biden will be wary. Although US public attitudes to trade liberalisation are changing, his industrial and trade platform “Made in America” has superficial echoes of Trump’s “America First”. But the biggest test of transatlantic relations is likely to come over China. Through the use of extraterritorial sanctions and regulations, Trump bullied most of Europe into ejecting the Chinese government-backed Huawei from its 5G networks. But there was always a fear that any moment the US president might turn on a dime, seal a bilateral trade deal with Xi Jinping and ditch his purely performative concern about human rights in Hong Kong, Britain’s old colony. Fraser describes the rise of China as the greatest collective strategic challenge facing the alliance, an issue that requires greater clarity from the US. He argues European trade officials would like nothing more than to work with the US on a policy towards China in the WTO, but cooperation is made near impossible by the US slapping tariffs on Europe. He says the UK is also not yet in a position “to balance out the tremendous geopolitical strategic risks of China with the economic opportunity and imperative to engage with China. We do not have the policy mechanism to work that through.” But constructing any policy mechanism in any field was always an act of faith in the Trump era. His thinking – “like an archipelago of dots” according to John Bolton, his former national security adviser – meant any policy was near impossible to create, or discern. With the return of the foreign policy professionals to the US Department of State, the UK at least has some adults with whom to converse."
2020-11-08T13:54:39Z,politics,Politics,Johnson risks rift with Biden by pressing ahead with Brexit bill,"Boris Johnson has risked opening a rift with the US president-elect, Joe Biden, by insisting the internal markets bill that reneges on part of the EU withdrawal agreement would go ahead as planned. The prime minister said the legislation would go through parliament and added that the planned changes, which would hand unilateral power to ministers to change or disapply export rules for goods traveling from Britain to Northern Ireland, would protect the Good Friday peace deal. “The whole point of that bill and indeed the finance bill is to protect and uphold the Good Friday agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland. And again, that’s one of the things that we’re united on with our friends in the White House,” he said. Biden, who has Irish roots, has expressed negative views on the UK’s plans to override parts of the agreement if no deal is reached with the bloc. During the campaign, Biden said that “any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border”. Johnson, who has not yet spoken to Biden, said there was “far more that unites the government of this country and government in Washington any time, any stage, than divides us” – despite a series of sceptical comments made by Biden and his allies about the prime minister. The House of Lords is expected to vote this week to remove parts of the internal markets bill that would break international law by removing some of the commitments in the agreement, something Labour has challenged the government to concede. Biden has previously called Johnson the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump” and allies of the new Democratic administration have been scathing about the UK prime minister. Tommy Vietor, the former national security spokesman for Barack Obama, commenting on the prime minister’s congratulatory message to Biden, tweeted that Johnson was a “shapeshifting creep” and added: “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump.” Johnson said there was much the pair could work on, including climate change. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, exited the Paris climate agreement, which Biden has said he will renew. “I think now with President Biden in the White House in Washington, we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,” he said. “I see that President Biden shares a slogan, ‘Build Back Better’ – we claim no proprietary rights over that slogan. But when you when you come to build back better, one of the ways to do it is to do it through a green industrial revolution.” Johnson played down any prospect of immediate trade negotiations with the US under Biden. “I’m a keen student of the United States’ trade policy and they’re tough negotiations,” he said. “And I’ve never believed that this was going to be something that was going to be a complete pushover under any US administration. I think there’s a good chance we’ll do something.” Earlier, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he would “listen very carefully” to the concerns of US Democrats but said the risk to the Good Friday agreement came from the EU.
Raab said he was sure diplomats would be able to smooth things over in Washington. “I’m confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively and correctly,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “We listen very carefully to the concerns of our American friends. Particularly on the Hill in the Irish lobby they feel very invested in the Good Friday agreement, we understand that. But it is not the UK that is putting it at risk, it is the EU.” Raab was also pressed on whether he believed there had been irregularities in the US voting system, after he had tweeted “some of the processes are still playing out” in his congratulatory message to Biden. “I’m not getting dragged in either to the election campaign or the immediate aftermath,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge. “We want to avoid getting sucked into the US domestic politics but it is very clear now in our view that there is a definitive result. “There may be some contest claims of irregularities but we’ve always said we have got full faith in the checks and balances of the American system to reach a clear result, and they’ve done that now.” Asked repeatedly if all votes should be counted in an election, Raab said “in principle, yes, of course” but said he did not want to be drawn into the controversies in the US. “We really don’t want to get drawn into the cut and thrust, the controversies, the claims, the counter-claims, either in the election or in the immediate aftermath, and that is we respect Americans’ rights to choose for themselves and we respect the checks and balances in the American system which will produce, as they have, a clear result.”"
2020-11-08T10:52:52Z,politics,Politics,Welsh first minister: time is right to end 17-day Covid 'firebreak',"The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said it is the right time for his country to emerge from its 17-day “firebreak” despite sharp rises in Covid cases and the decision by the UK government to begin a lockdown in England. Drakeford said the impact of the Welsh firebreak, which ends on Monday, would not be felt for a week or two but expressed confidence that Wales’s early action means the country will get to Christmas without a further national lockdown. In an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader in Wales took a swipe at Boris Johnson for repeatedly insisting that an end to the crisis is in sight, claiming this undermined trust. Drakeford said the pandemic had changed the state of the union for ever, but argued it had shown not that Wales should become an independent country but that it already had the powers to make its own decisions. There will be more freedom for people to meet in Wales from Monday when a new set of national rules comes into force and pubs, cafes and restaurants will reopen. But the changes come at a time when there are as many Covid patients in Welsh hospitals as there were in April, and cases in some areas, particularly in parts of the south Wales valleys, have soared. Drakeford said: “Our decision to go for a 17-day firebreak was based on the advice we had at the time. As long as we were really strict about our firebreak, three weekends and two weeks would be enough to suppress the virus. “The impact of the firebreak will not be felt for another week or two, but we continue to follow the science and follow the advice.” Data from Wales’s Techinical Advisory Cell (TAC) suggests people have respected the firebreak with movement back down to the levels seen in May. Drakeford said: “We took a difficult decision, given we were doing it on our own. We struck a bargain with people then if we made it as strict as we needed to, it would last for the 17 days. A lot of people at the time asked, was it necessary? Now I see people saying we haven’t done it for long enough. You have to set out your stall and hold your nerve. Our ambition was to find a pathway through the rest of this calendar year.” Provided people stuck to the firebreak and now follow the new rules, he said the country should be able to get through to Christmas without another national firebreak or lockdown, but he said it was “not helpful” to speculate what may be needed in the new year. “Many more things will emerge we have not thought of,” he said. Drakeford refused to be drawn on when the crisis may be over and criticised Johnson for making over-optimistic predictions. “It will be over when we get a vaccine that offers people more than a modest amount of temporary protection. I think the prime minister has created a problem for himself in terms of trust and credibility by regularly suggesting we’re only a few weeks away from everything being fine again. [He said] it was going to be over in 12 weeks, it was going to be all over before Christmas. “Even when he was announcing the lockdown for England, he couldn’t resist a final flourish in which he claimed it would be over by spring. I think that corrodes people’s confidence in the message. I’m sure it seems attractive at the time for a few moments. In the long term it doesn’t add to the credibility of political leadership. “I don’t want to ever be in the position of saying to people in Wales it’s all just around the corner, this will be over soon. We’re going to have to live with coronavirus for a long time. There’s no magic bullet and I don’t think it helps to suggest to people there is.”
The relationship between Cardiff and Westminster has been fraught at times during the crisis, not least when Wales banned people from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK. Drakeford said the engagement between the governments had been better in recent days, but he said the crisis had changed the union for ever. “I think it will change the nature of the conversation in Wales. I’m regularly asked about whether there is a rise in enthusiasm for independence in Wales. I think coronavirus has shown that we have a Senedd with its own independent powers and a government that has been prepared to use those powers independently when we have felt it is in Wales’s interest.” The first minister has urged people to follow the new rules – but said this was only part of the job. “We don’t want people to think: ‘How far can I stretch the rules? What can I do? What more can I get away with? Everyone has to ask not what can I do, but what I should do.”"
2020-11-08T09:08:37Z,politics,Politics,What does Bidenâ€™s win mean for Brexit?,"A Joe Biden victory will have “big consequences for Brexit”, those close to the talks on the EU side have said, forcing the UK to think again over its approach to Northern Ireland and threat to disapply the withdrawal agreement. Chris Coons, a close friend of Biden and a potential US secretary of state, told the BBC that Biden will want to “reimagine” the US’s transatlantic policy, the special relationship with the UK and its relationship with the EU, damaged by Donald Trump. On Northern Ireland, he warned: “I would expect to be concerned about making sure that the Good Friday accords are respected and protected and that the ways in which the UK-EU terms are negotiated doesn’t put at risk the stability of the border terms in Northern Ireland”. There is speculation that Biden’s first visit to Europe could be to Brussels and not London, Berlin or Paris, a clear sign that that the US wants to rebuild its relationship with Europe and repair the damage wrought by Trump in Nato, which is headquartered in Brussels, and through trade wars with Germany. And there will be a reset in the approach of the US on trade talks with the UK. Biden was Barack Obama’s vice-president who warned the UK would be at the back of the queue over Brexit. But he has more recently made his views clear – warning that if the UK government opts for no deal and in doing so carries out its threat to override parts of the the withdrawal agreement signed in January relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, there will be no trade deal with the UK. In September, he said the Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of bloody conflict in the region, cannot be “a casualty of Brexit”. “Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period,” he said. His views on the internal market bill will not, however, translate into a total reset for US-UK trade talks. Georgie Wright, of the Institute for Government, says that if anything, Brexit will spur on the US to strike a trade deal with the UK as it could be a means of prizing open the door again for a trade deal with the EU. Those on the EU side say both the US and Brussels have huge teams of negotiators and would have the capacity to run multiple talks. “Trade is not top of the US agenda at the moment. After four years of the ‘America first’ doctrine, the Republicans don’t want any more trade deals, and the Democrats aren’t too hot on them either,” said Wright. “It is hard to see how Biden would get a trade deal through Congress and a Republican Senate. But, it does see one advantage to a trade deal with the UK – and that is the possibility of gaining a foothold in Europe which it could use as a way of extracting more access from the EU. The thinking goes ‘if the UK, which has similar standards, accepts our goods – why can’t the EU market?’”she said. Anthony Gardner, a former American ambassador to the EU, recently told an audience in Germany that while Brexit was bad, Biden valued the transatlantic relationship with Europe and with the UK. “Here’s a dramatic difference: Donald Trump has only believed that the US-UK link was important, he was a cheerleader for Brexit. Joe Biden believes that the triangle of relationships, US-UK, UK-EU, US and EU, all have to work together, and you will see statements to that effect,” said Gardner."
2020-11-08T09:00:35Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson under pressure to avoid no-deal Brexit after Biden victory,"Boris Johnson will be under even greater pressure to strike a Brexit deal with Brussels when Joe Biden enters the White House, senior Tories and diplomats said on Saturday, amid fears that a no-deal outcome could seriously threaten relations with a new Democratic administration. The Foreign Office and No 10 are urgently trying to assess the implications for UK foreign policy of a Biden presidency, including in areas such as Brexit, climate change, the Middle East, China and Nato. But after a phone call on Saturday between Johnson and European commission president Ursula von der Leyen ended with Downing Street saying “significant differences remain in a number of areas”, fears were growing that both sides could be slipping towards no deal. Pro-EU Tories and diplomats are concerned that a no-deal outcome would cause early and serious tension between London and Washington and put the special relationship at risk, given Biden’s stated opposition to Brexit, support for European integration and support for the Good Friday Agreement. Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has made it clear that there will be no agreement on a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal if a no-deal outcome threatens the Good Friday agreement that he holds dear. His concerns over the threat to the agreement in the event of a no-deal Brexit reached new heights after Johnson recently forced through the internal market bill. Many saw the move as putting Brexit above the interests of peace in Ireland. Senior Tories and other senior pro-EU figures in Whitehall also point out that a UK-US trade deal after Brexit could be less likely under Biden than it would have been under Trump. Senior diplomats believe Biden might even prioritise an US-EU trade deal over one with the UK, as he tries to repair relations with the 27-nation bloc that were badly damaged by the actions of Donald Trump. On Saturday night one of Johnson’s former cabinet colleagues, Baroness Nicky Morgan, said that while in many respects Biden could prove a better ally than Trump in areas of UK foreign policy such as Nato, the Middle East and climate change, the thorny matter of Brexit would have to be dealt with very carefully. Taking into account Biden’s warnings on Northern Irish peace, Morgan said: “I think the PM will not want the first conversation he has with Biden to be about Northern Ireland, Brexit and no deal. Getting a deal will make that conversation much easier.” The former cabinet minister Damian Green added: “A deal is better than a no deal for all sorts of reasons. But a Biden White House would be much more receptive to a UK-US deal if we already had one with the EU.” Both Brussels and No 10 made it clear yesterday that Brexit negotiations remained stuck following the call between Von der Leyen and Johnson before a decisive week of talks, even as tentative signs emerged of agreement around a five-year transition period on fishing rights. The European commission president and the prime minister both highlighted in their post-call statements the contentious issues of EU access to British waters and agreement on future rules to ensure fair competition. Von der Leyen tweeted that “some progress has been made, but large differences remain” with just over a week remaining before parliamentary ratification on a trade and security deal will need to begin.
A statement from Downing Street emphasised the need to “redouble efforts” when the two sides, led by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost, re-engaged on Monday. “The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish,” a Downing Street spokesman said following Saturday’s call. “The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.” The negotiations are entering a decisive phase. But Barnier privately warned last week that the talks were not on a “trajectory” for a deal, telling MEPs that the coming week offered the last opportunity for common ground to be found. It is understood, however, that there are tentative signs of agreement on a five-year transition period on fisheries. Barnier has told diplomats that the “gap” on fishing is big regarding quotas and that “access to the 6-12 mile fishing zone” remains a sticking point for France and Ireland, who point to their fishing fleets operating in those stretch of seas for centuries. One source said the EU was seeking to help Johnson to overcome his political problems at home in order to get the deal over the line, but that the gaps in terms of quotas remained too big as yet for Brussels to be able to start selling the deal to the member states. In Brussels, the greatest concern is the lack of progress on the issues of standards and domestic subsidies, or state aid. The EU has proposed high-level principles on state subsidies to which both sides would agree. The UK would also establish an independent competition authority and there would be a dispute settlement mechanism with both sides able to take swift retaliatory action during an arbitration period if there was a clear breach of the rules. Downing Street has suggested, however, that the threshold for unilateral action needs to be a clear impact on trade from a subsidy rather than a mere risk. Meanwhile on the issue of standards, the UK has agreed to non-regression from current environmental, labour and social regulations but there has been a clash over how the two sides will develop their laws over time. “We are nowhere”, said one source."
2020-11-08T06:20:31Z,politics,Politics,Three times as many British voters favour Joe Biden than Donald Trump,"More than three times as many UK voters wanted Joe Biden to win the US election than favoured Donald Trump, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. About 57% of British people chose Biden against just 16% who backed Trump in the presidential election. Even Conservative voters preferred Biden to Trump, with 40% wanting Biden against 28% who favoured the outgoing president. A clear majority of UK voters – 62% – said they believed the US election was generally conducted fairly and properly, with 67% saying that Trump’s claims about electoral fraud were not true. A majority (58%) also said they believed Biden would be positive both for the United States and the world. Meanwhile at home, in the week that a second national lockdown began in England as the government tried to control Covid-19, Labour has opened a four-point lead over the Tories. Labour is up two points, on 42%, compared with a fortnight ago, while the Conservatives are unchanged on 38%. The Liberal Democrats are up one point on 7%.
It is the biggest lead for Labour since Keir Starmer became leader in April and represents a remarkable change in the standing of the two main parties. Early on in the pandemic in March, Boris Johnson and the Tories led Labour by 26 points in an Opinium poll, before the lead was gradually eroded as the government struggled to bring the virus under control. Two-thirds (64%) of people in England say they support the latest four-week lockdown, while only 20% oppose it. However, three in five (62%) think it was implemented too late. While there is broad support for most of the lockdown, some 37% said more sport should be allowed outdoors."
2020-11-07T15:13:55Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks remain deadlocked going into decisive week,"The Brexit negotiations remained stuck after a call between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen before a decisive week of talks. The European commission president and the prime minister both highlighted in their post-call statements the contentious issues of EU access to British waters and agreement on future rules to ensure fair competition. Von der Leyen tweeted that “some progress has been made, but large differences remain” with just over a week remaining before the UK and EU parliaments need to begin ratification of a trade and security deal. A statement from Downing Street emphasised the need to “redouble efforts” when the two sides, led by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, re-engage on Monday. A Downing Street spokesman said after Saturday’s call: “The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish. “The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.” The negotiations are entering a decisive phase. But Barnier privately warned last week that the talks are not on a “trajectory” for a deal, telling MEPs that the coming week offered the last opportunity for common ground to be found.

There are also concerns about progress on customs facilitation to allow goods to be exported and imported with the minimum of checks. The two sides have clashed on the UK’s insistence that international standards for goods should be mutually recognised as acceptable by either side rather than EU rules. According to a leaked memo seen by the Guardian, Barnier is concerned this issue could “derail” the entire customs declarations system."

2020-11-06T18:04:50Z,politics,Politics,Johnson and EU commission chief to hold talks before decisive week for Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold talks on Saturday before a potentially decisive week in the Brexit negotiations, amid growing concern in Brussels at the lack of progress. UK sources played down expectations of a breakthrough moment but with time short for parliamentary ratification the phonecall may prove to be the final chance for a political intervention in the troubled talks. “The prime minister will speak to [Von der Leyen] tomorrow afternoon to take stock of the UK-EU negotiations,” a Downing Street spokesman said. Johnson said he hoped a trade deal with the EU could be agreed, but the UK was well prepared if final-stage talks failed. “I very much hope that we will [get a deal], and obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. I think there is a deal to be done if they want to do it. If not, the country is of course very, very well prepared and as I have said before, we can do very, very well on Australian terms.” Claims that Joe Biden’s expected victory in the US presidential election had provoked the meeting were dismissed by EU and British sources as “far fetched”. Sources said the call was scheduled before election night and that uncertainty over the potential for a trade deal with the new US administration was having little or no impact on the talks. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, returns to London for the trade and security negotiations on Sunday. EU diplomats representing the 27 member states were told by the European commission on Friday that the next “major moment” would come at the end of next week, on Barnier’s return. The outstanding issues remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. EU officials close to the negotiations bemoaned a particular absence of progress on the so-called level playing field provisions to ensure neither side can deregulate to gain an advantage or unfairly subsidise businesses. There remains a lack of accord on how prohibitive the rules on domestic subsidies should be in the future treaty. Barnier told EU diplomats this week that the two sides were also struggling to agree a “credible mechanism” to ensure that social, environmental and labour standards on both sides develop in parallel. “We are nowhere,” said one source. The UK has agreed to non-regression from the current level but is resisting provisions that would tie the UK to Brussels’ rulebook in perpetuity. “Ideology is difficult to overcome,” said a source. EU sources said they hoped that the UK government’s refusal to budge was “brinkmanship” and “posturing” but they feared the two sides were doomed to run out of time, with neither willing to budge. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, has been pushing for a “final arbitration” meeting between Johnson and Von der Leyen, to Barnier’s frustration. Barnier told diplomats this week the gap between the two sides remained too wide on too many issues for such a moment to deliver a solution. He told MEPs in a meeting on Wednesday that “next week is really the last chance for the British to move”. One EU official said Johnson had not shown “any grasp of the detail”. Should a deal be possible, it is hoped the 27 EU leaders will be able to sign it off at an upcoming conference call on 19 November or at a similar summit expected to be arranged soon after. Sources suggested agreement needed to be found by 12 or 13 November to allow the European parliament to start its ratification process."
2020-11-06T13:39:46Z,politics,Politics,UK recession fears and rivalries take the shine off Rishi Sunak,"From Whitehall to Wetherspoon’s, there was near universal agreement that Rushi Sunak was performing very well under the stresses of the pandemic. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis the chancellor – a virtual unknown outside the Westminster bubble just months earlier – was getting almost as much airtime as the prime minister and collecting a string of flattering nicknames. There was “Dishy Rishi” for his “Eat out to help out” scheme designed to help restaurants recover from the first national lockdown. The financial news provider Bloomberg also dubbed Sunak, a Star Wars fan, “Britain’s economic Jedi”, for turning on the Treasury’s taps to pay millions of workers’ furlough wages and help save thousands of businesses from collapse. Sunak’s ability to gather such broad support – the pollsters Ipsos Mori found him to be the most popular chancellor since Labour’s Denis Healey in the 1970s – was noted by political pundits, who were quick to cast him as the “prime minister-in-waiting”. He remains the bookies’ firm favourite to take the top job.
But perhaps Sunak, who turned 40 during the first lockdown and has only been an MP since 2015, let his star rise a little too quickly. His rivals are seeding what they hope will be a more lasting, and damaging, label: “Rishi’s recession.” Perhaps this was in the back of his mind when on Thursday he set out the government’s latest spectacular U-turn: extending the furlough scheme to pay up to 80% of a person’s wages up until the end of March 2021. This had not been part of the Sunak master plan, but the chancellor had been under pressure from all sides.
Boris Johnson, who installed Sunak in No 11 in February, and his allies are understood to have launched a subtle campaign to ensure Sunak will be associated with the UK’s deepest recession since records began. His name is also being actively linked with some of the government’s most unpopular policies, including the refusal to concede to the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to extend free school meals over half-term. A Sun on Sunday article headlined Rishi vs Rashi accused Sunak of “parking the Treasury bus” to block £20m needed to feed 1.4 million underprivileged children. Allies of Sunak denied the claim and said the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had not asked for the money.
“He’ll have to take his share of bad news, not just clean up for stuff that works,” one insider said. A minister was said to grumble that Sunak needed to be told to “stop behaving as if he is PM already”. Whether he blocked it or not, the government’s failure to find £20m for hungry children while the chancellor spent half a billion on Eat out to help out has not gone unnoticed at food banks across the country, including those in Sunak’s Richmond constituency in Yorkshire. Alison Grainger, who helps run a food bank in Northallerton, near Sunak’s £1.5m constituency home, said it was “bewildering and disappointing” that Sunak “could help people rich enough to eat out at restaurants, but not people here who can’t afford to feed their families the basics”. Grainger said she had been impressed by Sunak when he came (along with a publicist and cameraman) to volunteer at the Hambleton Foodshare food bank in the town centre a few years ago. “People in the town have been proud of Rishi and what he’s done during the pandemic,” she said. “But now I think there is a feeling of disappointment, that he’s trying to do his best for big business but leaving the community to come together to feed the kids.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is thought to be working on the assumption it will be Sunak not Johnson he will be fighting at the 2024 general election, and is now zeroing in on the chancellor, blaming him for the economic pain that will be caused by the month-long England-wide lockdown that began this week. Starmer said it was Sunak who blocked the implementation of a less severe two-week “circuit breaker” recommended by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in September. “Make no mistake, the chancellor’s name is all over this,” the Labour leader told company bosses at the Confederation of British Industry virtual conference on Monday. “[It was] his decision to block a circuit breaker – to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’.”
Sunak, Starmer said, failed to learn, failed to listen and failed to lead. “The result is tragic – but all too predictable,” Starmer added. “It makes me so angry.” Sunak’s previous winter economy plan, which cut the amount of money workers would receive and increase companies’ contributions, did not even make it to the middle of autumn. His mantra that he “can’t save every job” had changed to say he was acting to “help protect as many jobs as possible” but only those that were “viable”. The suggestion that the chancellor and his mandarins could decide whose jobs were viable and whose weren’t sparked an immediate backlash, particularly among powerful figures in the arts. Asked by ITV News if he was suggesting some of the UK’s “fabulous musicians and artists and actors” should get another job, Sunak said: “As in all walks of life, everyone’s having to adapt.” “I can’t pretend that everyone can do exactly the same job that they were doing at the beginning of this crisis,” he said. “That’s why we’ve put a lot of resource into trying to create new opportunities.” This was met with derision – from stars used to the mud of Glastonbury to those accustomed to the glamour of the Royal Opera House. The British soprano Louise Alder said she couldn’t work in the UK “because my industry doesn’t exist” but could in Germany, where audiences are socially distanced. “In Germany I am ‘viable’. I choose to stay there,” she said. Oasis’s Liam Gallagher attacked government “dopes” for “telling musicians and people in arts to retrain and get another job”. The actor Michelle Collins, who played Cindy Beale in Eastenders, said: “Thirty-five years an actor, I now have a non-viable job. Thanks Rishi Sunak, is that all of us in the arts? We are prevented from working so cannot even work if we wanted to. Absolutely insulting to me and all those people who thrive in and enjoy the arts. Brings £120bn into economy.”
The chancellor, and his team of special advisers and image consultants running his social media campaign on Instagram and Twitter, are keen to point out that it was hard work and ambition that helped Sunak rise to the top. They talk of his summer job as a waiter at Kuti’s Brasserie Indian restaurant in Southampton, where he grew up, and his admiration for Southampton football legend Matt Le Tissier. Less often mentioned is his time as head boy at £13,000-a-term Winchester college, reading PPE at Oxford University or his years working for Goldman Sachs and controversial City hedge funds. Sunak’s own vast personal wealth – which includes a £10m-plus property portfolio with homes in Notting Hill and California as well as a Georgian manor house set in 12 acres of grounds in the village of Kirby Sigston, north Yorkshire – has also caused an unwanted distraction. Around the tearooms in Westminster, MPs are said to speculate that he probably also holds the title of “the richest man in the House of Commons”. “There is a sense that his wealth can make him feel a bit detached from other people,” said one Conservative MP who, like Sunak, was first elected to the Commons in 2015. “Beyond his ministerial team, there’s not really anyone I can think of who you’d say is a close ally.”
The MP said that Sunak’s ambitions were based on projecting a broad sense of competence, rather than forming a clique. “You could argue that he has done quite well so far, but giving out all the money is the easy bit. There’s a long way to go.” It’s impossible to find out just how rich Sunak is or where his millions are invested as he moved his wealth into a blind trust in July 2019. Labour activists have also seized on Sunak’s wealth and “lavish celebrity lifestyle” producing a viral video asking: “Is Dishy Rishi on your side? You decide.” The video, produced by the campaign group One Rule for Them, describes Sunak as “Boris’s smooth-talking people’s politician” and accuses him of planning tax cuts for “his old mates in the City”.
As images of Sunak’s Californian beach house, Yorkshire estate and “mansion in Kensington to boot” flash up, the narrator claims the chancellor once worked for a hedge fund that helped crash the economy. Adam McNicholas, founder of One Rule for Them, which describes itself as “a grassroots campaign fighting back against a government who thinks it’s one rule for their lot and another for the rest of us”, said he decided to create the video to “show the public who Sunak really is”. “Not many people knew he was a hedge fund manager, at a fund that helped crash the economy,” he said. “People need to know that before they make up their minds about him.”"
2020-11-06T13:05:11Z,politics,Politics,How a full-scale lockdown rebellion by Tory MPs was called off,"Just a few hours ahead of Wednesday’s Commons vote to approve lockdown 2.0, a dozen sceptical Conservative MPs gathered in parliament’s grand committee room 14. Minds had not yet been made up. Little more than a year ago, Tory MPs filed into the same room to cast their ballots in the leadership race that propelled Boris Johnson to Downing Street. Now, his party was being asked to support ordering the public to “stay at home” for a second time and many were deeply uncomfortable. As the clock ticked down, eyes were glued to the laptop set up in front of them. Joined by nearly 20 more of their Conservative colleagues on a Zoom call, they grilled the Sage member Sir Jeremy Farrar as he made the case for the 28-day restrictions via video link. Edward Argar, a health minister, watched on virtually and closed proceedings. The leading lockdown critic and former Tory minister Steve Baker, who organised the hour-long morning meeting, said: “The scene really was members of parliament wrestling with an impossibly hard choice, with vast uncertainty on both sides of the question, really profound consequences and a sense of what the hell are they going to do? They had the best opportunity they were going to get to grill the best advocate of the government’s position.” Not everyone was convinced. “In some cases it was very successful, in some cases colleagues decided to prioritise other matters,” he added. Baker, who as the former ERG chairman is a battle-hardened leader of Brexit rebellions, said: “On this matter I took an early decision that it was not for me as an individual backbencher to be seeking to drive MPs to one side of the question or another. I felt that the proper thing for me to do as an organiser of my colleagues, the best service I could render them and the public, was to make the arguments available to them.” Wednesday morning’s Zoom call wasn’t the only attempt to sway wavering minds on the back benches. Elsewhere, some former cabinet ministers were offered a virtual chat with Michael Gove – but it was the 2019 “red wall” intake where the government really focused its efforts to contain a full-scale rebellion. Calls from Boris Johnson and prepared speeches given to MPs by the whips office appeared to quell any major outbreak of ill-discipline from newly elected troops. But the whipping operation was harder this time than the Brexit votes, because Downing Street cannot reach all the MPs who have concerns. One veteran MP said there was growing despair about Johnson’s ability to steer the country through the crisis. “Dominic Cummings is also part of that,” the MP said in reference to prime minister’s most senior adviser, who the Guardian exposed for travelling to Durham during the height of the first set of restrictions in March. “And he is the one who is most in favour of locking down and just letting the economy tank.” The anti-lockdown group is not tight, in the way that Brexit factions were co-ordinated. Some are from rural constituencies. Others are passionate libertarians and oppose lockdowns on a values basis. But it isn’t small. Baker runs a WhatsApp broadcast list – which allows users to send a message to several contacts at once – entitled “lockdown sceptics”, which has 95 Tory MPs on it receiving updates, although colleagues cannot see who else is on it or reply to other recipients.
“What really worries me is that so many people were apparently quite happy to vote to deprive people of basic liberties,” one MP said. “That is how dictatorship happens. Adolf Hitler went through a constitutional process.” One rebel MP said that whips had focused on the 2019 intake. “Lots of people that didn’t vote with us were bullied like mad yesterday, most of the young lot, new entrants, were given speeches by the whips and told their futures lay supporting the government,” the MP said. “Boris was determined. He was ringing everybody.” Another MP, who did not rebel, said: “A large number of Conservative MPs think we are going to have to learn to live with this virus. So the approach he’s taking is burning his political capital with a lot of backbenchers.” The government easily won Wednesday’s vote to impose new restrictions in England for 28 days, by a margin of 516 votes to 38, with Labour’s backing. Several of the 34 Tory MPs who rebelled told no one of their plans until theyvoted. “I didn’t talk to anybody else about this, apart from one neighbouring colleague ,” the MP said. “If you look at the list, there are some people who just don’t like Boris. That’s politics. But there were some who are traditionally much more loyal, who had to say, ‘No, I just can’t do this.’ ” One senior Conservative MP, who voted against the new lockdown on Wednesday, told the Guardian: “You had some pretty heavyweight MPs in the no lobby or among those who abstained. Looking at Theresa May, who is not an excitable individual, denouncing the quality of the data on which we’re being asked to make this decision, and saying it was dodgy data, I thought was a remarkable thing.”
Several discontented Tory MPs said that now the vote was over, the rebels could now coalesce around specific demands. “Every time we vote on measures, more and more reluctantly, there is constant failure and no strategy,” one normally loyal MP said. One persistent source of anger is a lack of access to data. Many complain that the data presented by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance is questionable or out ofdate. “The government is almost creating a miasma of ignorance around what it’s doing,” said Chris Green, the MP for Bolton who resigned as a PPS over the local lockdown in his town. “People want answers, they’re not getting them, and therefore people reject what the government is saying. Therefore, compliance with edicts will go down.” David Jones, the former Brexit minister, added: “The evidence that has been produced is obsolete and therefore unreliable. I could not in good conscience vote to deprive so many of my fellow citizens of their essential freedoms on the basis of such unreliable evidence.” Others say they believe their local authorities are coping perfectly well with coronavirus and cannot see the logic of imposing a lockdown on already struggling businesses. Jonathan Djanogly, the MP for Huntington, said: “In my local area, the head of the health service, the council, the MPs, the police, everyone gets together once a week and it’s amazingly cohesive, decisions are made within three hours when they could have taken three months before. It is incredibly impressive – they have managed the situation.” He said he had been asked to support a lockdown without being given any data on the costs it would have. A number of MPs said they expected ministers to try to extend lockdown on 2 December, and that if this happened, the government would need Labour votes for it to pass. One predicted up to 100 Conservative MPs would refuse to back another lockdown extension. One senior MP said, “My reading of the temperature is that the centre of gravity – given that lots of people are very concerned about being portrayed as not caring about their local hospital being overwhelmed or their ICU not being able to cope – is very much ‘thus far but no further’. ” That warning was echoed by Baker. “We have to come out of this with a clear strategy for living with the virus and we never lock down again,” he said."
2020-11-06T12:46:40Z,politics,Politics,Home Office accused of breaching court order over asylum seeker evictions,"The Home Office has been accused of breaching a high court order that halts the eviction of asylum seekers during the pandemic lockdown, the Guardian has learned. During the first lockdown in March, the eviction of refused asylum seekers from Home Office accommodation was paused for public health reasons to protect asylum seekers and the general public from Covid-19. Asylum seekers who are made street homeless could be at risk of contracting and spreading coronavirus if left outside or sofa surfing, which would involve going from one household to another, which is banned during lockdown.
After the government’s lockdown announcement on Saturday, the Guardian asked the Home Office if it would pause evictions of asylum seekers once again. A government statement was provided on Tuesday, Home Office sources said, saying that while the policy was under review and would be determined by local circumstances, it was business as usual: those whose asylum claims had failed were expected to leave the country within 21 days and cessations of support had resumed in September. What the statement did not mention was that 24 hours earlier, on Monday, a high court judge, Mr Justice Fordham, had issued a court order instructing the Home Office to halt evictions because of public health concerns. The order was an interim measure until the matter could be more fully investigated at another court hearing. In his ruling, the judge said: “I have been given no reason and shown no reasoned document which addresses a basis for continuing with evictions in the circumstances. I cannot currently see a justification for continuing with evictions in the circumstances where the harm and risk cannot readily be reversed.” A Nigerian refused asylum seeker who received an eviction notice from the Home Office brought the case that resulted in the court order. But despite this order, the eviction process continued. On Tuesday, lawyers sought an urgent out-of-hours court hearing at 11.30pm to halt another threatened eviction that appeared to be going ahead despite the court order issued the previous day. The Guardian spoke to a 30-year-old woman from the Caribbean whose asylum claim based on gender identity was refused. The Home Office cut off her financial support on 19 October, and on Wednesday an official from the Home Office housing subcontractor Mears arrived at her door and handed her a pro forma eviction letter with the date she needed to leave the property – 11 November – handwritten into it. “I can see myself ending up on the streets,” she said. ”I have nowhere to go. My friends are asylum seekers and I’m not allowed to stay at their accommodation. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have previously made two suicide attempts. I feel like an outcast.” The eviction letter seen by the Guardian states: “You need to leave this property by 11 November 2020. We understand it is a key step in your asylum journey.” The letter suggests contacting the Home Office contractor Migrant Help for post-eviction support. “I did that but all they could offer me was a list of food banks,” said the woman. Kathy Cosgrove, a solicitor at Greater Manchester Law Centre who secured the court order on behalf of the Nigerian asylum seeker, welcomed the order but expressed concern about the Home Office’s failure to commit to halting evictions. “The home secretary has failed to promise to cease evictions and protect not only former asylum seekers but the communities in which they live. The government claims to follow the science but appears to have not considered the public health impact of making hundreds of former asylum seekers destitute.” Anna Lewis, the chief executive of Open Door North East, which has been supporting asylum seekers issued with eviction notices, said: “Over the last seven weeks, the Home Office has sought to dehumanise these individuals further by seeking to remove food and shelter from those who do not agree to return to their country of origin – a process which has created intense anxiety among the people we serve. We have supported people who were told they had to leave their home on the day of the lockdown or in the next few days and we were unable to give them any certainty that they would be made safe.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are fixing our broken asylum system to make it firm and fair. We will seek to stop abuse of the system while ensuring it is compassionate towards those who need our help, welcoming people through safe and legal routes. “There is no court order stopping all cessations of asylum support, but an interim order to pause decisions on support for failed asylum seekers. We have instructed contractors to pause cases that were being implemented at the time that this order came into effect.”"
2020-11-05T19:07:19Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak's star fades as he flip-flops on furlough ... again | John Crace,"I suspect that even Rishi Sunak is struggling to keep up. He is the chancellor with the budget box of many colours. At a rough count there have been at least eight different statements to announce new furlough measures since March, even if only five have ever been fully implemented. Three job support schemes in his winter economy plan have flatlined and been scrapped even before they were due to be introduced. It’s hard to know if he even agrees with himself any more and hasn’t just been bullied into the changes by the prime minister. With this rate of attrition, it’s becoming increasingly hard to know which government measures to take seriously and which to ignore. On Thursday morning the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, blamed the public’s failure to comply with restrictions as the prime reason for the second national lockdown. It didn’t appear to have occurred to him that many people might have thought the government was just having another of its funny turns and would have reversed the lockdown by the time so many had got round to breaking it.
Back in September, the chancellor had been absolutely clear as he ended the first – or maybe the second (my memory is as poor as his) – bailout scheme. “I don’t think it is the right thing to do to endlessly extend furlough,” he had announced to solemn nods of agreement from Boris Johnson and Conservative backbenchers in the Commons. And yet here he was, back in the chamber, to declare that he hadn’t really meant what he had said about all those variations on reducing payments to those whose businesses and livelihoods had been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and that he was going back to plan A. Or possibly plan B. As from now, all furlough payments would be reinstated, though not to those he had either deliberately or accidentally previously excluded, until March next year, presumably to prevent him from having to come up with another bailout package after yet more lockdowns or for all those job losses as the result of the government’s failure to agree a Brexit deal. If those negotiations break down, then half the country could be on furlough.
In previous appearances at the dispatch box, Sunak has appeared urbane and in command. The man riding to the rescue with suitcases full of cash. The Del Monte man who liked to say “yes”. Even when he was offering less than before. Now though, the chancellor appeared edgy. Brittle even. As if aware he was rapidly using up all his goodwill and there was only a certain number of times you could claim to be “financially agile” and “reacting to fast-moving events” before the country began to wonder if you were actually a bit clueless and making it up as you went along. After all, the new plan looked much the same as the first plan. Knocked up on the back of the same cigarette packet, and in the time wasted with his indecision hundreds of thousands might have already lost their job. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, was in no mood to take any prisoners. She simply stated the obvious. That Sage had predicted a second wave of infections and that another lockdown was an inevitability, so why had he previously tried to cap the government support at 67% to the many millions who were likely to find themselves off work?
It was hard enough to get by on the minimum wage as it was, and 67% of the minimum wage was hardly going to make ends meet. Sunak kept his head down and said little. Unlike Boris, he has the emotional intelligence not to try to bluster his way out of awkward situations. He knows when he’s busted. The rest of the session divided along predictable lines. Northern Labour MPs wondered why 67% had been OK for regions in tier 3, but 80% was now on offer when the rest of the country was affected. Welsh MPs observed that the need for a lockdown had been so clear the country had already been in one for the last two weeks, and the Scots sensed the scheme may not turn out to be all that it seemed. They may yet be right. The Tories forgot they had congratulated the chancellor for his previous schemes and pretended this was the first time they had ever heard of a furlough. It took Peter Bone to ask the one awkward question. Great bailout and all that, but how was he going to pay for it. Sunak shrugged. Boris, meanwhile, is acting more and more like a C-list celebrity on a Channel 5 reality TV show. Ready to endure any humiliation as long as there’s a TV camera to record it. You might have thought that for the Downing Street press conference we might get a double dose of Rishi to explain all over again while he still had star quality, albeit a bit tarnished. Instead we got Boris saying precisely nothing, other than to insist again that the NHS had begged him to delay his lockdown until it was running almost at breaking point. So folks, Johnson concluded, please just do your best to comply with the rules this time so we won’t need another lockdown again immediately. Boris could have done himself and everyone else a favour and just had a word in private with Dominic Cummings. Most of us don’t need to be told there are Specsaver branches outside Barnard Castle."
2020-11-05T18:58:40Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says four nations working on family Christmas plan,"Boris Johnson has announced plans for people across the UK to be able to spend Christmas with their extended families, while conceding that the government’s test-and-trace system “hasn’t had as much impact as we would have wanted” in reducing the spread of coronavirus. The prime minister used a Downing Street press conference alongside Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to try to push the message that people should abide by the four-week lockdown in England. Johnson and Stevens noted that 11,000-plus people were in hospital with coronavirus, and said that without public compliance over the lockdown, the NHS could struggle badly. “This second wave of coronavirus is real and it’s serious,” Stevens said, comparing the current number of Covid patients with the 3,000 that would be seen during a bad winter flu season. “This is not speculation, this is fact,” he said, a reference to scepticism among some Conservative MPs and others about projections of the potential impact of a new surge in Covid without the lockdown. Official figures released on Thursday showed that another 378 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 48,120. There were also a further 24,141 lab-confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to 1,123,197. Separate figures for deaths where the virus has been mentioned on the death certificate show there have now been around 63,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. The UK Statistics Authority criticised ministers earlier in the day for the use of data and predictions during pre-lockdown briefings at the weekend, saying there needed to be more transparency about how they were used. Stevens showed only one chart at Thursday’s press conference, which plotted actual hospital admissions caused by Covid over recent months. “Sometimes the charts can be a bit hard to keep up with,” he said. Johnson said the government and the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were “working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live”. “I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus,” he said. “But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures, though they are tough, are time-limited. “The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel.” Johnson set out what he said were the three strands to being able to “put the coronavirus back in its box”: better treatments for the illness, testing and the prospect of a vaccine. Questioned about figures showing that only 59.9% of close contacts of people who test positive for coronavirus are being reached and asked to self-isolate, Johnson said he accepted that the test-and-trace system could be better. “It has come in for a lot of criticism, and clearly it has taken too long for people to get their results sometimes. But they are improving,” he said. “It hasn’t had as much impact as we would have wanted. But there’s no doubt that by identifying people who have the disease, and identifying the localities where people have the disease, being able to get the R down in a way I don’t think we would have otherwise done, it’s had an effect.” Highlighting plans to roll out mass, near-instant tests, with a pilot under way in Liverpool, Johnson said he hoped that such technology would “offer a real way forward through this crisis”. Asked about vaccines, Johnson and Stevens expressed optimism that at least one of the many in development would prove effective, with the PM likening this to the “number of shots raining down on the goal”. Stevens declined to criticise the timing of the new lockdown. Government scientists had first advised a “circuit breaker” shutdown to stem infection rates in September. He said the NHS had spent the summer catching up with cancelled routine operations. “When the facts change you’ve got to act in accordance with those new facts, and quickly,” Stevens said."
2020-11-05T18:21:53Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Sweden and Germany put on quarantine list; Johnson raises Christmas hopes - as it happened,"Rishi Sunak has announced the government will extend furlough until the end of March as the second coronavirus wave and renewed lockdown measures threaten to drive up unemployment. The Bank of England has launched a fresh Â£150bn stimulus package for the UK economy. Boris Johnson has claimed that people will be able to have â€œas normal a Christmas as possibleâ€� if they comply with the lockdown rules. Speaking at his press conference this evening, he said: I have every confidence, if we follow this package of measures [ie, the lockdown] in the way that we can, as we have done before, I have no doubt that people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and that we will be able to get things open before Christmas as well. The second national lockdown in England has been caused in part by a lack of public compliance, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has said, adding that it will be a â€œhuge challengeâ€� to get the public to follow the strict rules this time. Boris Johnson has been under pressure to follow European leaders and warn Donald Trump that he will be damaging democracy worldwide if he continues to allege ballot fraud in the US presidential election without any supporting evidence.

2020-11-05T17:47:21Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit may reduce our food shipments to Northern Ireland, says Sainsbury's","Sainsbury’s has said the supply of some fish, dairy and meat products to its stores in Northern Ireland could be significantly reduced from January because of Brexit. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of the supermarket chain, said on Thursday: “If we don’t get greater clarity on the Northern Irish situation then we will see a restriction on the ranges of products we can sell. This is not one or two products in stores I am talking about, it is a substantial number of products and quite key, everyday products too.” Supermarkets’ supply chains will be hit by Brexit whether there is a free trade deal or not between the EU and the UK because the Northern Ireland protocol kicks in at 11pm on 31 December. Under the deal struck by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, fresh food coming into the region from Great Britain will be subjected to checks including customs declarations, and health certification protecting the island of Ireland from outbreaks of infections such as salmonella. Roberts said the industry was pushing for clarity as soon as possible on trading with Northern Ireland post-Brexit to prevent shortages in stores there from January. He said the industry had a “productive” meeting with government last week and wanted something akin to “trusted trader status” to help the flow of goods. “Customers expect to have access to a full range but [it] won’t be possible to make that available unless something changes,” Roberts said. Sainsbury’s has 13 stores in Northern Ireland, and its experience will be mirrored by its rivals Tesco, which has 55 stores in the region, and Asda, which has about 20 shops there. Both chains also source a lot of their products from mainland UK. Roberts said: “Customers are expecting value for money and continuity of supply. We need clarity from government to help us to be able to do that.” He said the problems could affect a “substantial number of products” including processed meat, such as mince and sausages, as well as fish and dairy items. Marks and Spencer said on Wednesday that its business in Ireland could be affected if no deal was agreed with the EU, and significant tariffs and bureaucratic costs were added to food imports – a development local business leaders have been warning about since January. It is understood supermarkets are also concerned that the EU has yet to grant a third-country listing, which would confirm that the UK conforms with EU regulations. While that listing is privately expected to be granted, the lack of clarity has put food suppliers, including Scottish seed potato companies, which sell into Northern Ireland, under “incredible strain”, according to Holyrood’s environment minister. With 55 days to go before the end of the transition period, there are many other outstanding issues affecting food suppliers in Great Britain, including the labelling and rules applying to food with ingredients from outside the EU. While significant differences remain in negotiations between the UK and EU, trade talks on Brexit are expected to continue from Sunday. If a deal can be struck it is expected that products that are more than 50% British will qualify under a rules of origin regime for tariff-free and quota-free sales across the EU. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, EU rules will apply in the region, so supermarket chains transporting food to shops in Belfast, Enniskillen or Derry will also have to satisfy rules of origin specifications. This requirement could affect the sale of biscuits, for example, if the grain has been sourced from Ukraine or elsewhere. Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the UK’s Food and Drink Federation, said: “Producers are now preparing for this worst-case scenario and many are planning to stop supplying the Northern Ireland market after 1 January 2021, to make as yet unconfirmed changes required for product labelling or while they assess if it remains a viable option for their business.”"
2020-11-05T15:27:12Z,politics,Politics,Johnson urged to denounce Trump's claims of US election fraud,"Boris Johnson has been under pressure to follow European leaders and warn Donald Trump that he will be damaging democracy worldwide if he continues to allege ballot fraud in the US presidential election without any supporting evidence. The prime minister said on Wednesday it was not for the UK as an ally of the US to intervene in the internal politics of the country, a claim that led to charges of cowardice from Labour and contrasted with a clearer stance stance from German politicians. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “It is important that all politicians who reach people directly, establish trust in the electoral process and the results.” He added it would be “premature” to comment further given that ballots were still being counted. The German chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, described Trump’s behaviour as “really unbelievable and it’s really with great sadness to many, many Germans to witness this awful behaviour”. The leadership of the Social Democratic party of Germany (SPD) accused Trump of trying to foment civil unrest with co-leader Saskia Esken saying: “In a democracy every vote counts and elections are decided by the voters.” “A candidate, even if he is the incumbent president, who calls for absentee votes not to be counted, acts anti-democratically,” Esken added. “More than ever, it is true that we have to defend our democratic achievements against populist and nationalist agitation.” Speaking on Sky news, the UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, became the first minister to hint at any criticism, calling for a “smooth” transition of power if Trump loses the election. He said: “We are all watching, biting our nails to see what might happen in those key swing states. But the important thing from our point of view is that we want the major democracy in the world to have a smooth transition, whether it’s a change of president or whether it’s the same president, we wish them well.” Ministers will be reluctant to ring Joe Biden to congratulate him on his victory until Trump has conceded defeat, but there is a danger that the US president will not do that, and will instead challenge the result either through lengthy vexatious court challenges, or by encouraging his supporters to take to the streets. The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, tried to avoid direct criticism of Trump saying he supported Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell in his call to keep counting the votes, but said it would be wrong for the UK to get involved in this stage. Asked if he approved of Trump’s challenge to the results, he said: “If he has got evidence let him bring it. That is how a fair and open legal system works. If he does not then it is simply undermining the process. Keep voting, keep calm.” Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chairman of the defence select committee, sent out a warning shot. “With authoritarianism on the rise across the world, how America handles and respects the democratic process over the next 48 hours will impact on all western nations’ credibility to uphold, promote and defend hard fought standards at a time of growing global instability.” The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told ITV’s Peston that Johnson and the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, were refusing to criticise Trump. “If he had been the leader of any other country in the world then the foreign secretary and the prime minister would have called it out.” She added: “He is behaving like a tinpot dictator… and it’s not acceptable and it should be called out.”"
2020-11-05T14:43:32Z,politics,Politics,Sunak now prefers risk of doing too much to risk of doing too little,"The past few weeks have been tough for Britain, tough for the government and tough for Rishi Sunak. The chancellor’s once glowing reputation has taken a battering in recent weeks as he has been forced to amend his support packages for the economy time and again. The latest U-turn involves extending the furlough scheme until the end of March, something Sunak said was necessary because the experience of the first lockdown was that the pain lingered even when restrictions were eased. Yet the unspoken message was that tough curbs on activity would remain in place even when the lockdown in England expires on 2 December. Rather than come back at that point, the chancellor is trying to do now what he has failed to do previously and get ahead of the curve. Sunak’s furlough pledge came just hours after the Bank of England announced it was boosting its money creation – or quantitative easing – programme by a bigger-than-expected £150bn. Again, the subtext was plain: on the day that England went into lockdown, we, the two institutions primarily responsible for economy policy in the UK, are working together and have your back. The IMF has praised the coordinated way in which the Bank and the Treasury have acted throughout the crisis and this was another example of it. There is a limit to what the Bank of England can do to boost activity, and that piles extra pressure on Sunak. Over the past couple of months, the chancellor has dropped talk of saving only “viable” jobs and is now in “whatever it takes” mode. It was significant that his latest statement did not include any mention of eventually taking steps to reduce the record peacetime deficit the UK will run in the current financial year. The risk of doing too little is seen as greater than that of doing too much. That looks like the correct call. The government is probably on course to borrow £400bn in 2020-21 but is having no trouble servicing its debt. Extending the furlough will limit – although not prevent entirely – the rise in unemployment expected over the coming months. The Bank estimates that in November 5.5 million people will be furloughed, falling to 2.5 million in December and the first quarter of 2021. That, however, assumes that restrictions after the four-week English lockdown ends on 2 December revert to the level of severity in mid-October, and there is a very good chance that fears of another surge in the infection rate will make ministers ultra-cautious about opening up the economy in the run-up to Christmas. Threadneedle Street thinks output will shrink by 2% in the final three months of 2020 but is aware that it could be worse than that.
Ultimately, there is no getting away from the fact that locking down businesses – not once but twice – comes at a cost: in this case an economy predicted to be 11% smaller in the final three months of 2020 than it was a year earlier. Everything is now about damage limitation."
2020-11-05T12:57:52Z,politics,Politics,Alok Sharma met Prince Charles three days after staffer's Covid test result,"Alok Sharma met Prince Charles at Clarence House three days after a staff member in the business secretary’s private office tested positive for Covid-19, it has emerged. The Guardian disclosed this week that the employee in Sharma’s inner circle received the positive result last Monday, after a union health and safety inspection report had identified concerns over social distancing in his office. Sharma had a meeting involving the individual on the Thursday before the test result, and the pair were in the department’s Whitehall office the following day. Sharma then flew to South Korea on the Saturday, where he continued meeting foreign dignitaries after being informed of the positive test, while other colleagues were forced to self-isolate. Now the Guardian has learned that once back in the UK, Sharma met Charles last Thursday. An entry on the court circular for 29 October states: “The Prince of Wales this morning received the Rt. Hon. Rishi Sunak MP (Chancellor of the Exchequer). His Royal Highness afterwards received the Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma MP (Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).” A spokesperson for Sharma stressed that Clarence House was made aware of the confirmed Covid test in Sharma’s office before the meeting, and it was agreed that it should go ahead as he did not have symptoms and had not been told to isolate. They said Sharma had had no “close contact” with the staffer who tested positive. The department has refused to say how long Sharma’s meeting with the employee who tested positive lasted or the number of staff forced to isolate. Separately, it was confirmed on Thursday that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had entered self-isolation. The Foreign Office said Raab had been informed that an individual with whom he had been in recent close contact with had tested positive for coronavirus. “In line with government regulations and NHS track-and-trace rules, the foreign secretary has taken immediate steps to self-isolate for the required period. He will continue to work remotely during this time,” a spokesman said. The government says a person who catches coronavirus can be infectious from up to two days before they are symptomatic, for up to 10 days thereafter, and can pass on the infection even if they have no symptoms. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization states: “The time from exposure to Covid-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days.” If an individual is informed by NHS test and trace that they are a “contact” of someone who has caught Covid-19, by law they must isolate for 14 days from their last point of contact with the person. Charles contracted coronavirus in March, and later said he “got away with it quite lightly” after experiencing only mild symptoms. It emerged this week that Prince William tested positive for Covid in April, which was not made public at the time. There have been documented cases around the world of individuals catching the disease twice, including in the US where researchers last month reported the country’s first confirmed coronavirus reinfection. Unions representing civil servants wrote to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) permanent secretary, Sarah Munby, last month to express “extreme concern” following confirmed cases there. There are understood to have been two other recent Covid cases among BEIS staff. A Public and Commercial Services (PCS) health and safety inspection of BEIS’s office carried out on Thursday 22 October – the same day of Sharma’s meeting including the individual who has tested positive for Covid – noted: “Ministerial offices, especially SoS [secretary of state], were very crowded and by far the busiest part of the building … We believe there are too many people (8 PO staff when we inspected) routinely in the SoS’s private office to enable social distancing and so protect the health and safety of all staff.” A spokesperson for the business secretary, who previously pointed out Sharma had tested negative before and after his South Korea trip, said: “The business secretary had no close contact with the staff member who tested positive at any stage. At no point has Mr Sharma been told to self-isolate either by NHS test and trace or through the NHS Covid-19 app, because he and the staff member were not in close contact at any stage. “Clarence House was informed of the situation ahead of the meeting and it was agreed it could progress as planned as Mr Sharma did not have symptoms and had not been told to self-isolate. Mr Sharma has followed all of the government’s guidelines at all times.”"
2020-11-05T06:00:38Z,politics,Politics,Tory London mayoral candidate criticised over TfL bailout 'facts' site,"The London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has been criticised after his team launched a “facts” website about the bailout for Transport for London that makes minimal references to its creation by the Conservative party. The website, titled Transport for London Bailout Facts, describes itself as “everything you need to know about TfL’s second bailout”. It attacks the mayor Sadiq Khan’s oversight of the authority at a time when it has needed a £1.8bn government bailout after revenues fell during the pandemic. Only at the very bottom of the page does the site state that it is “published by Kerry Halfpenny on behalf of Shaun Bailey”, before listing the address of the Conservative campaign headquarters in London. The website makes no explicit reference to the Conservative party or to Bailey’s hopes to challenge Khan for the mayoralty, meaning the website’s source may not be obvious to some readers. The “facts” claims have also been made in a leaflet campaign. The Conservatives have previously faced criticism for masquerading as a factchecking service during the 2019 general election. During the leaders’ debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s press account changed its name and branding to “factcheckUK”. Will Moy, the chief executive of Full Fact, an independent factchecking website, said the practice should be stopped, highlighting several instances of political parties and campaigners in the EU referendum creating similarly misleading materials. “It is inappropriate and misleading for a candidate for political office to brand campaign material as an independent resource,” he said. “In a democracy, voters need meaningful transparency to make informed decisions. Self-respecting politicians should make their own arguments in their own names.” The site first appeared on the Internet Archive, an automated web archive, on Sunday. Bailey does not appear to have shared the website on his Twitter account since then, but his profile contained a picture of the web address on a campaign vehicle and pictures of volunteers holding leaflets with similar designs.
Bailey had been due to go up against Khan in mayoral elections in May this year but the vote was postponed to May 2021 owing to the coronavirus lockdown. The decline in travel since the start of the pandemic has pushed TfL’s finances to the brink, and the government stepped in to bail it out at the weekend. A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said Khan was “trying to avoid responsibility” for £9.6bn in money wasted by TfL. “Londoners have a right to know the truth,” he said. A spokeswoman for Khan said Bailey’s campaign was “deliberately lying” and described the website as “fake news masquerading as ‘facts’”. She said: “The Tories must stop trying to take Londoners for fools.” The government will step in with £1.8bn to keep TfL running for the next six months, after a heated political battle between Khan and Boris Johnson, his predecessor as mayor. In return, TfL has agreed to shelve plans to build a second Crossrail link and to investigate a possible rollout of driverless trains. Johnson and Bailey have argued that Khan was responsible for “bankrupting” TfL. Khan has described this as a “blatant lie”."
2020-11-04T18:36:10Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: nearly 500 further deaths in 24 hours; MPs pass English lockdown rules by 516 votes to 38 – as it happened,"MPs have voted by a large majority to approve the English lockdown starting tomorrow â€“ although 34 Conservatives actively rebelled. Some 32 voted against, two acted as tellers, and around 16 others reportedly abstained as a protest, including the former prime minister Theresa May. (See 5.46pm.) May spoke in the debate, saying that one of her concerns was that the government was â€œmaking it illegal to conduct an act of public worshipâ€�. Many MPs complained about the provisions banning collective worship, and in his speech winding up the debate Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hinted that the rules on this might be relaxed. (See 3.57pm.) But, for the Tory lockdown-sceptics, their main objections related to the economic damage the measures will cause, plus the intrusion on personal freedom. Although MPs have debated coronavirus endlessly in recent months, there have been relatively view votes on the lockdown restrictions being imposed and this was probably the most passionate and angry debate yet. Much of it has already been published here, on Hansard online. The rebels included MPs from all wings of the party, although the most prominent tended to be libertarian Brexiters. (One of the ironies was that they were demanding an economic impact assessment of lockdown - despite actively resisting the idea for Brexit.) Boris Johnson won the vote with a majority of 478, but many of the Conservative MPs who did support him stressed their reluctance to do so and the debate showed that, if he were to try to extend the lockdown in December, a much more serious mutiny would erupt.
David Frost, the UKâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, has admitted that â€œwide divergencesâ€� remain between the two sides in the UK-EU trade talks. He made the comment on Twitter after it emerged that his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, has told EU ambassadors that the UK is holding back on holding back on making the compromises necessary for a deal. (See 4.47pm.)
The UK death toll from coronavirus has risen by 492 â€“ almost 100 more than the previous dayâ€™s increase. The NHS in England is returning to its highest state of alert amid warnings that hospitals will continue filling up with Covid-19 patients for at least another two weeks. Care home residents in England will be able to receive visits during the national lockdown after a last minute U-turn by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who has bowed to pressure from residents, relatives and care operators and reversed a ban in areas of high infection. The head of the Oxford University group developing one of the leading Covid vaccine contenders has played down the chances of vaccinating people by Christmas. Police chiefs have warned they will crack down harder on people who fail to show â€œcivic responsibilityâ€� by ignoring coronavirus restrictions and fines as England heads into lockdown this week.

2020-11-04T18:12:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris and Keir lock non-combative horns on lockdown at PMQs | John Crace,"Maybe it was because most minds were concentrated on the results of the election taking place in the US. Or maybe it was that all the arguments had already been made when the prime minister had given his statement on the second national lockdown on Monday. Either way, this week’s prime minister’s questions felt curiously underpowered. Rather as if Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson were going through the motions, with both taking it as read that it would be yet another easy points win for the Labour leader. Still, no politician has ever let repetition be a hindrance to what they are saying, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. So after inviting Johnson to agree that it wasn’t for any candidate in the US election to declare which votes counted and which didn’t – like all good populists, Boris believes you can have too much democracy, so he predictably declined to answer – Starmer moved on to the business of the lockdown. What had taken the government so long with this particular U-turn? After all, it had been two weeks since the PM had introduced a three-tiered regional system. Boris ummed and ahhed and tugged at his hair, aware that his more coiffed appearance on Monday had widely been seen as a sign of weakness, and proceeded to talk nonsense. He had been absolutely right to introduce regional lockdowns and they had been working brilliantly up until the moment he suddenly realised they weren’t working after all and that the infection rate was increasing across the country. Perhaps Starmer was as confused as everyone else by that logic or just wasn’t in the mood for gloating. Winning an argument against Boris has become too easy. All you do is argue the opposite of what he says he will do and you’ll be proved right with a government climbdown in next to no time. So rather than making a big deal of Johnson’s clear failure of leadership and that the Tories were now adopting Labour policy, Starmer kept to some simple facts. If the government had implemented the two to three-week “circuit breaker” lockdown over half-term as Sage and he had recommended, there would have been fewer deaths and less damage to the economy. Simples. So what was the plan if the R value wasn’t below 1 by 2 December? Here Boris struggled rather. While he could be sure that the lockdown regulations that parliament would be voting on later that afternoon would end on 2 December, he had no idea what might replace them if they had been insufficient in bringing down the rate of infection. Even he seems to have given up on Typhoid Dido’s test-and-trace system improving enough to bail him out, so all he could say was that he very much hoped the lockdown would work and it was political point-scoring to suggest it wouldn’t. Which was slightly ungracious as it had been Starmer’s promise to vote for the government measures that would ensure they became law. But then Boris has never been noted for either his loyalty or gratitude. He ended by incongruously saying Keir ought to be more like Tony Blair, who had written a piece in the Daily Mail about lockdowns, test and trace and vaccines that could as easily have been written by the current Labour leader. No wonder Starmer looked startled. He had spent most of the last week fending off the Labour left who felt he was already far too much like Blair. Seconds out, round three. Soon the two party leaders were slugging it out again for the debate on the new lockdown measures. Unsurprisingly, both Johnson and Starmer appeared even less enthusiastic or combative than they had earlier. Boris spent most of his time trying to dampen the concerns of the libertarians in his own party who were threatening to vote against him, rather than take pot shots at Labour, while Starmer delivered his stock speech on auto-pilot. It was all very under-powered. Things picked up a bit when Theresa May was called as Johnson seemed to make a point of walking out the chamber the moment she started talking. There is little love lost between the two and May began by saying how she would be unable to vote with the government. She must have enjoyed that. Having been serially betrayed by Boris over the years, it was good to even things up – if only a little. As so often, what was missing among the lockdown refuseniks was any sense of what they might vote for. How many Covid deaths a day were they prepared to accept to protect the economy? What alternatives to circuit breakers did they suggest, given that infection rates in regions under lockdown almost invariably only seemed to go up? Still, not having the answers has always been the backbenchers’ main privilege. It was left to Matt Hancock to close the debate for the government. He too regretted the need for the lockdown restrictions and promised to think again about people’s right to play golf and tennis. He also hinted the government might back down on communal worship. No bad thing, as prayer is all we seem to have left. With Labour backing it, the motion passed easily with fewer than 40 Tory rebels. But few were in any doubt they’d all be back to debate the same thing in a month’s time."
2020-11-04T13:39:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to comment on Trump's call to stop vote-counting,"Boris Johnson has sidestepped calls to comment on Donald Trump’s call to stop the counting of votes in the US election saying: “We don’t comment as the UK government on the democratic processes of our friends and allies.” He had been asked by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister’s questions in the Commons whether he agreed that “it’s not for the candidate to say which votes do or don’t count or when to stop counting” in the US election. Earlier on Wednesday, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had urged patience in waiting for the final outcome. Trump falsely claimed victory in the race for the presidency in the early hours of Wednesday morning, even as the election remained too close to call with millions of votes yet to be counted. He baselessly claimed “a very sad group of people is trying to disfranchise” his supporters and confirmed the worst fears of activists and analysts who predicted Trump would use spurious arguments to stop legitimate mail-in votes from being counted. Other senior UK Conservatives, including the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, have said it would be a disaster for the democratic cause worldwide if the election ends with accusations of fraud. Johnson is personally close to Trump, but will want to keep the UK government out of the controversy over the conduct of the vote and while it may be in Johnson’s personal interest to see Trump – an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit – re-elected, the Foreign Office’s long-term alignment on issues such as China, the Iran nuclear deal and the climate crisis leaves British diplomats more comfortable with a more predictable Biden presidency. Trump does not want to see the EU and the UK develop close trade or security relations after the UK’s Brexit’s transition period ends this December. Trump’s close UK supporter Nigel Farage backed Trump’s claims the election was being stolen but, when pressed to produce evidence, he was unable to do so, saying the evidence was “so new it has not yet come to light”. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, argued that in a “normal election” Labour would be more impartial but statements from the US president had put the country’s democracy “at stake”. The Labour foreign affairs spokesperson said: “We are in completely uncharted territory, and this is not like any election in my lifetime … The truth is Britain is not just a disinterested observer in this election. Everything is riding on the outcome of this election and I think that statement [on stopping vote counts] has proven why. That questions of democracy, people’s right to be heard and free and fair elections are absolutely at stake in this election. “America has, for a long time, stepped into the role as leader of the free world. And what America does matters, it sends reverberations around the world and so there is a huge amount riding on the outcome of this election.”"
2020-11-03T20:30:33Z,politics,Politics,High court rejects legal challenge over Dominic Cummings breach,"The high court has rejected a legal bid to challenge a decision not to investigate Dominic Cummings’s journey from London to Durham at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown. Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, said any decision to investigate Cummings must be made by the police. He did not have the power to interfere. Martin Redston, a 70-year-old director of a London engineering firm, had sought a judicial review over the case. At a hearing in London on Tuesday, Michael Mansfield QC said Cummings “appearing to evade any genuine scrutiny for his actions due to government associations is undermining of respect for the rule of law”. Mansfield argued that as Hill had oversight of the prosecution system, he had a duty to “nudge” the police with advice, particularly over new legislation such as the coronavirus rules. In the Cummings case, he said Hill should have “stepped in with some friendly advice” following Durham Constabulary’s three-day investigation, which only examined Cummings’s movements in County Durham including a 52-mile round trip to Barnard Castle. Mansfield said: “He should have said to the Metropolitan police: ‘This is worthy of investigation in relation to the circumstances in which Dominic Cummings left his home … and whether this does constitute a reasonable excuse.’” He also said it was important for Hill to assert his independence from government after the attorney general and prime minister said Cummings had done nothing wrong. Mansfield argued there was a clear public interest in an investigation over a concern that “the lawmaker broke the law he has made or helped to make”, adding: “If there is a prominent member of government we say flagrantly not obeying them [the rules], this affects the level of security and health for the rest. The public would be reassured if they knew they had been properly investigated.” Duncan Atkinson QC, for Hill, argued the director of public prosecutions did not have the power to refer cases to the police. In any case, Hill had not made a decision not to prosecute, the court was told. “There is no decision that can be judicially reviewed,” he said. Permission to review was rejected. Lady Justice Carr, sitting with Mr Justice Picken, said: “The decision in principle is that this renewed claim for permission to apply for judicial review will be refused.” The reasoning for the decision will be set out later this week. Redston said he would consider an appeal. Speaking outside the court he added: “I’m very disappointed. The ultimate aim of this is to ensure that Dominic Cummings is actually prosecuted for the breach of lockdown regulations. So now we need to consider how we go forward.”"
2020-11-03T19:35:31Z,politics,Politics,Boris's stooges back on the Covid tour throwing data at the politics,"Back in March, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were introduced – two ingenues blinking under the lights – to the nation at the Downing Street press conferences as the scientists to see the UK through the coronavirus pandemic. And even though Boris Johnson liked to treat the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser respectively as his two pet stooges, they were still the men on whose advice government policy was by and large made. But somewhere along the line, things soured. Whitty and Vallance became visibly uncomfortable when Boris chose to go rogue by interpreting the data to suit himself, and the relationship appeared to have completely broken down when the government ignored the advice of Sage to introduce a short “circuit breaker” lockdown and opted instead for a series of tiered regional lockdowns. Still, the band had reconciled its differences sufficiently to reform for a comeback tour for the briefing on Saturday at which the pair were invited to talk through some slides, before Johnson made the announcement – already leaked to the press the day before – that there was going to have to be another national lockdown after all. On Monday, it was Johnson’s turn to get it in the neck from MPs for the policy U-turn; on Tuesday it was that of Whitty and Vallance, who got to have their advice examined at a hastily assembled meeting of the science and technology select committee. It’s fair to say that both men would rather have been elsewhere. Any enjoyment at once again becoming public figures has quickly worn off, and Whitty and Vallance now yearn again for anonymity. The disconnect between MPs hungry for concrete data – and cheap political point-scoring – and experts who can only deal in probabilities has become too great. It was a clash of cultures in which there could be no winners. The session got off to a friendly enough start with the committee chair, Greg Clark, asking the questions. Nothing worse than having an academic paper that would probably be read by fewer than 10 people being peer-reviewed by one of your arch rivals. Vallance was adamant that he was only really confident in talking about six-week projections and pointed out that a lot of their predictions had proved to be totally accurate. Not so long ago Sage had been derided for suggesting deaths could rise to 200 a day by mid-November; that number had already long since been reached. Likewise, back in September, when there had been just 536 patients in hospital with Covid-19, people had laughed at the idea of that figure rising to 2,500 by mid-October. Now we were up to 10,000 and counting. So far, so good. Things got rather nastier when Labour’s Graham Stringer inquired why Vallance and Whitty had included a “reasonable worst case scenario” of 4,000 deaths a day in its slides at the Downing Street press conference when all other models were coming in significantly lower. Weren’t Sage guilty of trying to frighten Boris and the public into an unnecessary lockdown? “It wasn’t our intention to scare people,” Vallance insisted. One person’s reasonable worst case scenario was another’s walk in the park. That was the nature of the oxymoron. Besides, 4,000 wasn’t a prediction, it was a model, he said, without ever fully clarifying the difference between the two. And it was a model that had come from a reputable institution so it deserved to be included even if it was something of an outlier. At which point Whitty started to look visibly narked. So 4,000 might turn out to be well over the top, he snapped, but would MPs be happy to return to the daily death toll of 1,000 we had earlier in the year, because we were definitely on course to hit that target? And if MPs were happy with 1,000 deaths, then he wasn’t. Yes, the regional lockdowns had made a difference but the rate of infection was still going in the wrong direction and we didn’t want to reach a point where the NHS was unable to cope, because then there would also be a rise in excess deaths among cardiac and cancer patients. Things calmed down a bit after that but there was still a definite niggle in the room. Whitty observed that MPs kept asking for more and more data and Sage was doing its best to supply it. It wasn’t his fault if they didn’t like what they got. After all, it was inevitable that many of the predictions weren’t going to be entirely accurate. And instead of asking him for the economic costs of lockdown, why didn’t they try asking some economists instead? The whole essence of the coronavirus was there were no good choices. Scientists were having to choose between the crap and the really crap. Still, there was time for everyone to find some common ground. And that was on the uselessness of the government’s test-and-trace system. One of the goals of the lockdown was for the number of people infected to fall so far that Typhoid Dido might be able to locate at least a couple of their contacts. Serendipitously, Harding herself had simultaneously been given the graveyard slot of 5pm at the CBI conference. A time when it was almost guaranteed that everyone would have packed up for the day and she would struggle to trace herself. Clark desperately tried to end the session on something of an upbeat note. Would we be able to return to regional lockdowns in a month’s time, he asked desperately. Whitty and Vallance both shrugged. They hadn’t a clue. There were just too many variables in getting the R down below 1. But things were looking a bit more rosey, Clark said. There was the possibility of a vaccine, for a start. The winter might be hard, but the spring would be bright. “Brighter,” Whitty corrected him, keen to nip any signs of optimism in the bud. The afternoon hadn’t been his idea of fun, but at least he got to have the last word."
2020-11-03T19:22:13Z,politics,Politics,"UK can expect at least three Covid waves with lockdowns, Mordaunt says","The UK should be braced for at least a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic and further lockdowns, a minister has said as Tory sceptics warned they would not vote to extend England’s four-week shutdown. Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told MPs on Tuesday that there could yet be a rolling series of lockdowns – but argued this was not evidence that the measure was ineffective. It came as the former chief whip, Mark Harper, criticised a lack of engagement with Conservative backbenchers before a Commons vote on England’s lockdown on Wednesday, and said the government would be forced to rely on Labour votes to pass any extension beyond 2 December. Ministers expect a moderate number of Conservative MPs to rebel but Labour support means the measures are guaranteed to pass.
Speaking in parliament, Mordaunt said the government was “hopeful of being able to unlock in December but they are being driven by the data”. She said cases would inevitably rise after restrictions are lifted, and a high proportion of the population will remain vulnerable to the virus. “That is why some scientists expect a third or more waves of the virus to be managed [with] repeat lockdowns. Others argue that the need for future lockdowns is evidence they don’t work but that’s to misunderstand what they are there to do,” she said. “This approach buys us time and is the optimum use of the healthcare we have in the meantime while capacity is built and vaccines are sought.” Her remarks contrasted with those of Boris Johnson, who was bullish that England’s lockdown would end on 2 December, telling a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that this was a hard deadline to develop a new solution to contain the spread of the virus. The prime minister also appeared to affirm that the government expected the four-week lockdown to be enough to get the virus’s R number below 1 – raising questions as to whether the lockdown would be extended should that not occur. “Once again we are, alas, asking everybody to stay at home to protect the NHS, to save lives, and get the R down below 1. I know we can, I know we will. It’s only just above 1 at the moment,” he said. Harper said he had not received the reassurances he had repeatedly requested about the projections used by Johnson to justify the lockdown. He said he had not yet decided whether to support the government on Wednesday but predicted most colleagues would reluctantly back the plan, though the prime minister would struggle to secure support for any extension next month. “If the government do need to extend these measures, I think it’s very clear that they would end up depending on the votes of the Labour party – and prime ministers who end up depending on the opposition tend to end badly, in my experience.” James Grundy, the MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester – Andy Burnham’s old seat and a Labour stronghold for 114 years until December – said he planned to vote against the government unless financial support improved significantly or there was a clear timetable for a vaccine. “A rolling series of lockdowns might … hold Covid-19 at bay for a few weeks, or months, as the last one did. Then again, it might not. It certainly will cause absolute devastation to every other part of our society though,” he said. Conservative lockdown sceptics criticised the government’s strategy during a debate in Westminster Hall, to which Mordaunt was responding. The backbencher Richard Drax said the government had overreacted to the pandemic. “A draconian, onerous and invasive set of rules and regulations now govern our very existence,” he said. “I cannot recall a moment in our proud island history where our nation has been so cowed to the extent it is now.” The Tory MP Bob Seeley said anyone who believed restrictions would end on 2 December was “living in a parallel universe … You really wonder if the government is losing the plot over this.” Chris Green, the Conservative MP for Bolton, said the response had been “erratic”, and the regional tiered system had not been given enough time to have an effect."
2020-11-03T18:15:31Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Whitty says aim of lockdown is to reduce R enough to move on after 2 December â€“ as it happened,"Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has told MPs there is a â€œrealistic possibilityâ€� that the lockdown for England can be eased after 2 December. Asked if the restrictions would definitely be lifted then, as planned by the government, Whitty said: The decision as to whether to lift restrictions on December 2 is rightly a decision for ministers and parliament. I think that the aim of this is to get the rates down far enough that itâ€™s a realistic possibility to move into a different state of state of play at that point in time. But he also said he did not expect England to return to the exact tiering system in place now. He said: I think that the prime minister would probably want us to look at whether there should be variations on exactly the same tiering system as at the moment, rather than just assuming we would just revert to an absolutely identical one. I think thereâ€™s a lot to learn. And in fact, the next two or three weeks we will start to see the effects of the tiering in an even more granular way than weâ€™ve got to date and I think we should wait until we got that before we start to decide how best to use that in future. Boris Johnson has told the cabinet that Englandâ€™s lockdown restrictions will come to an end on 2 December, saying that was a hard deadline to develop a new solution to contain the spread of the virus. Students are defying government guidance that they should stay at university throughout lockdown to make a last-minute dash home before the new restrictions kick in across England on Thursday. Englandâ€™s most senior faith leaders have challenged the governmentâ€™s decision to ban communal worship during the second lockdown, telling Boris Johnson there is no scientific basis for the move. The number of people in the UK earning below the minimum wage has more than quadrupled to 2 million since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures, as the lowest-paid workers in Britain suffer the most financial damage. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid symptom study (CSS), has said his latest figures suggest coronavirus cases in England, Wales and Scotland are plateauing, with R, the reproduction number, now at about 1. The CSS monitors the spread of the virus through an app, with 4m downloads, which people use to report symptoms.
Ministers have prompted confusion over Englandâ€™s new lockdown rules with Michael Gove apologising for incorrectly indicating tennis and golf could be played, as cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick apparently wrongly suggested a family would be allowed to meet a friend for a walk outside. The terrorism threat in the UK has been upgraded to severe in the aftermath of the terror attack in Vienna overnight and a string of violent incidents in France, the government has announced."

2020-11-03T11:37:14Z,politics,Politics,"UK will struggle to deal with Brexit alongside Covid, says thinktank","Devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses risk being overwhelmed by Brexit implementation on 1 January, unable to deal with it alongside the urgent demands of the second wave of Covid-19, an influential thinktank has said. Local councils, trading standards officers and port health authorities are all part of the Brexit operation but may find themselves stretched because of the resurgence of the virus, the Institute for Government said. “The pandemic will make these plans harder. For example, critical staff may fall ill or need to isolate and resources may well be redirected to the pandemic response. “And although central government has managed to shift resources back to Brexit preparations after they were redeployed to help with the pandemic earlier this year, there is less capacity among the devolved governments and local authorities to handle both,” says report titled Brexit: How Ready is the UK? While the UK faces a challenging winter, cooperation with local administrations will be more critical than ever not least to understand how the double shock of Covid and Brexit is playing out in key areas including ports, airports and key industries that rely on cross-border supply chains or workforces. The report comes a day after the National Institute for Economic and Social Research warned that Brexit “on top of Covid-19 is likely to broaden the shock to growth and employment in the first quarter of 2021, weakening the UK’s recovery compared with other countries, and reducing productivity in the long run”. Authors of the IfG report commend the government on getting most of the required legislation including the new immigration and agriculture bills through by the end of the year. But questions remain. With less than 60 days to go, the government has yet to announce how the UK prosperity fund will work, how it will replace EU funding whether for science or economic development, says the report. It also predicts that the Northern Ireland protocol cannot be implement in full on time with the IT systems and infrastructure for new border control posts not ready for 1 January. This will present the government with a challenge to apply the “the letter” of the withdrawal agreement and risk lorry queues in ports such as Liverpool or facilitate the flow of goods without the new regulatory and customs checks in place and risk ending up in the European court of justice. While trust between the EU and the UK has been badly damaged over Boris Johnson’s threat to “disapply” some of the withdrawal agreement, the IfG believes if the offending clauses in the internal market bill are dropped, the EU should “be ready to show some flexibility” on the Northern Ireland protocol. On border readiness elsewhere in the country, the IfG says “more work is needed” to help business prepare for the new controls which many do not realise apply whether there is a trade deal or not. “The economic damage wrought by coronavirus has robbed many of the bandwidth, and cash, to do what is needed,” it says adding that as recently as late October one third of small businesses were still labouring under the illusion that the transition period would be extended beyond 31 December. It also criticised the government’s communications campaign as concentrating on the opportunities of Brexit rather than making a call to action for businesses. And it warns that while Whitehall may have the resources and separate work streams on Brexit, Westminster should not be complacent. “Even if the UK civil service has the necessary resources to do so, the devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses may well be overwhelmed,” it says."
2020-11-02T20:19:11Z,politics,Politics,Subdued Johnson just a piece of flotsam being buffeted around | John Crace,"Looking on the bright side for the prime minister, he didn’t have any more credibility to lose. As a rule of thumb, you can pretty much guarantee that for everything that Boris Johnson says, the opposite will turn out to be true. As with Brexit, so it is for the coronavirus. In March, he insisted the virus would be defeated in 12 weeks. That went well. In July, Boris promised the country would be back to normal by Christmas. No one’s putting any money on that now. In his statement to the Commons on the latest national lockdown, Johnson insisted the virus would be beaten by March. He didn’t say what year. It’s hard to know which is the more bewildering: the fact that we have a prime minister who is both incompetent and unable to distinguish between fact and fiction; or that there are so many Conservative MPs who are consistently taken aback by the failings of their leader. You would have thought by now it would have been 203 times bitten, 204 times shy. But no. They continue to cut him some slack, albeit increasingly grumpily; as if they are as surprised as anyone that Johnson has failed to deliver on his promises and each time insist he is now on a final warning. Something has to change, they warn. But it never does. Johnson was in the Commons to give the statement he had already been forced to give at Saturday’s Downing Street press conference after details of the national lockdown agreed between him, Rishi Sunak, Michael Gove and Matt Hancock had been mysteriously leaked to the papers the night before. Not that it was a national lockdown, mind, because Boris had promised there would not be another national lockdown. Rather it was a lockdown that would be imposed nationally, albeit with schools and universities remaining more or less open.
This was a subdued Boris. Even by his own standards, this latest U-turn was a humiliation. An admission that he has not just lost control of the coronavirus, he’s lost control of the government. He’s just a piece of flotsam being buffeted around. Not that it stopped him lying, of course. Just that the lies have become progressively more feeble, as if even he has stopped the pretence of believing them. He began by stating that the government had had to change course because the scientific data had changed on Saturday. The chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer had actually given their latest briefing to the cabinet well before that, which was why the lockdown had been agreed on Friday. Sage had called for a “circuit breaker” back in September and had been clear a tiered series of regional lockdowns were going to be insufficient to contain the spread of the virus. But Boris didn’t want to upset his more libertarian MPs, so he decided to kill a few more people instead. Besides it would have been shameless opportunism to introduce a lockdown any sooner. For weeks now, Johnson has been dismissively referring to Keir Starmer as Captain Hindsight. Now he was tacitly forced to admit the Labour leader was Captain Foresight and that he was General Hopelessness. Because the measures that Boris was introducing were ones which Starmer had been demanding for the best part of a month. Something which Keir was not slow to point out. The new lockdown was both harder and longer than the one Labour had proposed and less likely to succeed. With Labour having promised Johnson the necessary votes on Wednesday, most of the rest of the session was a free for all with the prime minister as the fall guy. A lot of the flak came as friendly fire. Tory Brexiters hadn’t fought to close borders only to curtail every Englishman’s right to go into any pub they wanted to get Covid-19. Just as long as the virus wasn’t caught from Johnny Foreigner then all was tickety-boo. You could die happy knowing the virus had spread from a Brit. Why bother flying to Zurich, when you can turn the whole of the UK into a Dignitas hub? Who knows, it could turn out to be a huge money-spinner? The longer the session went on, the more confused Johnson’s answers became. He was adamant the country would return to regional lockdowns on 2 December, even though he could give no guarantees the rate of infection would have come down sufficiently over the course of the next month. He guessed it would be down to parliament what happened next, he said unhappily. So that was a yes and a no. “The country wants politicians to act together,” he shrugged sadly, apparently unaware of his own failure to act on scientific evidence and work with Labour a month ago – and of the fact that the MPs least inclined to work together were his own. Some wanted golf courses reopened, others were happy to compromise on pitch and putt. The DUP’s Sammy Wilson said that he had come to hear Churchill but had only got Halifax-style appeasement instead. What became more and more evident the longer the session went on was that Boris was out of ideas. Other than to do too little too late. He wasn’t even sure what he had and hadn’t promised Scotland by way of bailout. Starmer slumped back in his seat. He knew what we all knew: that we would be back in the Commons on 2 December with little change in the nation’s health, to have the same arguments over lockdowns and the failure of test and trace all over again. You can cancel Christmas now."
2020-11-02T18:30:46Z,politics,Politics,Starmer accuses Johnson of 'catastrophic failure of leadership' over England lockdown â€“ as it happened,"Boris Johnson has sought to persuade Conservative backbenchers to support his plan for a new coronavirus lockdown across England, saying that failing to act now would risk the â€œmedical and moral disasterâ€� of an overwhelmed NHS. In a statement to the Commons lasting almost two and a half hours, and involving questions from 100 MPs, he repeatedly stressed that the lockdown legislation would only apply until 2 December and that MPs would have to vote on what happened next. But he could not give a categorical assurance that an extension of the lockdown would not be required, as some ministers have privately been saying. (See 9.16am.) He also claimed that mass testing would be the route to a more normal future. In his opening statement he said: We now have not only much better medication and the prospect of a vaccine the immediate prospect of many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests â€“ with a result in minutes. Trials have already shown that we can help suppress the disease in hospitals, schools and universities by testing large numbers of NHS workers, children, teachers and students. These tests, crucially, identify people who are infectious but do not have symptoms, allowing them immediately to self-isolate and stop the spread of the disease,and allowing those who are not infectious to continue as normal. This means that, unlike in the spring, itâ€™s possible to keep these institutions open and still stop the spread of the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests which we will be manufacturing in this country applying them in an ever-growing number of situations, from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when theyâ€™re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even cities. Many Tory MPs are very unhappy about the decision to order a second lockdown but, although some of them were openly critical during the statement, overall there was less anger than might have been expected and even those Conservatives sceptical of the strategy were generally respectful. Johnsonâ€™s reception was much warmer than the one Theresa May used to get from Brexiters in the year before her resignation. This might be because reports of Tory dissent have been exaggerated, but more probably itâ€™s because the lockdown-sceptics are having little success in persuading colleagues they have a viable alternative strategy.
Sir Keir Starmer has said Johnsonâ€™s lockdown U-turn represents â€œa catastrophic failure of leadership and of judgementâ€�. (See 3.50pm.) He also said that Johnsonâ€™s decision to delay the lockdown had cost lives (see 11.58am) - a judgment shared by at least one scientist on the governmentâ€™s Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies. (See 9.54am.) Johnson has hinted that the Treasury will fund a furlough scheme for Scotland after November if it needs one because it is in lockdown when England isnâ€™t. (See 5.34pm.) He made the apparent concession in the Commons, telling the Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross: The furlough is a UK-wide scheme. If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course itâ€™s available to them, that has to be right and that applies not just now but of course in the future as well. Earlier, in a TV interview, Ross said Johnson was not as good a communicator as the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon. (See 5.13pm.) Johnson proved him right when when it became clear that no one really knew quite what the PMâ€™s answer to Ross in the Commons actually meant. (See 5.44pm and 5.53pm.) A code error in the NHS Covid-19 app meant users had to be next to a highly infectious patient for five times as long as the NHS had decided was risky before being instructed to self-isolate, the Guardian has learned. Police may have to take action to stop residents of England â€œescapingâ€� to Wales for an evening in a pub or restaurant when the month-long English lockdown comes into force from Thursday, the Welsh government has said. High-street retailers, pub chains and airlines are among the companies to warn of the impact the surprise imposition of a second lockdown in England will have on their businesses. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-11-02T17:32:14Z,politics,Politics,Help for self-employed in England to be doubled in November,"Boris Johnson has announced the government will double the level of financial support for self-employed workers in November during the second coronavirus lockdown in England. Faced with mounting pressure to help millions of workers before new measures are imposed on Thursday, the prime minister said the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) would be increased from 40% of average profits to 80% in November. People who work for themselves will be able to apply from the end of the month – rather than the middle of December as initially planned – to help provide support faster during the second lockdown in England. It comes after the government announced a U-turn to extend the furlough scheme for employees at the weekend hours before it was due to close. Furlough will now subsidise 80% of workers’ wages in November, rather than a reduced level of two-thirds under the new job support scheme replacement programme, which will now be launched a month later in December instead.
Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, confirmed that the increase in help for the self-employed would be to an average of 55% of trading profits over the wider period from November to January, while the maximum grant available would increase to £5,160. Detailing the changes on Twitter, the chancellor said the fourth update to his economic support package in almost as many weeks would offer £4.5bn of help to self-employed workers between November and January. The Treasury said £13.7bn of support for self-employed people had been provided since the onset of the pandemic in March, on top of more than £40bn for employees through the furlough scheme. Sunak said: “The rapidly changing health picture has meant we have had to act in order to protect people’s lives and I know this is an incredibly worrying time for the self-employed. “That is why we have increased the generosity of the third grant, ensuring those who cannot trade or are facing decreased demand are able to get through the months ahead.” The chancellor said the deadline for businesses to apply for a Treasury-backed loan had also been further extended, until 31 January. The government-backed loan schemes have so far supported more than 1m businesses to access more than £60bn of finance. Business groups welcomed the additional measures but warned that millions of people were slipping through the cracks and urgently required support, including the newly self-employed, sole company directors and people who had lost their jobs. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Despite this extension, there are still many businesses and individuals who have, through no fault of their own,, not yet been able to access any government support since the start of the pandemic. “They too will require help to sustain their businesses and avoid further increases in unemployment.”"
2020-11-02T17:30:32Z,politics,Politics,Labour to avoid revolt by voting against overseas operations bill,"Labour is gearing up to vote against the overseas operations bill in the Commons on Tuesday, to halt a damaging run of rebellions at a time when the party is in turmoil following the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn. Writing in the Guardian, John Healey, the party’s shadow defence secretary, described the bill as “dishonest and damaging” and said it was “not in the best interests of British troops, British justice or British military standing in the world”. Labour sources indicated that the party would abandon its previous policy of abstaining should the amendments it was supporting fail, and oppose the bill at its third and final Commons reading. Critics argue the bill effectively legalises torture and war crimes by soldiers serving abroad because it introduces an effective five-year time limit to criminal prosecutions to almost all crimes for soldiers serving overseas. Healey wrote that he believed the government’s approach “risks the international criminal court acting to put British forces personnel on trial in the Hague if the UK justice system won’t”. Last month, three of Labour junior shadow ministers were sacked after joining Corbyn and 14 other MPs from the party in the division lobby by voting against, when the leadership had called for an abstention. It was the first of three human rights-related rebellions against the party leadership, including two others on the covert human intelligence sources bill, the last of which attracted 34 rebels, the largest rebellion since Keir Starmer took over as leader. Andrew Scattergood, the co-chair of the party pressure group Momentum, which had been campaigning on the bill, said Labour’s leadership had “done the right thing” but added: “They have only done so because of concerted pressure from Labour members and left MPs. This is a vindication of their principled opposition.” Those on the left believe that Labour’s tactic of repeated abstention had been designed to “provoke leftwing resignations” – including the subsequent departures of Dan Carden and Margaret Greenwood at the most recent rebellion. The party faces a greater crisis following the suspension of Corbyn, who had said the scale of Labour’s antisemitism problem “was also dramatically overstated for political reasons” in the aftermath of a scathing EHRC investigation. Focus is expected to switch to amendments put down by the Conservative MP David Davis and Labour’s Dan Jarvis, which aims to ensure that torture and related offences would not be covered by the five-year limit. The amendments have been supported by five Conservative MP, including former cabinet ministers Davis and Andrew Mitchell, as well as Crispin Blunt, Ian Liddell-Grainger and Pauline Latham. “I am very concerned about the reciprocal danger to our soldiers if the government does not take a strong line,” Mitchell said. The government – bringing the concluding stage of the bill in the run-up to Armistice Day this Sunday – says the bill is necessary to prevent soldiers from being affected by vexatious claims. A defence source added: “Whilst it is admirable that Labour have this time chosen to fall down on one side or another of the vote – instead of sitting on the fence – they’ve unfortunately chosen the side that confirms their long-held disdain for armed forces personnel.”"
2020-11-02T07:10:59Z,politics,Politics,Covid: Boris Johnson faces Tory fury amid hints of further England lockdown,"Boris Johnson will insist there is “no alternative” to a nationwide lockdown as he addresses the House of Commons on Monday amid mounting fury among Tory MPs, after ministers conceded the new “stay at home” order could be extended beyond 2 December. The prime minister will tell parliament that without the draconian new measures, which will come into force across England on Thursday, deaths from coronavirus over the winter could be “twice as bad or even worse” than in the first wave. He will promise the government will “seek to ease” restrictions when the measures are due to expire. However, cabinet minister Michael Gove made clear on Sunday they could be left in place if they have not yet brought the infection rate down sufficiently. Gove said: “We’ve got this four-week period, during which we’re going to review progress, but of course we’ll always be driven by the data. We will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.” Pressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said “yes”. Sage member Jeremy Farrar, the chair of the Wellcome Trust, echoed Gove’s caution, saying it was important not to be too “fixed” about the 2 December end date. If the infection rate, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen far enough by then, he said, the measures should be extended. “Much better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year,” he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show. The latest official data showed that on Sunday, 23,254 people were tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. A further 162 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Johnson will set out his plan to parliament after a chaotic weekend that saw his dramatic announcement brought forward after it was leaked on Friday evening, causing shock among his own backbenchers. Amid forecasts that the economy could take a hit of up to 10% as a result of the new curbs, the Bank of England is poised to announce a fresh cash injection into the economy later this week. The City had been expecting a resumption of Threadneedle Street’s quantitative easing programme even before the new lockdown was announced, but now sees a fresh support package as inevitable. The Treasury plans to announce more generous support for the self-employed following the continuation of the furlough scheme for employees, but no further measures from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are currently planned. Gerard Lyons, who was chief economic adviser to Johnson when he was mayor of London, said the lockdown was “terrible news” for the economy, which he said could shrink by up to 10%. “This lockdown will ensure that a large section of the economy will be in a moribund state and will require huge new stimulus and help,” Lyons said. Sunak had previously resisted a nationwide shutdown amid fears about its economic cost, but signed up to the plan in the face of the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed within weeks without action. “If you have an NHS that’s not going to function, people are not going to be running off shopping, they’re going to stay at home. The economy gets crumpled anyway – and people lose faith in government,” said a Whitehall source. Sunak’s abrupt decision to extend the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of workers’ wages in affected businesses, was met with fury among northern mayors, who repeatedly urged him to take the same approach when cities including Manchester and Liverpool were facing tough tier 3 restrictions last month. “This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,” Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. “Quite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government’s “differential treatment” of people on low wages and “people in the north versus people in the south”. Conservative MPs also lined up to criticise the government’s approach on Sunday. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour that he will vote against the government’s lockdown measures in the vote on Wednesday. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said he feared the lockdown would last until the spring, as the virus resurges. “In March, Boris said let’s hope this will only last four weeks, and it lasted four months. My firm belief this time is it will last six months. Because when it gets to 2 December and R is still 1.5, which it will be, because this lockdown will hold less well than the last one, then it will have to continue.” He said only countries that have aggressively pursued a “test, trace and isolate” approach, including drastic measures such as closing borders and separating those testing positive from their families in isolation wards, had managed to control it successfully. Another former cabinet minister said they believed ministers had been left with little choice but to act, but the “shambles” of the weekend “could cost us dearly in the polls”. Former minister George Freeman said he would support the government – but only on the basis of a clear strategy that would see more power handed to local leaders to balance health and economic risks in their areas in the future. MPs will be given a vote on the measures on Wednesday, before they come into force – but they are likely to pass with Labour support, even if a significant number of Conservatives rebel. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, will urge the government to use the four-week lockdown period to fix the shortcomings in the test-and-trace system. He will call for much more extensive “retrospective” contact tracing to identify the source of outbreaks, and urge the government to use new rapid saliva-based testing kits to carry out weekly screening of high-risk workers. These should include NHS staff, as well as other at-risk workers such as those in education, transport, retail and hospitality, Ashworth will suggest. “Coronavirus is growing with ferocity and urgent action is needed to bring the R below 1 nationwide which is why Labour urged Boris Johnson to use the opportunity of the half-term holiday for a time-limited ‘circuit break’,” he said. “This didn’t happen, and test and trace have been overwhelmed. Controlling Covid-19 depends on fixing tracing, ensuring the quick turnaround of tests and introducing regular, weekly testing to identify the 70% of carriers who may not have symptoms but can still spread the virus.” Speaking to MPs, Johnson will stand by his decision not to lock England down earlier as scientific advisers recommended in September – a choice Labour claims will have cost lives. “I know some in the house believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership,” the prime minister is expected to say."
2020-11-02T07:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Chips are down: Brexit uncertainty causing Scottish potato crisis,"Scottish potato farmers have said that uncertainty surrounding their ability to sell to Northern Ireland post-Brexit is causing millions of pounds in losses, prompting Scotland’s environment minister to accuse the government of treating the industry as “expendable” in trade talks. While fisheries in Scotland have been treated as a priority in Brexit talks, Scottish seed potato farmers – one of the biggest exporters for the production of chips and crisps in the world – have been told they will be unlikely to be able to export to Northern Ireland from 1 January as things stand. Seed potatoes are potatoes from which others are grown but with strict EU-wide health checks for blight, pest and other diseases before being sold commercially. The Scottish industry accounts for 75% of UK production and is worth more than £200m a year, six times the value of the recently signed fisheries deal with Norway but dwarfed by the £1.4bn overall UK fishing trade. Mairi Gougeon has written to Lord Gardiner of Kimble, the parliamentary under secretary of state for rural affairs, to say Scottish potato farmers, many of them running family businesses, have been put under “incredible strain”. At the centre of the issue is Northern Ireland’s special place after Brexit, following EU customs rules on food and animals coming in from Britain whether there is a trade deal or not. But Gougeon complained that while the UK was offering the EU a six-month transition period to allow European seeds and plants to be sold in Britain, “the reciprocal arrangement is not available to us”. This leaves EU markets and Northern Ireland closed to Scotland’s producers. “I must request again that you urgently contact the EU to press for an early resolution of the UK equivalence applications,” she wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian, adding that the industry faced an initial £15m financial loss “as a result of not having access to the EU or NI”. Officials at Defra have said they are waiting for the EU to recognise equivalence but farmers say they can’t run a business on such uncertainty with just 59 days to go before the end of the UK’s transition period. Iain Barbour, who runs the decades-old JBA Seed Potatoes in Dumfries with his father, said the situation was making people’s lives “miserable”. “If there was a huge disaster and the Northern Ireland potato crop failed, we would not be allowed to send in seed potatoes to help them. Even Asda and Tescos, they wouldn’t be allowed to have eating potatoes from us,” he said. Scottish seed potatoes are considered a global gold standard because they are less prone to diseases because of the climate, which puts them at a higher standard than EU regulations, he said. With the first seed potatoes planted around 17 March for early harvests at the end of May, “customers in Northern Ireland are rushing to stock up,” said Barbour in case the Scottish spud is banned from 1 January. Boris Johnson claimed the EU were threatening to “blockade” food supplies to Northern Ireland last month, taking the issue to an explosive political level. Seed suppliers are now fearing they will be collateral damage. “I’m actually really annoyed about it. We’ve seen a 6,000% increase in demand from some of our customers who are stockpiling,” said Paulo Arrigo, who runs Italian vegetable seed supplier Franchi in Harrow. “Do you know what Defra’s advice was? Tell everyone in Northern Ireland to get their stocks in before Christmas,” said Arrigo. A Defra spokesman said it understood the importance of seed and other propagating material exports for UK horticultural businesses, and remained committed to securing market access beyond the end of the transition period. “We have already formally submitted the equivalence application, on behalf of the UK, to the European commission – and await their response,” he said."
2020-11-02T06:00:41Z,politics,Politics,Labour urges UK trade secretary to end delays over Kenya and Ghana deals,"The Labour party has urged the UK trade secretary, Liz Truss, to end delays over rollover deals with Kenya and Ghana to prevent them being slapped with high tariffs when the UK leaves the EU on 1 January. Negotiations with Kenya and Ghana have yet to be signed off with only nine weeks to go before the UK’s transition deal with the EU comes to an end, when import charges would be imposed on goods worth £2.6bn from the African countries. Labour officials fear Truss is trying to drive a hard bargain with individual nations that depend on foreign income from sales of bananas, cocoa and flowers to the UK to make up for deals that largely favour foreign imports. With EU trade talks hanging in the balance and discussions with the US barely started, the trade department signed a deal with Japan last month that the shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, warned massively favoured the world’s third-largest economy. Shadow trade minister Gareth Thomas said in a letter to Truss that he was concerned that the department’s attention had switched from talks with the East African Community (EAC) trade bloc to bilateral deals with individual countries. He said that the failure to sign deals with Kenya and Ghana had left them unable to plan for next year and, worse, the current proposals left them facing duties on exports to the UK. “The terms of the continuity agreements you have been proposing would lead to new barriers to trade between both Ghana and her neighbours in the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] and similarly would adversely affect trade between Kenya and other developing countries in the EAC.
“The UK has a record of supporting regional trade integration through DfID-backed programmes such TradeMark East Africa and I would be keen to understand how, in your view, putting at risk vital trade flows between some of the poorest countries in the world is compatible with such programmes?” A government spokesman said: “Ghana and Kenya’s economic potential is huge and we continue to work closely with these African nations to ensure trade continuity for businesses following the transition period. “Our ongoing discussions demonstrate our commitment to increasing trade with developing countries, which can ultimately help to remove barriers, reduce poverty, create more jobs and boost economic growth.”"
2020-11-02T00:01:33Z,politics,Politics,Reform UK: Brexit party to rebrand as anti-lockdown voice,"The Brexit party has applied to the Electoral Commission to change its name to Reform UK in a bid to rebrand the party, which has no elected representatives, as a voice in the anti-lockdown movement. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, and chairman, Richard Tice, first announced the plan in a joint article in the Telegraph where they wrote it was “time to redirect our energies”. The name change is subject to approval of the commission. The Brexit party gained 2% of the vote in the 2019 general election, and none of the 275 candidates it stood won a seat. Prior to the December election, Farage had announced the party would change its name following the UK’s exit from the European Union and focus on campaigning for changes in the electoral system. In a statement on Sunday announcing the plans to rebrand the party, Farage said: “As promised, we continue to keep a very close eye on the government’s trade negotiations with the EU, to ensure a proper Brexit. Further reform in many other areas is also vital for our nations’ future.” Tice added: “The need for major reform in the UK is clearer now than ever. A new approach is essential, so that government works for the people, not for itself.” He said that a new strategy was needed for tackling the coronavirus so that “we learn to live with it, not hide in fear of it”. The idea of ending the Covid pandemic through herd immunity was recently denounced as “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence”, by 80 researchers who wrote a warning letter in a leading medical journal. The Brexit party announcement comes as England prepares to enter a four-week nationwide lockdown on 5 November, a decision which has angered some Tory MPs, with prominent backbenchers including Sir Graham Brady warning they are likely to vote against the new restrictions. MPs will vote on the second lockdown on Wednesday as experts warn that the daily death toll could reach as high as 4,000 by Christmas if swift action is not taken. Announcing the decision on Saturday evening, Boris Johnson said that if nothing is done the country faced a “peak of mortality” worse than that of the first wave in April."
2020-11-01T18:31:35Z,politics,Politics,Starmer: most Labour members would not support Corbyn's EHRC response,"The “vast majority” of Labour members would not have approved of Jeremy Corbyn’s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s report on antisemitism in the party, Sir Keir Starmer said on Sunday. The new leader also said his predecessor should “reflect” on what he said following the publication of the findings of the EHRC inquiry which found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Corbyn was suspended from the party on Thursday after he used his initial response to the EHRC conclusions to suggest that the extent of antisemitism in the party while he was leader had been exaggerated. In an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Starmer refused to be drawn on whether he wanted to see Corbyn readmitted to the party, saying that to answer that would pre-judge the disciplinary process currently underway. But Starmer did say that Corbyn should “reflect” on how he responded to the report when it was published. “I think the vast majority of people in the Labour party and the wider Labour movement think that that was the wrong response and the right response was to honestly accept the findings, apologise, move forward,” Starmer said. Starmer said that in his own response to the EHRC report he had been clear that “those that deny or minimise antisemitism in the Labour party, and say it’s just exaggerated or part of a factional fight, are part of the problem”. Starmer went on: “I was therefore very disappointed in Jeremy’s response where he appeared to suggest it was exaggerated etc.
“I’d invite Jeremy just to reflect on what he said … because I think for most people what they wanted from the Labour party on Thursday was an honest recognition of the problem and of an apology, a line in the sand and a constructive way to move forward, which is what I want for the Labour party.” In his initial response to the report, Corbyn said: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” After the announcement of his suspension, which he has said he will “strongly contest”, Corbyn issued a partial clarification, saying that it was wrong to say that Labour did not have a problem with antisemitism, but that he was just making a point about flawed public assumptions about the numbers involved. “It’s … undeniable that a false impression has been created of the number of members accused of antisemitism, as polling shows: that is what has been overstated, not the seriousness of the problem,” Corbyn said. Corbyn was referring to a poll finding in a book about Labour and antisemitism suggesting that people aware of the Labour antisemitism controversy guessed on average that 34% of party members had been the subject of a complaint. Corbyn says the actual figure is 0.3%. Starmer said he had not spoken to Corbyn since the decision was taken to suspend him from the party. He also rejected claims that the decision to suspend Corbyn, which also entails the removal of the party whip in the Commons, would plunge the party into “civil war”. “There is no need for a civil war in the Labour party. I stood on a platform to unite the party and I’m determined to do that, but I also made a solemn pledge that we would root out antisemitism and I’m not going to shirk from difficult decisions in rooting out antisemitism,” Starmer said."
2020-11-01T17:50:53Z,politics,Politics,"UK will not import chlorinated chicken from US, ministers say","The government has finally vowed not to allow chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef on British supermarket shelves, defying demands from the US that animal welfare standards be lowered as part of a future trade deal. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the environment minister, George Eustice, have also revealed the government will put the recently established trade and agriculture commission on a statutory footing with a new amendment to the agriculture bill. “We are announcing today that it will be made a statutory body which will give independent advice on trade deals as they go through parliament,” they said in an article in the Mail on Sunday. The move is a significant U-turn for the government, which had rejected Lord Curry’s amendment to the bill to strengthen the commission’s role and legally ban any food that does not meet British import standards post-Brexit.
The commission, on which the National Farmers’ Union and the Food and Drink Federation sit, will now be asked to produce an independent report on the impact on animal welfare and agriculture of each free trade deal the government signs after Brexit. Their recommendations on whether to accept or reject the deal will then be laid in parliament at the start of the 21-day scrutiny period under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act process. Truss and Eustice also gave the clearest commitment yet to ban US meat from animals not raised to British standards. “Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are already banned in the UK, and we will not negotiate to remove that ban in a trade deal,” they said. Donald Trump’s ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, dismissed fears over chlorine washes earlier this year, saying they were the “most effective and economical way to fight food-borne illness”.
He also said last year that the row was presenting the British public with “a false choice”, and that “inflammatory and misleading terms like ‘chlorinated chicken’ and ‘hormone beef’ are deployed to cast American farming in the worst possible light”. The National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, declared the move to put food standards into primary legislation a “landmark moment for the people of the UK, for our countryside and the future of the food on our plates”.
The U-turn over the agriculture bill comes days after Boris Johnson met Batters for a private meeting over food standards. She said the prime minister had responded to the NFU petition, which had been signed by more than a million people, and the campaign by animal welfare experts, environmental charities, politicians and celebrities including Jamie Oliver and Joe Wicks. “It was clear to me how much he personally cares about this issue. I am delighted that he has led the government to draw a line in the sand and commit to the 2019 Conservative manifesto commitment not to undermine our farmers in future trade deals,” she said. The consumer group Which? welcomed the move to make the trade and agriculture commission a statutory body, but said consumers should be directly represented. The government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, has recently said the health sector should also be represented after there was evidence of an increase in consumption of sugary foods in Mexico after a trade deal with the US enabled an advertising blitz by the US confectionary industry."
2020-11-01T17:02:51Z,politics,Politics,Chlorinated chicken vow won't put UK food standards fears to rest,"Chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef are off the menu for post-Brexit trade deals, though a government pledge not to allow such products into British supermarkets, restaurants or canteens falls short of demands for a legal ban. A more significant announcement by the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the secretary for environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice, was the revelation that the government will table an amendment to the agriculture bill this week to put the newly established trade and agriculture commission (TAC) on a statutory footing. The move does not close the door on chlorinated chicken, which is emblematic of Brexit food fears, but it does add a layer of scrutiny to any trade deals, much-demanded by high-profile campaigners. It is also a significant U-turn by the government, which had recently rejected Lord Curry’s amendment to strengthen the role of the TAC despite a huge campaign by farmers, environmental NGOs and the food industry, all concerned about a future US assault on the British food sector. Sources say the change of heart came after a recent meeting between Boris Johnson and the formidable National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, who recently said chlorinated chicken would become the norm if ministers were not given more power over trade deals. She hailed the move to strengthen the TAC as a “landmark moment”, but concerns remain over future food standards after Brexit because of the lack of transparency at government level. “These are all little baby steps at this stage. We have this language and pledges about chlorinated chicken, but we do not know what that actually means in trade policy terms,” said David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project. The central problem is the lack of a formal and detailed trade policy on what is typically the most contested area in free trade negotiations. Food and agriculture represent less than 10% of the British economy and exports will not feature high on the wishlist of trade negotiators, but access to the British food market will be the key driver for nations such as the US and Argentina, where grain and meat are central to their economies. “We can make the case against chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef by going around the world saying ‘this is how we should do this’, but this is not how negotiations work,” said Henig. “What we need is more than that. We need an actual trade policy. We still don’t have that. If it is going to be important to put animal welfare standards in our trade policy, then there has to be a debate about that in parliament, and we still haven’t had that. It’s not just that we don’t have legislation, we’re not at even at first base, which is having a trade policy.” There is also concern that the so-called Crag process, covered by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, is a woefully inadequate for international trade deals. Critics say three weeks is scarcely enough time to examine trade deals, which can run to thousands of pages laden with technical detail. The government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, has called for a parliamentary scrutiny process more robust than Crag, arguing trade deals should be treated like legislation, with full parliament debates and select committee reviews. Batters made the point at the Tory party conference that ministers could make as many pledges as they liked, but could then turn to “secondary legislation on any day of the week effectively to change it”. Those with knowledge of the government’s change of heart, however, say putting the TAC on a statutory footing is “definitely a meaningful step”. They say that even before the Crag process begins, the TAC will get confidential privileged access to the trade deals before they are laid before parliament. This means if a trade deal does open the door to chlorinated chicken, for example, the independent body can raise a red flag and warn MPs before the start of the 21-day scrutiny process."

2020-11-01T09:00:15Z,politics,Politics,Union leader says Keir Starmer 'pushing Labour into civil war' over Corbyn suspension,"Keir Starmer was struggling last night to contain an escalating row over Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension from the party following last week’s bombshell report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism in the party. A union leader has accused Starmer of using the issue to pursue a “civil war” within the party, and joined with six other union bosses in issuing a joint statement describing the suspension of Corbyn as “unjust”. The unions’ intervention came as antisemitism campaigners seized on Corbyn’s suspension to warn that the party remains “unsafe” for Jewish members until it thoroughly investigates 15 other MPs about whom they have lodged detailed complaints, including deputy leader Angela Rayner. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, said that he believed the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, which found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination in relation to antisemitism, was “well-balanced”. However, Ward said the decision to suspend Corbyn “reeks of political opportunism”, adding that Starmer had set a bar for suspension that was incompatible with “a fair process”. Labour suspended Corbyn after he claimed that “the scale of the problem” of antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”. But Ward said Starmer had “decided to plunge the Labour party into a civil war of his own making”. “Nothing that Jeremy said warranted his suspension,” Ward said. “It was a well-balanced and factual response to an equally well-balanced report. There isn’t space for one antisemite in the Labour party. But if Labour is actually interested in fighting racism, it needs to do so honestly and not through a damaging factional lens.” Ward added: “Minority groups cannot be used as a battering ram for Labour’s factional war.”
Yesterday, seven trade unions affiliated to Labour, including Unite, Labour’s largest donor, and the TSSA, which backed Starmer in the party leadership election, released a joint statement, reported on the website LabourList, expressing “serious concerns” about Corbyn’s “ill-advised and unjust suspension” and urging the party leadership to “repair this damage”. “As the general secretaries of trade unions affiliated to the Labour party, we seek to put on record our serious concerns about the manner of and rationale for suspension of the former party leader Jeremy Corbyn,” the statement reads. Having suspended Corbyn, Starmer is coming under acute pressure to take more robust action against 15 other Labour MPs about whom the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), which brought the original complaint that triggered the EHRC investigation, has concerns. The CAA submitted a lengthy dossier to the party about the MPs before Corbyn’s suspension. Now it is calling for swift action against them. “Sir Keir has promised to tear out antisemitism ‘by its roots’,” said Gideon Falter, chief executive of the CAA. “Mr Corbyn was just one of those roots. The 15 other sitting MPs who have indulged in or promoted antisemitic discourse are others. Labour is not safe for Jews until these cases are dealt with under a disciplinary process that is independent, fair, transparent and expeditious. We made the original referral of Labour to the EHRC because the party ignored such cases for so long. We have given Sir Keir until the end of his first year in office to finally address our complaints if he wants Jews to be able to return to Labour.” Labour now faces the highly sensitive task of dealing with Corbyn’s case while investigating the other complaints, in what will be the first major test for David Evans, Labour’s new general secretary.
Fiona Sharpe, spokeswoman for Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS), said it was clear that Labour’s processes had not been “fit for purpose” and called for a wider, independent review into hundreds of antisemitism complaints. “Over this period, LAAS reported hundreds of apparent party members, providing evidence of Holocaust denial, the use of racially pejorative language, threats of violence and a variety of antisemitic tropes,” she said. “Due to Labour’s appalling mismanagement, many of these members are still active in the party: at local meetings, on councils and even in parliament.” The shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said that the Labour party would recover from the damning report. “I am sure we will move on as one united party at what is a very very critical time for our country and for people’s lives and livelihoods,” she told BBC Breakfast."
2020-11-01T05:45:11Z,politics,Politics,UK industry chief says business needs more from 'thin' Brexit deal,"A business-led campaign to widen a “thin” Brexit deal struck between Britain and the European Union will begin immediately in the new year, it has emerged, amid concerns about the long-term effects on the UK’s economy. In an interview with the Observer, Carolyn Fairbairn, the outgoing director general of the CBI, said that securing a basic deal with the EU should be seen as a “starting point” for a deeper relationship. She warned of a serious effect on Britain’s large services sector, including financial and legal services, as well as engineering. UK government officials remain locked in talks with their Brussels counterparts this weekend, just a fortnight before the deadline identified as the last point at which a deal can be agreed. The main stumbling blocks remain fishing rights and “level playing field” conditions related to state aid. However, even if a deal is signed off, there are grave concerns among British business bodies over the barriers to trade that it will erect. Fairbairn said that any deal would be a “significant improvement” on a no-deal outcome, while the removal of tariffs would be “existential” for the car industry. However, she said her “really big disappointment” was the lack of help for British services in the potential deal, adding that the CBI would immediately fight to broaden the agreement. “Any deal we get now is likely to be focused on goods, and it should be treated as a starting point for a more comprehensive deal in the future,” she said. “At the CBI, we would be doing two things. First of all, we would be looking to help businesses make the most of where we are, to look for the opportunities and to manage that transition. And second, we will be working with the government and supporting the negotiations around building further chapters. [We would like] a services chapter. We’ll need more on aviation. We’ll need more on haulage. Data will be crucial. We hope that there will be a data agreement, but there will be more to do on the back of that. That will be the challenge of the next one to two years. And we will be on that case pretty well immediately. But we need that base case of a foundation deal first.” Some groups have raised serious concerns about the extent of new barriers to trade that will be erected even in the event of a deal. While tariffs will be removed, bureaucracy will increase and both government and industry are braced for issues at the border. A business taskforce to manage the transition has been forged between government and industry in an attempt to smooth the Brexit process in the new year. Looking back on a tumultuous five years in the job, Fairbairn said it had “been a mistake, and a lost opportunity for our country” for businesses not to have had greater involvement in the shape of the deal.
Cash reserves and stockpiling have been run down as a result of the virus, with many businesses assuming the Brexit transition period would simply be extended. “There is some wishful thinking,” Fairbairn said. “The single thing that would be getting businesses preparing best is a deal. Disruption of some sort is likely.” It comes as Boris Johnson is being warned that securing a deal with the EU is the best and easiest way to improve relations with a Joe Biden White House, should the Democratic candidate win this week. Biden has voiced concern that Johnson’s Brexit tactics could affect Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Britain’s former ambassador to the US who served in Washington between 2007 and 2012, said that a deal was the route through which Johnson could build relations with Biden. “I do think that they need to calculate what the impact of no deal would be, not just on the future relationship over free trade agreements, but more generally, on Britain’s standing with a new Biden administration,” he said. “No deal looks a very lonely position if you’ve got a Biden administration in Washington. “The very strong view among Biden’s team is that Brexit was a strategic mistake of some magnitude. They’ll be wondering how we fill that gap and will have concluded over the past four years that we haven’t really been able to identify a new British role in the world.”"
2020-10-31T12:24:33Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street launches Covid lockdown leak inquiry,"An investigation has been launched in Whitehall after details of the government’s plans to introduce stricter national lockdown measures next week were leaked to newspapers. The Times reported on Friday night that the prime minister was considering imposing a national lockdown early next week. According to the report, Boris Johnson met with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove to discuss the steep rise in infections, and was expected to hold a press conference on Monday.
Other newspapers, including the Daily Mail and the Sun, also wrote that a national lockdown was expected to be announced next week, which reportedly led Downing Street to launch a leak inquiry to uncover the source of the story.
The government has come under fire for failing to release the information directly to emergency services and businesses. John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, demanded “clear communication” from the government on coronavirus restrictions, saying a leak created a “media frenzy, causes confusion and … encourages some to make the most of their pre-lockdown time”.
Dr Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that briefing newspapers before businesses forced the latter to “wait and worry”. “If the government is planning another national lockdown it must say so immediately, rather than allow business and market confidence to be further eroded by speculation,” Marshall said. “The media briefings have to stop. The government needs to speak honestly with the nation, setting out a clear plan, the evidence for its actions, and significant increases in the support available for businesses and employees facing the hardship of no demand or the crushing blow of closure.” This is not the first time the government has been criticised for releasing information to national newspapers before affected communities. Earlier this month, the Sheffield city region mayor, Dan Jarvis, said “frustrations had bubbled over” among northern mayors when they found out about lockdown measures in their areas through newspaper reports. In September, the Speaker of the House of Commons accused Hancock of “running this chamber ragged” by deciding to brief the media about changes in restrictions before informing parliament. “I accept that decisions have been taken in a fast-moving situation, but timings for statements are known to ministers,” Sir Lindsay Hoyle told MPs."
2020-10-31T00:01:35Z,politics,Politics,"Drive less or face post-lockdown gridlock, UK transport experts warn","Many Britons will have to get used to driving less if the country is to avoid gridlock on the roads once coronavirus restrictions ease, and councils must provide better routes for cycling and walking, transport experts say. Government statistics show motor traffic is almost back at pre-lockdown levels, and only 59% of employees have returned to their workplaces. One study predicts that with health concerns reducing the use of public transport, up to 2.7 million more people could end up using cars for commuting trips alone. Cycling UK, the campaign group that commissioned the findings from a series of road transport experts, is urging the government and local authorities to push ahead with schemes to boost walking and cycling as alternatives. In May the government announced £250m in emergency funding for councils to implement schemes to boost active travel, including wider pavements, coned-off cycle lanes and so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), where some residential streets are blocked to through motor traffic. However, some such schemes have been abandoned after angering some locals and politicians. A pop-up cycle lane in Reigate, Surrey, was removed within days following pressure from the local Tory MP, Crispin Blunt. In London several schemes have been abandoned or rolled back, including a bike lane on the busy Euston Road and an LTN in Lewisham. Rachel Aldred, a professor of transport at Westminster University, who was one of the experts consulted by Cycling UK, said non-car transport methods should be encouraged. “Without such changes, motor traffic will only grow further as and when [restrictions] are relaxed,” she said. “[Doing] nothing means more traffic jams, more road injuries, and more pollution.” Another of the experts, Richard Allsop, emeritus professor of transport studies at University College London, said people who usually drove would face some difficult choices on whether to endure – and contribute to – gridlock, or seek alternatives. “All users of motor vehicles have to find by trial and error how best to make their journeys, and perhaps which to give up making in their vehicles, as they collectively get used to the enhanced – but from their point of view reduced – network,” he said. “This will be a bit uncomfortable for quite a lot of us and really awkward for some. But our share in this discomfort is just our tiny share of the vast price that needs to be faced up to to reduce emissions, decarbonise transport and do our country’s bit in keeping climate change manageable for future generations.” Duncan Dollimore, the head of campaigns at Cycling UK, said ministers had correctly warned of the looming problems on the roads and had acted with the £250m emergency fund. “Unfortunately, a vocal minority of people and MPs have taken exception to these schemes, blaming them as the sole cause of congestion.”"

2020-10-30T18:30:29Z,politics,Politics,Dossier alleges Cummings may have perverted course of justice in account of lockdown trip,"Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have been handed a 225-page dossier urging them to investigate Dominic Cummings for allegedly perverting the course of justice, in relation to a statement about his journeys to the north-east of England at the height of the pandemic. The former regional chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said Cummings’ claims during a press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden on 25 May affected the course of justice as they were made as Durham police’s investigation into his behaviour was already under way. Afzal’s lawyers gave extensive details of the allegation in the dossier sent on Friday to Durham police, the Metropolitan police and Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, and his staff at the CPS. They claimed the legal test for such a prosecution had been met. The dossier also accuses Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, of multiple alleged offences under the coronavirus regulations for leaving their primary home in London and their second home in Durham without, it says, a reasonable excuse. The most serious allegation in the documents is the claim that Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of his journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April and his denial of a claim that he made a second lockdown trip to Durham. If such a charge were proven, Cummings could face a prison sentence. In a statement, Afzal’s lawyers said: “The alleged offence of perverting the course of justice arises from Mr Cummings’ statement in the rose garden … Mr Cummings made public assertions about his conduct at Barnard Castle on 12 April and his actions on the weekend of 17-19 April that appear to be wholly inconsistent with accounts of his conduct at that time obtained from eyewitnesses.”
Cummings admitted in his statement that he had travelled to Durham and Barnard Castle, as revealed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. He said he had acted legally and travelled to Durham to self-isolate after his wife became sick with suspected Covid, and a day before he also fell ill. He claimed he had phone data to prove he was not in Durham on 19 April as one Guardian source had claimed. When three other people made similar claims, Downing Street said it considered the matter closed and refused to release the evidence that Cummings said proved he was in London. Two of the people, Dave and Clare Edwards, gave statements to Durham police officers on 25 May as the prime minister’s chief aide was giving his press conference, claiming that they saw a man whom they believed to be Cummings on 19 April in Durham’s Houghall woods. The submissions from Afzal’s lawyers said Cummings’ account appeared to have influenced a three-day investigation by Durham police into his lockdown journeys. The force made no finding on his decision to leave London because its investigation was confined to County Durham. It concluded that the journey to Barnard Castle on Wakefield’s birthday amounted to a “minor” breach of the rules “because there was no apparent breach of social distancing”, and it found there was “insufficient evidence” that he made a second trip. Afzal’s lawyers said new statements from witnesses called these conclusions into question. At least three people have reported seeing Cummings in Barnard Castle, including Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, who alerted the Guardian and the police to seeing Cummings and his family getting into a car on a road on the southern side of the Tees on 12 April. Cummings said he stayed by the Tees for 10 to 15 minutes and strayed no more than 15 metres from his car. But Rosalind Evans, a retired council worker, told the Guardian and the police that she saw someone she believed to be Cummings in the town centre on 12 April. A third person, Alan Gowland, told the Sunday Times and later the Guardian that he saw someone he believed to be Cummings on a path by a weir on the other side of the Tees from Lees’ sighting. Afzal’s dossier includes eight annexes of new statements from witnesses in Barnard Castle and Durham. The Met and the CPS have previously refused Afzal’s request to investigate the allegations against Cummings. Afzal, whose brother Umar died from coronavirus when he was self-isolating at home on 8 April when Cummings was in Durham, said he wanted to get to the truth. “The picture painted by the witnesses that have come forward appears clear and coherent and is inconsistent in important parts with the version given by Mr Cummings,” he said. “I believe the CPS’s public interest test is also met, given the impact that this has had on general compliance with Covid regulations.” A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed. Durham Constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations.” Cummings and Wakefield have been approached for comment."
2020-10-30T17:46:45Z,politics,Politics,"Corbyn-supporting MPs discussed quitting Labour, Ian Lavery says","Labour MPs who support Jeremy Corbyn have discussed resigning from the parliamentary party and sitting as independents amid fears that Keir Starmer could lead a “mass purge” of the left, an ally of the former leader has said. As senior party figures called for calm following Labour’s suspension of Corbyn on Thursday for saying the party’s antisemitism problem had been overstated, Ian Lavery said there are fears that the move was a “war cry” that could force some MPs to leave. Lavery, who chaired the party for three years until April, told the Guardian that many of Corbyn’s supporters, including MPs, fear the suspension is the beginning of a significant change in direction under Starmer. On Friday evening senior figures close to Starmer and Corbyn were engaged in informal talks in an effort to allow the former leader to return to the party. Officials from Unite the Union have been involved in the discussions, which are expected to continue over the weekend, it is understood. Many on the left of the party, including general secretaries of affiliated trade unions and Socialist Campaign Group MPs, remain furious with the decision to suspend Corbyn. But they have been warned by those closest to the former leader not to do or say anything which may make his position more difficult. Lavery’s comments come after Starmer defended the party’s decision to withdraw the whip from his predecessor. The new Labour leader added that he has not ruled out expelling Corbyn from the party he led until six months ago. Meanwhile, a poll from Ipsos Mori showed Labour five points ahead of the Conservatives on 42%, the first time the opposition had been ahead according to the pollster since Boris Johnson became prime minister, although the research was conducted in the week leading up to Corbyn’s suspension. Lavery told the Guardian on Friday: “I have heard people suggest that if this is going to a continued change in political direction then perhaps they might not stay the full term as a Labour party representative. Perhaps they [MPs] might be convinced to become independent Labour. “I have heard MPs saying that if this is a purge of the left and things aren’t resolved and continue in the same direction, then they would have to check their conscience to see whether they could stay as Labour MPs until the end of this parliament. There is a possibility of people moving to becoming independent.” Any such move would be a “disaster,” Lavery said, urging all MPs to stay within the party, but he called on senior figures including Starmer to reach out before it is too late. “The only way we will win an election is by staying as a united party. If people perceive this to be an all-out attack on the left of the movement – and if that is borne out by other decisions by the leader – there will be issues that will come to the fore that will result in massive problems. “I would urge those MPs not to leave and I would urge the leader’s office to reach out. We have got to try to keep people calm. This dispute with Jeremy has got to be resolved as quickly as we possibly can and then we can move forward,” he said.
Lavery, the MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland, said Labour’s decision to suspend Corbyn could be challenged because it had broken a key recommendation of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, which found the party responsible for three legal breaches over antisemitism. “The EHRC recommendations, all of which I support, said quite clearly that there shouldn’t be any intervention from the leader’s office in disciplinary matters. Jeremy was suspended on Keir’s say-so,” he said. This is denied by the party, who say the general secretary, David Evans, made the decision. The widening schism in the party could be healed if the two sides come to a resolution over Corbyn’s suspension, Lavery said. “I think that there has been a miscalculation and there is room for discussion between the adults in the room to see if there can be some sort of resolution,” he added. In a series of interviews on Friday, Starmer insisted he had had nothing to do with this disciplinary process. Party staff were told this afternoon that the only person consulted by Evans in advance of his decision to suspend was a lawyer. Asked if possible disciplinary action against Corbyn could include expulsion, Starmer said: “Yes, people have been expelled from the Labour party.” He told the BBC: “But it’s not for me to say what process should be followed, that’s for the general secretary, or what sanction is in order. “I don’t want a civil war in the Labour party. I don’t think there’s any need for one. I want to unite the party. But I’m not going to renege on my commitment to root out antisemitism.” Starmer said he had spelled out to Corbyn on Wednesday evening how he intended to respond to the damning report by the EHRC. “I’m deeply disappointed in that response from Jeremy Corbyn yesterday not least because I spoke to him the night before the report to set out how I intended to deal with it,” he said. Others on the party’s left were preparing to speak up in support of the suspended former leader on Friday night.
Members’ pressure group Momentum held an online rally, with familiar allies John McDonnell, Diane Abbott,and Richard Burgon among those who spoke. . McDonnell told the event that what happened to Corbyn was “profoundly wrong and must be reversed”. He added: “We are stumbling into one hell of a row, over what? The use of language, misrepresentation and overreaction. My advice is with a bit of explanation with what was meant in statements we can save ourselves a lot of grief.” Closing the event, Abbott said she was “shocked and saddened” by the suspension. “It’s most damaging to the prospect of a Labour government,” the former shadow home secretary said. “There’s a truism in British politics that divided parties do not win elections.” Despite Lavery’s comments, some allies and colleagues of both Starmer and Corbyn seemed keen to step back from any immediate confrontation, with Labour officials saying that while the disciplinary process was out of Starmer’s control, there would be “lots of meetings” taking place with all sides in the interim. Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, Labour’s biggest financial donor, also rolled back from his more combative tone from Thursday, saying it was “a sensitive time” and people should remain measured. “Now is the time for some calmness, so we can see if we can resolve this,” he told Sky News. “Yesterday should have been about moving on from antisemitism, and embracing what the EHRC said, which Keir did, and unfortunately we’ve all been knocked off the rails a little bit by Jeremy’s suspension.” McCluskey is understood to have toned down his comments after a conversation with Starmer. McCluskey met the Labour leader on Friday afternoon with proposals for an negotiated end to the suspension, but there was no immediate sign that anything had emerged as a result. One Corbyn ally said they believed the Labour leadership would be keen to resolve the disagreement quickly and that both sides were seeking “mutual ladders to climb down”. However, they disputed Starmer’s implication that Corbyn had been fully briefed about the repercussions of downplaying the scale of antisemitism in Labour before the EHRC report, saying the pair only had a “short” phone call on Wednesday evening, with few details."
2020-10-30T16:50:24Z,politics,Politics,Labour to investigate complaints of antisemitic messages after EHRC report,"Labour officials are poised to investigate complaints about antisemitic messages on social media after campaign groups reported an apparent increase in the use of suspicious terms after the publication of a damning report on the issue. The expected crackdown prompted concerns from allies of Jeremy Corbyn, who was suspended from the party over his response to the report, that members or officials who support the former leader on social media could also face sanctions. The inquiry by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which found Labour broke equalities law in areas including harassment and discrimination, was particularly critical about antisemitism on social media. It said that under Corbyn’s leadership the party’s investigators did not look into complaints about such content being liked or shared, “which meant that potentially antisemitic conduct went unchallenged”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the party would now “proactively investigate” the social media accounts of Labour members and officials to prevent the spread of such themes. The party leader, Keir Starmer, has more generally promised a robust disciplinary response over the issue. In interviews on Friday, in which he did not rule out the possibility of Corbyn being expelled, Starmer said that of 827 cases connected to antisemitism that had been dealt with since he took over as leader in April, a third of the perpetrators had been removed from the party.
As part of Labour’s promised response to the EHRC’s recommendations, officials are expected to draw up guidelines on what would constitute messages that would merit disciplinary action. Corbyn was suspended for saying in his response to the EHRC report that while he accepted its recommendations, the problem of antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. One issue yet to be determined is whether simply agreeing with, or repeating, this statement would amount to an offence, or if it would need to be a stronger message, for example, arguing that the claims of antisemitism in Labour more generally were a political plot. One ally of Corbyn expressed concern that the process could end up being a wider purge of members or officials sympathetic to the former leader. “It is a fact that polls have shown people believed the scale of antisemitism in the party was much greater than it actually was, so people can legitimately say that,” they said. “But the problem is, once you start a process it takes on its own dynamic.” Sefa Ozalp, a researcher at Cardiff University’s HateLab who studies hate speech on social media, said that antisemitism on Twitter had more than tripled compared with the week before the EHRC report was published. “Compared to the mean of antagonistic tweets counts in the seven days leading to the publication of the EHRC report, there was a 260% increase in antagonistic tweets on 29 October,” Ozalp told the Guardian. “This significant increase demonstrates that [the] offline antisemitism row in [the] Labour party triggers online discussion around Jewish identity and antisemitic sentiments.” The Community Security Trust, a Jewish organisation that monitors and tracks antisemitism and has previously produced reports about its prevalence on social media, said there were signs that the publication of the EHRC report could have triggered an increase in such postings. The group said it had used software to search for terms linked to leftwing antisemitism, such as “Zionist”, “Mossad” and “Rothschild”, alongside Starmer’s name over the past 30 days.
On Thursday there was a “significant spike”, it said, adding that some of the messages could have been expressing sentiments opposing antisemitism as the software covered all mentions. A separate issue for Labour officials to work out is their precise legal culpability for online sentiments expressed by officials and others. The EHRC report cited two instances where antisemitic conduct amounted to harassment under equality laws, one of which was due to Facebook comments by a Labour councillor. In dealing with social media messages, disciplinary teams must be able to discern not just whether those behind them were Labour members, but if they also held an official role, potentially making the party legally responsible, one insider said."
2020-10-30T16:21:31Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn's constituents air frustration and anger over suspension,"Hussein Jabar still can’t believe Jeremy Corbyn was suspended from the Labour party. The owner of Gadz Cafe in Finsbury Park, which is decorated with pictures of the former Labour leader, shook his head and simply said: “Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t deserve this.” Labour was plunged into further turmoil on Thursday after it suspended Corbyn over his comments about a damning report into antisemitism within the party. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Corbyn said of the report: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons.” Labour announced his suspension at 1pm, with Corbyn finding out from a camera operator as he left a community centre in north London. In a later interview, the former Labour leader urged his followers to “stay in the party” to fight for leftwing principles.
In his constituency of Islington North, which Corbyn won with 64.3% of the vote in the 2019 election, there was anger on Friday over his suspension. While most people did not have pictures of him plastered across their walls, support for the former Labour leader ran deep. “This man works very, very hard for anyone. He spends his whole life helping people,” said Jabar, who has known Corbyn for several years. “Everyone here knows Jeremy is a very good man. This is hard to see, especially with his age. They should be giving him something for his retirement, not this.” One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “Corbyn is a very nice man and very popular here. I’ve known him for a long time and he is always helping poor people. He doesn’t have the arrogance of the other politicians.” He added: “When I woke up this morning and I saw the news, I was so upset. I feel like he is family. He worries about our problems, he is always helping us.” But there was also frustration at how Corbyn responded to the report’s findings. Sue Davies, who was helping her granddaughter move in with her partner, said: “Where he let himself down is that throughout the entire controversy of antisemitism he never stepped up … And when he did talk about antisemitism, he didn’t talk about antisemitism, he talked about racism. Jewish people wanted to hear him on antisemitism.”
Her granddaughter’s partner, Gill, disagreed. “I think he has been misconstrued. I am Jewish myself and I know he isn’t antisemitic. Unfortunately, I do think he has a lot of people behind him who maybe pushed him to say what he said yesterday, but Keir Starmer is an idiot.” She added: “He [Corbyn] was the person who wanted the report to come out. And the press is just twisting it as though he interfered and he didn’t interfere.” Davies said she remembered the first rally she went to after Corbyn became leader and how excited she felt. “He was pro-Palestinian and I understand that, but many Jewish people are pro-Palestinian, and that was never acknowledged. He should have been upfront and had press conference after press conference, day after day.” Ella, a recent university graduate, said she was desperate for Labour to be the strong oppositional party the country needed right now. “It’s disappointing to see such a fractured and divided party when we need a strong opposition.” She said she and her mother had backed Corbyn and she was disappointed to hear he had been suspended, but felt in some way it was inevitable. “It felt like the entire way through his leadership of the party, there were always people rallying against him and trying to divide the party in two.”"
2020-10-30T14:56:14Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn's suspension: what will Labour do next?,"Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended ? David Evans, the party’s new general secretary, sent Jeremy Corbyn an email at about 1pm on Thursday notifying him of his suspension from the Labour party after the former leader said antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” as he responded to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into the issue. The email came two and a half hours after Corbyn’s statement and, given the time elapsed, the message would have been brief, citing only the rule broken. Accusations about antisemitism are covered by Labour’s catch-all rule 2.1.8, which says: “No member of the party shall engage in conduct which in the opinion of the NEC is prejudicial, or in any act which in the opinion of the NEC is grossly detrimental to the party.” What happens next? Labour’s governance and legal unit will review the file and invite Corbyn to discuss the case, in a process expected to take several weeks or possibly months. The process typically involves an interview where a friend or lawyer can be present, and where officials will seek to establish if the former leader stands by his remarks, qualifies them, or seeks to apologise or walk them back. The interviews can often have an important bearing on proceedings; party insiders say that when the former London mayor Ken Livingstone was questioned, he was combative. Others, however, show contrition. What is the role of the party’s national executive committee (NEC)? Under Labour’s current rules, the case with a report from the governance unit is sent to the disputes panel subcommittee of the party’s ruling NEC, which is now up for election and is comprised of elected delegates from all parts of the Labour party from the membership to trade unions, councillors and MPs. The party has confirmed that its leader, Keir Starmer, who sits on the NEC, will not be involved in handling Corbyn’s complaint. Other senior figures such as the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, are unlikely to be involved either, meaning the case would be determined by a subgroup of less well-known Labour figures. What are the sanctions? The NEC disputes panel can recommend anything from ending the suspension, issuing a warning, or expulsion. In the case of expulsion, Corbyn would be able to appeal, this time to another party body, the national constitutional committee, which appoints a panel of three and operates similarly to a court. But there is a strong possibility Labour’s rules will change too. In response to the EHRC’s finding that Labour broke equalities law, Starmer promised to establish “an independent complaints process” – designed to be without political interference – which would be in place “as soon as possible in the new year”. What about the Conservatives and other parties? All parties have disciplinary systems but after the EHRC’s report, they are likely to have to be revamped. The Conservatives have been accused of refusing to take complaints about Islamophobia in its ranks seriously after ditching plans to hold an inquiry into the issue. Boris Johnson himself was subject to a complaint, eventually dropped by the party without further action, after he compared fully veiled Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers. The EHRC said as much in the foreword to its report, arguing that politicians on all sides had a responsibility for “challenging racism in all its forms”. But it complained that “in recent times, there have been examples of behaviour that falls well below the standards we would expect, from politicians of various parties”."
2020-10-30T13:31:16Z,politics,Politics,Plant inspectors and rising prices: UK garden industry set for Brexit shock,"The UK’s love of horticulture has grown during the coronavirus pandemic, but avid gardeners are being warned of a Brexit shock, with rising prices, potential plant shortages and even the need for plant inspectors at nurseries. Every year 55,000 trucks loaded with plants arrive in the UK from the Netherlands alone. Each individual pot or hessian root wrap bears an EU “plant passport”, which allows frictionless cross border trade. But from 1 January, these passports will no longer be valid in Britain. Importers will need to complete their own checks to comply with new UK regulations to certify that each plant is disease- and pest-free, adding costs and delays to suppliers who will now have two layers of red tape to contend with – one for EU customers and one for British nurseries. Andy Moreham, the sales and marketing manager at Joseph Rochford Gardens wholesale plant nursery in Hertfordshire, said the new regime would choke off some supplies from industrial suppliers in the Netherlands.
“They are now going to be exporting at additional cost and some of our suppliers have told us they will not want to do this and they want to just sell their products to the EU,” he said. “I feel sorry for them because they have nothing to do with the UK government’s decisions, it’s going to be difficult for them and for us as it’s been nice to have built up a close working relationship with them over decades.” Strolling through the remainder of this season’s lavenders, hydrangeas and hedging from the Netherlands, Moreham pointed out the EU flags and passports on the plants. He said it was the consumer who would pay for Brexit. “Most likely we will see a 10% increase in costs.” It is no surprise that in a nation of gardeners, the horticulture industry is huge, worth £5bn a year, yet it does not receive the same attention in Brexit talks as farming and fishing.
Joseph Rochford Gardens is a small family business with a turnover of about £4m to £5m. But like many nurseries it relies heavily on imports, with about £1.5m worth of stock coming from the EU. The doubling up of regulations – one for EU buyers and one for British buyers – seemed unnecessary, said Moreham. Some suppliers have told the nursery it could need plant inspectors on site every day to produce the quantity of certificates that would be required for cross-channel trade under the new “independent UK” regulatory system. Each certificate will cost £180 to the supplier, enough to wipe out the small margins on sales. In addition to the health certificates, suppliers will be subject to health inspections at ports and inland border control posts, which are being set up under Michael Gove’s border operation model. Suppliers will also have to supply export declarations to EU authorities for the first time, coupled with customs documentation on arrival in the UK for the first time.
“The cost of inspection at each end, the increased cost of transport, the cost of hiring agents to register each import on the various new software systems for imports, it is likely that there will be a 10% increases in costs,” Moreham said. “Plants are perishable, if our plants get stopped at the harbour for God knows how long, then they will dry out and if they are delayed for a day or two or they decide they need to put them in quarantine, they could deteriorate or die.” Joseph Rochford Gardens is adding £150,000 worth of seedlings and cuttings to its December orders to beat the potential chaos and supply shortages in January, when it would usually grow on for saleable produce in March and April. “Covid has cost us £1m in sales and has long-term consequences,” he said, adding that it had not left any money for capital expenditure that would be needed across the industry to do what the government would like them to do: develop a homegrown business to match that of the Netherlands and obviate the need for so many imports. Moreham’s immediate concern is delays at the borders and a second wave of coronavirus destruction. “Horticulture has been the poor relative to agriculture and doesn’t have the same clout. But we are a multibillion-pound industry, a successful industry that is only going to grow. We are going to have to look at how the industry changes and grows more for our market.”"
2020-10-30T10:03:22Z,politics,Politics,Starmer says Corbyn could have predicted suspension for EHRC response,"Keir Starmer has said Jeremy Corbyn could have predicted that his decision to play down the extent of antisemitism in Labour would lead to disciplinary action, and added that it was theoretically possible the former leader could be expelled from the party. In a round of media interviews as Labour descended into infighting following Corbyn’s suspension for saying that antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons”, Starmer insisted he had had nothing to do with this disciplinary process. But asked if possible disciplinary action against Corbyn could include expulsion, Starmer said: “Yes, people have been expelled from the Labour party.” Of 827 cases connected to antisemitism dealt with since he took over as leader in April, Starmer said, a third had been kicked out of the party. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “But it’s not for me to say what process should be followed, that’s for the general secretary, or what sanction is in order. I don’t want a civil war in the Labour party. I don’t think there’s any need for one. I want to unite the party. But I’m not going to renege on my commitment to root out antisemitism.” Starmer said he had spelled out to Corbyn on Wednesday evening how he intended to respond to the damning report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which found Labour responsible for three legal breaches over antisemitism. “I’m deeply disappointed in that response from Jeremy Corbyn yesterday not least because I spoke to him the night before the report to set out how I intended to deal with it,” he told Today. “And from discussions yesterday morning I’m in no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn and his team knew exactly what I was going to say in my response about not only antisemitism but the denial and the arguments about exaggeration, and it’s just a factional fight. “That is why appropriate action was taken yesterday by the general secretary in suspending Jeremy Corbyn. That’s the right acton – very difficult action, but the right action, which I fully support.”
Speaking earlier, Starmer told BBC One’s Breakfast that the decision was made at about 1pm on Thursday by Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, as a result of Corbyn’s rebuff of criticism in the EHRC report. The Labour leader, who took over from Corbyn in April, and has accepted in full the EHRC’s findings, said he had not spoken to his predecessor since the report was published. He said: “What I had hoped would happen yesterday is that we could accept what was going to be a very difficult day, draw a line in the sand and move on. “And I’ve spoken extensively to Jewish communities, Jewish leaders over the last six months. That’s what they wanted to happen yesterday, an ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on. “That’s what I hoped would have happened yesterday. As it happens it took a different turn of events because of Jeremy Corbyn’s response.” Corbyn has pledged to fight the suspension, and is rallying allies, including supportive MPs and friendly unions, including Unite, which is Labour’s biggest financial supporter. Asked about the former leader’s future in the party, Starmer declined to comment, saying it was “very important that I don’t now comment on what is going to happen in the process”. Asked whether he believed Corbyn was himself antisemitic, he indicated not: “I don’t see Jeremy Corbyn in that light. Neither did the commission report make any findings, individually, about things that Jeremy had said or done.” The EHRC said Labour under Corbyn was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act, connected to harassment, political interference in antisemitism complaints and inadequate training for those handling the complaints. Challenged on what he did while serving as shadow Brexit secretary to try to change the party’s actions, Starmer said he had spoken out, both privately and in public, adding: “Within the shadow cabinet you have responsibility, and I accept that. And we all have to accept the findings yesterday, and apologise for them.” Asked why he did not resign, he said: “I thought it was important to have voices in the shadow cabinet.”"
2020-10-29T21:59:20Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn to fight suspension from Labour after EHRC antisemitism report comments – as it happened,"The repercussions of todayâ€™s events are likely to be felt in the Labour party for a long time to come - hereâ€™s a rundown of events as they happened. EHRC report finds Labour responsible for unlawful acts of discrimination and harassment. An investigation into the Labour party by the equalities watchdog found it was responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination, and identified what it described as â€œserious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaintsâ€�. Jeremy Corbyn said he did not accept all of the EHRCâ€™s findings and that the scale of the antisemitism problem in Labour was â€œdramatically overstatedâ€� for political reasons. He also said he was â€œdetermined to eliminate all forms of racism and root out the cancer of anti-Semitismâ€� and admitted â€œJewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.â€� Labour given until 10 December to draft an action plan. The party was given until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement the reportâ€™s recommendations, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not fulfilled. Keir Starmer said it was a â€˜day of shameâ€™ for the Labour party. â€œThe EHRCâ€™s reports are stark and leave no room for equivocation,â€� Keir Starmer said in his first reaction to the release. Labour suspended Jeremy Corbyn. A Labour party spokesman said: â€œIn light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation.â€� Corbyn said he would contest â€˜political interventionâ€™ to suspend him. â€œIâ€™ve made absolutely clear that those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong,â€� he said in a statement. Momentum described Corbynâ€™s suspension as â€˜massive attack on the leftâ€™. Momentum, which was set set up in 2015 to support the leftwing of the Labour party under the leadership of Corbyn, said the suspension should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity. Keir Starmer said he â€˜fully supportsâ€™ the move to suspend Jeremy Corbyn. â€œI made it clear that we would not support antisemitism or the denial of antisemitism through the suggestion that it is exaggerated or factional and that is why I was disappointed by Jeremy Corbynâ€™s response and that is why appropriate action has been taken, which I fully support,â€� he said. Jeremy Corbyn urged Labour supporters to â€˜stay in the partyâ€™ and fight. In an interview following the removal of the party whip Corbyn called for calm and for members to â€œmake the caseâ€� for leftwing values internally. Unite boss Len McCluskey said Corbyn suspension will â€˜create chaosâ€™ in Labour party. Corbyn ally McCluskey said the division created by todayâ€™s events would leave Labour â€œdoomed to defeatâ€�. Cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, wrote a scathing letter to Keir Starmer, challenging him over his â€œfailure to speak outâ€� on antisemitism during his time in the shadow cabinet, and demanding answers on Corbynâ€™s future in the Labour party."
2020-10-29T20:25:49Z,politics,Politics,Labour's left calls for Jeremy Corbyn's suspension to be lifted,"Labour’s left has called for Jeremy Corbyn to be swiftly reinstated, with a group representing more than 30 MPs declaring it would “work tirelessly” in support of the former leader until his case is resolved. Following his suspension on Thursday over comments about antisemitism, Corbyn convened a call with leaders from Unite and the Communication Workers Union, as well as supportive MPs, the party pressure group Momentum and other left affiliates. The group was divided over whether Corbyn’s suspension by Labour was premeditated but agreed to mobilise party members in support of him while also seeking conciliation with the party and its leader, Keir Starmer, to see whether an amicable way back for Corbyn could be found. If the party seem determined to press ahead with tough action, one source at the meeting said it could “get very big and very divisive very quickly”.
Momentum said it would “not take attacks on the left lying down” as it sought to rally Corbyn supporters. Key figures in parliament and the unions, however, downplayed talk of a party split. The Socialist Campaign Group, which comprises 33 Labour MPs, representing a sixth of the parliamentary party, released a short statement saying it “firmly opposed” Corbyn’s suspension, which followed his reaction to the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report into antisemitism within Labour. John McDonnell, a longtime Corbyn ally, sought to strike a conciliatory note. Urging “all party members to stay calm” the former shadow chancellor said: “In the interests of party unity, let’s find a way of undoing and resolving this.” Few other MPs in the Socialist Campaign Group – normally Corbyn’s bedrock of support at Westminster – were willing to be publicly drawn into the row. Nadia Whittome, who was first elected in 2019, said she “unequivocally” supported the EHRC’s recommendations, in a lengthy statement that made no mention of Corbyn or his suspension. “It is vital that we learn from our mistakes and change our party for the better,” she said. One shadow cabinet member said: “I’d be surprised if any quit the party. Several members from all sides did that in the last parliament, and they all ended up losing their seats.” Insiders at Unite, the most significant Corbyn-supporting trade union, said they were “staggered” by the suspension decision. But Len McCluskey, the union’s general secretary, called on “members angered by this suspension not to leave the party” – in effect urging them to fight from within. The suspension, McCluskey said, was “an act of grave injustice”, which he argued would “create chaos within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory. A split party will be doomed to defeat.” Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “Keir Starmer’s political decision to suspend Jeremy Corbyn – a lifelong anti-racist campaigner – flies in the face of the report.” Labour’s left had been in retreat among the membership, as demonstrated by Starmer’s significant victory in the party’s leadership contest in April, with the leftwing candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey winning 28% of the vote. On Thursday it was unclear how far Corbyn’s suspension would galvanise them. Nevertheless, the “stand your ground” message was being widely shared by organisations such as Momentum. Its organisers said there had been “an explosive response” to an email from co-chairs Andrew Scattergood and Gaya Sriskanthan to its membership on Thursday lunchtime. “This suspension risks politicising Labour’s response to antisemitism. It is a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity,” the two wrote in their email. “They want us to give up. They want us to throw in the towel. They want us to feel despair. But we’re not going anywhere.” Momentum said it had called an emergency meeting of its national coordinating group to work out its response. One Momentum member wrote back saying Corbyn’s suspension had “shook me to the core” and that they had immediately considered resigning. “But as you say we must stand up and fight for the left and true socialism. I am dismayed to think that this may cause a civil war within the Labour party,” they wrote in an email shared with the Guardian. Donations to a fighting fund already set up by a Corbyn supporter to help pay for costs in a separate legal action soared on Thursday. It has raised about £350,000, which would easily be enough to afford the former leader experienced legal representation if required during any disciplinary proceedings."
2020-10-29T20:19:01Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer had his response ready. Then came Corbyn's post,"Jeremy Corbyn walked out of a community centre in Crouch End, north London, at just after 1pm on Thursday to learn from a journalist that he had been suspended from the Labour party. The man who was Labour party leader as recently as April had not received a telephone call or text to let him know that the whip had been taken away from him. Corbyn found out after recording a television clip reacting to the highly critical report from the equalities watchdog released that morning. A Labour MP since 1983, Corbyn froze for a moment in the chill October wind before moving swiftly on. Action had been taken against Corbyn, MP for Islington North, because of a Facebook post, released that morning, in which he claimed that the problem of antisemitism was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media.
It was a crucial moment in a turbulent 24 hours when the faultlines within the Labour party were exposed by the conclusions of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission report. The move led to warnings from left-leaning union leaders and MPs, who said they would fight to keep the Corbyn project alive. There had been no hint of what was to come on Wednesday evening when Corbyn, Keir Starmer, the party’s new leader, and his deputy, Angela Rayner, discussed their respective plans for responding to the report. Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, had read the findings in their entirety and was ready to make an unqualified apology for the party’s failings. His allies believe he had little choice, given the report’s damning conclusions. Labour, it said, was responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cited “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. Starmer knew that Labour, only the second political party after the BNP to be investigated by the body, was about to be served with an unlawful act notice and had until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement a series of changes. During the talks on Wednesday, Starmer spoke directly to Corbyn in what was described as a “friendly and professional” conversation. Corbyn’s team say they were told that they would be given prior sight of Starmer’s statement. Discussions also took place about whether Starmer and the party’s general secretary, David Evans, had any intention of taking disciplinary action against Corbyn. According to his team, the former Labour leader received reassurances that action was not planned. However, sources close to Starmer insist nothing was agreed or planned with Corbyn in advance. The report was released at 10am the following day as scheduled, and it made for painful reading. Headlines travelled across the world stating that the UK Labour party, which founded the EHRC and has been at the forefront of fighting racism since its foundation, had unlawfully discriminated against Jewish members. Corbyn’s team had prepared their response but had still not received any notification of Starmer’s speech, it is claimed. At 10.36am, Corbyn’s statement was published. He wrote he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. The statement said: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” Starmer’s staffers were stunned. Within minutes, Starmer was due to speak directly to the nation at a televised press conference to apologise for failing to tackle antisemitism. He had little time to adjust a prepared speech, and chose not to. At 11am, he appeared before TV cameras, saying that those who “deny there is a problem are part of the problem … those who pretend it is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem”.
Reporters at the press conference asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, questioning whether the MP would be suspended for saying that the allegations had been “exaggerated”. Starmer said he would “look carefully” at them. By 12.15pm Corbyn had arrived in Crouch End to record interviews with broadcasters. Again, he said he disagreed with a number of the report’s points and repeatedly said that the number of antisemitism cases had been “exaggerated”. The decision to suspend Corbyn was taken by Evans, rather than Starmer. Just after 1pm a statement was released by Labour suspending him from the party and stripping him of the party whip. “In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation,” a spokesperson said. Corbyn’s allies said if Starmer’s office had shared his speech they would have seen the leader’s plan to refer to “exaggerated claims”, and would have modified Corbyn’s statement.
In a later Facebook statement, Corbyn wrote: “I will strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me. I’ve made absolutely clear that those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong. “It’s … undeniable that a false impression has been created of the number of members accused of antisemitism, as polling shows: that is what has been overstated, not the seriousness of the problem.” Allies of Corbyn last night condemned the move and urged Starmer to allow him back into the party. John McDonnell, who served as shadow chancellor throughout Corbyn’s tenure as leader, said the party’s decision should be overturned. “On the day we should all be moving forward and taking all steps to fight antisemitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong.” Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, said the suspension appeared to contradict one of the report’s key recommendations – to remove the leader’s office from party investigations – and warned of chaos across the movement. McCluskey said: “It is also an act of grave injustice which, if not reversed, will create chaos within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory.” Many others in the parliamentary party and across the shadow cabinet supported the move. One shadow cabinet member said this could be “a clause 4 moment for Keir”. Rayner said Corbyn had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem of antisemitism. “I’m devastated that it’s come to this. Today should be about really listening, reading and taking in the report,” she said. His suspension was welcomed by Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said: “Having presided over the descent of a proudly anti-racist party into a party that broke equalities law in its treatment of Jews, his shameless comments today showed that he remains part of the problem.”"
2020-10-29T19:52:50Z,politics,Politics,Labour in turmoil as Corbyn suspended in wake of antisemitism report,"Labour was plunged into turmoil after the party suspended Keir Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, in the wake of a damning report into antisemitism that found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. The decision to suspend Corbyn for saying the problem of antisemitism within Labour was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media sent shockwaves through the party and led to rumours of a split.
Corbyn’s rebuff of criticism from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) put him at odds with his successor. Moments after Corbyn’s statement was released, Starmer spoke at a press conference where he said those who “pretend [antisemitism] is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem”. Corbyn is understood to have spoken to Starmer on Wednesday night, ahead of the report’s publication, and was reassured there was no plan to take action against him in light of its findings. That changed after Corbyn’s statement was released. There was an atmosphere of shock and dismay in Labour HQ after Corbyn’s statement was published shortly before 11am, according to party sources. “It was total disbelief that he would put that out,” one adviser said.
A senior Labour source said the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, spoke to Corbyn and his team and urged him to apologise and issue a clarification in a televised clip he recorded at lunchtime, but he did not do so. Labour announced his suspension at 1pm, with Corbyn finding out from a cameraman as he left a community centre in north London. It is understood that Corbyn did not intend to make his statement a direct challenge to Starmer despite suspicions among senior Labour figures that he was “goading Keir”. Corbyn condemned the “political intervention” and said he would “strongly contest” the action – but called for calm and urged supporters not to quit the party. Shadow cabinet ministers backed Starmer, with one describing it as the Labour leader’s Clause IV moment. In a broadcast clip released after his suspension, Corbyn urged his followers to “stay in the party” to fight for leftwing principles following the decision to suspend him. During the interview, Corbyn refused to retract his earlier statements, saying the “public perception” about how many members were under investigation for antisemitism was “very different” from the reality. Len McCluskey, leader of Labour’s single biggest donor, the Unite union, called the suspension a “grave injustice” and said it raised questions over Starmer’s involvement in disciplinary matters – a key topic of the EHRC investigation. Starmer’s team strongly deny the decision was his. McCluskey, whose union gives millions of pounds to the party each year, said it would “create chaos” within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory. “A split party will be doomed to defeat,” he said. The decision to suspend was taken by Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, and chief whip, Nick Brown, and meant automatic withdrawal of the party whip, according to multiple sources.
Corbyn-supporting members of Labour’s national executive committee on Thursday evening confronted Evans over his decision to suspend the former leader and claimed that the decision could be legally challenged. One ally of Corbyn said: “In theory, the NEC could call an emergency meeting and get him back in.” One of the key criticisms of the EHRC report was of regular political interference in the complaints process by Corbyn’s office. “The general secretary has always had that power to act quickly. Keir had to keep away from it otherwise it goes against everything that has happened today,” a member of the party’s executive committee said.
Corbyn’s supporters believe the disciplinary process is flawed and that the Labour leader will be able to fight his suspension, intending to challenge the notion that Starmer had no role in the decision. Corbyn’s fate in the disciplinary process could take months to resolve. The party has been charged by the EHRC with setting up a new independent procedure to fairly resolve outstanding complaints. One shadow cabinet minister, who called it “a Clause IV moment for Keir”, added: “I hadn’t expected Keir to be so strong in criticising those who deny antisemitism. It was the obvious clap line for those in the party who have been worried about the issue. Once he’d said that, the party had little choice but to act.” Another senior Labour MP said Corbyn’s suspension had been inevitable given his response to the report: “Jeremy showed absolutely no contrition or acknowledgement of his role and the role of his staff and supporters in causing this tidal wave of antisemitism. Keir had no option. The bit where Jeremy says the problem was overstated for political reasons is just echoing antisemitic conspiracy theories.” The MP said that even without the statement, some sort of showdown with Corbyn would have probably taken place: “A line had to be drawn beneath this, and the report is pretty clear that his office, his staff, his general secretary meddled in these inquiries.” The EHRC report found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cited “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. However, Corbyn said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media,” he said. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” Rayner said the former party leader had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem, adding that she was “deeply upset by the circumstances, and upset that Jeremy wasn’t able to see the pain that the Jewish community have gone through”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the mood at shadow cabinet on Thursday had been sombre. “It was not a decision anyone took any pleasure in, least of all Keir. I could not see any other reaction other than absolutely sadness.” She said that the party was closely monitoring Labour members’ and officials’ social media accounts over the coming days and would take action against any further antisemitism. “We will proactively investigate, we will not be passive about this, racism is a cancer, it is a poison,” she said. “Once it is allowed to enter an institution, it poisons everything that it touches, and so we are going to be proactive about this.” John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, described Corbyn’s suspension as “profoundly wrong”. “On the day we should all be moving forward and taking all steps to fight antisemitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong,” he tweeted. “In [the] interests of party unity, let’s find a way of undoing and resolving this. I urge all party members to stay calm as that is the best way to support Jeremy and each other. Let’s all call upon the leadership to lift this suspension.” The grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum called the suspension “a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity”."
2020-10-29T19:30:30Z,politics,Politics,From MacDonald to Corbyn: a history of Labour leaders who ran afoul of the party,"Jeremy Corbyn already had a special place in the political record books. His more than 600 career Commons votes against Labour make him easily the most rebellious backbench MP ever to become a party leader. But Corbyn’s suspension from the party he led until April this year is a spectacular new first. No former Labour leader in history has ever been suspended from the party. However, if Corbyn’s suspension – which he has said he will “strongly contest” – leads to his eventual expulsion, he will share a fate with a very different former Labour leader, in the shape of Ramsay MacDonald. The two men and the two cases could hardly be more different. Corbyn has spent his career as a man of the Labour left, mostly on the back benches. MacDonald was expelled from Labour in 1931, when, as a Labour prime minister, he formed a National Government with Conservative and Liberal support in the face of the economic depression and surge in unemployment that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash. Although a handful of Labour MPs followed MacDonald into the National Government in August 1931, the majority elected Arthur Henderson to succeed him and went into opposition. MacDonald nevertheless remained a member of the Labour party for another month, even as prime minister, before the Labour national executive finally expelled him “automatically and immediately” in September 1931. He instantly became the most vilified figure in Labour history, serving as prime minister for another four years until 1935. He died during a sea voyage in November 1937. The only other Labour leader to run afoul of the party in a comparable way was Michael Foot, the leader from 1980-83. Like Corbyn, Foot spent the bulk of his long parliamentary career – he was first elected in 1945 – as a leftwing backbench rebel. Foot, like Corbyn this week, eventually lost the Labour whip for his frequent revolts. In March 1961 he voted against the party line over air force spending, and was expelled from the parliamentary Labour group. Foot only regained the whip after the election of Harold Wilson as Labour leader in February 1963. Stafford Cripps, Clement Attlee’s chancellor of the exchequer from 1947-50, is the only postwar holder of the one of the great ministerial offices to have actually been expelled from Labour. That happened in 1939, when Cripps, then the MP for Bristol South-East (later the constituency of Tony Benn), advocated a “popular front” electoral strategy with the Communist and Liberal parties and with anti-Appeasement Conservatives. He rejoined Labour in 1945. No Conservative leader of modern times has ever been expelled from the party. Iain Duncan Smith, leader from 2001-03, probably came closest, as a serial backbench rebel over Europe during the premiership of John Major in the 1990s. Much the most senior Conservatives to lose the party whip in recent years were the former chancellors of the exchequer Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond and the former home secretary Amber Rudd, who were among more than 20 Tory MPs punished for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit in September 2019. In the current parliament, elected in December 2019, Corbyn is the second Labour MP to lose the party whip. He joins Claudia Webbe, who lost the whip pending a court appearance next month in a harassment case. Webbe has not been expelled from the Labour party. Other “independent” MPs in the current parliament now include Julian Lewis, who lost the Conservative whip after becoming chair of the Commons intelligence and security committee with Labour support earlier this year, and the former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier, who lost the whip for travelling from Glasgow to London and back after testing positive for Covid-19."
2020-10-29T18:44:23Z,politics,Politics,Antisemitism report opens up Labour's fault line all over again | John Crace,"The report into antisemitism in the Labour party was more damning than expected. As well as finding the Labour leadership guilty of political interference in the handling of complaints, the Equality and Human Rights Commission found specific examples of harassment and discrimination. “But equally of concern,” it added, “was a lack of leadership within the Labour party on these issues, which is hard to reconcile with its stated commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.” The EHRC concluded that the Labour party could have tackled antisemitism more effectively if the leadership had chosen to do so. Jeremy Corbyn’s almost instantaneous Facebook response was rather more expected. Much ado about nothing. After acknowledging there had been antisemitism in the Labour party, though no more than in society at large, and that one racist in the party was one too many, came the big “buts”. But he had been trying to deal with it, but was frustrated by party bureaucracy. But the problem had been grossly overstated by the media and opponents for political advantage. In fact it had been almost entirely down to the media falsely reporting true allegations that he had lost the last election. It was almost as if the only antisemitism he had witnessed during his time as party leader – not that he had personally witnessed any – had been a little, light recreational racism. You could feel the former Labour leader just itching to mention Boris Johnson’s comments on Muslim women looking like letterboxes and other examples of Tory Islamophobia. Hell, no one had ever done more to fight racism in all its forms than him, but no leader could be expected to keep tabs on everything at the same time as creating a new socialist utopia. Give him a break. Keir Starmer looked like a man under the cosh as he gave his own press conference. This was by far his worst day since he had become Labour leader. Dealing with Boris and the Tories was child’s play compared with this. In a short statement, Starmer said this was a day of shame for Labour. He unreservedly accepted all the EHRC findings and would implement them in full. It was what the Labour leader didn’t say that was causing him the most pain. Because what Starmer was doing his best to avoid was acknowledging that he had served in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and had backed him at last December’s general election. All of which was, well, potentially embarrassing. He was more or less in the clear so far as the allegations made against the leader of the opposition’s office were concerned because everyone had always known that Corbyn never consulted Starmer on anything of any sensitivity or importance. But backing Corbyn to win the last election was rather more problematic, because Starmer couldn’t very well tell the truth and say that he had never shared his values and that the only reason he had pretended to do so was because he knew Corbyn was heading for a big defeat. And if every centrist MP had bailed out of the Labour party to join the doomed Change UK, then there would have been no one credible left to take over as leader when Corbyn was inevitably forced to stand down. In which case Labour would have been out of power for even longer. Those were the kind of personal moral compromises that every successful politician had to make but couldn’t be spoken out loud. Especially on a day when the morality of the Labour party itself was under the spotlight. So Starmer merely stared anxiously into the middle distance and sucked up Labour’s existential guilt while carefully sidestepping any complicity of his own. Naturally, most questions centred on what Starmer planned to do about Corbyn, and these too were treated with a similar level of evasion. These were matters, he insisted, that should be dealt with after a proper period of reflection and internal investigation. Except they couldn’t. Corbyn’s refusal to accept the EHRC report in full rather put paid to that, and so by lunchtime Starmer had been forced to withdraw the whip and suspend his predecessor from the party. If Change UK had won any seats, Corbyn would now have been free to sit next to all the MPs he had driven out of the party as an independent. Within an hour or so, Corbyn had upped the ante once more by posting on Twitter: “I will strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me,” while again insisting there wasn’t a racist bone in his body. He followed this up with a short broadcast clip, urging Labour members not to give up on the fight for social justice – and not to believe everything in the EHRC report. This was Starmer’s worst nightmare and he could only release another statement insisting the party was right to suspend Corbyn but that the investigation into his actions must be fully independent. At a time when Labour should be focused on the government’s incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, the party was tearing itself apart again. Momentum and other Corbyn supporters were treating their man as a saint, martyred in the pursuit of pure socialism, while the rest of the party was desperately trying to find a way to move on from an issue that had festered for years. Rather than being an end to the matter, the EHRC report had once again split the party on tribal lines. Boris must be unable to believe his luck."
2020-10-29T17:06:21Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit talks making good progress, says Ursula Von der Leyen","Trade and security negotiations between the UK and the EU are making good progress, Ursula von der Leyen has said in the most optimistic comments to date on the state of the Brexit talks. As the negotiations moved to Brussels after seven days in London, the European commission president said: “We’re making good progress but [there are] two critical issues: level playing field and the fisheries, [where] we would like to see more progress. “We are in very close contact on an hourly basis because the negotiations now have been intensified … There are 11 other fields of files that have to be negotiated.” her comments come after Downing Street said last week that the talks were over. The outstanding issues are the level of access to British waters the UK will provide to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business, including rules on domestic subsidies, and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. Von der Leyen, who was speaking after a meeting with the Canadian prime minster, Justin Trudeau, said the negotiators would work deep into the issue of how to construct a dispute mechanism that would allow either side to suspend parts of the deal in the event of a clear breach of obligations. The European council president, Charles Michel, said the state of the talks would probably assessed next week with Brussels hoping to start the ratification process in mid-November. The comments will be warmly welcomed by Boris Johnson after a stormy few weeks. Trudeau also spoke positively about rolling over the current terms of the trade deal Canada has with the EU to ensure the UK continues to benefit after the transition period. Under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada, 95% of the imports covered are tariff and quota-free.
Trudeau said: “There have been many discussions over the past years between myself and Prime Minister Johnson and his predecessor on that seamless transition, on a rollover of the CETA between Canada and the EU, to be the basis for a Canada-UK free trade agreement that would allow certainty for Canadian and British companies going into the future. “I think you’ve heard that there are significant complexities that the UK is grappling with in terms of negotiating the post Brexit agreement with the EU. I can highlight that it’s fairly straightforward with Canada and we are certainly very optimistic in the ability to see things roll over smoothly.”"
2020-10-29T15:16:45Z,politics,Politics,Antisemitism in Labour: what did the report find and what happens next?,"What is the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)? Often referred to as the UK’s human rights watchdog, it is an independent body with a unique set of legal powers to enforce equality laws, eliminate discrimination, reduce inequality and protect human rights. It was established in 2007 by a Labour government following a merger of the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Was the investigation into failings over antisemitism in the Labour party unusual? Yes. The EHRC has never before embarked upon a statutory inquiry into a major political party. Labour is only the second political party to be investigated by it: in 2009, the EHRC launched legal action against the British National party over concerns about ethnic restrictions on its membership. What were the terms of the inquiry into Labour and antisemitism? After receiving hundreds of complaints from Jewish party members alleging either antisemitism or a failure to investigate allegations on antisemitism, the EHRC launched an inquiry in May 2019.
It aimed to establish whether Labour had broken the law by failing to implement recommendations from Lady Royall, the home affairs select committee and the Chakrabarti report to stem antisemitism in the party; whether the rule book and the party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes enabled it to deal with complaints; and whether the party had responded properly to complaints of unlawful acts. How did the EHRC carry out the investigation? It received evidence from the Jewish Labour Movement, the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Jewish Voice for Labourand whistleblowers. EHRC investigators analysed a sample of 70 complaints of antisemitism made against Labour party members including 12 complaints put forward by the Labour party. Most of the sample of complaints related to conduct on social media, reflecting the predominance of that type of complaint overall. However, it also included conduct at meetings and events and comments made to the media. What did it conclude? The EHRC found that Labour was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act (2010) relating to political interference in antisemitism complaints; a failure to provide adequate training to those handling antisemitism complaints; and harassment. The failure relating to political interference “mainly came from the opposition’s office”, the EHRC found, and this was “not a legitimate approach”. The interference applied to a third of the 70 case files reviewed. What is the reputation of the EHRC? The EHRC has been dogged by problems including internal rows and a lack of funds. Since David Cameron came to power in 2010, its budget has been cut from £63m to less than £17.4m. It has often been portrayed as toothless by equality campaigners, or a “politically correct” liberal institute by those on the right. It was recently criticised by the Muslim Council of Britain for failing to launch an inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party. A report last year from the Commons women and equalities committee called on the EHRC to “overcome its timidity” and “refocus its work”. What happens next? The Labour party has been served with an unlawful act notice. It has until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement the recommendations, which is legally enforceable by a court if not fulfilled."
2020-10-29T14:49:04Z,politics,Politics,Labour suspends Jeremy Corbyn over EHRC report comments,"Labour has suspended its former leader Jeremy Corbyn after he said antisemitism in the party was “overstated” following a damning report from the equality watchdog. The move is likely to ignite a civil war in the party between the leader, Keir Starmer, and Corbyn-supporting MPs. Corbyn condemned his suspension as a “political intervention” and said he would “strongly contest” the action. The suspension was provoked by a statement from Corbyn that rejected the overall conclusions of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, saying the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. That statement set the former Labour leader directly at odds with his successor. Moments after Corbyn’s statement was released, Starmer spoke at a press conference where he said those who “deny there is a problem are part of the problem … Those who pretend it is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem.” The decision to suspend Corbyn was taken by the party’s disciplinary unit, rather than Starmer, who saw the statement just moments before he was due to give a press conference on the report. Multiple Labour sources said there was a sense of shock in the headquarters at Corbyn’s statement. Asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, Starmer told reporters that he would “look carefully” at his predecessor’s comments. Two hours later, the party suspended Corbyn and withdrew the Labour whip. A Labour spokesman said: “In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation. He has also had the whip removed from the parliamentary Labour party.”
The EHRC report found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cites “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. However, Corbyn said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” After his suspension, Corbyn said he would “strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me” – suggesting he believed it was done on Starmer’s direct orders. “I’ve made absolutely clear those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong. I will continue to support a zero tolerance policy towards all forms of racism.” Labour’s former deputy leader Harriet Harman said Corbyn’s suspension was the right thing to do. “If you say that AS [antisemitism] exaggerated for factional reasons you minimise it and are, as Keir Starmer says, part of the problem,” she tweeted. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, who was promoted to the shadow cabinet under Corbyn, said the former party leader had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem. “I’m devastated that it’s come to this. Today should be about really listening, reading and taking in the report,” she said. Rayner rejected the idea that the issue had been exaggerated for partisan reasons, saying people should read the EHRC report: “I think that brings shame on us, and there’s no mitigation of that, and we have to acknowledge that and do something about it.” Rayner said she was “deeply, deeply upset by the circumstances, and upset that Jeremy wasn’t able to see the pain that the Jewish community have gone through. “Jeremy is a fully decent man, but as Margaret Hodge said, he has an absolute blind spot, and a denial, when it comes to these issues. And that’s devastating.”
John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, described Corbyn’s suspension as “profoundly wrong”. “On the day we should all be moving forward & taking all steps to fight anti-Semitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong,” he tweeted. “In interests of party unity let’s find a way of undoing & resolving this. “I urge all party members to stay calm as that is the best way to support Jeremy and each other. Let’s all call upon the leadership to lift this suspension.” Before Corbyn’s suspension, Peter Mason, the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), said Corbyn and Starmer’s words spoke for themselves and were clearly at odds. “Jeremy Corbyn does not have a future in the Labour party, he is yesterday’s man.”
Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and JLM’s parliamentary chair, said Corbyn “sat at the centre of a party that enabled antisemitism to spread from the fringes to the mainstream”. Pressed on whether he should remain in the party or face action after his statement, Hodge said Corbyn was now irrelevant to the party. “There is an absolutely entrenched cultural challenge, and diverting it into somebody who is irrelevant in the Labour party today … it just doesn’t matter,” she said. “What matters are the commitments that Keir Starmer gave today. Jeremy is part of the past. I want to move on.” Corbyn said that when he took over as Labour leader in 2015, “the party’s processes for handling complaints were not fit for purpose”. He added: “Reform was then stalled by an obstructive party bureaucracy.” He argued that from 2018 the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, and his officials “made substantial improvements, making it much easier and swifter to remove antisemites. My team acted to speed up, not hinder, the process.” He said: “Anyone claiming there is no antisemitism in the Labour party is wrong. Of course there is, as there is throughout society, and sometimes it is voiced by people who think of themselves as on the left. Jewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.”"
2020-10-29T14:45:39Z,politics,Politics,Key findings of the EHRC inquiry into Labour antisemitism,"The Labour party could have tackled antisemitism more effectively “if the leadership had chosen to do so”, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) concluded as part of its 130-page investigation released on Thursday. The watchdog also found that Labour breached the Equality Act in two cases – relating to the former London mayor Ken Livingstone and a borough councillor, Pam Bromley – “by committing unlawful harassment” against Jewish people. Here is a breakdown of some of the key findings. Labour leadership “We found specific examples of harassment, discrimination and political interference in our evidence,” the EHRC said in its foreword, adding: “But equally of concern was a lack of leadership within the Labour party on these issues, which is hard to reconcile with its stated commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.” No individuals are named as being responsible by the watchdog. Instead, the report criticises the party hierarchy broadly for failing to take decisive action, despite what it says are “recent improvements” in handling complaints. “Although some improvements have been made to the process for dealing with antisemitism complaints, it is hard not to conclude that antisemitism within the Labour party could have been tackled more effectively if the leadership had chosen to do so,” the report states. Interference in the complaints process The EHRC concludes that “there was political interference in the handling of antisemitism complaints”, which it said was part of a “wider practice” of the leader of the opposition’s office getting involved “in disciplinary cases that were deemed ‘politically sensitive’”. It reviewed 70 complaint files between March 2016 and May 2019 and concluded that there were 23 instances of political interference by staff from the leader’s office and others. “These included clear examples of interference at various stages throughout the complaint-handling process, including in decisions on whether to investigate and whether to suspend,” the EHRC said. As a result, the equality watchdog concluded this “was indirectly discriminatory and unlawful” and it held that the Labour party was legally responsible for it. The Corbyn mural complaint There was “political interference” in decisions about whether to investigate complaints, the EHRC said, citing the example of a complaint made in April 2018 about Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously posted a statement in support of an artist who had produced an antisemitic mural in the East End of London. Staff from Corbyn’s office called for the case to be dismissed, emailing the party’s governance and legal unit, which was responsible for complaints. The email said: “The complaint itself seems to fall well below the threshold required for investigation and if so surely the decision to dismiss it can be taken now.” Staff from Corbyn’s office also “amended and approved” the written response to the complainant “to include details on Jeremy Corbyn’s actions in relation to the mural” even though Labour’s stated process excluded staff from the leader’s office becoming involved in complaints. Ken Livingstone case Labour breached the Equality Act in two cases, the EHRC said, when its agents were engaged in “committing unlawful harassment”, including using “antisemitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of antisemitism were fake or smears”. One was the case of Livingstone, who in April 2016 sought to defend a Labour MP, Naz Shah, who had reposted a Facebook image suggesting that Israel be relocated to the United States. At the time, Livingstone was a member of Labour’s national executive committee and so, according to the EHRC, an agent of the party. “Ken Livingstone repeatedly denied that these posts were antisemitic,” the EHRC said. “In his denial, Ken Livingstone alleged that scrutiny of Naz Shah’s conduct was part of a smear campaign by ‘the Israel lobby’ to stigmatise critics of Israel as antisemitic, and was intended to undermine and disrupt the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn MP.” In conclusion, the EHRC said Shah’s comments “went beyond legitimate criticism of the Israeli government” and were not protected by rights to free expression. “Neither is Ken Livingstone’s support for those comments,” the EHRC added. Emails show many examples of interference in Livingstone’s case, the EHRC said. In April 2018, two years after his original comments, members of the party’s governance and legal unit (GLU) “sought the green light” from staff at the leader’s office to conduct a disciplinary interview with the former mayor. Leader’s office staff agreed that “there was no option but to authorise the interview”. One staff member, Laura Murray, commented: “We have let the Ken case drag on for far too long already and, if GLU leak to the press that we have held up this investigation of him, it will look beyond awful.” Livingstone had been suspended from the party in April 2016. He resigned in May 2018 before the internal investigation against him concluded. Pam Bromley case The watchdog also examined the case of Pam Bromley, a Labour councillor in Rossendale, Lancashire. She made “numerous statements” on Facebook between April 2018 and December 2019 that the EHRC said amounted to “unwanted conduct related to Jewish ethnicity” and “had the effect of harassing Labour party members”. On 15 December 2019, she posted on Facebook about Jeremy Corbyn: “My major criticism of him – his failure to repel the fake accusations of antisemitism in the LP [Labour party] – may not be repeated as the accusations may probably now magically disappear, now capitalism has got what it wanted.” Bromley, who had been suspended from the party in April 2018, was expelled by Labour in February 2020. Inconsistent social media policy The EHRC said that of the 70 complaints of antisemitism it investigated, the vast majority – 59 – concerned social media. Labour also had a policy, although it was applied inconsistently, of not investigating complaints about likes or shares of antisemitic content on social media until “mid-2018”, the report said. That meant “repeated sharing of antisemitic material could have escaped investigation, even where it could have amounted to a breach of the party’s conduct rule or unlawful harassment or discrimination”. Labour “has now acknowledged that its policy was wrong”, the EHRC added. Borderline cases A further “18 more borderline harassment cases” were identified in the sample of 70 studied by the EHRC. But typically “there was not enough evidence to determine whether the Labour party was legally responsible” because, for example, the person was not an elected representative or candidate. These were cases involving social media posts that “diminished the scale or significance of the Holocaust” or “compared Israelis to Hitler or the Nazis”, or “referenced conspiracies about the Rothschilds and Jewish power and control” or “accused British Jews of greater loyalty to Israel than Britain”, among others. Cooperation with Labour The watchdog indicated that its relations with Labour were not always smooth as it worked through its investigation from its formal beginning in May 2019. It said that while Labour had said it was “keen to engage”, the EHRC “encountered a number of delays in receiving information”. “At times, we were seriously concerned about the party’s commitment to working with us and to dedicating enough resources to the matter,” the EHRC said, although this seems to have resolved itself after a meeting with the former general secretary, Jennie Formby, in November 2019."
2020-10-29T13:31:01Z,politics,Politics,"Labour responsible for harassment and discrimination, EHRC antisemitism inquiry finds","The Labour party broke equalities law including harassment and discrimination over antisemitism in the party, an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has found. In a long-awaited report, the EHRC said there were “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. It said Labour under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act, connected to harassment, political interference in antisemitism complaints and inadequate training for those handling the complaints. The EHRC’s lead investigator, Alasdair Henderson, said the failure of leadership must ultimately stop with Corbyn. “As the leader of the party at the time, and given the extent of the failings we found in the political interference within the leader of the opposition’s office, Jeremy Corbyn is ultimately accountable and responsible for what happened at that time,” Henderson said. The inquiry found that antisemitic comments by Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, and Pam Bromley, a councillor in Rossendale, Lancashire, amounted to harassment of Jewish members under law, and this was “only the tip of the iceberg” of such behaviour.
The EHRC uncovered what it said was inappropriate interference in the complaints process over antisemitism by staff from Corbyn’s office, with 23 instances found, including staff exerting influence on decisions on areas such as member suspensions or whether to investigate claims. Some of these decisions were made “because of likely press interest rather than any formal criteria”, it said. While there was a wider culture of political interference in certain complaints, the report said this occurred more often in antisemitism cases, and was thus found to be discriminatory and unlawful. Henderson said the EHRC had faced significant obstruction under the previous leadership. “There were times in late summer, early autumn last year where we were seriously concerned about their commitments to work with us and had to push quite hard on them,” he told a briefing. He said the situation improved after a meeting with the then general secretary, Jennie Formby, but placed the blame for the report’s delay at Labour’s door. He said the obstruction was “very disappointing given the party’s stated zero tolerance of antisemitism and the initial commitment to working with us”. In response to the report, three of the UK’s main Jewish organisations – the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Community Security Trust – said in a joint statement the EHRC’s findings were “a damning verdict on what Labour did to Jews under Jeremy Corbyn and his allies”. Citing examples of poor practice in dealing with complaints about antisemitism, the EHRC said an email inbox for these “was largely left unmonitored for a number of years and no action taken on the majority of complaints forwarded to it”. Of 70 files reviewed for the inquiry, 62 had records missing. The inquiry found that this element of indirect discrimination against Jewish members – the lack of a proper complaints and disciplinary procedure – lasted until August 2020, four months into Keir Starmer’s tenure, but was now being addressed. The report details comments by Livingstone and Bromley that it says amounted to unlawful harassment because they were found to have antisemitic themes or suggested complaints about antisemitism were faked or smears. It notes that Bromley made repeated Facebook posts with antisemitic themes, for example defending references to the Rothschild banking group, and complaining about a “fog of fake accusations of antisemitism” and calling herself the victim of a “witch-hunt”. Complaints were made about her in May 2017, but Bromley was only suspended from the party in April 2018, a day after an article in the Times about her comments. On Livingstone and Bromley, the report says: “As these people were acting as agents of the Labour party, the Labour party was legally responsible for their conduct. In each case, the EHRC considered the perception of those affected by the conduct, and Labour party members told the EHRC that the comments contributed to a hostile environment for Jewish and non-Jewish members.” The EHRC said these two cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”, with 18 other instances where there was not enough evidence for a legal conclusion that the party was responsible for the conduct, covering councillors, candidates and constituency party officials. It said there were “many more files” showing evidence of antisemitic conduct by a member who did not have a party role, meaning Labour could not be deemed responsible for them. The report makes 11 recommendations, including an independent complaints process and clearer rules, an acknowledgment of the prior political interference and proper training for those involved in handling complaints. The joint statement from the three Jewish groups said the report “proves why British Jews were so distressed and it disgraces those who attacked us for speaking out against anti-Jewish racism”. The Jewish Labour Movement, which was among the groups that referred the party to the EHRC, said blame for what happened “lies firmly with those who held positions of leadership – those who possessed both power and influence to prevent the growth of anti-Jewish racism”. It said: “Antisemitism within the Labour party had serious consequences for many people, causing real emotional pain and despair to those who have given their lives to the Labour party. As the EHRC points out, it undermines confidence in our politics and the fabric of our democracy. “It will now be for the Labour party to set out how they intend to eradicate anti-Jewish racism from our party. This will in part be achieved by implementing the legally binding actions set out of the EHRC’s report in full and without delay.” Gideon Falter, the chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “The EHRC’s report utterly vindicates Britain’s Jews, who were accused of lying and exaggerating, acting as agents of another country and using their religion to ‘smear’ the Labour party.” Caroline Waters, the interim chair of the EHRC, said: “The Labour party made a commitment to zero tolerance for antisemitism. Our investigation has highlighted multiple areas where its approach and leadership to tackling antisemitism was insufficient. This is inexcusable and appeared to be a result of a lack of willingness to tackle antisemitism rather than an inability to do so.” The review was launched in 2019 after party whistleblowers alleged Labour was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints, and within local party structures."
2020-10-29T13:10:44Z,politics,Politics,Commons dismisses sexual assault claims against ex-MP Ross Thomson,"A Commons inquiry has dismissed sexual assault allegations made by a Labour MP against Ross Thomson, Boris Johnson’s former Scottish campaign manager, it has been reported. Paul Sweeney, who later lost his Glasgow North East seat in December 2019, alleged that Thomson drunkenly tried to fondle his genitals and forced a hand down his trousers in a Commons bar in 2018. Sweeney went public with his complaints a month before the general election, resulting in Thomson standing down as the Scottish Conservative candidate for Aberdeen South, the seat he had won at the 2017 election. He has always denied any wrongdoing. The parliamentary commissioner for standards has concluded that Thomson’s behaviour was not sexual in nature and cleared him of any breach of parliament’s misconduct policy, according to the Times. Sweeney said he could not comment for legal reasons. He has the right to appeal against the decision, which would be heard by an independent expert panel. Kathryn Stone, the commissioner, found that witness accounts did not support the allegations, the Times reports, and that while it was “entirely possible that discreet contact might not have been observed by others, Mr Sweeney’s account was of behaviour that was highly unlikely to have gone unnoticed by others in the immediate vicinity”. Stone reportedly said she was “concerned that the detail of Mr Sweeney’s account has changed, with new elements introduced over time, some of which have not been substantiated”, and added: “I cannot safely conclude that this complaint presents as a malicious one.” Sweeney submitted his complaint a few weeks after a separate allegation of “sexual touching” was made against Thomson, which had resulted in the police being called to the same bar, and about five months after the date of the alleged assault against him. No formal complaint was made to police in the earlier incident and no further action was taken. The commissioner reportedly found Sweeney’s explanation that he only raised the complaint when he thought Thomson might be a serial offender to be “plausible”. Speaking to the Times, Thomson said he believed his sexuality had influenced abuse that was directed towards him after the complaints were made public. He said: “If you look at other politicians who have had allegations against them … I can’t think of a politician who received more personal abuse than I did at the time. My only conclusion is that because I was gay I got more. Maybe that’s wrong but it’s how I feel.”"
2020-10-29T11:38:38Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn rejects overall findings of EHRC report on antisemitism in Labour,"Jeremy Corbyn has rejected the overall conclusions of a report on antisemitism in Labour, saying the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media – a statement that sets him at odds with Keir Starmer. In a Facebook post responding to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report, which found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism, the former Labour leader said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. However, he expressed regret that “it took longer to deliver that change than it should”. The report does not lay blame directly with Corbyn but the EHRC’s lead investigator, Alasdair Henderson, said the failure of leadership must ultimately stop with him. “As the leader of the party at the time, and given the extent of the failings we found in the political interference within the leader of the opposition’s office, Jeremy Corbyn is ultimately accountable and responsible for what happened at that time,” Henderson said. Corbyn’s argument that the problem was exaggerated for factional reasons places him on a potential collision path with Starmer, who said in his response to the report that those who made such arguments were “part of the problem”. Asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, Starmer told reporters he would “look carefully” at his predecessor’s comments. Corbyn said in his statement: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” The EHRC launched its inquiry after complaints about antisemitism within Labour during Corbyn’s time as leader. The report cites “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. Corbyn said that when he took over as Labour leader in 2015, “the party’s processes for handling complaints were not fit for purpose”. He added: “Reform was then stalled by an obstructive party bureaucracy.” Corbyn argued that from 2018 the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, and his officials “made substantial improvements, making it much easier and swifter to remove antisemites. My team acted to speed up, not hinder the process.”

Of course there is, as there is throughout society, and sometimes it is voiced by people who think of themselves as on the left. Jewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.” In a separate response, Formby also said the party had sought to speed up the process of dealing with complaints about antisemitism, while accepting mistakes. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative, we brought reforms to conference which were passed by Labour members and affiliates that enabled rapid expulsions,” she said. “Mistakes were made along the way, and of course I wish we could have made the reforms more quickly, although some of them required rule changes which are necessarily slow. “But the record shows that as a result of the changes we made, Labour’s previously unfit processes were transformed, becoming more rapid, robust and more independent than any other political party.” Calling on Starmer to implement the EHRC’s recommendations, she said: “I hope that this continued work can rebuild relations with the Jewish community and mend the hurt and pain that has been caused.”"
2020-10-29T11:13:41Z,politics,Politics,Jewish Labour councillors who led EHRC antisemitism process tell of mental toll,"More than 70 whistleblowers consisting of current or former Labour staff, MPs and officials submitted testimony on antisemitism to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, as part of a coordinated effort by two Jewish Labour councillors who say the process has left them traumatised. The Guardian can reveal that two of the whistleblowers were offered physical security, guidance against potential cyber-attacks, legal advice and counselling as part of a concerted effort to collect widespread evidence of antisemitism across the party. The two councillors from the Jewish Labour Movement received 800 pieces of submitted evidence from Labour members of their experiences in the party, which included posters of Donald Trump being left on members’ lawns and threats of violence. Both Adam Langleben, a former Labour councillor in Barnet, north London, and Peter Mason, who remains a councillor in Ealing, west London, say the experience of submitting evidence to the EHRC cost them their mental wellbeing.
Mason and Langleben said they had initially tried to work with the then Labour leadership and be a bridge between the party and the Jewish community. However, they described losing faith in the leadership’s ability to take antisemitism seriously after Jeremy Corbyn’s defence of an antisemitic mural was revealed in 2018, leading to a protest by members of the Jewish community outside parliament. Mason said he was visiting the attraction Thorpe Park, watching a video on his phone of an apology by Corbyn that he felt he could not accept, when he decided to change tack. “I knew any attempt to try to win them over to the argument that the community was making was just over,” he said. After a slew of new antisemitism allegations and frustration at the party’s response, a decision was taken to gather evidence for a possible EHRC referral using the JLM website to call for member submissions. The initial referral to the equalities watchdog was made by a separate group – the Campaign Against Antisemitism – but Mason said they were worried the referral would need to solely rely on public statements and social media, rather than the insider experiences of Jewish members and Labour staff, which only a Labour-affiliated group could reach. “We were desperately concerned about the EHRC basically wading into a political fight,” Mason said. “Are they really going to launch an investigation into the Labour party, a potential future government? So let’s spend some time at least figuring out if we’ve got an argument.” Langleben took charge of filtering more than 800 submissions, saying the majority met the threshold for antisemitism. “What we felt was unique was the experience of Jewish members in physical meetings and the interactions with officers.” Mason said it was important for them to stress in their submission to the watchdog that it was not a case of anonymous trolling on Twitter. “There’s been a lot of discussion about dossiers of screengrabs of Twitter and Facebook, that crowded out arguments we were making about people’s real lived experiences,” he said. “People would speak out in CLP meetings about antisemitism, and then would find images of Trump being left on their lawn.” The initial referral to the EHRC had one whistleblower statement, from a member of staff who worked inside Corbyn’s office, and about 500 pages of supporting evidence from witness statements. JLM began to crowdfund for legal advice in early 2019 but also received what they described as “kind” help from lawyers at Mishcon de Reya who were “invested in it.” After the EHRC formally launched its investigation in May 2019, Mason said they began to have “discreet conversations with what turned out to be a significant number of whistleblowers … who felt they needed to break the silence over the extent of antisemitism, but also defend their own positions in what had or hadn’t happened previously”. Eight former Labour staffers went public in a BBC Panorama documentary later that year, alleging consistent interference from the leader’s office in antisemitism disciplinary cases, which allies of Corbyn strongly deny. That prompted a flood of contacts from Labour HQ, from people who said they felt “duty-bound” to speak to the investigation. Langleben and Mason said whistleblowers who contacted them about giving evidence to the EHRC were offered legal advice, counselling and physical security. “We do have a member in south London who was physically assaulted,” he said. Mason said he and Langleben would often play roles of “good cop, bad cop” with whistleblowers who told them their stories. “Adam had left [Labour] and I’d stayed; I was in a very deep and dark place, and Adam probably felt liberated. I ended up just displacing a lot of my anger. “We’re constantly asking ourselves the question: by offering a package of support to whistleblowers, are we leading people to give us incorrect testimony? So we were like dogs with bones, trying to make sure that we always got to the actual proper truth.” Langleben lost his council seat in the 2018 local elections, blaming Labour antisemitism fears among voters in north London, and left the party the following year, partly in solidarity with Luciana Berger, the MP who quit Labour over antisemitism, joining Change UK and then the Lib Dems before losing her seat. “I think the anguish inside of me got to the point where actually I [could] no longer justify to myself remaining,” he said. Mason remains a Labour member, saying he felt the good he was doing on the council “building houses, enabling people to have decent incomes” was a key factor, as well as his responsibility to Jewish members. “I basically traded that responsibility to Jewish members for my mental health,” he said. “There is this unrelenting pressure in your local party that you are evil, you’re not really Labour, you’re doing a disservice to Labour, because you have the temerity to speak about antisemitism, that continued well beyond the election.” Both feel the party has much further to go beyond just accepting the recommendation of the EHRC. “It’s going to be how [the Labour leader] Keir Starmer deals with the community more broadly, but also the party politically and the culture,” Mason said. “If Labour conference were to convene today, with the same delegates from 2019, there’s not a single recommendation that the EHRC could make that would survive conference floor.”"
2020-10-29T09:51:37Z,politics,Politics,"National lockdowns should be backup plan on Covid, says WHO envoy","National lockdowns should be used only as a “reserve” measure to control coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid. Dr David Nabarro said “circuit breakers” should not be a “primary measure” for tackling the spread of Covid, as France prepares for its next national lockdown and Germany introduces tighter national measures. The UK government continues to say it will do “everything we can” to avoid a national lockdown, despite pressure from its own advisers to impose one. A leaked document produced by modellers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) found that under a “reasonable worst-case scenario”, 85,000 people could die from a second Covid wave, and 356,000 people could be hospitalised. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Nabarro, a British doctor, suggested that while lockdown restrictions in the north of England appeared to be slowing the spread of the virus in some places, cases were rising in the south where household mixing is still allowed in many places. Local action in the north had led to “a sort of levelling up, and southern parts of the UK are speeding up,” said Nabarro. But he cautioned against a full national lockdown, describing it as “a very extreme restriction on economic and social life” that temporarily “freezes the virus in place”. He said: “You don’t want to use those as your primary, and I stress that, primary, means of containment. Because in the end living with the virus as a constant threat means maintaining the capacity to find people with the disease and isolating them.” Building a robust test, trace and isolate system must remain the priority for all governments, said Nabarro, “with lockdown still the reserve that you use to take the heat out of the system when things are really bad”. In media interviews on Thursday morning, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, accepted that coronavirus rates were in a “bad place” all over the country but said the government was resisting calls for another national lockdown. He told Sky News: “We will continue with our localised but proportionate approach on taking action where the virus is strongest, but you can see from those figures that the virus is in a bad place in all parts of the country. “The approach of trying to bear down on it where it is most concentrated I think continues to be the best way forward because despite the fact the virus is rising across the country, it is very concentrated in some places nonetheless.” Dr Mike Tildesley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, who is on the committee that produced Sage’s worst-case scenario for the coming winter, said urgent action was needed to slow the spread of the virus. Stressing that the modelling was not a prediction but simply a way of working out what would be needed if things went very badly in the coming months, Tildesley said that on the current trajectory some areas had slightly higher caseloads than even the worst-case scenario. He told Today: “R is greater than 1 everywhere and if we don’t take urgent action, we are most likely to see that as we approach the festive period we are probably going to be in at least tier 2 pretty much everywhere in the country. So really we need to move away from these regional firefighting techniques to try to move to something more national.”"
2020-10-29T06:00:05Z,politics,Politics,Legal action taken against PM over refusal to investigate Kremlin meddling,"A cross-party group of MPs and peers including a former national security adviser are taking legal action against Boris Johnson over his government’s refusal to order an inquiry into Russian interference in UK elections. The group filed a claim in the high court in an attempt to force the prime minister to carry out an independent investigation or public inquiry. It is the first legal action of its kind over alleged national security failures.
The move follows the publication in July of the Russia report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). It found that the government and its intelligence services had failed to investigate Kremlin meddling in the 2016 EU referendum vote – a “hot potato”, as the ISC put it. The ISC urged Downing Street to carry out a full inquiry and to put in place a legislative framework to prevent future interference by foreign states. No 10 turned down the request. It argues there is no evidence of successful disruption by Moscow. The parliamentarians are now seeking a judicial review. They argue that the government’s inaction breaches its obligation under article three, protocol one of the European convention on human rights. This requires genuinely free elections to take place. The high court claim names Johnson as defendant. It is being backed by Lord Peter Ricketts, the government’s first national security adviser between 2010-12 under David Cameron, and the former chair of the joint intelligence committee (JIC). In a witness statement, Ricketts said he was “very surprised” the government had not sought evidence over Russian interference in the Brexit vote, nor carried out “a post-referendum assessment of Russian attempts to influence elections in the UK”. He added: “Given the importance of knowing the extent of past Russian interference in assessing the risk for future elections, I do not understand why the government would choose not to investigate.” Ricketts said there was a “considerable and growing body of evidence” that Moscow had actively interfered in other western elections, including the 2016 US presidential election and France’s 2017 presidential vote. Ensuring the integrity of British elections was a key national security issue, he said. Six peers and MPs have joined the claim. They include the Lib Dem Lord Strasburger, cross-bencher Baroness Wheatcroft, Labour’s Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and Alyn Smith, the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesperson. “The Russia report raised a series of deeply troubling questions,” Smith said. “We don’t know if the UK spy agencies were caught napping over Russian interference and didn’t take it seriously, or if the spooks were given tacit instruction [by politicians] not to look into this.”
Johnson refused to release the Russia report before last year’s general election. It found “credible evidence” the UK was a target for “political influence operations” and “disinformation campaigns” carried out by Vladimir Putin’s operatives. Details were hidden in a classified annex. Lord Strasburger described Lord Ricketts’ support for the action as “very significant”, stressing: “He was about as senior as it gets in the intelligence community and if he is worried about the government’s refusal to investigate, we all should be”. Baroness Wheatcroft, a former Conservative peer, called the government’s failure to investigate “shameful”. She said there was “no doubt that the internet has opened the way for widespread potential interference in the electoral process from malign forces and that Russia has tried to exploit that opportunity”. All the Citizens, a non-profit organisation, has joined the application. The government has 21 days to respond, with a hearing unlikely before spring."
2020-10-28T19:44:12Z,politics,Politics,Labour braces for damning ruling in EHRC antisemitism report,"Senior Labour figures are braced for the equalities watchdog to rule that the party acted unlawfully in its treatment of Jewish members, as a shadow cabinet minister said the antisemitism crisis was the most shameful in Labour’s history. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report is set to recommend an independent complaints system when the findings of its long-awaited inquiry are published on Thursday.
The inquiry’s conclusion will close a painful chapter in Labour’s history under Jeremy Corbyn, when it was accused of institutional antisemitism and MPs resigned amid recriminations over toxic factionalism within the party HQ. Corbyn is expected to make a statement after the report is made public, as is his successor as leader, Keir Starmer.
The EHRC is not expected to make direct recommendations that disciplinary action should be taken against high-profile individuals such as Corbyn. But sources close to the inquiry said an earlier draft report found evidence of indirect discrimination in the operation of the party’s processes, which would be a breach of equalities law. However, there are understood to have been multiple challenges to the draft report and the EHRC’s final conclusions have been kept under wraps. Starmer is likely to accept all of the report’s recommendations, though a legal challenge to the EHRC’s findings is planned by Jewish supporters of Corbyn if they disagree with its conclusions. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said on Wednesday the antisemitism crisis had been “a shameful period in our history, and we have to be clear that we are never going back to that, and we will do everything we can to repair relations with the Jewish community who are understandably and quite rightly hurt by the Labour party’s failure to deal with this in recent years”.
The EHRC launched the review in 2019 after whistleblowers alleged the party was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints, and within local party structures. The referral came from a number of Jewish groups including the Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Jewish Labour Movement. The final report, which is more than 100 pages long, has been closely guarded by the EHRC. It is one of the body’s most politically charged investigations to date. A draft report is known to have been shared with the Labour party in July, as well as with a small number of key figures from the Corbyn administration. Investigators have examined incidents involving the former Labour mayor of London Ken Livingstone and the former MP Chris Williamson, both of whom were suspended by the party on antisemitism charges. The report will also look at alleged interference in the disciplinary process by members of Corbyn’s team and the way the complaints procedure operated. One source described the language in the draft report as “strong” and said Starmer would come under pressure to set out whether the party would take disciplinary action against individuals involved in the previous administration, such as Corbyn, his former chief of staff Karie Murphy, or the former general secretary Jennie Formby. Gideon Falter, the chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said there must be consequences for Labour staffers if the report was highly critical. “The party must be forever changed after this episode so this can never happen again,” he said. “Those responsible remain in the party and must be held to account if Sir Keir Starmer is to tear antisemitism ‘out by its roots’, as he has promised. The EHRC’s report is a pivotal moment in this corrective process, which is why we called in the EHRC and were the originating complainant in its investigation. “The EHRC has considered a great deal of evidence from us and we will have more to say when the report is published.” Murphy, whom several former party staffers have accused of meddling in antisemitism cases, has said the handling of such disciplinary cases improved during Corbyn’s tenure. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, antisemites were removed from the Labour party more quickly, transparently and effectively than ever before. As his former chief of staff, I’m proud of that record,” she said."
2020-10-28T16:51:27Z,politics,Politics,Scotland to pardon hundreds convicted in 1984 minersâ€™ strike,"The Scottish government is to pardon hundreds of men convicted of offences during the 1984 miners’ strike after an independent review of the divisive and at times violent dispute. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, said legislation due next year would provide the miners with a collective and posthumous pardon in an effort to provide closure to mining communities and the police officers involved. “This was a bitter and divisive dispute,” Yousaf told the Scottish parliament. “Although three decades have passed, scars from the experiences still run deep. In some areas of the country, the sense of being hurt and being wronged remains corrosive.” Yousaf and Neil Findlay, the Scottish Labour MSP who campaigned for the review and the pardon recommendation, said the UK government should revisit a decision in 2016 to reject calls for a UK-wide public inquiry into the policing of the strike, which lasted from March 1984 to March 1985, and particularly the so-called “Battle of Orgreave” in South Yorkshire. Yousaf said Scottish miners were disproportionately punished. Around 500 Scottish miners were arrested and 200 of those were sacked by the National Coal Board – about 30% of the UK total, even though only 7% of the UK workforce worked at Scottish pits. Findlay said findings from the Hillsborough inquiry and the release of UK government cabinet papers on the strike had confirmed the long-held view among miners that policing of the strike was politically motivated. “Most of those were trumped-up charges of minor breaches of peace, and affected people who lost their jobs, they lost their redundancy, their livelihoods; many were blacklisted. Many never, ever recovered,” he said. Yousaf said officials still needed to draft the legislation and set out the criteria to be used. He said it was unlikely there would be legislation before parliament is dissolved for next May’s Holyrood elections. John Scott QC, a human rights specialist who led the review, recommended the that qualifying criteria should cover miners convicted of the minor common law offence of breach of the peace or breach of bail, who had no other convictions and who were fined.
Alex Bennett, 73, was among a group of miners gathered outside Holyrood before Yousaf’s statement. He said he was arrested while picketing Bilston Glen colliery in Midlothian, and summarily dismissed by the coal board, leaving his young family in poverty. “I was blacklisted. I couldn’t get a job for three years,” he said. “I’m 74 at my next birthday and I’ve never even had a parking ticket.” Being pardoned, he said, would “right a wrong”. Andrew “Watty” Watson, 55, a train drivers’ instructor from Fife who has campaigned for nearly 10 years to be exonerated, believes he was the youngest miner to be convicted during the strike. A week after his 19th birthday, Watson made several V-signs at police vans taking non-striking miners to Comrie colliery in Fife. He was arrested and convicted that day of breach of the peace, and four days later the coal board sacked him. He was reinstated a year later, only weeks before an industrial tribunal was due to take place, and says he lost four years of pension contributions. Watson said he was elated to know he may now be pardoned. “To burden me for 36 years with something as trivial as what I done? Living with it for 36 years has been hard, but I’m a fighter and I got through it,” he said. Tom Wood, a former deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders police who served at Bilston Glen colliery in Midlothian during the strike, said many officers were very uncomfortable about policing picket lines. Many came from mining areas, but they also felt those miners who wanted to work had the right to do so. He said 55 officers in his force received serious injuries on picket lines, including fractures and torn ligaments. Some miners were convicted of serious charges for acts of violence. “It was no picnic,” Wood said. Even so, he said the then government and the National Coal Board overreacted. “As regards miners who were arrested for simply breach of the peace and subsequently sacked and blackballed, that extra-judicial punishment by the coal board was spiteful and excessive.” He added: “The real lesson of the miners’ strike is what didn’t happen afterwards: [there was no] rebuilding, retraining and no investment in mining communities to give people hope. Mining villages were literally hollowed out. “We’re very unlikely to see another major industrial dispute like that, but in a post-Covid, post-carbon age we’re going to see further industrial decline. How we handle that post-industrial decline is going to be vitally important. That for me is the main lesson of the miners’ strike.”"
2020-10-28T16:09:09Z,politics,Politics,What to look out for in EHRC report on Labour antisemitism claims,"The long-awaited report into allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party by the equalities watchdog will be published on Thursday. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said the party will accept all the recommendations of the report, which the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has called the most shameful moment in the party’s history. These are the key points to look out for in the report: Has the Labour party broken the law in its treatment of Jewish members? The key finding the party must respond to is whether it has broken equalities laws – which could leave the party open to further legal action. The finding would hinge on the experience of Jewish members within the party, which the EHRC has sought evidence on. Labour has already settled in court with whistleblowers who spoke to the BBC about antisemitism, who say they were then defamed by statements from party spokespeople. Is Labour ‘institutionally antisemitic’? That claim has been made by several former MPs, including Ruth Smeeth, and others who left the party over Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership such as the former Jewish Labour Movement chair Luciana Berger.
If the EHRC were to make this finding, based on the Macpherson report – which described institutional racism as the “collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin” – it would not mean the party itself was entirely staffed by racists. It would mean a discriminatory culture developed, including through “unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping”. That could also mean the processes for redress were inherently biased against complaints from Jewish members and that there was a culture of denialism around the problem. What is said about Jeremy Corbyn and the figures around him? Many of the key individuals involved during the period under investigation, including the former general secretary Jennie Formby, Corbyn’s chief of staff Karie Murphy, the head of complaints, Thomas Gardiner, and the director of communications Seumas Milne have left their roles in the party. Prominent figures who may face criticism are the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone and the former MP Chris Williamson. Senior Labour insiders expect it to focus on the failings of the party as a whole, rather than indicting individuals for specific decisions. It is understood that those who have been named in the report will have been given limited sight of its findings. Some antisemitism campaign groups may be disappointed unless the watchdog fingers Corbyn personally for his role in the scandal.
Was the party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes adequate to cope? Murphy wrote in a piece for the Guardian this week that she was proud of her record as chief of staff in tackling antisemitism – despite multiple complaints that she and other members of Corbyn’s offices interfered with the complaints process especially when complaints were made about members previously associated with Corbyn. Murphy cited an audit of more than 300 antisemitism complaints received by the party from November 2016 to February 2018, which found that only 34 had been investigated. She alleged that changes brought about by Jennie Formby as general secretary – Formby has since left the role – led to a fourfold increase in expulsions per case. The report is likely to go into the most detail about whether party processes were adequate to deal with an onslaught of antisemitism complaints – and whether there was any improvements after three internal and external inquiries – the Baroness Royall report, the report by Shami Chakrabarti and the House of Commons select committee report. Was Labour’s ability to deal with racism complaints hindered by toxic political factionalism over Corbyn’s leadership? Relations broke down during the course of Corbyn’s tenure not just with Jewish community leaders but with the party’s Jewish affiliate – the Jewish Labour movement – which became one of two key complainants to the EHRC. Whistleblowers in the complaints department of Labour HQ who spoke to the BBC Panorama programme made a number of serious claims about the party’s internal culture for dealing with complaints of antisemitism, suggesting key figures meddled in complaints. Some of the whistleblowers were then themselves named in a leaked internal report this year that revealed what it called a “hyper-factional” environment, in which hostility to Corbyn’s leadership hampered the smooth running of complaints procedures. The leaking of that report, and its contents, are the subject of an independent review chaired by the QC Martin Forde."
2020-10-28T16:03:15Z,politics,Politics,"Parliament could get legal powers to summon witnesses, MP says","Parliament could soon be given legal powers to summon reluctant witnesses such as Dominic Cummings and Rupert Murdoch to answer questions from MPs, according to the chair of a Commons committee. Chris Bryant, who chairs the cross-party privileges committee, said a report due to be released this year would set out plans to compel witnesses to appear before MPs and hand over documents. Any such move could meet resistance from No 10, according to one informed source, and could anger some Tory backbenchers as some argue that the right to compel witnesses already exists in parliamentary rules. It follows several high-profile battles to drag potential witnesses including Mike Ashley, Philip Green and the Maxwell brothers to be questioned before House of Commons committees. Cummings, who is now Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, was ruled to be in contempt of parliament last year after failing to appear before MPs investigating fake news. In an interview with the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast, Bryant said the committee was concluding its inquiries after being asked by the house to examine how to prevent witnesses from treating parliament with contempt by lying or refusing to give evidence. “This has been an ongoing battle over the years, because some including Dominic Cummings and many others have either refused to turn up or been deeply offensive or have lied when they’ve appeared before the committee,” the Labour MP said. “We are determined to crack this nut and so we’re doing an inquiry on that at the moment as well about the powers of parliament to make sure that people attend.” The committee has been in talks with officials from the US Congress, New Zealand and Australia about how their legally enforced subpoenas work, and it plans to issue a report by the end of this year, according to Bryant. “I’m certain we will end up with the view that there has to be some form of being able to force witnesses to attend and/or provide papers. The question is just how, and that’s what we’re working on at the moment,” he said. A government source said: “We await the committee’s report and will consider carefully its recommendations.” After Cummings refused to give oral evidence to MPs, the privileges committee acknowledged that its sanctions options were limited to recommending that the Commons issue a formal admonishment for his conduct, raising questions about the committee’s enforcement powers. A 1999 report on parliamentary privilege said that in principle the Commons had the right to jail people who refused to attend a committee hearing after it issued an official summons. The individuals would be in contempt of parliament if they had “without reasonable excuse failed to attend before the house or a committee after being summoned to do so”. In reality, the worst that summoned witnesses face is public criticism if they do not attend. A series of witnesses have been criticised for delaying their appearances before committees. During the phone-hacking scandal in 2011, it took months for MPs to bring the News International executives James and Rupert Murdoch before MPs on the culture and media and sport committee. MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee threatened Mike Ashley with contempt after he took several months to attend parliament to discuss the Guardian’s revelations that some Sports Direct workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. The businessman Philip Green was criticised by members of the same committee for taking weeks to respond to a request to give oral evidence about the collapse of BHS, which put 11,000 jobs at risk. Erskine May, a guide to parliamentary procedure for MPs, stipulates that if the Commons votes to hold a person in contempt of the court of parliament, the Speaker can issue a warrant for that person to appear. This power was used in 1992 to force the Maxwell brothers to give evidence about pension funds. In evidence to the committee, the Conservative peer and former Treasury select committee chair Andrew Tyrie said the committee system had been increasingly thwarted in a number of big investigations. “If we arrive at the point where appearance is voluntary and denial of papers can be fought out endlessly in exchanges with lawyers, I think that parliament and its position as a representative of the people that is there to obtain consent will be sharply diminished. We just cannot reduce all this to an appearance of the fearful and the willing,” Lord Tyrie said."
2020-10-28T15:32:41Z,politics,Politics,"Large gatherings could be banned at Christmas, UK minister admits","Families will be prevented from having large Christmas gatherings if it is deemed necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19, a cabinet minister has said. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said it was too early to outline exactly what restrictions would be in place over the festive season, but admitted that families would be banned from “coming together in large gatherings” if needed. A letter from the Liberal Democrats’ leader, Ed Davey, the party’s Scottish and Welsh leaders and the Alliance party deputy leader in Northern Ireland has called for a “four nations summit” to agree on uniform guidance for families at Christmas. The letter to the four UK governments, which have each been setting their own restrictions, says: “We must accept the inevitability that people are going to travel to be with their loved ones during the festive time of year.” In areas of England under tier 1 measures, people must abide by the rule of six indoors, but in other areas social mixing between households inside is not allowed except where support bubbles have been formed. More than 8 million people in England are expected to be under the strictest tier of restrictions by the end of the week, and if the situation continues then many extended families will not be able to spend Christmas under one roof. The number of coronavirus-linked deaths in the UK passed 60,000 on Tuesday, and the daily toll rose above 200 weeks earlier than predicted. Eustice, when asked on LBC radio whether he agreed that police would have to break up parties for Christmas or Diwali, the Hindu festival that is two weeks away, said: “We want people to live and have Christmas as close as possible to normal. It’s a really important family time, we understand that … The prime minister said he wants us to be able to enjoy Christmas and for families to be able to come together. “It’s too early to say though exactly what restrictions will be in place by Christmas and obviously if we do need to have restrictions in place and prevent families from coming together in large gatherings, if that’s necessary to control the virus, that’s what we’ll have to do.” Pressed on whether he would have to support it if necessary, he replied: “Well, if necessary, we will have to put regulations in place, yes, but we want to make sure that people can enjoy Christmas and come together as families still, but it may not be in quite sort of large gatherings that some people would normally experience.”
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Eustice said: “We should set our guidelines, not as the Lib Dems say based on Christmas is coming, we should set our guidelines based on the epidemiology of this virus and follow the science and respond to emerging situations in a proportionate way. “And that’s what we’re doing, and it’s too early I’m afraid to say exactly what the situation will be by Christmas, but we do understand people want to have a Christmas that’s as close as possible to normal and to meet family and come together.” On Tuesday the TV presenter Victoria Derbyshire issued an apology after saying she planned to defy the law on social gatherings to celebrate with her family at Christmas."
2020-10-28T12:53:04Z,politics,Politics,Trade department's Brexit soy sauce price cut claim prompts backlash,"A government claim that the new UK-Japan trade agreement will lead to cheaper soy sauce has been shot down as it was pointed out that Britain pays 0% tariffs under an EU deal. The Department for International Trade (DIT) made the claim in a tweet during Tuesday nightâ€™s broadcast of The Great British Bake Off, where it was Japanese week and the bakers made kawaii cakes.
The trade secretary, Liz Truss, keen to promote the benefits of the much-heralded post-Brexit deal with Japan, retweeted the post.
But it was pointed out that the tariff on soy sauce from Japan is already 0% thanks to a free trade agreement between Tokyo and the EU.
David Henig, a trade expert, wrote: â€œCurrent tariff on soy sauce entering the UK from Japan â€“ 0%. Tariff on soy sauce entering UK after UK-Japan trade deal â€“ 0%. Not a good look when you canâ€™t trust a government social media account to tell the truth.â€� Others noted that the UK imports relatively little of its soy sauce from Japan.
The popular Kikkoman brand is manufactured in the Netherlands and is currently imported free of any duty. The tariff will rise to 6% by default if no trade deal is agreed with the EU before the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of the year. Other popular brands are made in Wales, as the Welsh MP Anna McMorrin pointed out along with hundreds of others.
DIT appeared to compound its own goal by adding later that â€œunder WTO terms, the tariff on soya [sic] sauce is 6%. Under our deal, they will be 0%â€�. The UK does not trade under WTO terms with Japan and would default to a tariff system that would closely follow the EU tariff regime if it crashes out of the bloc without a deal. A DIT spokesperson said: â€œCurrently the UK global tariff on soya sauce is 6%, therefore if we had not secured a UK-Japan trade deal, soya sauce would cost consumers more come the 1 January 2021.â€�"
2020-10-28T09:55:03Z,politics,Politics,"Antisemitism inquiry is Labour's most shameful moment, says senior MP","An investigation by the equality watchdog into antisemitism in the Labour party is the most shameful moment in the party’s history, a leading frontbench Labour MP has said. The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s report is due to be published on Thursday after an 18-month investigation into claims of anti-Jewish racism in the party during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Asked if the investigation was the most shameful moment in the party’s history, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, agreed that “it probably was, yes”. Speaking on Times Radio on Wednesday morning, Ashworth said: “A lot of this was about the fact that there was just a refusal to acknowledge the issue. “I obviously don’t know what’s in the report, because it’s confidential, but that was a shameful period in our history, and we have to be clear that we are never going back to that, and we will do everything we can to repair relations with the Jewish community who are understandably and quite rightly hurt by the Labour party’s failure to deal with this in recent years.” The EHRC launched the review after whistleblowers alleged that the party was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints and within local party structures. The referral came from a number of Jewish groups including the Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Jewish Labour Movement. Key allies of Corbyn are expected to launch a staunch defence of their record when the report is published. Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s former chief of staff, whom several former party staffers have accused of meddling in antisemitism cases, has said the handling of antisemitism disciplinary cases improved during Corbyn’s tenure. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, antisemites were removed from the Labour party more quickly, transparently and effectively than ever before. As his former chief of staff, I’m proud of that record,” she wrote in a piece for the Guardian on Monday. Gideon Falter, the chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said there must be consequences for Labour staffers if the report is highly critical. “The party must be forever changed after this episode so this can never happen again,” he said. “Those responsible remain in the party and must be held to account if Sir Keir Starmer is to tear antisemitism ‘out by its roots’, as he has promised. The EHRC’s report is a pivotal moment in this corrective process, which is why we called in the EHRC and were the originating complainant in its investigation. “The EHRC has considered a great deal of evidence from us and we will have more to say when the report is published.”"
2020-10-27T20:12:49Z,politics,Politics,"North-south divide could be our undoing, Tory MPs say","MPs have suggested that a “north-south divide” in the Conservative party could be its “undoing” and lead to a string of rebellions against Boris Johnson unless he commits to moving northern cities and regions out of the harsh coronavirus lockdown. Fifty-five MPs representing northern regions of Britain signed a letter calling for a focus on “levelling up” the regions and a roadmap out of Covid-19 restrictions, saying it was a warning shot to show they had the numbers to inflict a government defeat. Government sources said there was no plan to set out specifics on how curbs could be lifted for areas under tier 2 or 3 restrictions, stressing that the emphasis was still on persuading people to follow the rules as cases and hospitalisations remained high. The Conservatives’ prized red-wall seats, many won for the first time from Labour in 2019, have borne some of the worst effects of Covid-19, in illness and economic terms. On Tuesday more than half of the 207 Covid-19 deaths announced by NHS England were in the north of England, and the region was reported to have more than half of all patients on ventilation beds.
The MPs, in the Northern Research Group, led by Jake Berry, former minister for the northern powerhouse, wrote to the prime minister demanding a “clear roadmap” out of lockdown and arguing that the Covid pandemic had “exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities”.
“This north-south divide in the Tory party could be our undoing,” one southern Tory MP said. “These are MPs who delivered our victory, but far from a spending splurge in their towns they’ve seen their constituents placed under lock and key for months while the south gets more freedoms. “Unless the chancellor opens his cheque book to signal a spending-led recovery these MPs are going to get very agitated indeed and they have the numbers. But then seats like mine are going to pay for it in tax rises.” The show of strength in the numbers – enough to defeat Boris Johnson’s majority – was an important part of the group going public, one MP said. “You sometimes have pressure groups that don’t want their guns to be counted. But on this occasion it gives an indication of the strength of the group as a whole. It doesn’t do any harm for governments to know that there’s a group of MPs who are paying particular attention to particular issues and will vote accordingly, in the interests of constituents.” However, some in the group said they did not realise the intention had been to go public with their concerns and said they had hoped to be able to make private representations to Johnson, stressing that the act of sending the letter was not “hostile”. Pressure is likely to be applied over any new coronavirus restrictions and on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, when he publishes his one-year spending plan in November. The one-year plan, which replaces the comprehensive spending review, delayed for a second time, is intended to be concerned entirely with the pandemic response. But MPs said there had to be a “signal of intent” about the levelling-up agenda beyond the virus. Sunak, the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, moved to ease concerns on Tuesday, saying the government was committed to infrastructure, skills and broadband spending. “I absolutely share my colleagues’ frustration at restrictions. Of course that’s frustrating if you’re having to live under these things, and you want to know when it’s going to be over,” he said, without committing to any further steps.
MPs who signed the letter said they wanted to see concrete action, on lockdowns and with regard to a wider agenda. David Jones, the former Brexit minister, who signed the letter, said: “The seats of northern Britain delivered the government’s majority. So what we’re looking for is an expression of commitment or a reassertion of the government’s commitment that they understand the need to level up the north and bring more equality to the country as a whole.” Simon Fell, Conservative MP for Barrow and Furness, said the group was “trying to essentially keep the government honest on its promises to the north”. Among his demands Berry has urged the government to publish information in an “easily digestible, consumer-facing, public-friendly way” akin to how church halls use large mock thermometers to display progress with fundraising."
2020-10-27T18:35:32Z,politics,Politics,Jake Berry: how Boris Johnson's ally became his fiercest critic,"When Boris Johnson ran for the Conservative leadership last year, there were only a handful of people within the party he could fully rely on to back his bid. One of those people was Jake Berry. But the former minister, who has been Tory MP for Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire since 2010, has gone from an ally of the prime minister to an outspoken critic, and not without drama. On Monday, Berry wrote a headline-grabbing letter, co-signed by more than 50 Conservative MPs from northern England, expressing concerns the government will break its promise to “level up” the country and urging him to provide a “clear roadmap” out of localised lockdowns. While Berry insisted it was not a revolt or the start of a “blue wall” rebellion, it was interpreted as exactly that. Serving as northern powerhouse minister under Theresa May and later Johnson, Berry had once been one of Johnson’s keenest supporters – alongside fellow MPs Nigel Adams and Ben Wallace – chaperoning the future PM around parliament to conjure up support for his leadership bid. But according to reports, as Johnson headed toward the top job, Berry was overlooked in favour of MPs who had been involved with the Vote Leave campaign. In February he turned down a job in the Foreign Office during a cabinet reshuffle, saying as a father of three young children he could not accept a role which “would have required substantial amounts of foreign travel”. A Labour councillor at Rossendale borough council within Berry’s constituency claimed Berry had effectively been sacked from cabinet and that the letter this week was him “exacting his revenge” over his treatment. “I think he’s now reeling from the fact that he got sacked despite being incredibly loyal to [Johnson’s] leadership campaign,” they added, without agreeing to be named. Peter Steen, the Conservative group leader for the council, who has known Berry for the decade he has held the seat – previously represented by Labour’s Janet Anderson – admitted that Berry had been wounded by losing his ministerial role but said “he accepts the ups and downs of the game”. A born and bred northerner, having been brought up in Liverpool before studying law at the University of Sheffield, Berry was motivated “by the people he represents”, said Steen. “When he was a minister, yes, he enjoyed the position. But he’s not driven by personal aggrandisement,” said Steen. “I had a conversation with him at the weekend and it’s not that at all, he’s representing the people of the north. He’s not there to be a cheerleader, he’s there to support and represent his community.” Meanwhile, Andrew Percy, one of the signatories of Berry’s letter to Johnson and Berry’s predecessor as northern powerhouse minister, insisted the missive was merely a request made of the government, rather than outright criticism. “The letter was not done in a critical way,” he said. “Covid of course has focused all attention elsewhere so this is just an attempt to put the [Northern Research] Group on the radar and to push the need for a proper post-Covid vision.” Within his own constituency, views on Berry appear to be mixed. A business owner in Edenfield said: “You do see him around and I suppose he does support local people, but with all MPs they’ve got their own personal agenda. I don’t know what he wants to achieve professionally [with the letter] but hopefully it’s for the benefit of us all.” Steen added that in recent months the MP had “got a bit of flak” after it was revealed he had been living in Anglesey, north Wales, rather than his constituency during the national lockdown (Berry said he had been at his property thereafter visiting family when lockdown was announced, and then had to self-isolate before deciding not to travel for public health reasons). But the main issue facing him now on the ground was his decision to vote with the government last week in opposing the extension of free school meals during the holidays. The Labour councillor said the vote had been at odds with Berry’s supposed support for the north. “People are at best disappointed and at worst really, really angry,” he said. Berry was approached for comment."
2020-10-27T18:00:20Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit deal hangs in the balance, says EU council president","Brexit negotiations have hit their most difficult stage, with Brussels still unsure whether a deal with Boris Johnson is possible within the next two crucial weeks, the European council president, Charles Michel, has said. The former prime minister of Belgium, who leads the summit of EU leaders, said in an interview with the Guardian that the result still was still hanging in the balance with what he suggested was a further fortnight of talks to come. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to stay with his team in Westminster until Thursday, after which the troubled negotiations are due to resume in the Belgian capital. Both sides are seeking to keep outside commentary on the negotiation to a minimum in a sign that the talks have effectively entered a so-called “tunnel” or “submarine” phase, where the negotiators seek to hash out the final details away from the glare of the media and domestic political stakeholders. But Michel said Barnier was still maintaining a flow of intelligence to the member states, in preparation for a deal being struck and ratified. He conceded that it was as yet too early to say whether there would be a successful outcome from the final decisive phase. “In my opinion it’s very clear that it is necessary to work seriously, [which is] what we are trying to do, with full trust for Michel Barnier and his team, and we will assess in the next days or in the next weeks, when we consider it is time to assess, what is the result of the talks that are ongoing.” Michel said. “We all know that in all negotiations, the last and final decisions are the most difficult. Will we get a deal? I don’t know, it will depend on what will be on the table. But we are working in order to make sure all member states are well informed, are involved in the process in order to make sure there is confidence – which is key in order to able to decide.” The outstanding issues in the trade and security talks remain the level of access to British waters provided to foreign fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business, including rules on domestic subsidies, and mechanisms in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. “It is not a surprise. You know what are the most difficult topics, and we are working to try to find solutions on the most difficult topics,” Michel said. “It’s not possible for me to assess what will happen in the next days or in the next two weeks.” EU sources have suggested that mid-November is now the absolute deadline for a deal in order for there to be time for parliamentary ratification on both sides of the Channel. Michel was speaking to a group of European newspapers before a videoconference meeting of EU leaders on Thursday where the 27 heads of state and government will seek to further coordinate their efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Michel said there needed to be a unified approach to both the use of rapid testing kits and the rollout of a vaccine. He said he expected at least one of the vaccines currently under trial to be available by the end of the year, albeit there could be no certainty. “We need to speak the truth,” Michel said. “The current situation in Europe is serious and bad. That’s why we need to act and it is urgent … I remember that before the summer we thought there was a risk, without certainty, that we would face the second wave after the summer. And now, no doubt, there is a second wave, [a] strong second wave.”"
2020-10-27T16:35:13Z,politics,Politics,Cycling campaigners urge Keir Starmer to learn from collision,"A cycling campaign group has urged Keir Starmer to learn from a collision he was involved in over the weekend that left a cyclist with an injured arm. Police attended the incident on Sunday, close to the Labour leader’s home in Kentish Town, north London. The male cyclist received a minor injury to his arm and was taken to hospital as a precaution. Donnachadh McCarthy, the co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists, said: “We hope this crash will be a wake-up call to Keir Starmer that the Labour party needs to do far more to hold the government to account for failing to invest the £6bn per year needed for protected cycling infrastructure, as advocated by the UN, to enable kids to cycle to school safely, as they do in Holland.” Starmer’s office said he spoke to a member of the British Transport Police at the scene and provided a badge number of the officer concerned. A spokeswoman for the force confirmed an off-duty police community support officer witnessed the collision and provided Starmer with their details. The Met police refused to confirm Starmer’s involvement, but issued a statement saying no arrest had been made. A spokesman said: “The driver of the car had stopped at the scene and exchanged details with the cyclist but had left before officers arrived. Officers later attempted to contact the driver of the car and left a message advising him to report the matter to police. The driver of the car subsequently attended a north London police station. He was not arrested or interviewed under caution.” A spokesman for the Labour leader said: “Keir was involved in a minor road traffic accident on Sunday. He spoke to a British Transport Police officer who attended the scene and swapped details with the officer and the other individual involved. “Keir stayed at the scene until the ambulance arrived. Later that afternoon, he reported the incident to a police station in accordance with the law. Since the incident, Keir has also been in touch with the other individual involved.” A London ambulance service spokeswoman said: “We were called at 12.08pm [Sunday] to reports of a road traffic collision involving a car and a cyclist on Grafton Road, NW5.“We sent an ambulance crew to the scene. A person was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital.” Two residents who witnessed the aftermath of the incident told the Guardian they saw two police cars and an ambulance at the scene of the accident at around 12.30pm outside a swimming pool on Grafton Road. The residents, who declined to be named, said they assumed there had been an accident at the pool because an officer was guarding the entrance. The latest statistics for traffic collisions on roads in London show signs of an improvement in safety for cyclists that has coincided with an expansion of cycle lanes in the capital. Figures from Transport for London released last month showed five people died while cycling in the capital in 2019, down from 12 in 2018. A higher take-up of cycling in the capital has been accompanied by an overall increase in accidents. Injuries to cyclists were up 36% to 4,634 last year, compared with a long-term average of 3,410 based on figures for the period 2005-09."
2020-10-27T16:33:53Z,politics,Politics,Salmond accuses Sturgeon of pursuing vendetta over report into harassment claims,"Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon’s government of pursuing a vendetta against him in a major battle over the release of the official report into sexual harassment claims against him. In a further escalation of the long-running dispute between Salmond and his former friends and allies, it has emerged the Scottish government plans to ask a judge for permission to hand over the report that upheld two claims of alleged harassment against him to MSPs investigating the controversy. John Swinney, Sturgeon’s deputy, has told a Scottish parliamentary committee the government wants to release the official report into the harassment complaints and a covering letter sent to Salmond by Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, in August 2018. The government’s decision to uphold the complaints was leaked to the Daily Record newspaper, triggering a bitter legal battle. Salmond took the Scottish government to court and won in January 2019 when it admitted its internal inquiry was unlawful and “tainted by apparent bias”. In a batch of new letters released by a Scottish parliamentary committee on Tuesday morning, Salmond’s lawyer, David McKie, said those documents should have been destroyed in January 2019 after Salmond won his case. Swinney told the committee on Monday some papers had been destroyed, but the two documents sent to Salmond were kept. McKie said that showed “the clear objective of the Scottish government is to tarnish the reputation of our client and to seek to distract the committee from the core remit of investigating the Scottish government and the first minister”. Swinney revealed that government lawyers would go to the court of session seeking permission to release those papers, and up to 2,000 other pages of evidence and documentation used during Salmond’s civil action against the government. Following a separate criminal trial in March 2020, Salmond was acquitted at the high court in Edinburgh of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, involving nine female civil servants and Scottish National party officials. Among a series of further disclosures on Tuesday, more questions emerged about Sturgeon’s failure to disclose that she was told in March 2018 Salmond was under investigation. Sturgeon admitted earlier this month that she was told about the investigation by Salmond’s former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein when they met in her Holyrood office on 29 March 2018, but had forgotten it had taken place. Sturgeon had repeatedly insisted she first learned of the allegations when Salmond told her during a private meeting at her home on 2 April, a meeting followed by phone calls, text messages and a further meeting between them. Court papers released on Friday by the committee show the Scottish government had claimed during Salmond’s legal action she “first became aware of the existence of an investigation into [his] conduct in April 2018 when [he] made her so aware”. It was not until 7 June 2018 that Sturgeon wrote to Evans to disclose those contacts, but her letter to Evans, released on Monday, does not mention meeting Aberdein. That delay has led to Sturgeon coming under a separate formal investigation for breaching the ministerial code by an independent ethics commission because the meeting involved government business. Sturgeon has denied Salmond’s allegations of a conspiracy or of collusion. She told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I think the reason perhaps he is angry with me – and he clearly is angry with me – is that I didn’t cover it up, I didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away.” In a disclosure that will raise further questions about what Sturgeon knew and when, McKie also asserted that her principal private secretary, John Somers, twice met one of the two complainants in November 2017, soon after the complainer indicated she may have allegations to make against Salmond. In his letter to the committee, McKie said another as-yet-unidentified person was at one of those meetings. They took place several weeks before Sturgeon signed off on the new anti-harassment policy in late December 2017 that allowed civil servants to make retrospective complaints against former ministers. The two complainants filed formal complaints against Salmond in January 2018. Salmond’s allies allege the Scottish government admitted defeat in his civil action because his lawyers were about to call Somers, forcing him to admit Sturgeon’s office had had contact with the complainers."
2020-10-27T14:33:18Z,politics,Politics,Who are the Northern Research Group that pose a 'threat' to Johnson?,"They have been described as the “biggest threat to Boris Johnson’s authority since he came to power”, with the potential to cause as much trouble as Jacob Rees-Mogg’s backbench power base during the Brexit negotiations. Led by Jake Berry, the former northern powerhouse minister, more than 50 Conservative MPs in the north of England, Scottish borders and north Wales, have written to the prime minister demanding a roadmap out of the coronavirus lockdown and investment to address the north-south divide that governments “have failed to tackle for decades”.
Taking a leaf out of Rees-Mogg’s influential European Research Group (ERG), the hard Brexiters who ultimately cost Theresa May her job, the MPs call themselves the Northern Research Group (NRG). They will commission research on their issues of concern and have reached out to unions. Like the ERG, the group has the potential to be another party within a party; it has 55 members, 20 more than previously thought. The 41 signatories to the letter (14 remain anonymous and are thought to include serving members of the government) include four former cabinet ministers, the former Brexit secretary David Davis, the former housing minister Esther McVey, the former Scotland secretary David Mundell, and the former Wales secretary and current deputy chair of the ERG, David Jones. As with the ERG, the group appears tightly organised and has been meeting for several weeks via the video chat site Zoom. It has now presented its policy goals – a rebalancing of infrastructure funds, with demands for priority investment in a trans-Pennine “Northern Powerhouse Rail”, strategic development corridors, and ultrafast broadband. William Wragg, the MP for Hazel Grove and an NRG member, said the coronavirus pandemic had only exacerbated the need for “a good deal for the north from the government”, adding: “This isn’t about giving government a tough time. The prime minister shares our collective priority. But there are compelling and constructive arguments we, as a group of northern MPs, can make to government about how it delivers on its promise to level up the north.” If Johnson has concerns about a power base to rival Downing Street, he did not show them when he discussed the NRG with Berry a few weeks ago. “He was absolutely supportive. I think his exact words were ‘I order you to go out and set this group up’. I don’t know how he feels about it this week, but I think at the time he thought it was brilliant,” Berry told the Spectator last week. Some believe Covid-19 has fuelled the NRG. “Many of these MPs are new, have hardly been in Westminster and haven’t been exposed to the discipline of the whip’s office,” a former government insider said. “They’ve also seen, after the internal market bill rebellion, that it doesn’t take 40 backbenchers to get a response. This idea that Johnson could have an iron grip on things because of his 80-seat majority has been proven not to be the case. [There were] only a handful of MPs rebelling on that bill, but Downing Street reacted immediately.”
If the NRG follows the ERG model Johnson may find himself up against a group with a slick media operation to rival Downing Street and the potential to vote as a large backbench bloc. The group supports devolved governments and wants mayors to have “tax and spend powers” so they can drive change in the north of England, something that may be anathema to Johnson after his bruising battle with the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. Berry described the group as “a trade union for northern MPs” and said he had talked to the Trades Union Congress about joint projects. “If that ruffles feathers in the Tory party? Boohoo,” he told the Spectator."
2020-10-27T10:00:54Z,politics,Politics,UK faces new legal challenge over arms sales to Saudi Arabia,"Campaigners have filed for a judicial review of the UK government’s decision to renew arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) said the weapons would “fuel destruction and prolong the conflict” in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has employed widespread bombing in a war that has killed thousands of civilians. Last month, a United Nations report said countries arming parties involved in the conflict could be “aiding and assisting” war crimes, and said there had been “documented patterns” of serious international humanitarian law violations. In a June 2019 case, also brought by CAAT, the court of appeal ruled British arms sales to Saudi Arabia were unlawful and said ministers had illegally signed off on arms exports without properly assessing the risk to civilians. It ordered the then international trade secretary, Liam Fox, to hold an immediate review of at least £4.7bn-worth of arms deals with Saudi Arabia and the government suspended new arms sales to the country. However, in July this year the government announced it was resuming arms sales to Saudi Arabia, after a review concluded there had been only “isolated incidents” of airstrikes in Yemen that breached humanitarian law.
The trade secretary, Liz Truss, said at the time: “The government will now begin the process of clearing the backlog of licence applications for Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners that has built up since 20 June last year.” Andrew Smith, of CAAT, said: “Tens of thousands of people have been killed in this brutal bombardment, yet arms companies have profited every step of the way. These arms sales have only fuelled the destruction and prolonged the conflict. Last year, the court of appeal found that the government has acted illegally, and nothing that we have seen since suggests otherwise. “The government may think that the widespread destruction of schools, hospitals and homes can be dismissed as ‘isolated incidents’ but we do not. These arms sales are immoral, and we are confident that the court will confirm that the decision to renew them was illegal.” The UK has licensed the sale of at least £4.7bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia since the start of the civil war in Yemen in March 2015, but CAAT says the real figure is likely to be higher. A government spokesperson said: “The UK operates one of the most comprehensive export control regimes in the world. “The government takes its export responsibilities seriously and rigorously assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria. We will not issue any export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria.”"
2020-10-26T19:30:28Z,politics,Politics,Ex-Corbyn aide Karie Murphy says she is proud of record on antisemitism,"Jeremy Corbyn’s former chief of staff has said she is proud of Labour’s record on antisemitism, days before the equalities watchdog is expected to publish its report on the issue. Karie Murphy, one of Corbyn’s fiercely protective inner circle, whom several former party staffers have accused of meddling in antisemitism cases, said she had been moved to speak out “for the first time … [to] set the record straight” about the party’s handling of cases, claiming that it improved during Corbyn’s tenure. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, antisemites were removed from the Labour party more quickly, transparently and effectively than ever before. As his former chief of staff, I’m proud of that record,” she has written in a piece for the Guardian. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is expected to publish its long-awaited report on Labour this week. It launched the review after whistleblowers alleged that the party was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints and within local party structures. Any key figures who are criticised in the report, who could include Murphy, are likely to have been given some limited sight of its findings in advance. Murphy said there had been an “extremely successful campaign to obscure the facts” about how the party handled complaints, claiming it was “primarily driven by political opposition to Jeremy Corbyn’s socialist, internationalist politics” and procedural failings. “I’m not speaking out for the first time to dismiss the fact that antisemitism reared its head among a small minority in the Labour party. It did. It was wrong and the party as a whole was slow to deal with it effectively,” she said. But in comments that were fiercely opposed by the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), Murphy said a “relentless and highly politicised media campaign” was also to blame. It “hurt Jewish people and disturbed and confused many in our movement,” she said. “Could more have been done earlier? Yes, of course. But what was done – including changes to the party’s rules and instituting detailed guidance on antisemitism for an expanded complaints team – unquestionably made it easier and swifter to remove antisemites from the party.” Murphy said she was “deeply sad” that relations with the Jewish community were at such a low ebb during Corbyn’s tenure. “But it wasn’t for want of trying, let alone because of any tolerance of antisemitism.” she wrote. Whistleblowers who worked in Labour’s governance and legal unit, several of whom went public to speak to the BBC Panorama programme, have previously said senior party staff fatally undermined their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints, which Murphy denies. Several staff described experiencing breakdowns as a result of the atmosphere. Murphy cited an audit of more than 300 antisemitism complaints received by the party from November 2016 to February 2018, which found that only 34 had been investigated. She alleged that changes brought about by Jennie Formby as general secretary – Formby has since left the role – led to a fourfold increase in expulsions per case. Murphy said she and other staff members in the Labour leader’s office did not meddle in cases involving party members, saying she saw it as “a factional trap” when she was asked for advice – a claim strongly disputed by former staff members, who have claimed they were put under inappropriate pressure in prominent cases. Mike Katz, chair of the JLM, said Murphy’s claims were a smear of Jewish members. “JLM referred Labour to the EHRC because our efforts to engage constructively with the party from 2015 onwards had been rebuffed constantly and our members faced continued discrimination, harassment and victimisation,” he said. “At no point was there genuine remorse, improvements to the system, or any real progress in the number of cases handled or outcomes. Their only success on antisemitism was the rigour with which they protected their political allies, downplayed the issue and gaslit those who spoke up against it. Smearing the pain of our members and the wider Jewish community as part of a ‘highly politicised media campaign’ is shameful.”"
2020-10-26T18:50:18Z,politics,Politics,Sunak under pressure to reveal whereabouts of his own investments,"The chancellor is under pressure to reveal where his multimillion-pound personal fortune is invested after suggestions that some of his wealth, which is managed by a so-called blind trust, could be held in offshore tax havens. Opposition MPs and transparency campaigners on Monday called on Rishi Sunak to be “completely transparent” about where his wealth – earned over a career at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs and hedge funds – is invested in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest with his role running the UK economy.
Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “The truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.” Sunak registered a blind trust in July 2019 after he had been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. Under a standard blind trust arrangement individuals can still receive income from their investments but cannot make decisions about how the money is invested. The campaigners and MPs are concerned that Sunak will know where his money was invested before he placed it in the blind trust, and that raises concerns that his decisions as chancellor could be influenced by his personal stakeholdings. The financial transparency campaigners have also called on the chancellor to be categorical on the question of whether any of his wealth is sheltered in offshore tax havens. Abena Oppong-Asare, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “Rishi Sunak needs to be completely transparent with the public about whether any of the funds he invested in a blind trust are held in offshore tax havens. Taxpayers paying their fair share expect nothing less.” Sunak is the only chancellor to have used a blind trust since details of ministers’ interests began to be published in 2009. Seven serving ministers hold a blind trust, compared with 13 in 2015. Richard Murphy, a visiting professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and a self-described “tax justice campaigner”, said: “The problem with this arrangement is that the blindness is for the public. We literally know nothing.”
Daniel Beizsley of the financial transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption said: “The issue as I see it with Sunak is that unless the trustee was given specific instructions to diversify the portfolio, then Sunak is fully aware of its contents. It’s difficult to see how this could absolve him of conflict of interest claims. Additionally, by placing assets into the blind trust arrangement, the public’s ability to judge potential conflicts is reduced as his ministerial declaration is now empty.” Sunak’s spokesperson refused to comment, but a Treasury source said: “Blind trusts/blind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement. “Politicians of all stripes have used blind trusts/blind management arrangements to ensure they avoid any conflict of interest, including the last Labour government.”"

In the old days, it just made my brain ache (17.5%? What kind of maths even is that?). This year, it has been the symbol of the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis (I’ve known cuts to it and bumps to it, in the service of a choppy economy, but until the pandemic I had never known payments be suspended). From here on in, I suspect, VAT stories will be all about Brexit, because from 1 January, EU sellers will be liable for VAT to the UK government. For smaller EU businesses, especially those whose UK markets aren’t huge, it just won’t be worth selling to us. To look on the bright side, this might be a bonanza for small UK businesses, which will have less competition. To unpack that hard economic jargon for the layperson, “less competition” means we won’t be able to buy stuff, and the stuff we can buy will be more expensive and possibly not as good, because there’s no other stuff we could buy instead.
It reminds me of the stories we used to hear about Russia in the 80s. Tourists came back from there all saying the same two things: first, the Kremlin/Hermitage is beautiful; second, nobody could get hold of Levi’s. This was the shorthand we used to understand the depredations of communism towards the end of its tenure. Sometimes it was embellished, and the returning traveller had been offered cash for the Levi’s they were standing up in. It made no sense, but it made all the sense; practically speaking, why not just wear something else? Emotionally, it was the lived reality of the powerlessness of life in a communist dystopia. You wanted something. You could afford it. But you couldn’t have it. I make no comment on whether we need all the stuff we are buying from the EU in the first place. I merely observe that “a bit like Russia in the 80s, only with less of a resistance movement” was not on the side of anyone’s bus."
2020-10-25T18:00:00Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers call for apology from Johnson and Patel for endangering colleagues,"The UK prime minister and the home secretary are accused of endangering the personal safety of lawyers through their abusive attacks on the profession and should apologise, more than 800 former judges and senior legal figures have said in a letter sent to the Guardian. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel are additionally accused in the letter of displaying “hostility” towards lawyers, undermining the rule of law and effectively risking the lives of those working in the justice system. The signatories include three former justices of the UK supreme court, five retired appeal court judges, three former high court judges, the lawyer heads of four Oxford University colleges, more than 80 QCs, 69 law professors from leading English universities, the directors of Liberty and Justice, as well as hundreds of law firm partners, barristers and solicitors. The letter is the largest coordinated response so far to increasingly vehement rhetorical attacks on the legal profession by the two Conservative politicians. In August, the Home Office published a video on Twitter blaming “activist lawyers” for frustrating the department’s efforts to deport people with no right to remain in the UK. The video was later withdrawn. Earlier this month, at the Conservative party conference, Patel broadened her targets, claiming that among those defending the “indefensible” and “broken” immigration appeals system were “do-gooders, lefty lawyers, the Labour party”. In his conference speech, Johnson went further, declaring he would prevent “the whole criminal justice system from being hamstrung by what the home secretary would doubtless – and rightly – call the lefty human rights lawyers, and other do-gooders”. Last week, a man appeared in court charged with carrying out a racist attack on a firm of immigration lawyers in London. Cavan Medlock, 28, from Harrow, faces six charges including preparing an act of terrorism. He has not yet entered a plea.
The roll call of signatures protesting against the vilification of lawyers represents an extraordinary host of prominent legal experts united in a common purpose. Among the former judges are Lords Collins, Dyson and Walker, who recently left the supreme court, as well as onetime appeal court judges Sir Richard Buxton, Sir Anthony Hooper, Sir David Keene, Sir Alan Moses and Sir Stephen Sedley. The letter states: “We are all deeply concerned at recent attacks, made by the home secretary and echoed by the prime minister, on lawyers seeking to hold the government to the law. “Such attacks endanger not only the personal safety of lawyers and others working for the justice system, as has recently been vividly seen; they undermine the rule of law, which ministers and lawyers alike are duty-bound to uphold. “We invite both the home secretary and the Prime minister to behave honourably by apologising for their display of hostility, and to refrain from such attacks in the future.” In support of the letter, former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald QC said: “The home secretary may not grasp the indecency of her language, but the prime minister should know better. “Lawyers who represent demonised people are always attacked by populist politicians, but it is demeaning to our country and its institutions that the government itself is now dipping into this disreputable playbook. “It is precisely this sort of ugly authoritarianism that the rule of law is called upon to counter. The entire legal profession is proud of those lawyers who are being so crudely and dangerously vilified.” The former supreme court justice Lord Dyson told the Guardian: “What’s worrying is the inflammatory language used by the home secretary and supported by the prime minister. It was irresponsible and dangerous and quite unjustified to use inflammatory language of the sort. The language is almost the language of a demagogue. “We all know what happens when people in high places and in power resort to language of that kind … they are whipping up emotions without justification. It’s dangerous.” Dinah Rose QC, the president of Magdalen College, University of Oxford, said: “The people at the heart of government whose role it is to ensure that the legal system and the rule of law are respected have either decided to remain silent or their voices are not being listened to. “Where lawyers are abusing the system, they deserve to be criticised, but the problem is that the government’s attack is on any lawyer who is using the system to represent their clients. There’s an attempt to whip up hatred against lawyers for simply doing their job.” In a judgment last week upholding the right for migrants to have access to lawyers, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, also stated: “It is a matter of regret that a minority of lawyers have lent their professional weight and support to vexatious representations and abusive late [immigration] legal challenges.” A government spokesperson said: “The government rejects the underlying insinuation in this letter and is clear any form of violence is unacceptable. Lawyers play an important role in upholding the law and ensuring people have access to justice. They are however not immune from criticism.”"
2020-10-25T14:08:58Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Tory leader: I still can't see why Dominic Cummings did not resign,"The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, has reignited the row over Dominic Cummings’ Durham lockdown trip by indicating that he could not see how the prime minister’s most senior aide did not resign over the incident. Ross, who quit his junior ministerial post in protest at Cummings’ 264-mile journey from London at the height of Covid-19 restrictions, said the actions of Boris Johnson’s adviser were “indefensible” and that they had undermined the government. In a fresh intervention unlikely to prove popular in Number 10, Ross stood by his decision to stand down and suggested Cummings should have followed his lead. Pressed on whether he believed Cummings should have resigned over the affair, Ross told the Guardian: “If someone who was not involved at all resigned then, yes, I don’t see how the individual themselves couldn’t take that position. I was so far removed from the actions yet even that far away from it I felt what he did was indefensible and that’s why I would assume, or I feel, he would take the same decision but he didn’t.” Ross was particularly unconvinced by Cummings’ excuse that he had gone on a separate drive with his family while he was in Durham to nearby Barnard Castle, apparently to test his eyesight. “I felt the only way I could be true to myself was to resign from government and to express my opposition to what he’d done, particularly the driving 60 miles to test your eyesight.” Noting his wife’s job as a police officer, he said: “I did think, how would she manage if she pulled someone over for driving issues and they used the defence that they were testing their eyesight?” He has no regrets: “Several months on, I still believe it was the right decision to take.”
Rather than setting back the 37-year-old MP’s career, within months of his resignation in May from the role as parliamentary undersecretary of state for Scotland he was thrust back into the frontline of politics when he became the Conservatives’ leader north of the border uncontested. He has since set about reinvigorating the Scottish Conservatives’ approach as the SNP renews its calls for a second independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon’s party is riding high in the polls ahead of next year’s Holyrood election. Ross, who has a seat in Westminster but not in the Scottish parliament, appointed Ruth Davidson, who held his job until 2019, to be his party’s leader in Holyrood. Davidson has been no fan of Johnson and any apparent attempt by Ross to differentiate himself from No 10 could play well with the home crowd, given the prime minister’s popularity in Scotland is questionable. In his conference speech this month, he called on his party to end the “defeatism and disinterest” over the country’s future in the UK, arguing that an SNP majority in next year’s Holyrood election was not inevitable. Reflecting on the speech, Ross said he had wanted to “make it very clear that it’s in our name that we are both Conservative and unionists”. “I said in my speech it’s in our DNA and if you don’t believe in strengthening the union and the bonds that we share across four nations of the United Kingdom then you’ve got to reflect on if you’re in the right party or not,” he said. “The feedback I’ve had back since is people at various levels in the party think it is right that that message was delivered just now because the defeatism and disinterest only benefits the SNP and their agenda to separate Scotland from the rest of the UK and I want to do everything I can to stop that.” It comes as a poll this month put backing for independence at a record high of 58%. The SNP constitution secretary, Mike Russell, indicated on Thursday that Scotland could face a second independence referendum as early as next year, following the victory for the Better Together camp in 2014. Ross called Russell’s comments “deeply disappointing but sadly predictable”. Reports also emerged this month about a leaked memo from a political consultancy firm given to senior Tories which said continuing to dismiss calls for another independence referendum could be counterproductive. It proposed potentially handing more power to Edinburgh. Ross said he did not receive the memo, but dismissed the suggestion of more powers going to Holyrood, suggesting the current ones should be used to better effect. On Sturgeon’s handling of the pandemic, Ross highlighted her communication skills in what some might characterise as a subtle dig at Downing Street. “No one would doubt that Nicola Sturgeon is a highly effective communicator but when you look at the response to the pandemic in Scotland, and across the UK, it has been largely similar,” he said. “So people who suggest there has somehow been a different approach to dealing with coronavirus in Scotland to the rest of the UK are simply unable to point to anything substantial that has been done differently. But there has been a difference in terms of the communication.” Asked about Downing Street following Scotland in U-turning over the summer on exam results, Ross said: “From students receiving their exam results in Scotland, the U-turn took longer by the Scottish government than it did by the UK government. Now I think the UK government should have seen what happened in Scotland and changed the decision before exam results south of the border were even delivered … but the fact is that it took the Scottish government longer.”"
2020-10-25T11:03:38Z,politics,Politics,Labour vows to force another Commons vote on free school meals,"Labour has thrown down the gauntlet to Downing Street by pledging to force another Commons vote if it does not U-turn on its refusal to provide free school meals in England during the holidays, as a senior Conservative MP admitted the government has misjudged the country’s mood over the issue. In a fresh intervention that will boost the campaign being led by the footballer Marcus Rashford, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Sunday his party would push for another vote if there is no change of course before Christmas. Labour was defeated by the government in a vote on the policy last week, prompting businesses and councils – some of them Tory-led – to step forward to offer to feed children in the October half-term break, but the government has so far dug in to defend its position. In an apparent softening of tone after a No 10 spokesman last week refused to praise councils and firms offering help, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said Rashford deserved “huge credit” for his work on the issue although he stood by Downing Street’s line.
It comes as Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the influential Commons liaison committee, said the government had “misunderstood the mood of the country” on free school meals. As the government continues to resist appeals to reverse its move, Jenkin told the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme on Sky News: “I think we have to admit that we have misunderstood the mood of the country here.” Highlighting that the government had funded local councils to provide support, he added: “The public want to see the government taking a national lead on this and I think the government will probably have to think again on that, particularly if there’s going to be more votes in the House of Commons. “I think when you have got the chairman of the education select committee [Robert Halfon] not supporting the government on this – and he’s a Conservative – I think the government has to listen to the Conservative party.” Asked how he would vote in any further Commons divisions, Jenkin said: “I shall wait to see what the government says and how they respond to the situation.” Halfon, who voted against the government on the free school meals motion on Wednesday, wrote in the Spectator on Saturday: “Combating child hunger should, therefore, be a cause that all Conservatives can embrace. That should include the temporary extension of free school meals over the holidays while (and only while) the economic impacts of the pandemic continue to be felt.” Downing Street has already been forced to perform a U-turn once on the issue, deciding to provide £15-a-week meal vouchers to eligible children over the summer after Rashford campaigned on the issue, but it has refused to do so for the holidays ahead.
Asked what had changed, meaning children who got them then should not get them during the autumn or Christmas holidays, Lewis told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “There’s a couple of things [that] have changed. Obviously, back in the summer we had all the schools were closed, we had that full lockdown period. Things have moved on, we’ve now got about 99% of schools and children back at schools … that’s really good. So we are in a different place but there’s more than that.” He added: “In the holidays, what we’ve put in place actually is not just the uplift in universal credit, because obviously the schools are closed so it’s about making sure the welfare system can cover and support what people need. So we’ve put the uplift into universal credit, around just over a £1,000 a year, but also very specifically we’ve put £63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship … and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that.” Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour’s shadow mental health minister, told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “We are honestly hoping that the Conservative government dig deep and look introspectively and perform a U-turn on this, but we certainly will be pushing for a vote before Christmas.” The children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, told the same programme she thought the government should provide free school meals over the holidays, adding: “I’ve been horrified by the debate, really disappointed about the debate over recent days. We’re a wealthy country, it’s 2020.” “To have a debate about whether we should make sure that hungry and vulnerable children should have enough to eat is something which is strikingly similar to chapters, I think of you know, what we’d expect to see in Oliver Twist, a novel published in the 19th century. So let’s stop the divisive and distracting conversations, and start focusing.”"
2020-10-24T19:34:33Z,politics,Politics,Johnson will wait for US election result before no-deal Brexit decision,"Senior figures in European governments believe Boris Johnson is waiting for the result of the US presidential election before finally deciding whether to risk plunging the UK into a no-deal Brexit, according to a former British ambassador to the EU. Ivan Rogers, who was the UK’s permanent representative in Brussels from 2013 to 2017, told the Observer that a view shared by ministers and officials he has talked to in recent weeks in several European capitals, is that Johnson is biding his time – and is much more likely to opt for no deal if his friend and Brexit supporter Donald Trump prevails over the Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Rogers said: “Several very senior sources in capitals have told me they believe Johnson will await clarity on the presidential election result before finally deciding whether to jump to ‘no deal’ with the EU, or to conclude that this is just too risky with Biden heading for the White House, and hence live with some highly suboptimal (for Johnson) skinny free-trade agreement.” The former ambassador to the EU – who quit under Theresa May’s premiership because of disagreements over Brexit strategy – remains in regular contact with senior government figures in EU capitals. Rogers said that if Trump won he and others in Europe believed Johnson would think “history was going his way” with his rightwing ally still in the White House. The prime minister would therefore be more likely to conclude he could strike a quick and substantial post-Brexit US-UK trade deal than if Biden emerged as president after the 3 November poll. By contrast, a Biden administration would prioritise rebuilding relations with the EU that have been damaged by Trump. Rogers joined other former UK diplomats last night in warning that a Democratic administration under Biden would prove hugely problematic for Johnson and the UK government, threatening the so-called special relationship. “I don’t think either Biden or his core team are anti-British, but I think they are unimpressed by both Johnson and his top team,” he said.
“They believe him to have been an early and vigorous supporter of Trump, and that Brexiteer thinking – which they think has damaged the unity of the west – has many parallels with Trumpism. So I really doubt there will be much warmth in the personal relationship. And Biden’s would simply not be an administration which viewed European integration as a negative. “The UK’s absence from the EU will make it clearly less influential because it can no longer lead European thinking on the geo-strategic issues which will matter hugely to Biden. So [Biden] will put Berlin and Paris – and indeed Brussels – back at the heart of US thinking: not uncritically, because the US will still have serious issues with EU approaches on economic and security issues..” Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador in Washington, who quit the post in 2019 after the leaking of diplomatic cables in which he criticised the Trump administration as “inept”, said Biden might even favour a US-EU trade deal over one with the UK. Darroch said: “Whoever wins in November the bedrock of the relationship – defence, security and intelligence collaboration – will remain as strong as ever. But if it’s Biden, there are likely to be some issues. The Democrats don’t like or support Brexit. They may prioritise trade deals with the Pacific region or the EU over a UK/US deal. They will block a trade deal with us if they think we are putting the Good Friday agreement at risk. And they remember and resent Johnson’s comments in 2016 about ‘the part-Kenyan president’ having ‘an ancestral dislike of the British empire’ – not to mention Johnson telling US diplomats that Trump was ‘making America great again’.” Last week the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, insisted a deal with the EU could still be done although substantial disagreements remain before the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The main problem areas include fishing rights, post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. Jonathan Powell, who served as a diplomat in Washington in the 1990s before becoming Tony Blair’s chief of staff and taking control of negotiations that led to the Good Friday agreement, said Biden believed Johnson had imperilled the Irish peace process. He said: “Biden is very proud of his Irish antecedents. He has always been active on Northern Ireland since before I was in Washington. He takes a close interest in the Northern Irish peace process and sees it as an outrage that Johnson has in his cavalier manner threatened peace in Northern Ireland for so little reason. So that is going to be chalked up against him.” In Washington there are plenty of foreign policy advisers around Biden who worked in the Obama administration and have not forgiven Johnson for his “part-Kenyan” comments. The camp sees Johnson as part of the same populist phenomenon that brought Trump to power. And from the Democrats’ point of view, the UK outside the EU will make it less important as a partner on the world stage. “In all these giant issues – tech and disinformation and China, and trade, the position of the EU on those issues is just a lot more important than the position of the UK,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s foreign policy adviser. “For these big ticket items I think that Brussels, Berlin and Paris are just much more in the middle of it all, than London will be.” Foreign Office and Downing Street officials downplay the prospect of difficulties in the “special relationship” if Biden wins. They point out the UK will have opportunities to take the lead on the world stage and build relations with a new US administration. They cite the fact that the UK will chair the UN security council from February, and the rotating presidency of the G7 from the US, as well as hosting the 26th Conference of Parties (COP 26) on climate change in Glasgow in November 2021. “Climate is really important,” a British official said. “That’s really going to help because you’ve seen lots of comments from Biden about how important that is to him, and since we are leading on COP, it will be something where they will instantly recognise our value and our importance.” A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The US election is an internal matter for the US. We welcome the intensive talks taking place with the EU in London over the weekend, where for the first time we will be negotiating on legal texts and across all areas at the same time. “We’ve been clear in our ambition for what we want to achieve, we want to reach an FTA that respects us as a sovereign nation and we want to achieve this as soon as possible.”"
2020-10-24T15:08:58Z,politics,Politics,"Tory MPs faced abuse after 'scum' incident, party chair says","Tory MPs have suffered “widespread abuse” after Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, referred to one as “scum” in a heated parliamentary debate, the party’s co-chairman has said. More than 100 Tory MPs have signed an open letter promoted by Amanda Milling MP urging the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, to take action against all party members who perpetrate “unacceptable abuse online and offline”. But public figures and opposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of seeking to deflect attention from the backlash it is receiving over its decision to vote against extending free school meals to deprived children over the 2021 school holidays. The letter, signed by 112 MPs, says Rayner’s language led to the phrase “Tory scum” trending on Twitter, abusive phone calls and MPs’ offices being targeted. It added: “This has not only affected MPs but also their hard-working staff and supportive families, the vast majority of whom are not public figures.” Labour has been contacted for comment. Rayner’s heated exchange took place during a debate on economic lockdown measures on Wednesday. The Conservative MP Chris Clarkson broke off from a speech attacking what he characterised as Labour’s “hindsight-heavy” approach and confronted Rayner over whether she had used the slur against him. As a row erupted, the deputy Speaker, Eleanor Laing, intervened by shouting “order” and rebuked Rayner, telling her: “From the frontbench we will not have remarks like that, not under any circumstances, no matter how heartfelt it might be, not at all.”
As the debacle threatened to overshadow Labour’s attempt to seize the initiative on a day of opposition debates about economic support in lockdown areas and free school meal provision, Rayner issued an apology within hours. In a statement on Wednesday evening, Rayner said: “I apologise for the language that I used in a heated debate in parliament earlier.” On Saturday the Tory MPs’ letter had been shared thousands of times on Twitter, with many users suggesting the abuse was more likely to stem from the decision to overwhelmingly oppose extending free school meals in a Commons vote. “You don’t think voting against feeding hungry children during the school holidays had a little something something to do with the abuse?” tweeted the former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman OBE. “A valiant attempt to shift the blame while simultaneously detracting from the main issue, ie children going to bed hungry night after night.” Meanwhile, the musician Nitin Sawhney accused the party of double standards, pointing to Boris Johnson’s recorded history of using offensive terms towards black people and Muslims in columns he has written previously."
2020-10-24T15:00:27Z,politics,Politics,Why the row over congestion charge expansion could tear London apart,"In its 17 years of operation, the London congestion charge had become a relatively uncontroversial fact of life; few motorists now assert the right to travel for free into the crowded eight square miles at the heart of the capital city. But now that zone could be expanded far and wide: right out to the orbital roads that ring the inner boroughs – the North and South Circular – used by hundreds of thousands of cars a day. To pay a £15 congestion charge to drive to a hospital in Woolwich, to an Asda or Ikea in Beckton or Tottenham, a cemetery in Willesden or the wide open spaces of Wanstead Flats – let alone a daily school run or journey to work in any borough – is a completely different proposition. Is it a serious one? According to City Hall, it certainly is: serious, outrageous, and unfair. In the extraordinary funding row between Boris Johnson’s government and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the Treasury is proposing to stump up only about half of the £2bn London says it needs right now to cover fare revenue losses on public transport due to the pandemic. A leaked letter from the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to Khan spelled out the proposal that Transport for London (TfL) should extend the congestion charge – though Shapps later said it was just one option. Amid rising anger – not least from his own MPs in outer-London boroughs – Johnson told a questioner at PMQs that “any expansion of the congestion charge [is] entirely the responsibility of the bankrupt current Labour mayor of London”.
Seasoned observers of the capital’s politics see this as something of a phoney war. Tony Travers, director of the research group LSE London, says: “What lies behind this is a potential embarrassment from the government’s point of view.” One way or another, he says, TfL, running an interconnected transport network of unparalleled size, will have to be given billions of pounds – whether renationalised, by being taken under government control, or via money handed to Khan. And that spending will be described as a “bailout” for Londoners, at far more per capita than is given to northern cities. “It’s designed to make it look like London can pay. But in the end, all these measures are not going to amount to anything like as much as the central government support that will be necessary.” Quite how much money Shapps and his department estimate an expanded congestion charge can raise is unknown. The government-commissioned KPMG review into TfL’s finances – a condition of it receiving the first tranche of funding in May – has been withheld. Even TfL’s commissioner, Andy Byford, has seen only a two-thirds-redacted version. Meanwhile, City Hall refuses to dignify the hostile proposal with so much as a back-of-a-fag-packet calculation. Apart from the politics, an estimate is difficult to pin down. The technicalities of extending the charge are in place: London’s ultra low emission zone (Ulez) is already to be extended to the wider boundary from next October, monitored with cameras for number-plate recognition. Any driver using a vehicle that falls below emissions standards – all but the newest diesels, and old petrol models – will have to pay £12.50 a day, for any journey, or face an £80 fine.
But while many drivers have arguably had time to ditch or upgrade a polluting vehicle, a wholesale charge on cars now would be very different. Alexander Jan, a former chief economist at Arup and a former London transport adviser, has calculated that, even with the bulk of the shortfall made up by dramatic council tax hikes and fare rises, TfL would be left looking to make £650m from a wider charge. That is equal to an average of £305 a year for each car-owning household in Greater London. Restrict that to boroughs within the zone, and the per-household burden more than doubles. However, the calculation – both political and financial – is more complex. Car ownership, and reliance on cars, is much higher in boroughs outside the extended zone, but as an RAC Foundation analysis has shown, more than half of work journeys by drivers living in those outer suburbs would enter the new charging zone. Residents living in a charge zone have generally qualified for a 90% discount, but those entering from outside pay the full whack. “If you had to drive, and pay £15 a day, you’d have to pay £5,500 a year,” says Jan. Neither, he says, should it be sold as a congestion charge if it is simply for revenue-raising. “You need to be very clear about the objectives. One of the weaknesses of the current zone has been that traffic speed started falling, with road space reallocated. That infuriates motorists who pay £15 and haven’t seen congestion reduced.” A “cellular” or zonal approach would also be needed, says Travers, or it would risk such unintended consequences as an actual increase in people driving into central London: those who have already been charged for a local journey, or who beneft from a wider residents’ discount zone, might decide to drive into the central area as well. How much would it produce? Travers says: “It sounds like hundreds of millions rather the billions needed. It’s not an easy way to make quick, large amounts of money for TfL.” Sian Berry, the Green party co-leader and London mayoral candidate, has backed Khan in the row with government – not least because other conditions suggested include ending free travel for under-18s and raising public transport fares. The extension of the C-charge zone would be “a bad tax”, she says, “not progressive or related to your ability to pay.”
Neither, Berry notes, does sufficient public transport even exist for many journeys across or between outer boroughs: “We need more buses, but for now people are using cars.” However, she says, drivers should pay something: “Unlike farepayers, the people who drive in the rest of London don’t contribute, not even to the potholes.” The Greens have been pushing an alternative since 2016: a smart road-pricing plan, using a meter to tot up charges. According to their initial studies it could have raised £500m a year – about 50% more than now, but a sum never intended to plug the financial hole left by Covid-19. Road pricing is backed by the thinktank Centre for London, as well as transport-user group London TravelWatch. Its director, Emma Gibson, says supporters of charging were “wrongfooted” by the sudden proposals to extend the current system, which would be counterproductive. However, she says, it should open up the debate: the pandemic could lead to progress if politicians end up “finally proposing an equitable and effective solution to reducing traffic on our roads”. The short-term result of Covid-19 has been a comparative upsurge in car use. It is now at about 90% of pre-pandemic levels, while train and Tube passenger numbers are barely a third of normal. Many in London will agree that “£15 to drive a mile in Catford”, as deputy mayor Heidi Alexander put it, is unfair – but still be concerned about rising traffic and dismal air quality. Berry says: “We should be given some breathing space to decide on a fairer system – and government support in the meantime. Otherwise we’re going to end up either with TfL bankrupt, or something that rinses Londoners for the next 10 years.”"
2020-10-24T07:00:18Z,politics,Politics,"With the Brexit walkout and sulk over, is the UK on the home straight for a deal?","British officials close to the Brexit negotiations had said Downing Street would be mindful of the “atmospherics” at last Friday’s EU summit when deciding on the next steps. It was, it would seem, a sniff test. The leaders gathered in Brussels apparently failed it. The result was a walkout of sorts by the prime minister, only resolved once Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, publicly acknowledged that British flexibility in the talks would need to be reciprocated. The negotiation resumed on Thursday. There has since been much talk from Downing Street of a victory: the EU agreed to a 10-point plan as to how things would henceforth work. There would be daily talks, a centrally held legal text to be worked upon, and either the chief negotiators or their deputies would be in contact every 24 hours to maintain focus on progress. Perhaps it did need a sulk to get to that point, but the EU wants a deal, and an uptick in the speed of the talks could have been expected.
What is clear is that Downing Street was always very concerned with those atmospherics. “As [Barnier] made clear, ‘any future agreement will be made in respect of the decision-making autonomy of the European Union and with respect for British sovereignty’,” the No 10 spokesman said. The hope in Brussels is that the mood music is important to Downing Street, because the prime minister is ready to push out of his comfort zone. He was simply discomfited by the dominant public narrative that the UK had to be the one conceding. That narrative wasn’t true. The bloc has ditched its opening demand that the UK follow Brussels’ state aid laws, for a start. But that was all some time ago. A corrective in the public consciousness may have been necessary. That is fine. Stitching together and promoting complicated compromises to keep national electorates happy or blissfully unawareis what Brussels does. What is of more concern, however, is that for all this week’s hurly-burly, the gaps between the sides remain significant and the deal at the end of it remains thin. Johnson’s Brexit deal will still leave the UK £70bn worse off than if it had remained in the EU. GDP is expected to be 3.5% lower in 10 years’ time. A no-deal outcome would inflict roughly twice that amount of damage, and so there is certainly a significant bauble for Johnson to secure. But there remains the outside chance – and it is very much an outside chance – of disaster if the EU side does not set the price quite right for their “zero tariff, zero quota” deal. And for each issue there are potentially destabilising clashes on principle to come.
On domestic subsidy control, the UK has started working with the EU on the rules to be included in the trade deal that both sides’ state aid systems will have to respect. It is a matter of finding the right balance, of allowing diversion by the UK while assuring the EU side that there are means for recompense where trade is distorted. But there is a more thorny ideological principle at stake. The UK has said it will write into the deal a reference to the continued role of the Competition and Markets Authority to maintain fair trade. But it has not said this body will ex-ante approve domestic subsidies. Such a body is a must-have to the EU side. Yet it is difficult to imagine that a set of hard and fast rules, governed by a new bit of Whitehall bureaucracy, as being part of the light-touch vision of Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. When it comes to fisheries, France is counselling its fishermen to brace for change and the UK is open to talking numbers. But there will be winners and losers. Again, there are some principled positions to grapple with. Paris is adamant that the fishermen in the English Channel are in a different situation. They have fished in the waters of La Manche for centuries and nothing should change in their quotas. The UK is adamant that they will change, and insists it must be able to decide annually whether to give access at all to foreign fishing fleets, a right that Norway already enjoys. While it would become a pro-forma decision, it would be a disconcerting one for European fishing communities. Finally, there is the matter of governance, which is as important as it is technical. The EU says it needs a system where binding decisions can be swiftly made as to whether either party has breached the comprehensive free trade agreement. And there needs to be the power to hit the other side with a sanction in a part of the economy where it will hurt. For the UK, this feels all too close to being an association agreement, the likes of which may be more suitable for a country seeking to be enveloped into the EU’s sphere rather than pushing away from it. A breach on issues of goods should be dealt with by a sanction within that chapter of the deal. It is complicated and it is legalistic. But we have had the theatrics, for good or bad. The fate of the deal now lies squarely in the detail and the negotiating room. • This article was amended on 28 October 2020 to correct the name of the Competition and Markets Authority."
2020-10-23T16:40:22Z,politics,Politics,Treasury confirms it is to end VAT waiver on PPE in UK,"Face masks and gloves will cost more from the end of this month after the government said a temporary waiver of VAT on personal protective equipment (PPE) would not be extended, the Guardian has learned. The Treasury confirmed that the 20% sales tax would once more apply to protective equipment bought by firms and consumers from November, after a six-month exemption. While care homes and the healthcare sector can access PPE from the Department of Health and Social Care, the increase could mean extra costs for businesses and ordinary people, who are legally bound to use masks in shops and on public transport. The government initially cut the tax to zero on 1 May to “relieve the burden of VAT on the price of purchasing PPE used for protection from coronavirus by frontline workers”. The measure applied to PPE approved for use by Public Health England and was aimed in particular at care homes, to help them buy stocks of masks, gloves and gowns, amid a flood of infections in the sector and a global scramble for equipment. The total saving to care homes and companies is thought to have been more than £300m over six months. Health and social care providers are now able to source PPE via a government portal designed for the purpose. But private sector businesses in the food wholesale and retail sectors, as well as ordinary consumers, cannot. Food and convenience store wholesalers warned that they and other businesses that are obliged to use PPE are now facing increased costs just when they are struggling most. James Bielby, chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, said: “There couldn’t be a worse time to inflict extra costs on the food supply chain. Wholesalers have been trading at a loss for months because of the restrictions on their hospitality customers. Some of them have lost 80% of their business and are struggling to maintain their contracts to schools, hospitals and care homes. “To burden them with a 20% increase in the price of equipment that they rely on to carry out their operations is kicking them when they are down and it will only increase the existing risk to food distribution to vulnerable groups. “The reasons for introducing a zero rate haven’t changed, and we face months of further Covid-19 measures. It’s disappointing that the zero rate isn’t being continued for as long as Covid restrictions on trade are in place.” Dawood Pervez, managing director of convenience store supplier Bestway Wholesale, said: “An increase of 20% is a significant amount, and it is a surprising move if we all wish to keep safe and control the pandemic. “There is little doubt that increases in price will slow demand and act as a barrier to buying PPE for some, at a time when many peoples’ income has been reduced due to the pandemic, and every penny in their shopping basket counts.” The Treasury confirmed that VAT would apply to PPE from 1 November, but advised firms to reclaim it as a business expense. An official said the cut was only ever intended to maintain the supply to healthcare providers, not to reduce costs for businesses and consumers."
2020-10-23T16:10:56Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 20,530 people test positive in 24 hours; Nottingham to enter tier 3 'next week' - as it happened","Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a five-level system for restricting peopleâ€™s movements and limiting physical contact as part of new measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 in Scotland. The system includes a top level that is tougher than the highest of Englandâ€™s three tiers, which Sturgeon said would be closer to the lockdown imposed across the UK in late March. Here is a guide to the five levels. Hundreds of cafes, restaurants, pubs and local councils across England rallied behind Marcus Rashfordâ€™s campaign to end child food poverty, announcing they will step in to provide disadvantaged children with free school meals during the October half-term after the government refused to do so. The acts of generosity, from Blyth to Falmouth, come amid a difficult time for the hospitality sector and austerity-stricken councils alike. Rashford tweeted: â€œSelflessness, kindness, togetherness, this is the England I know.â€� Downing Street declined to welcome the development. Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions are expected to come into force in parts of Nottinghamshire by Wednesday, PA Media reported. Itâ€™s understood that MPs from the region were briefed this morning and that a government announcement is due on Monday. The areas reported to be in line for the highest level of restrictions are Nottingham city, Rushcliffe, Broxtowe and Gedling. Warrington borough council has agreed a deal with the government to move into tier 3 as rates of infection remain high, the Warrington Guardian reported. The Cheshire town will become a tier 3 area next week, with the exact date still to be confirmed. The council said it was getting Â£5.9m in central government support, made up of just under Â£1.7m for local testing and other public health measures, and Â£4.2m to help businesses and staff. The UK R number is down slightly but remains above 1, according to the latest data from Sage. The estimate for R for the whole of the UK is between 1.2 and 1.4. Last week, it was between 1.3 and 1.5. The death rate for patients with coronavirus has increased in England for the first time since the peak of the outbreak in April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The Welsh first minister defended his governmentâ€™s decision to stop supermarkets from selling â€œnon-essentialâ€� goods during the two-week firebreak, which begins at 6pm today. Amid criticism that the decision was sprung on stores at the last minute and claims that it is impossible to judge what is an essential item, Mark Drakeford said it wasnâ€™t fair to order high street shops that trade in non-essential items to shut while still allowing supermarkets to sell the same goods. The Welsh government was also criticised for not giving details of its â€œexit strategyâ€� from the 17-day firebreak. Drakeford said ministers would meet next week to continue to discuss the national restrictions that will follow the firebreak. More than 1,000 businesses in Blackpool called on Boris Johnson to save the seaside town from â€œcatastrophicâ€� damage caused by tier 3 restrictions, LancsLive reported. In an open letter, they state the financial settlement for Lancashire is â€œnowhere near sufficientâ€� to support those businesses that have been forced to close, in addition to those who are expected to continue to trade against a backdrop of cancellations and shattered consumer confidence.

2020-10-23T14:32:29Z,politics,Politics,Andy Burnham: former New Labour high flyer cast as 'king of the north',"Andy Burnham barely had his headphones on in time for Dave from Rochdale to put a flea in his ear. “Good afternoon, Andy,” the first caller to the BBC Radio Manchester phone-in said, before observing that Burnham was “not flavour of the month” in London. “Basically,” he said, “should you consider resigning?” Burnham thought not, and Janet from Bolton agreed. “Hello Andy,” she said. “You’ve done everything you possibly can. How are you feeling in yourself?” “Completely knackered,” Burnham replied, and even his greatest critics would understand why. Over the past fortnight, the mayor of Greater Manchester – who since taking office has had to deal with a terrorist attack, an austerity-driven funding crunch, and the alarming sight of his former seat of Leigh being taken by a Tory for the first time – has found himself at the centre of a ferocious battle over central government funding as the region enters tier 3 coronavirus restrictions. By the end of negotiations, the mayor was asking for £65m, the government offering £60m; then, at least in the Burnham camp’s telling, the government pulled the plug. During a press conference on the steps of the Bridgewater Hall, Burnham accused Boris Johnson of “playing poker with people’s lives”, and broke off when shown an email setting out funding of just £22m to call the move “brutal” and “frankly disgraceful”.
One journalist called him a “showboat”, and Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed he was “cheap and disagreeable”. But if the crowd that gathered and cheered as he spoke was any measure, Mancunians disagreed. Eventually, the £60m was found, and while nobody would say Burnham had triumphed, nobody could deny he had been heard. If his opponents view him as an opportunist, Burnham’s advocates suggest the coronavirus crisis and accompanying sense of an English divide have established him as exactly the voice that the north of England – not just Greater Manchester – needs. “The role suits Andy, no question – he has the experience, the reputation, the popular standing to make it his own,” said Lucy Powell, the Labour MP for Manchester Central. “Without him in that job, I’m not sure it would have cut through in the same way.” By all accounts, Burnham is in his element, conducting endless Zoom meetings and media interviews from his son’s attic bedroom and making the hour-long bike ride into Manchester once a week to work in an almost deserted office. In a febrile political climate he has largely maintained unity among the council leaders and local MPs whose backing he needs, even the Conservatives. One person present in a meeting of council leaders considering their response to the government’s latest offer recalls the Tory leader of Bolton council, David Greenhalgh, summarising the mood of the room by saying: “What a clusterfuck.”
Greenhalgh ultimately agreed to negotiate a separate deal for Bolton. But by and large, even those who are not instinctively aligned with Burnham have viewed his approach as an effective one. “His attempts to paint himself as the northern champion, sometimes it can ring a bit hollow and seem like PR,” said James Schneider, a former director of strategic communications for Jeremy Corbyn. “And sometimes it can lead him to have much more thoughtful, interesting, surprising politics than the rest of his part of the party. At the moment, it’s been pretty much pitch perfect.” A search for articles featuring Burnham’s name and “king of the north” in the last week throws up 21 results, and only three mention his eyelashes. These days, a ship that seemed to have sailed has crept back on to the horizon: again and again, he is being asked whether he might ultimately like to be prime minister. In his early New Labour days, such questions seemed unlikely. As a special adviser in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and centre-forward for the “Demon Eyes” football team, he was viewed as an effective operator, but with the Milibands, Ed Balls and James Purnell around, he was never the golden boy.
“He was a very nice guy with a good brain, and he had more Labour authenticity than a lot of the posh southerners,” said Tim Allan, a Demon Eyes teammate and former adviser to Tony Blair who went on to found the PR agency Portland. “You would have said he would have stayed around, being involved, but not that he would have gone on to run Greater Manchester. But a lot of the more obvious superstars of that era just aren’t on the stage any more.” Burnham was smart, ambitious, and perhaps the victim of his own success. Chris Smith, his boss at DCMS, views his former protege as having done “an extraordinary job” in the last fortnight “with real passion and authority”. But, he suggests, his rapid rise through the ranks left him straitjacketed. “It was perhaps to his disadvantage that his talent saw him promoted so soon,” Smith said. “I think one of his mistakes for a time was not allowing the passion that we’ve seen in the last few days to come through. He felt he had to be the identikit politician, always looking over his shoulder.” If the nadir of his orthodoxy was what Schneider called a “very stupid rightwing campaign” during his second Labour leadership bid in 2015, in which he missed the mood of the membership so colossally that he launched it at Ernst & Young with a promise that “the entrepreneur will be as much our hero as the nurse”, it was also a blessing in disguise. (A source close to Burnham said that the recollection “still pierces my heart”.)
“I was trying to climb the pole, wasn’t I, in my early years in politics,” Burnham told GQ last year. “I was. I wanted to ‘get on’. It was later that I started to reevaluate a lot of things.” The transition to the mayoralty was, perhaps, as pragmatic as it was idealistic. “One of Andy’s gifts is to convince himself that the best thing for him also happens to be the right thing to do,” said a member of Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet. But Margaret Aspinall, the Hillsborough campaigner who became friends with Burnham through his crucial work on that cause, gives that view short shrift. “He is absolutely true to his convictions,” she said. “A lot of politicians, they give you the tea and sympathy and then they slam the door in your face. He fought for us.” If that pugilism has come to national attention in the last fortnight, it has been a righteous feature of Burnham’s political style for some time. “I think we’ve lost the art of anger,” he said in that GQ interview. “I only found my anger late in my parliamentary career.” Thus freed to speak for himself and for his region, would he really give it up for another shot at Westminster? Like Johnson when he was London mayor, he has it both ways, telling interviewers that he expects his current role to be “my last job in politics” but that he “wouldn’t rule it out”. One current Labour frontbencher views the equivocation as mere reflex. “I suspect he doesn’t have serious ambitions to lead the party any more, and of course that’s hugely liberating,” he said. “He’s not calculating, he’s just being, and that’s why it’s working. It’s been a long time since the north has had such a powerful voice.”"
2020-10-23T13:05:19Z,politics,Politics,UK presses for use of faster passport gates at EU airports post-Brexit,"Boris Johnson has clashed with Brussels over an 11th-hour attempt to save British passport holders from hours of delays at European airports from the end of the year. The government is seeking continued use by UK nationals of the automatic e-gates used by EU nationals at airports and Eurostar terminals. The move is seen by the European commission as an attempt to keep Britons in faster lanes rather than having to queue up with the rest of the world after the end of the transition period. Studies suggest the loss of access to automatic gates and the need for extra passport checks could delay Britons by an extra hour as they move through some European airports. The issue has been raised in the ongoing trade and security negotiations, and the government has made contact with a number of member states in an attempt to retain access to the e-gates. The commission is adamant that giving UK nationals such a right would breach EU law. “The Schengen border code is restrictive on this,” says one internal EU document seen by the Guardian. It is understood that the commission called in representatives of the member states for a presentation on “treating UK nationals at the Schengen borders” after the issue was raised by the British negotiating team. At the meeting on 12 October, it was asked whether e-gates could be opened to UK nationals carrying biometric passports. The commission responded: “No, EU law currently reserves use of e-gates to holders of EU/EEA/CH passports.” CH is the country code for Switzerland. Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway are in the European economic area (EEA) but not the EU. A senior EU diplomat said: “Having grown up in Brussels, Boris Johnson values the ability to travel freely to the continent. So it is perfectly apt that the UK is now asking the EU to change its own laws to accommodate London on something it always had. We are probably in for another re-run of ‘the EU is being unfair’, ‘we’re only asking for a Canada-style deal’. It isn’t.” The UK allows citizens of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the US, Singapore and South Korea to use biometric passports to pass through automatic gates on arrival. The government has said in a paper on the UK’s post-Brexit border operating model that it will “ensure that EU, EEA and Swiss citizens may also continue to use our e-passport gates and the existing queueing arrangements”. But in a sign that EU intransigence on the issue could lead to a tit-for-tat restriction on European travellers, the paper adds that “this will be kept under review”. The commission has advised the member states that the e-gates could be used where a UK national is exiting its territory, but not on entry. The member state would have to have a national entry-exit system and the passport of the British national would need to be stamped, reducing the benefits of use of the automated border control. Officials at one of Europe’s biggest airports, Schiphol in Amsterdam, through which roughly 5 million people travel from the UK each year, expect British travellers to face considerable delays. As it stands, Britons spend on average around 25 seconds at the passport control desk at Schiphol. It is estimated this will increase to 40-45 seconds next year due to the need for additional document checks. With each person taking longer to get through passport control, it could take between 50 minutes and an hour more for a passenger on a busy flight to get through the system. It is understood that EU capitals have been informed that it may be possible for UK nationals to use the e-gates at some point in 2022 should a new IT project registering entry and exit be rolled out by the EU on current schedule. The system’s introduction has already been delayed by two years. The European commission and the Home Office declined to comment."
2020-10-22T17:33:09Z,politics,Politics,In the battle of Tory egos it's the 'Man in the Know' Sunak show | John Crace,"The government moves in mysterious ways. Only on Tuesday, it had been unable to find an extra £5m to secure a deal with Andy Burnham and other local leaders to take Greater Manchester into tier 3. And on Wednesday there had been no money available for the poorest children, who will tiresomely insist on still wanting to be fed when not in school, to get free meals during the holidays up until next Easter. But on Thursday the Magic Money Tree was dripping with cash. Rishi Sunak has only been chancellor for about eight months, but I’ve already lost count of how many budgets he’s delivered since March. We must be into double figures by now. His winter economy plan that was announced at the tail end of last month hasn’t even survived till the end of autumn – and is now on to its third iteration. Some may see this as a weakness in strategic planning. A failure to predict what was only too obvious to most of the rest of the country. But Sunak prefers to give his policies a more positive spin. He likes to see himself as the Man in the Know; someone who can react to fast-changing events at speed. After all, who could possibly have guessed that the UK – along with the rest of Europe – was heading for a second wave of coronavirus? Other than the government scientists who had been saying just that for months. So Sunak was back in the Commons to deliver yet another round of financial help for businesses affected by Covid-19. The costings could wait for another day, as Sunak prefers not to let the details of how he will eventually pay for things – austerity or higher taxes – take the gloss off his moment in the limelight. First was a bailout for all businesses affected by being in tier 2. This was backdated to August just to prove that he wasn’t just bothered about London and the West Midlands, but really, really cared about the north-west too. If he’d announced all this just a week ago, he could have saved the government a world of pain. Then there was going to be more help for businesses who would now only have to pay 5% of the wages of employees who only worked one day per week. This wouldn’t make the worker any better off and more likely to be able to pay the bills, but it would at least make it more likely they still had a job. Which was something. And finally the government was going to double the support for the self-employed from 20% to 40%, so they would also go broke a little less quickly. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, wasn’t quite as enthusiastic about the new proposals as Sunak seemed to expect. She called them “too little, too late” and observed that the best part of a million jobs had already been lost as a result of the government not having acted sooner. Nor did she wholly buy the idea that the measures weren’t being driven by London and the West Midlands and that the north-west had been tacked on as an expedient afterthought. What was required, she concluded, wasn’t the whole country gradually edging its way into tier 3: it was a “circuit breaker” to halt the rise in infections. Though this did rather presume that the government could introduce an effective test-and-trace system. Even as she spoke, the latest statistics were published showing performance going from bad to worse. But Rishi wasn’t here to listen to any of the naysayers. He is a man with the effortless self-belief and thin-skinned vanity of a multimillionaire who is never likely to experience financial hardship and just wanted to lap up the plaudits of the crowd. He got unexpectedly tetchy when accused of going for a cheap photo opportunity in Wagamama – Sunak doesn’t do anything on the cheap – and instead chose to wallow in the love of his own benches. This was his day. His moment in the sun and nobody was going to spoil it. At times like this, he gives the impression he believes his brand is bigger than that of his own party. The fawning proved far too much for Boris Johnson, who had appeared for the opening half-hour, and he sloped off just as Andrew Mitchell was declaring his undying love for the chancellor. There’s only space for one narcissist in the room when Boris is around. So just as well the prime minister had gone awol, otherwise he would have had to listen to Tory Matt Vickers describe Rishi as “the man, the myth, the legend”. Sunak could only nod in agreement. What no one mentioned of course, was that we had been here countless times before. Each of Sunak’s previous recent budget statements, which had proved to be hopelessly inadequate, had been received with nothing but adulation. But that was then and this is now. The past wasn’t just a foreign country it was a nonexistent country. And when, in a month or so’s time, Sunak came to the Commons to announce yet more measures, they too would be greeted with the excitement and shock of the new. The battle of the egos was resumed later in the afternoon when Johnson and Sunak combined to give a joint Downing Street press conference. And though neither had anything new to say, it was Sunak who was the clear winner on points. Boris merely repeated his shtick of mumbling incoherently while casually mixing in the odd lie about anything that caught his fancy – he looks increasingly fed up with the job and only capable of dealing with a reality that he would like to exist – while Rishi sounded totally confident and at ease. Even when he is having to explain why his previous measures have been inadequate, he manages to maintain the pretence that his mistakes were deliberate. Still, Sunak shouldn’t get too relaxed about being top dog. Because the person showing most sincerity was Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser and the third person in the room. And though he was doing his best to be optimistic, he didn’t have much cheer on offer. The test-and trace system was still a mess and that was really the only way out of the current situation. We were stuck with the virus, and we were stuck with a government committed to a tiering system from which no region was likely to escape downwards anytime soon. It was going to be a long winter."

2020-10-22T16:21:26Z,politics,Politics,Changes to the coronavirus job support scheme in England explained,"The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced an expansion of the government’s new furlough scheme. Announced alongside a package of business grants for companies in areas facing higher levels of coronavirus restrictions, the expansion comes less than a month after Sunak first announced the job support scheme (JSS) to replace furlough. What has changed? Under the old system announced in late September, the JSS was designed to support the wages of employees who worked at least 33% of their usual hours. The company would pay full wages for the hours an employee worked. For the hours a worker was away from their job, the government would pay 33% of their wages, and firms would need to contribute a further 33%. The system was designed to help companies suffering a fall in business during the pandemic and needing to put staff on reduced hours to save money. Companies could choose to top-up pay to 100%. The scheme was due to launch on 1 November, after the furlough scheme closes next week. Analysts at the Resolution Foundation had warned it would be more cost-effective for businesses to cut jobs, because keeping one employee on full hours would be cheaper than having two workers receiving part-time pay on the JSS. After the changes announced on Thursday, an employee now needs to only work 20% of their usual hours to benefit from the JSS. The government has also cut the level of employer contribution from 33% – to just 5%. This means the government will pay 62% of a worker’s wages for the time they are away from their job. According to the Resolution Foundation, the cost after the changes for a firm looking to keep a typical furloughed worker on for half their normal hours has now been reduced by 85%, falling from £233 to £35 a month. The new system will replace the coronavirus job retention scheme – commonly known as furlough – which was launched in March to cover 80% of workers’ wages. After being gradually scaled back since the start of July, the furlough scheme included a 20% employer contribution and 60% from the government in October. Workers still received 80% of their normal pay. It also sits alongside the coronavirus job retention bonus – which offers companies £1,000 for keeping a furloughed worker on their books until at least the end of January. What support is available in tier 2? The expansion of the JSS is designed to aid companies suffering a drop in business in areas subject to “high” alert tier 2 restrictions, which include curfews on opening hours and bans on people from different households meeting. The chancellor also announced cash grants of up to £2,100 per month primarily for businesses in the hospitality, accommodation and leisure sector, which may be adversely impacted by the restrictions in high-alert level areas. The Treasury said the grants would be made available retrospectively for areas that have already been subject to restrictions. The Treasury said it estimated the grants could benefit around 150,000 businesses in England, including hotels, restaurants and B&Bs, which aren’t legally required to close but have been adversely affected by local restrictions nonetheless.
What support is available in tier 3? Sunak announced an expansion of the JSS earlier this month for businesses in “very high” tier 3 alert level areas which have been forced to close their doors. Known as the “job support scheme: closed” the system of wage subsidies is different from the “job support scheme: open” because it requires no contribution to be made to workers’ wages from businesses. It also does not require an employee to work a minimum number of hours. Under the JSS: closed, the government will pay two-thirds (67%) of a worker’s usual wages. Employers pay no wages, although must still pay national insurance and pensions contributions. The government has also made available business grants of up to £3,000 a month open to companies in tier 3 areas. Ministers have also pledged to provide support to local authorities for helping businesses in their local areas."
2020-10-22T14:56:56Z,politics,Politics,"Stoke, Slough and Coventry moved into tier 2 Covid measures","Hundreds of thousands of people in Stoke-on-Trent, Coventry and Slough are facing tougher Covid-19 restrictions including a ban on households mixing socially indoors. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that from Saturday the three areas would move into tier 2 of England’s three-tier system. He said rates of infection were surging in the areas, with a “concerning” increase in coronavirus cases among people aged over 60, prompting the government to act. Unveiling the new measures in the House of Commons on Thursday, Hancock said: “Unfortunately we’re seeing rising rates of infection in Stoke-on-Trent, in Coventry and in Slough. In all of these areas there are over 100 positive cases per 100,000 people, cases are doubling around every fortnight, and we’re seeing a concerning increase of cases among the over-60s.
“So we’ve agreed, in partnership with local leaders, to move these areas into the high local alert level, coming into force at one minute past midnight on Saturday. The central change is that people cannot now meet other households socially indoors. This applies in any setting, at home or in a restaurant or any other venue. “The rule of six still applies to any outdoor setting and although you may continue to travel to open venues, you should reduce the number of journeys where possible.” Thanking local leaders for their work and cooperation, Hancock sought to reassure people living in the three areas that they would be supported by the government, including with new economic measures announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, earlier on Thursday. Hancock said the government was formally beginning talks with Warrington, in Cheshire, about moving it into the highest alert level, tier 3. In tier 2, hospitality businesses such as pubs and restaurants are allowed to remain open but people are only allowed to visit them with members of their own household, or support bubble. Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire, has a population of 256,375, Coventry’s population is 371,521, and 149,539 live in Slough, in Berkshire, according to a 2019 mid-year estimate by the Office for National Statistics. Responding in the Commons, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, pressed the government over its decision not to follow the guidance of scientific advisers and enact a nationwide “circuit breaker” lockdown. He expressed concern that the approach taken by ministers meant tougher action would be necessary in the coming weeks. “We’re only in autumn, winter has not hit us yet,” he said.
Hancock pledged to give councils stronger enforcement powers to shut premises on public health grounds “without delay”. He told MPs: “As part of local discussions … local authorities including the LGA [Local Government Association] have asked for stronger enforcement powers, and I agree.”
He added: “The proposals that we’ll bring forward will mean councils will be able to act without delay and use closure notices to shut premises on public health grounds to help suppress the virus. We’ll work with local authorities in the coming days on the details of these proposals so we can act in a firm and fast way against the minority who are breaching these lifesaving rules.” Hancock said the daily Covid-19 testing capacity was now more than 370,000. “I’m delighted to be able to tell the house that yesterday we began the rollout of lateral flow tests to schools and universities,” he said. “Lateral flow tests don’t require a lab or a machine – the kit gives you the result within minutes. We’ve successfully purchased many millions of these tests and they’ll allow us both to find the virus where it spreads and to reduce the disruption that virus control measures inevitably create.” The tests will be introduced to councils from Thursday, starting with Stoke-on-Trent."
2020-10-22T14:40:44Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: £3bn standoff over UK-EU scientific collaboration,"The UK’s post-Brexit collaboration with European scientists hangs in the balance after it emerged that the EU offer of staying in the Horizon research programme could leave London with a £3bn deficit. “The financial negotiations are not in a good position and the offer that the [European] commission has made to the UK is not appealing,” Vivienne Stern, the director of Universities UK International, told a Lords Brexit committee on Thursday. Top researchers are concerned that Boris Johnson is now preparing to walk away from Horizon Europe, which is one of the most ambitious science funding programmes in the world and the successor to the €80bn (£72bn) Horizon 2020 fund. The issue is a stumbling block but Stern has urged both sides to “compromise on costs” and reach a deal that provides continuity for one of Britain’s most successful sectors. She told peers the EU had offered a “one way” financial formula to stay in Horizon Europe, under which the UK would contribute about £15.2bn to the programme’s seven-year budget, with top up funding if the the country won research projects worth more than that. But if the value of the awards to British science fell short of the investment, the UK would not be reimbursed. Stern said: “In order to receive an equivalent to £15bn in receipts, we need to win 16% of funding from the programme. We currently will win 12.7%, so that implies that even if we continue to participate at the current level, there would be a net contribution over the life of the programme’s seven years at about £3bn. Now, even we think that doesn’t look fair, and we’ve been saying to our European counterparts.” Scientists are desperate for a deal and have said they are already struggling to stay in research programmes with EU nations because of the uncertainty. While the UK government has said it will provide replacement funding to scientists in Britain, peers were told that money alone was no substitute for the “intangible” value of Horizon Europe. “Continuing involvement in European science programmes is absolutely vital to UK science,” Sir Richard Catlow, the vice-president of the Royal Society, told the Lords subcommittee on EU services. “It’s not just about money, it’s about networks and collaboration. We will be a poorer nation scientifically and a poor nation generally without.” Catlow said a “modest net contribution” to Horizon Europe was probably reasonable because of the wider benefit of remaining part of international teams. With time running out for Brexit negotiations, there are no guarantees there will be deals on elements of the future relationship with the EU beyond trade. “If we get to the end of December and there’s no negotiated outcome,” said Stern, the best thing would be to “try to get back to the table on research collaboration”. It was a bridge that could still be built, she said, and “with compromise on both sides on the cost question, it is a deal that could be done fairly quickly”. Earlier, the committee heard the UK was the “most prolific producer of research” in science and medicine after the US and China, but “was ranked first internationally every year since 2007” when measured by the impact on a particular field. Universities receive £6.5bn for research a year, with 11% of the funding coming from the EU. After the US, British scientists’ “most frequent partners” are Germany and France, Stern said. • This article was amended on 23 October 2020 because an earlier version said universities receive £600bn for research. This has been corrected to £6.5bn."
2020-10-22T14:16:11Z,politics,Politics,Treasury denies Rishi Sunak's restaurant meeting broke Covid rules,"Rishi Sunak did not flout lockdown rules by holding a meeting in a branch of a pizza chain in Waterloo to discuss his latest business support package, because it was “not a functioning restaurant at the time”, the Treasury has said. The Treasury issued a press release featuring 12 photos of the chancellor and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, sitting around a table at a branch of Franco Manca in south London with representatives of hospitality businesses. The mixing of members of different households in indoor hospitality settings is currently prohibited in the capital, and office staff are urged to work from home where possible.
Boris Johnson’s official spokesman was asked on Thursday about whether business meetings could be held in restaurants or cafes in areas under tier 2 restrictions. He said: “There is an exemption for work meetings to take place in hospitality settings. Our intention when providing that exemption had been to provide the opportunity for freelancers or for the self-employed who didn’t have an office space to work in, to use hospitality if necessary.” He added: “What we would ask people to do wherever possible is to hold meetings remotely, via phone or via video conference or whatever it might be.” Challenged about whether Sunak had broken the rules, a Treasury spokesperson said: “The restaurant was not a functioning restaurant at the time. There were no customers in the restaurant at the time and it was all Covid-secure including face masks worn and social distanced.” Attendees were pictured seated apart from one another around long tables, with pastries and water.
Aides said Sunak believed it was important to show his support and solidarity with the hard-hit hospitality sector, which has been pressing for more financial backing for months. Sunak had previously been criticised for launching his “eat out to help out” scheme in the summer by serving food at a branch of the noodle chain Wagamama without wearing a face mask – though they were not mandatory for hospitality staff until September. Treasury announcements are meticulously branded and often feature Sunak’s signature prominently, sometimes to the irritation of Tory colleagues. Adviser Cass Horowitz is often credited with burnishing his personal brand."
2020-10-22T13:11:12Z,politics,Politics,"Sunak has stopped digging, but can he clamber out of his Covid hole?","U-turns are always hard for politicians but Rishi Sunak’s was more humiliating than most. It was only last month that the chancellor was congratulating himself on the generosity of his winter economy plan, which scaled back the Treasury’s financial support just as the Covid-19 pandemic was entering a more threatening phase. Yet from the moment Sunak announced the details of his WEP it was clear that he would have to come up with more or risk businesses go bust in their droves. Now the chancellor has sought to address the design flaws by reducing the amount employers will need to contribute to top up the wages of employees working part-time, by making government grants more widely available to struggling businesses, and by increasing support for the self-employed. Sunak hopes this will deal with two problems, one national and one local. The national problem was the contribution the Treasury expected businesses to make to the wages of part-time employers at a time when the summer recovery in the economy has petered out. Under the furlough scheme, the state paid 80% of a worker’s wages and employers paid nothing. From August, the employers’ contribution rose gradually to 20% this month. The job support scheme replaces the furlough next month, and was designed to help those doing a third of their normal hours. For the remaining time, the plan was for the costs to be split equally between the Treasury, the employer and the worker. So employers would be paying 55% of the wage costs for someone working 33% of the time. This made it more expensive for employers to hire two part-time workers than one full-time worker. The new plan is aimed at preventing the inevitable layoff that would result by reducing the minimum hours needed to be worked to 20% and by reducing the contribution of employers to the top-up to 5%. According to the Treasury, that means that if someone was being paid £587 for their unworked hours, the government would be contributing £543 and their employer only £44. There was also a local problem caused by the government’s tiered approach to tackling Covid-19. Businesses in the highest tier – tier 3 – that were forced to close would have 66% of the wage bill covered by the state; but businesses in tier 2 not forced to shut but suffering from a drop in demand received no extra help. Hospitality businesses in London have been especially critical, and the chancellor has responded both with the more generous job support scheme and through grants of up to £2,100 a month, paid retrospectively. Sunak’s volte-face follows a well-established political principle that when you are in a hole the first thing to do is to stop digging. Clambering out of the pit will be no easy task, however. The self-employed, who will receive grants worth 40% of their normal income, will rightly feel aggrieved they are being treated less generously than employees. There could be more U-turns to come. • Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."
2020-10-21T18:41:00Z,politics,Politics,Angela Rayner apologises for calling Tory MP 'scum' in Commons,"The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has apologised for calling a Tory MP “scum” in the House of Commons after he criticised her party’s opposition to the government’s handling of the pandemic. In heated scenes in the chamber during a debate on economic support measures for lockdown areas, the Conservative MP Chris Clarkson broke off from a speech attacking what he characterised as Labour’s “hindsight-heavy” approach and confronted Rayner over whether she had used the slur against him. As a row erupted, the deputy speaker, Eleanor Laing, intervened by shouting “order” and rebuked Rayner, telling her: “From the frontbench we will not have remarks like that, not under any circumstances, no matter how heartfelt it might be, not at all.” Tories seized on the incident, with Clarkson later writing to Rayner to demand she say sorry. As the debacle threatened to overshadow Labour’s attempt to seize the initiative on a day of opposition debates about economic support in lockdown areas and free school meal provision, Rayner issued an apology within hours. In a statement on Wednesday evening, she said: “I apologise for the language that I used in a heated debate in parliament earlier.”
Clarkson had been using his speech to criticise the Greater Manchester Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, over his handling of negotiations with Downing Street for an economic support package, after the talks broke down this week. He then turned his fire on Labour more broadly, characterising the party’s approach as opportunistic. Clarkson also highlighted comments from the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, who reportedly said last month in reference to the pandemic that Labour should not “let a good crisis go to waste”. He said: “Today’s last-minute debate has all the hallmarks of the same opportunism … [that] has done so much damage over the past few days. No doubt with a carefully calculated vote at the end designed for release on social media afterwards. I implore members opposite to park the opportunism. “I know the honourable member for Stretford and Urmston [Green] thinks this is a good crisis which the Labour party should exploit, and I know she speaks for a lot of her frontbench colleagues when she says that. You just need to see it in the support-U-turn- oppose approach that’s categorised their hindsight-heavy behaviour.” Amid audible heckling in the chamber, Clarkson then broke off to ask of Rayner: “Excuse me, did the honourable lady just call me scum?” After Laing intervened, Rayner, who earlier in the opposition day debate disclosed that her aunt had died from Covid last week, responded: “I think one of the things I’d ask your guidance on is the honourable member saying things about the frontbench which is inaccurate in their speech and I’d ask them to withdraw it.” Laing said it was not for the chair to decide what was “accurate or inaccurate” but asked Clarkson to be “reasonable” in what he said and to be “careful of his remarks”, inviting him to withdraw and apologise if he felt he had said anything offensive to Rayner. Clarkson, the MP for Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, which is facing tier 3 lockdown restrictions from Friday, said: “I should clarify, I asked the honourable lady if she called me that, that’s what I heard.” In a later point of order, the Tory MP Katherine Fletcher condemned Rayner, telling the Commons: “Today she has shamed Manchester, shamed this house and she should apologise.” Clarkson wrote to Rayner following the exchange, calling on her to apologise. “In the spirit of those promises of constructive opposition and in the interest of providing a united front in the battle against coronavirus, I respectfully ask that you retract and apologise for your comments,” he wrote.
Opening the debate, Rayner disclosed her aunt’s death to Covid and thanked hospital staff in Stockport who cared for her, adding: “So I speak today not just as a member of this house, nor as a Mancunian, but as someone who like many others across our city and our country who in the last few weeks have lost loved ones to this terrible virus. “That more than anything is why I come here not wanting the government to fail but to succeed because lives literally depend on it. And we know that at public health response will only save lives if it is supported by a fair economic settlement.” Tory MPs rallied behind Downing Street to easily defeat Labour’s motion which had called on the government to publish fair national criteria for financial support in areas enduring tougher lockdown restrictions, to be voted on in parliament, as well as providing workers on the job support scheme at least 80% wage support. The vote was won by the government by 340 to 261 on Wednesday, with Greater Manchester Tory MPs Chris Green and William Wragg voting with the opposition in favour of the motion."
2020-10-21T17:16:35Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: daily record of 26,688 new Covid cases; Sturgeon confirms Scotland's five-tier lockdown plan - as it happened","The UK has recorded 26,688 new coronavirus cases - a new daily record and a 25% increase on yesterday’s total. Weekly hospital admissions are up 39% in the UK and weekly deaths are up 57% on the previous week. (See 5.22pm.) As Jamie Jenkins, a former ONS statistician reports, in England hospital admissions are now at the level they were in the middle of May.
But in Scotland, where restrictions were tightened earlier than in the rest of the UK, there are some positive developments in the figures. Although deaths are still rising (see 2.11pm), the recent sharp rise in new cases seems to have halted. (See 4.43pm.) Tens of thousands of deaths are now inevitable in a second wave of coronavirus infections sweeping across England because of the failure to contain the virus, a government scientific adviser has warned. As my colleague Ian Sample reports, John Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told MPs that without further measures England’s tiered Covid-19 strategy would lead to high numbers of new infections every day, putting the NHS under strain and driving up the death toll. “If you look at where we are, there is no way we come out of this wave now without counting our deaths in the tens of thousands,” Edmunds, an epidemiologist, told the joint hearing of the Commons science and technology committee, and the health and social care committee. Downing Street has said it is restarting trade talks with the EU, after Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said this morning that Brussels accepted the need for compromise on both sides. (See 5.39pm.) Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “dividing communities” and pitting regions against each other in his approach to local lockdowns, arguing that areas put in the top level of coronavirus restrictions were likely to be stuck there for months. Nicola Sturgeon has accused Boris Johnson of ignoring expert advice about the need for a Covid restrictions strategy that includes an “extreme” top level close to the full lockdown imposed in March. Leaders in the Sheffield city region have attacked the government’s “tawdry” and divisive approach to imposing tough coronavirus restrictions, saying its £41m deal is far less than needed and tied up in red tape. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has accused Boris Johnson of telling a “blatant lie” to the House of Commons after the prime minister accused him of bankrupting Transport for London. The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, is facing demands to apologise for apparently calling a Tory MP “scum” in the Commons after he criticised Labour’s opposition to the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. England and Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has locked horns with Tory MPs in a Twitter row over the footballer’s campaign to extend free school meals (FSM) to cover holidays. Rishi Sunak has cancelled the UK government’s three-year spending review for the rest of parliament to allow Treasury ministers more time to focus on coping with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.

2020-10-21T17:09:12Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks to resume after Michel Barnier speech breaks impasse,"The Brexit talks will resume on Thursday, with negotiators tasked with working through weekends in pursuit of a deal in the remaining few weeks, after Michel Barnier met the prime minister’s demands for re-engagement. The impasse was broken after the EU’s chief negotiator made public his intention to “seek the necessary compromises on both sides”, telling the European parliament that he believed an agreement was “within reach” and that he was willing to work “day and night”. Downing Street said Barnier’s speech on Wednesday morning had met the threshold for the resumption of the troubled talks, with fewer than four weeks left before a deal will have to be ready in time for parliamentary ratification.
The government’s volte-face comes just six days after it said the trade talks were “over”. Boris Johnson had called on Britons to prepare for a no-deal exit from the transition period which ends on 31 December. Following a call between Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost, Downing Street said the intensified phase of daily talks would start on Thursday. Either the chief negotiators or their deputies would also meet every 24 hours to maintain focus. Negotiations will take place daily including weekends, unless both sides agree otherwise, according to a release on the structure of the talks. A No 10 spokesman said: “Lord Frost discussed the implications of this statement and the state of play with Mr Barnier earlier today. On the basis of that conversation we are ready to welcome the EU team to London to resume negotiations later this week.” He added: “It is clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas, but we are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks. “As both sides have made clear, it takes two to reach an agreement. It is entirely possible that negotiations will not succeed. If so, the UK will end the transition period on Australia terms and will prosper in doing so.” The resumption of the negotiations brings to a close a period of what some EU diplomats described as a “period of pure farce and theatre”. Barnier had been due to start talks on Monday but had been told by Frost that his presence would be unwelcome unless there was a “fundamental change” in the EU’s approach to the talks. The clash had followed an EU summit where leaders had openly offered to compromise, and Barnier himself had offered to speed up the negotiation. But Downing Street had apparently taken umbrage at a summit communique which lacked mention of the need for “intensive” talks, a concept included in an earlier draft. There had also been the suggestion that it was up to the UK to move on its negotiating position. In Brussels, it was widely believed to be a planned piece of political theatre designed to hide the fact that Johnson had broken his own deadline of securing a deal by 15 October. Barnier sated Johnson’s apparent criteria for restarting the talks through a speech in Brussels in which he acknowledged both that the UK had already shown significant flexibility and that the EU would need to compromise. He noted, in particular, that the British negotiators had made important moves in relation to the issue of domestic subsidy control, one of the remaining contentious issues. In the last few days, the EU had already offered intensive daily talks on legal texts relating to issues across the trade and security deal, in response to Downing Street’s demands. But those moves had still been regarded as insufficient. “It was too early to end the sulk,” said one EU diplomat. “He has his victory now and perhaps we can have a successful negotiation”. A senior French official said the EU negotiators should not be “afraid of UK tactics” in the final phase of the talks, claiming Downing Street had no intention of walking away for good. The official said: “What we shouldn’t do again on the EU side is to be so happy that the UK, after playing these tactics, is back at the table, that we give too many concessions. “We are ready to discuss finding a deal. That said, I don’t think we should be too afraid of UK tactics which is to say: if you don’t give me what I want I will leave the table, and I don’t care about having no deal. If the UK would really not care about having a new deal, it would have left the table long ago, frankly.” The official added: “We have been discussing for more than three years. The current government in the UK has been in place for more than a year. So if its ideal solution would be to have a no deal, it would have cut off the negotiation and left the room, a long time ago. And if no deal was so easy for the UK to swallow or to put in place, it would be done already.”"
2020-10-21T16:59:40Z,politics,Politics,Boris falls into Keir's tiers trap and goes full delusional over TfL | John Crace,"It wouldn’t be prime minister’s questions without Boris Johnson being accused of telling at least one lie. Indeed, in recent months it has often felt as if Boris has taken a bet with Dominic Cummings to see if he can outdo himself on the lies of the week before. But normally Boris saves his biggest fibs for his exchanges with Keir Starmer. This time he reserved his top Trumps for London MPs concerned about planned changes to Transport for London and council tax. Not that Starmer didn’t yet again comfortably get the better of Johnson: rather he seemed to have grown tired of a full-on assault on the prime minister, and decided to employ simple logic in an effort to get Boris to commit himself to something he might later regret. And in that he was extremely effective. Because it will be in only about a month’s time that Johnson will realise into just how much trouble he has unwittingly got himself. Though whether he will care is another matter. Like all narcissists, Boris lives only for the moment. The Labour leader opened with a simple question: how does a region that gets put into tier 3 ever get out of it? Simple, said Boris. When the rate of infection falls below one. Fine, Starmer replied. Except that on current evidence there was no sign of the R rate falling below 1 any time soon. Only Cornwall and possibly the Isle of Wight currently had an infection rate lower than Manchester when it was in effect put into tier 2 measures back in July. And we all knew where Manchester was now. What’s more, there were no guarantees those regions that had been put in tier 3 would be much better off than they had been before. Even the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser had said tier 3 restrictions wouldn’t be enough to lower the rate of infection. And as it had been proved already that almost every tier 2 region would inevitably end up in tier 3, the government was merely piling on months of agony with no exit plan. This was the kind of straightforward logic that invariably defeats Johnson, and his telltale bullshit tics kicked in. The shouting, the waving of arms and the needy glances towards his own benches. “Um …” said Boris. He was reviewing each region every 28 days. Before keeping it precisely where it was. Why else would he have been negotiating a six-month deal for Manchester if he had imagined there was a cat in hell’s chance of the region having its restriction eased before then. “Ah, Manchester,” Starmer segued easily. The prime minister who could waste £40m on a non-existent garden bridge and spend £6k a day on test-and-trace consultants didn’t seem to be able to find £5m for Manchester. Nonsense, Boris blustered. The Tories were one-nation Conservatives who brought the country together by pitting one council against another. Labour merely wanted to close everything down with a circuit break for months on end. AKA two to three weeks. At this Starmer zoned out. History would prove one of them right within a couple of months. And he was totally confident he would be history’s chosen one. Sometimes it paid to play the long game. Relieved to have got off more lightly than he expected – spotting trouble coming down the track has never been his strong point – Boris went full delusional when challenged by three Labour London MPs and one Tory about the proposed shake-up of Transport for London and the responsibilities of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor. It was worse than listening to a child explaining how the dog ate his homework. Cringe-worthy. It was also telling just how personal Johnson’s hatred for Khan is. He can’t stand the fact that Sadiq is more popular in London than him, nor can he bear it that Khan has unarguably done a better job than he did as London mayor. So Boris went into hissy-fit overdrive where one lie was immediately topped by another. Sadiq had bankrupted the city, he was personally responsible for the damage to Hammersmith bridge – at least when your own bridge is only in your imagination, you can’t do any damage to it – and Londoners deserved everything that was coming down the road to make their lives more miserable for having backed him. None of which was true. According to TfL’s accounts, since Khan took over from Johnson in 2016 he has reduced the deficit by 71% and increased cash reserves by 16%. That TfL is now in trouble is entirely down to the pandemic. Not even Johnson’s own MPs could stomach these lies. Asking for the country’s trust during a national crisis when you can’t even tell the truth about an audited balance sheet is an uphill struggle. If the prime minister will lie about this, what won’t he lie about? Still, though, Johnson wasn’t finished. Before the opposition day debate on Marcus Rashford’s proposals to extend free school meals throughout the holidays up until Easter, Boris was twice asked to take the proposals seriously. Twice he declined. The thing about children that he had just discovered was that they didn’t actually need to eat during school holidays. Their metabolisms stopped. And besides, going hungry was the kind of character-building quality that the country would need in a post-Brexit, post-Covid world. It was as crass as it was tin-eared. Johnson has already caved in to Rashford once and the chances are that some time soon he will be forced to do so again. But when you are programmed to have all failures expunged from your memory, these are the kinds of mistakes you make."
2020-10-21T16:07:39Z,politics,Politics,Tier 3 lockdowns: how each region's support package compares,"Greater Manchester
Greater Manchester is home to 10 councils and the largest labour market outside south-east England. Highly skilled jobs have grown over the past decade, but most work is in sectors such as retail, hospitality, tourism, construction and care, where pay rates tend to be low and pockets of deprivation persist. The case for more Covid-19 support has focused on the region’s relatively high business density compared with other regions. Sheffield city region
Taking in areas including Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley, the region has high levels of deprivation as well as flourishing and emerging manufacturing sectors such as aerospace and healthcare. Tourism had also been driving the hospitality sector. Liverpool city region
The region encompasses six local authorities: Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral. Unemployment rates have been falling over the past decade, from a peak of 10%, though wage rates are low in comparison to the rest of the country. As in some other post-industrial northern cities, hospitality and leisure has become an increasingly vital sector, supporting 50,000 jobs across the region. Lancashire
Covering Lancashire county council, Blackburn with Darwen council, Blackpool council and Lancashire’s 12 district councils, the area is home to a slightly older population than surrounding areas, and jobs growth has lagged behind. The retail and health sectors account for around a third of all employment, followed by a manufacturing base. * The funding formula: £8 per head for test and trace and £20 per head for business support, according to the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick ** Test and trace: Though still subject to talks, funding is expected to be used to help additional staff. Some local authorities have separately reached agreement with the government on accessing data in order to try to reach contacts who cannot be reached centrally."
2020-10-21T15:04:17Z,politics,Politics,Manchester young Tory hits out at Boris Johnson over Covid restrictions,"The chairman of Manchester Young Conservatives has criticised the prime minister for forcing the region into the strictest coronavirus curbs, saying the move was a “kick in the balls” to “red wall” seats gained by the party across northern England last year. Cameron Cosh, 20, spoke in a personal capacity but said his views were “definitely shared among people in my group”, adding that the £60m financial support package offered to Greater Manchester was “pathetic”. The offer was rejected on Tuesday by the region’s Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, who condemned the government for “playing poker” with people’s lives. Cosh’s comments came after he posted a series of widely shared messages from the youth group’s Twitter account on Wednesday after the government failed to strike a deal with Greater Manchester leaders and said it would impose tier 3 restrictions, closing pubs and other hospitality venues. The since-deleted tweets read: “Boris has lied about helping us in the north. It’s time for him to go. He’s not a Conservative. He’s got no backbone or genuine deals. He’s incompetent. He has now lost all the seats we worked so hard in Greater Manchester to win.” The third-year politics student at the University of Manchester said on Wednesday he had “given up his life” to campaign for the party in the region ahead of the December 2019 election, in which the Conservative party won large gains in north-west England. “It’s just a kick in the balls really, it’s going to damage all the work I did,” he said. Cosh agreed with Burnham that more financial support – such as an 80% furlough scheme – was needed in areas affected by the strictest measures, and that Boris Johnson’s failure to concede to his demands was at odds with the government’s levelling-up agenda. “They’ve got four years – all’s not lost but it’s not a good start,” he said, adding that Johnson’s government had already been undermined by “U-turn after U-turn over the summer”. While supporting the Labour mayor over the latest restrictions and financial package, unlike Burnham, Cosh is vehemently anti-lockdown, advocating instead for a system of “herd immunity” to be created among those at low risk from Covid-19. “The elderly and the vulnerable – those who are likely to catch it – I think should go into isolation and be shielded. Everyone else who is healthy should continue on and try and help the economy,” he said. “If not, the economy is going to die, and when we all come out it’s going to be a pretty shit life trying to piece together some sort of 2008-esque nightmare.” Cosh warned that 18- to 24-year-olds would probably face the worst economic outcomes as a result of long lockdowns, and said he thought little love had been lost between his age group and the government. He added: “I don’t think they had a decent chance of getting young people, never mind getting young people in Manchester, onboard anyway. That’s still a long way off.”"
2020-10-21T14:50:58Z,politics,Politics,Appeal court quashes UK policy of removing migrants with little warning,"The court of appeal has quashed a Home Office policy of removing migrants from the UK without access to justice. In a unanimous decision, three judges found the policy, which allowed the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK sometimes with only hours notice and in many cases without access to lawyers, to be unlawful. More than 40,000 removals were affected by the policy, resulting in vulnerable people being put at risk. Some were recognised as having been removed unlawfully, were brought back to the UK and granted leave to remain. Wednesday’s ruling will be a blow for the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has vowed to take a tough line on removing migrants from the UK. It also comes at a time when she has been reported to be considering making some definitions of human rights law for judges rather than leaving judges to decide these legal points for themselves.
The judgment from the lord chief justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Hickinbottom and Lord Justice Coulson emphasises the importance of the right of access to justice under common law: “The right to access the court is an absolute and inviolable right … the right to access to the court is not a relative right to be balanced against other rights and interests.” The Home Office policy that has been quashed includes “removal windows”, whereby someone is given as little as 72 hours notice that they might be removed from the UK at some point during the subsequent three months, without any warning. The appeal court challenge was brought by the charity Medical Justice, the Public Law Project and Duncan Lewis solicitors. A Medical Justice spokesperson said: “One of our society’s most precious treasures is access to justice. Chillingly, away from the public gaze, this policy denied that fundamental right on a massive scale causing serious harm to extremely vulnerable people and risking life. It was effectively a shortcut to removal. Quashing the policy brings us back towards equal access to justice for all.” Rakesh Singh, a solicitor at the Public Law Project, said: “This is a case about access to justice, one of the fundamental values of the British constitution. The ‘removal windows’ policy shut people out of the legal process. It meant that when mistakes were made, people could not access the court to put things right, and led the Home Office to remove people with a right to be here – including a number who were caught up in the Windrush situation. “Removing people in this way caused terrible injustices and placed many individuals and families in danger and into hardship, unnecessarily and unjustly.” Raja Uruthiravinayagan of Duncan Lewis solicitors said: ‘The importance of this judgment cannot be overstated. Access to justice is a fundamental principle of rule of law. Without it, individuals will not be able to challenge unlawful decisions and hold decision-makers accountable. It protects our fundamental rights and freedoms. The delivery of justice should be impartial and non-discriminatory, regardless of who is seeking it, if it is to protect and strengthen our democracy.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our immigration and asylum system is fundamentally broken and we are determined to introduce a new system that is fair, firm and will expedite the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection.” Home Office sources said the court found that the removal windows interfered with an individual’s access to legal advice. It did not find that removal windows were unlawful. • This article was amended on 28 October 2020. An earlier version said that the policy could allow the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK within hours; this has been clarified to say the removal could be with only hours notice."
2020-10-21T13:54:48Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan accuses Boris Johnson of ‘blatant lie’ over TfL,"London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has accused Boris Johnson of telling a “blatant lie” to the House of Commons after the prime minister accused him of bankrupting Transport for London. The mayor is seeking a £4.9bn settlement for the next 18 months to keep the capital’s tube and bus services going with revenues collapsed because of Covid. Attacking Khan in the House of Commons, Johnson told MPs: “It was the Labour mayor of London who bankrupted TfL’s finances,” going on to say that any plans to increase fares or extend the congestion charge zone were “entirely down to him”. But Khan accused of him of lying and trying to impose a “triple whammy” of “punitive” charges on Londoners when the “sole cause” of TfL’s financial problems was the pandemic. He tweeted:
TfL said that Khan inherited a £1.5bn deficit from Johnson as mayor, with that loss following the phasing out of a grant that had been scrapped by David Cameron when he was prime minister. It said that, before lockdown TfL, was on course to achieve reserves levels of £2.2bn by the end of March 2020, an increase of 31% over the four years since 2016, but passenger numbers and revenue were now down 70% year-on-year because of the pandemic. The clash also came as TfL confirmed the latest death of a bus driver from coronavirus, which has brought the number of fatalities among workers during the pandemic to 45. In a statement, Khan also accused Johnson of trying to claw back losses through an increase in tube and bus fares, an extension of the congestion charge and higher council tax in exchange for rescue funding. This was “punitive”, he said. “London’s net contribution to the Treasury of £38.8bn last year means that Londoners and the capital’s businesses are not only paying for transport services in the capital but heavily subsidising those in the rest of the country too.” It is a repeat of the political clash during lockdown when the government withheld a £1.6bn rescue package until the mayor agreed an increase in the congestion charge and an extension of the ultra-low emission zone charge to the weekend. Khan said Johnson’s attack was a “vindictive” political stunt aimed at weakening Labour in London before next year’s mayoral elections. He told a TfL board meeting: “Now is not the time for the government to play party political games or be vindictive towards London. “This is far too serious a matter. We need to do what’s right for the city and the people of the city who have endured so much during this crisis.” This month the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote to Khan setting out a long list of conditions before agreeing a six-month bailout. According to a letter seen by the Financial Times, he threatened to seize control of TfL and to run it from Whitehall. “We will be taking reserve legislative powers allowing us if necessary to direct TfL,” Shapps wrote. The threat to undermine the London mayor is seen in some quarters as part of an attempt to cut Labour city leaders out of Covid planning. The shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “It’s extremely worrying that despite repeated requests, the government is offering only a papering-over-the-cracks funding package for Transport for London, with such punitive conditions.” Khan called on ministers to reconsider their “ill-advised and draconian” proposals. A spokesman for Johnson said TfL’s debt stood at £12bn and it was now spending £400m a year on debt interest, making it “effectively bankrupt”."
2020-10-21T13:00:10Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson and Evgeny Lebedev: a decade of politics, parties and peerages","The theme of the party attended by Boris Johnson was unmistakable. On the first floor was a mural of Joseph Stalin, dressed in green military uniform. A hammer and sickle decorated the windows. In the centre of the room was an ice sculpture in the shape of a pistol, from where a barman dispensed vodka shots. A gun – presumably fake – lay on a red double bed in the basement, next to an outdoor smoking area. “Do you like my gun?” the party’s host, Evgeny Lebedev, reportedly asked one visitor. There was also a stuffed bear. It was Friday 15 December 2017. Lebedev’s parties held in London and at his palazzo in Umbria, Italy, are a highlight of the social calendar. At this particular USSR–themed bash there was champagne, as much as you could drink, a caviar station, a dancefloor and a DJ, and a guest list including A-list actors, rock stars and members of the cabinet. The most senior was Johnson, then foreign secretary. The prime minister is a regular attendee of parties hosted by Lebedev, which have a reputation for decadence. Prior to the December event, an email had told staff hired for their model looks to prepare for excess. “This party will be on the wilder side so PLEASE BEHAVE YOURSELF,” it said. The question of how wild it was depends on who is asked. One attendee called it a “vodka assault course” – others say it was more restrained.
Johnson is understood to have stayed later than most. His late-night presence attests to one of the more unlikely friendships in modern British politics, which culminated over the summer in Johnson’s contentious decision to make Lebedev a member of the House of Lords. Lebedev will take up his peerage later this month, or early next, with his new title to be revealed on 29 October. It will mark another significant moment in a relationship that has weathered all manner of scrutiny, and some criticism, since it began more than a decade ago. Back in 2009, Johnson was the newly elected mayor of London and Lebedev the son of a billionaire who had just bought the Evening Standard. The Standard was a stalwart supporter of Johnson, endorsing his 2012 reelection campaign. But the relationship between them was unusual for a politician and a newspaper proprietor. In 2015, for instance, Johnson and Lebedev camped out together on the streets of London to draw attention to homelessness among army veterans. They made an improbable double act. When Johnson joked that he had fallen in a puddle, Lebedev quipped: “I saved your life”; the two shared a bottle of whisky. Beyond the bonhomie, the friendship has touched on Britain’s political destiny. In February 2016, Lebedev went to a private dinner at Johnson’s Islington home. Johnson was wrestling with whether to back Brexit. Other guests included Michael Gove and his wife, Sarah Vine. Oliver Letwin, patched in via iPhone, tried to persuade Johnson to come out for remain. History records what happened next. Lebedev witnessed these secret Tory manoeuvres. Last year, the Standard, then edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, endorsed Johnson to become Conservative leader and to succeed Theresa May as prime minister. “Their relationship is social. Evgeny thinks Johnson is a good sport. And Evgeny is addicted to being around people who make him feel important,” one person familiar with Lebedev said.
Johnson has described Lebedev “as a major force for good” – and even found time to go to his home on 19 March, the same day the prime minister had implored Britons to stay indoors to help curb the spread of a virus that would within days force a national lockdown. Nevertheless, his decision to put Lebedev forward for a peerage came as a shock to many in Westminster, provoking cries of cronyism at a time when all parties had committed to reducing the bloated House of Lords. “It’s payback for political support. In my view it’s unprofessional rather than fishy,” said one source. Behind the scenes in Whitehall, the Guardian can reveal, there had been consternation of a different sort. Two days before Johnson met Lebedev in March, the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac), which scrutinises all nominations, wrote to the prime minister. It is understood to have expressed concerns about Lebedev’s proposed peerage and asked Downing Street to reconsider.
The commission, made up of cross-party peers, carries out “propriety checks” on candidates. It does not have the power of veto. But it can suggest that a party come up with an alternative, which is what is understood to have happened in Lebedev’s case. Peers were apparently alarmed following a confidential briefing from the UK security services. They told the commission Lebedev was viewed as a potential security risk because of his father, Alexander Lebedev, a one-time Moscow spy. During the late cold war period, Lebedev Sr worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. His real employer was KGB foreign intelligence. Subsequently he went into banking and the media. Alexander Lebedev has never sought to hide his KGB past. In a recent memoir, Hunt the Banker, he charts in a few pages his path through his recruitment by the KGB, his posting as a spy in London in 1988 and his exit from the world of espionage in 1992 with the rank of colonel.
In July, Lebedev’s name is understood to have been resubmitted by Downing Street and sources said there was a “to and fro” between No 10 and Holac, reflecting “concern about his antecedents”. Downing Street sought further assurances from the security agencies; they told those who needed to know their fundamental assessment about the possible security risk was unchanged, but they also provided extra context, which was enough to lead to a different outcome. The peers reluctantly signed off on his appointment, the Guardian understands. In their confirmation letter, they are said to have called on Johnson to examine Russian influence in the House of Lords, something highlighted by parliament’s intelligence and security committee in its Russia report. Security sources say Lebedev’s “family links” mean that he is still regarded as a potential concern, even as he enters the Lords. In effect, they estimate the risk to be low, partly because peers do not see classified documents. Lebedev says he is being unfairly maligned due to his Russian background. Downing Street initially said it would not comment on individual cases, adding that “it is not uncommon” to seek “further information and assurances” over House of Lords appointments. But when pressed, a No 10 spokesman said: “Evgeny Lebedev is a British citizen who has made an outstanding contribution to the UK. All peerages are vetted by the House of Lords appointments commission for matters of probity. The commission seeks advice from government departments and agencies where appropriate.” Downing Street insiders highlighted Lebedev’s ownership of the Evening Standard and the Independent, as well as his charitable activities – a point made by the peer himself.“Raising £75m for UK charities and spending £120m saving two great UK media titles might have had something to do with it,” Lebedev told the Guardian. ‘This wasn’t just a fun Christmas party’ Johnson was not the only influential politician to drop into Lebedev’s opulent townhouse at 20 Park Square East for the 2017 Christmas party. The first guest of note was an ex-prime minister, Tony Blair. Blair came between 6.30pm and 7pm, before the event began, his office said. He spent 20 minutes talking to Lebedev in the Stalin room. Other politicians came by at about 8.30pm. They included Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, the former Labour MPs Peter Mandelson and Tristram Hunt and prominent Conservatives such as the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. And, of course, Johnson, foreign secretary in May’s faltering government. Missing was David Cameron, who had been to other Lebedev events including a 2015 birthday party. The politicians mainly arrived and left early. In contrast, the actors turned up fashionably late, at about 10pm to 11pm. They included Sir Ian McKellen, who co-owns a pub with Evgeny Lebedev in east London, as well as Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Stewart and Idris Elba. Elton John appeared in a red suit.
Also there was the 86-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corp and proprietor of the Brexit-supporting Sun, as well as the Times and the Sunday Times. Murdoch, who left long before midnight, sat on a sofa, according to one observer, and select people were brought to him. Upstairs, the atmosphere in the purple lit L-shaped party room was hedonistic, those present said. And as the night went on it got increasingly uninhibited. This was in contrast to the more conventional room downstairs, where most of the politicians had gathered, they said. Later in the evening, according to some people who were present, a small number of Lebedev’s guests also consumed class A drugs in at least one part of the house. Johnson was not among them. Many attendees, including Lebedev, said they did not see it and were not aware of it. But while it would hardly be unusual for drugs to be taken at an upmarket bash in central London, the fact Johnson was still at the party late on certainly was. While other senior politicians had circulated and left, the foreign secretary and future prime minister had stayed on, apparently slipping in and out through a back entrance.
“It doesn’t feel like it’s good for democracy to have these parties going on,” one witness said. “This wasn’t just a fun Christmas party. It was more than that. It was a forum for doing a lot of [political] deals and creating things that the public doesn’t know about … It seems a more important issue now Johnson is our prime minister.” The witness is not the first person to have made such a point about senior politicians and media proprietors. The 2012 Leveson inquiry found the relationship between politicians and the press over the previous three decades had damaged the perception of public affairs. It concluded that politicians of all parties had developed “too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest”. That advice has not stopped Johnson from continuing to see Lebedev. In April 2018, he flew to Italy for a weekend at the Lebedevs’ Terranova mansion. His trip came soon after two Russian military assassins poisoned Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury with the nerve agent novichok. Johnson had been meeting Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to discuss the Skripal crisis. He took the unusual step on the Italy trip of leaving his security team behind.
The following day, a member of the public spotted Johnson at the airport. His suit was crumpled and he looked hungover. The foreign secretary was on his own, clutching a book. He boarded an easyJet flight back to London. It is unclear what Johnson discussed with Lebedev or his father, who was also in Terranova, or why he dispensed with his bodyguards for the solo trip. Last year, a day after the general election, Johnson again attended Lebedev’s vodka and caviar Christmas party at Park Square East. The event was also a celebration for Alexander Lebedev’s 60th birthday. And, as it turned out, it was also a chance to toast the Conservatives and their election majority. The prime minister came with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds.
The Guardian has repeatedly asked Johnson about his attendances at these parties, and whether he thinks, given the senior government jobs he has held, he is taking unnecessary risks. He has always declined to answer. Lebedev, however, accused the Guardian of a “continuing harassment of me over the past year or so [which] has been full of untruthful innuendo and light on facts. “It had also been racist. It is possible to be Russian-born and prominent in this country and not a promoter of the Russian state or government. I am one such person and, moreover, I am not my father, whatever dubious allegations you might wish to direct against me via him.” Lebedev is to receive his letters patent from the Queen on 29 October. The Garter King of Arms will unveil his new title. A ceremony introducing Lebedev to the Lords can be expected soon after. During it, he will swear an oath of allegiance to the monarch while wearing a borrowed ermine robe. And then the prime minister’s friend is a peer for life."
2020-10-21T12:15:07Z,politics,Politics,Starmer accuses Johnson of 'bargaining with people’s lives' over lockdown support,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “dividing communities” and pitting regions against each other in his approach to local lockdowns, arguing that areas put in the top level of coronavirus restrictions were likely to be stuck there for months. In a series of exchanges at prime minister’s questions that highlighted the policy divide between the parties over how to tackle growing infection rates, the Labour leader said Johnson was “bargaining with people’s lives” in the way financial support for affected areas was decided. In response, Johnson said Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, who has been battling the government for more support for businesses and workers affected by the region moving into tier 3 of lockdown rules, had turned down a generous offer. The £60m of business and employment support was still on offer, Johnson said, and would be distributed to the region via local boroughs. But Starmer said those affected by tier 3 rules in Greater Manchester, where pubs, bars and other businesses will have to close, “will either be out of work or face significant pay cuts”. The government’s job support plan pays such people two-thirds of their wages, rather than the 80% under the now-defunct furlough scheme. “Their rents and their mortgage won’t be lower, their food and their heating bills won’t be lower, and that could last for months,” Starmer said. “Why can’t the prime minister and the chancellor understand this? Stop bargaining with people’s lives, stop dividing communities, and provide the support that is needed in Manchester.” The Labour leader accused Johnson of approaching negotiations in a “grubby, take it or leave it way”. He said: “It’s corrosive to public trust to pit region against region, mayor against mayor, council against council, asking them to trade away their businesses and jobs.” More generally, Starmer argued, tier 3 was “the worst of all worlds”. He said: “It brings significant economic harm, without getting the virus sufficiently under control to exit tier 3. Instead of being a solution, tier 3 is a gateway to weeks and weeks, more likely months and months, of agony, from which there’s no likely exit.” Starmer began by pressing Johnson over how a tier 3 region could depart from the rigorous rules, saying this could only seemingly happen if the R rate, the rate of coronavirus infections, was below one, meaning infection numbers are falling rather than rising. “If the R rate hasn’t gone below one, then the infection rate is still going up, and the numbers are going up, and the admissions are going up, and numbers in hospitals are going up, and the deaths are going up,” Starmer said. “Is the prime minister seriously saying that he would take a tier 3 area out of tier 3 with the R above one? I don’t think so.” Johnson said tier 3 areas would have their status reviewed every 28 days, and accused Starmer of being “incoherent” in attacking local lockdowns when he was also arguing for a national lockdown for two or three weeks, a co-called circuit-breaker, intended to break the spread of transmission. The prime minister said: “I think it is the height of absurdity that he stands up and attacks the economic consequences of the measures that we are obliged to take across some parts of the country, when he wants to turn the lights out with a full national lockdown.” Starmer reiterated his call for a temporary lockdown, saying it should begin to coincide with half term for most English schools next week: “This may be the last opportunity for the prime minister to put in place an effective circuit break. The prime minister was too slow in the first phase of this pandemic. He’s being too slow again.”"
2020-10-21T11:17:39Z,politics,Politics,Sunak scraps three-year spending review to focus on Covid-19,"Rishi Sunak has cancelled the UK government’s three-year spending review for the rest of parliament to allow Treasury ministers more time to focus on coping with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The chancellor said he would set out a one-year spending plan that would focus entirely on dealing with the budgeting needs of departments and the devolved governments during the pandemic.
The move is a blow to Boris Johnson’s ambition to reclaim the economic agenda with an upbeat outlook for the UK and the government’s investment plans once the coronavirus has been brought under control. Officials at the Ministry of Defence are also understood to be disappointed after commitments from No 10 that the prime minister would back a long-term strategic plan for military investment. The Treasury said: “While the government would have liked to outline plans for the rest of this parliament, the right thing today is to focus entirely on the response to Covid-19 and supporting jobs – that’s what the public would expect.” Last month the Treasury scrapped plans for an autumn budget that was previously billed as a landmark event that would set out the government’s tax and spending agenda until the middle of the decade. Sunak insisted that long-term capital projects would receive support from the Treasury “to deliver our ambitious plans to unite and level up the country, drive our economic recovery and build back better”. He singled out HS2, the new high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham and Manchester, as a project that would continue to receive long-term spending commitments. He added that the health and education departments would be given special attention by Treasury ministers and offered spending commitments beyond the 2021-22 financial year.
However, there was concern inside other Whitehall departments that without a budget before the end of the year and a single-year spending review, there would be limited scope for long-term planning. Business leaders also said privately that the failure to set out the government’s agenda until the end of the parliament would leave businesses that depend on government contracts unable to make investment decisions. Sunak had already signalled that public sector pay would be held back over the next three years to bring down the Whitehall pay bill. In July he said most public sector workers could expect to have their pay kept low to help reduce the public-spending deficit."
2020-10-21T10:40:59Z,politics,Politics,Red wall areas facing Brexit job shock even under a deal – report,"The “red wall” voters who helped deliver Boris Johnson’s election victory will be disproportionately affected by Brexit even in the event of a deal being agreed, storing up trouble for the prime minister in 2024, according to a report. With the new wave of Tory MPs in former Labour strongholds forced to choose between supporting Johnson over his handling of coronavirus lockdowns in the north and answering to their constituents facing job losses, the report forecasts more trouble after Brexit.
It classes 35 of the constituencies as “vulnerable” to a Brexit job shock because they rely so heavily on manufacturing. As the gains made by the Conservative party in 2019 were so slender, they could easily be reversed by job losses or the uncertainty to livelihoods caused by Brexit, says the Manufacturing in the Marginals report, compiled by a former Foreign Office official and high commissioner. In a fresh look at the consequences of Brexit, Paul McGrade weighed up the number of votes that delivered the Tories’ majority against manufacturing jobs, constituency by constituency. In some constituencies the capacity for Brexit shock is greater because so many key jobs are concentrated in one sector. For example, in Bury North, where the Tories took the seat from Labour by 105 votes, there are 4,500 people in manufacturing jobs, with many in the chemical industry, a sector recently identified as at risk from Brexit. The chemicals company BASF, which has six sites in the UK, has said Brexit will add a £1bn of costs to its business, even if there is a deal, potentially threatening the future of some of its operations and those in supply chains that use their chemicals in paint, coatings and agriculture. This is because it faces £50,000-£60,000 in additional costs to go through a new compliance process for each of its 1,300 unique chemicals, because the UK is coming out of the EU’s Reach regulation system. “Given how exposed the chemical industry is to trade disruption with the EU, owing to its heavily regulated nature, this underlines how economic harm to manufacturing could do significant electoral damage in these Tory-held marginals,” says the report. “In Bury, where the Conservatives won two seats on very slim majorities, and in neighbouring Heywood and Middleton, the scale of employment in the chemical industry is very high, amounting to 4,495 jobs.” The challenges flow from Britain’s departure from the single market and the customs union and will be faced irrespective of a deal being struck. “The risks from no deal are well known. But our report, for the first time, maps where manufacturing jobs are at risk in every constituency in Britain, deal or no deal. In much of the blue/red wall, the number of jobs potentially at risk far outweighs the current political majorities, which shows the scale of the post-Brexit challenge for the Conservatives and for Labour if they want to hold or win those seats at the next election,” said McGrade, who is Brexit counsel at Lexington Communications.
If the ratio of factory jobs to Tory majority votes can be said to be roughly 40:1 in Bury North using this “risk” calculation, the next most vulnerable seat for the Conservatives is High Peak in Derbyshire. Home to thermoplastics manufacturers, chemical suppliers and metal castings companies, it has more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs, compared with the Tory majority of 590 votes – a 10:1 ratio. Also vulnerable to a Brexit manufacturing decline are Bolton North East and Blyth Valley, where the number of factory jobs is nine times greater than the Tory margin of victory. Other areas deemed at risk include the West Midlands, which has 30,000 jobs in the motor industry across five constituencies. Solihull, home to Jaguar Land Rover, will be particularly vulnerable, says the report. “In a lot of these constituencies, these are the best jobs around and are highly skilled,” said McGrade. The east has a huge reliance on the pharmaceutical industry, bringing the number of jobs in manufacturing up to 242,000 across five constituencies including Cambridge and Welwyn Hatfield. The report says it recognises that manufacturing is not some sort of “political kryptonite” for the Conservatives, but adds: “The fact that these votes were won, in the words of the prime minister, on the strength of ‘borrowed votes’, means they are vulnerable to switching next time.”"
2020-10-21T06:00:27Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak accused of ignoring struggling businesses in constituency,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been accused of ignoring the plight of struggling businesses in his constituency, including a number of outdoor education centres that face being wiped out. “Over the last five months I’ve tried to speak to Mr Sunak but he just doesn’t seem to be listening,” said Terry Hailwood, the head of Low Mill Outdoor Centre, one of several centres nationwide facing closure because of a ban on overnight school trips. “He only visits businesses round here that are benefiting from his schemes. For those of us struggling, making redundancies, he just doesn’t understand our issues.” Sunak and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, are coming under pressure in their respective constituencies as a national campaign continues against a ban on residential school trips, which risks an “economic, social and cultural disaster” and the loss of 15,000 UK jobs unless it is lifted by spring. Companies, schools and parents say a generation of children risk missing out on often life-changing benefits of visits unless there are changes to Covid-19 restrictions that have left outdoor education centres dormant since March. The role of Sunak – who as chancellor has overseen the furlough scheme and other funding for businesses struggling in the pandemic – has engendered some particularly strong feelings in his constituency of Richmond in Yorkshire. Hailwood said: “Sunak has three centres in his own backyard that have had their business decimated by government guidance. At Low Mill, we are at risk of closing permanently and our staff are on notice. We don’t qualify for the new Job Support Scheme. It’s jobs and businesses slipping through the cracks in his own patch.” In Williamson’s constituency of South Staffordshire, the chief executive of an outdoor education centre that has been running “transformative” trips for children and adults said it had also “tried to engage constructively” with the MP on the mounting threat to the existence of outdoor education providers. “Despite our Staffordshire site being located in his own constituency, it is clear that he has not taken the time to properly consider how we operate or the importance of the sector’s survival to our younger generation,” said Alex Williamson, CEO of Kingswood centre. The Department for Education has said schools have been able to run non-residential trips since the start of term. It is keeping guidance on residential and non-residential trips under review in line with Public Health England advice. The parliamentary offices ofSunak and Williamson have been approached for comment."
2020-10-21T05:00:26Z,politics,Politics,"‘This is a chance to smile again’: Strictly’s Jacqui Smith on scandal, divorce and life outside politics","The last time Jacqui Smith had a dance lesson was when she was six or seven and her mother took her to a Scottish dancing group. She wore a kilt and took a few exams, but that was it. In the intervening 50 years, she says with a laugh, “my dancing has really been about family weddings – discos where you dance around your handbag – and prancing around the kitchen”. Smith – a former Labour MP, the first female home secretary, a scalp of the expenses scandal – is a contestant on this year’s Strictly Come Dancing. When we speak on the phone, it is after a long first day of training with her partner, Anton du Beke. “I think he was pleasantly surprised with my ability to pick things up,” she says. “I think we’re going to have slightly more in the dance than perhaps he feared.” Du Beke, Strictly’s gentlemanly dancer, traditionally gets the show’s “comedy” celebrity (another political entrant, Ann Widdecombe, filled the role in 2010). Did it feel like an insult to be paired with him? The 57-year-old laughs. “Anton got to the final last year and he’s very clear about that and very ambitious for us, as am I.” He is also – how to put this kindly? – not hellbent on stealing his partners away from their husbands. Is she relieved at not having to face the “Strictly curse”, whereby the frisson between the dancers and their partners becomes too much to bear? Smith cackles, then adds: “I won’t have it said that Anton is not gorgeous. But he is happily married and I am in a newish, but lovely, relationship. Trust us, there will be no Strictly curse.” It has been a strange and unsettling year for all of us – and more so for Smith than for some. In January, it emerged that her 33-year marriage had ended. Her role as chair of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust (from which she has stepped down temporarily) has been particularly challenging, for obvious reasons. So this feels like a new phase in her life, she says. Strictly – fun, different, profile-building – came along at the right time. She has developed “a sense of perspective” and more confidence as she has got older. “I think, in some ways, I worry less and I have more joy now,” she says. “I’ve had a very lucky, fulfilled life, but I’m very happy and joyful about the opportunities at the moment and that I think are still to come.”
She says it is partly about sending the message, especially to women her age, that “there are many new ways, physically and emotionally, that you can reinvent yourself in your late 50s. I hope that’s what I’m going to prove. I’ve had some difficult times professionally, I’ve had difficult times personally over the last two or three years, and this is a chance to smile and live again.” Does she mean the end of her marriage? “Yes. I’ve been very sad about the end of my marriage, but in some ways it means you have to think about new starts.” In truth, Smith has been in the process of reinventing herself for a few years. I interviewed her briefly when she was the home secretary and, goodness, she was boring. Even by politicians’ standards, she seemed stilted and humourless. This liberated Smith is very different. In the LBC podcast For the Many, which she hosts with the political pundit Iain Dale, and in her appearances on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, she has revealed herself to be outgoing and warm – with a filthy sense of humour. On the phone, she is funny and self-deprecating; although she still takes a politician’s approach to tackling questions, it feels as if she is at least trying to be open.
Has her personality changed, or was it the constraints of the job? “Home secretary is a serious role,” she says. “There is not a lot of time for laughing – and that’s right. And, of course, [being in] government means that you are quite often defending a government position. But if you ask people who were in cabinet with me, they will say that I was somebody who would have enjoyed a laugh and, I hope, was the same then as I am now. What I’m free to do now is to be that person.” Smith was part of the wave of women who entered parliament with Labour’s victory in 1997. As a child, she wanted to be prime minister. “So, to that extent, I failed,” she says, a smile in her voice. She grew up in Malvern, Worcestershire, where her parents were Labour councillors. “There was lots of discussion and argument around the dinner table,” she says. “And there was a lot of involvement in politics day-to-day – I used to think that election day was one of the best days of the year, alongside Christmas Day.” A clever child, she went from her state school to Oxford, where she read politics, philosophy and economics, before becoming an economics teacher. Once an MP, she quickly moved through the ranks, became a minister in 1999 and chief whip in 2006. When Gordon Brown became prime minister, he promoted her to home secretary – making her the first woman to hold the position. She dismisses the view that she was authoritarian (she pushed for ID cards and 42-day detention for terror suspects). “One person’s authoritarian home secretary is another person’s …” She trails off. “I said right at the very beginning that there’s no bigger honour than being responsible for the security and safety of the British people in a whole range of different ways. That was at the heart of the policies that I implemented – not authoritarianism.” She will not acknowledge a through-line from Labour’s immigration policies – under Smith, the numbers of immigration officers and detention centres rose markedly – to the Tories’ “hostile environment”.
In the past, she has complained, justly, about her treatment by the media, elements of which often focused on what she was wearing or used gendered language to speak about her (“stroppy” was one word). When the MPs’ expenses scandal broke and it emerged that Smith had claimed for two pornographic films that her husband had watched, she became an early focus. “There were elements of it that were gendered, but, at the same time, a lot of my treatment came about because I was the home secretary and anybody who has that position will be in the public eye,” she says. “I made mistakes and mistakes were made around me. Because of my status, I probably took a bigger amount of flak than others who, in some cases, did worse than I did. But I have moved on from that and, actually, what I feel is that women in politics now have a tougher time than I had.” Among her several jobs is chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, the organisation founded in the aftermath of the murder of the Labour MP in 2016 to create, among other things, a more civil public life. Smith is concerned about the abuse that MPs get, particularly on social media. “That whole sphere of public life is much more toxic and potentially difficult now than it was in my day. I took a fair amount of abuse – some of it was deserved, and some wasn’t – but I think, almost across the board, MPs have a much tougher time now. What worries me is that it discourages people from wanting to be part of our democracy.” Particularly women? “It disproportionately affects women, and it disproportionately affects black women, as we’ve seen in terms of the abuse Diane Abbott faces, and Dawn Butler recently. It’s disproportionate for women, disproportionate for women of colour, and it’s worse now than it has been previously and I’m not willing to stand by and see that happen.”
She would like to see the end of anonymity online, at least behind the scenes, “so that, while [people] can remain unknown in public, if they perpetuate hate or threaten online, they can be identified by law enforcement if necessary”. She also supports the designation of misogyny as a hate crime. Politics need not be “gentle”, she says. “But that doesn’t mean dehumanising people, being abusive, invading people’s personal space. It also means encouraging women to step into the public arena – and then protecting them when they’re there.” Would she go into politics now, were she starting again? “I think and hope I still would. But I might have thought more about it than I did at the time, because you are putting yourself out there. More importantly, I want other women to think politics is the place where they belong, where they can make a difference.” There have not been enough women involved in decision-making during the Covid-19 crisis, she says. “I think it has been a problem for this government’s handling of it that there has been such a small, male group of ministers and advisers making decisions. I can’t believe that if there had been more women around the table, there wouldn’t have been somebody saying, for example: ‘If you’re going to tell people on a Sunday night to go to work on a Monday, it might be quite a good idea if you’d thought about whether or not they’ve got childcare or whether or not they’re caring for elderly relatives.’” Likewise, she says it should have been a time to bring in people from all parties. “If you’ve got the biggest public health and political crisis probably in my lifetime, I think it’s a good idea if you bring all the talents in to help you to solve that. Boris Johnson has been too narrow in the people he’s had around him and he’s made less good decisions because of that.” Smith resigned as home secretary in June 2009 and lost her seat the following year. She had been politically vulnerable for some time, but the expenses scandal finished her off. Claiming her sister’s London home as her main residence, which allowed her to claim expenses on the family home in her constituency – while not against MPs’ allowances rules – looked bad.
But it was the revelation that she had claimed for two adult films that became the source of prurient humiliation. Her husband, who was employed as her parliamentary assistant, had to make an excruciating public apology for embarrassing his wife. Even now, a look through the nastier replies to Smith’s tweets confirms people will always associate her with the films. How does she feel about the fact it is so enduring? “I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about what people associate me with; I spend a lot of time worrying about what I can do in terms of continuing public service and the joy that I can have in my life.” The public storm, she says, “was absolutely horrible. There’s nothing nice about being on the front of the newspapers and, more importantly, there’s nothing nice about your family being on the front of newspapers, but we’ve all survived it.” She did not wallow for long, she says: “You spend a lot of time getting on with your life and doing the best that you can. Sometimes, you have to just keep going, and that’s what I did.” Her political career did not survive, but her marriage did – at least, until recently. She says they “remain friends … we’re still in each other’s lives, but just in a different way”. Earlier this year, single for the first time in more than three decades, Smith tried online dating. What was that like? She laughs nervously. “I don’t think it’s that easy for anybody to meet a new partner after being, in my case, happily married for 30 years. I don’t like to be a dinosaur so, yes, I did do some online dating and met some very lovely people.” Did they know who she was? “I haven’t had that many dates, but they had all worked out who I was before I met them.” She adds: “I’m a human being; I’m not just my public persona. Anybody who dates later on in life, you will bring with you a career, a lot of different experiences, but in the end you’re just a human being who’s looking for somebody else to share time and fun with. In that way, you’re not any different to anybody else.” She has a new partner who, she says, has “proved his absolute worth by buying me a vibrating foot spa” to restore her feet after a hard day’s hoofing. What is she hoping to get from Strictly? “A glitterball, obviously,” says Smith of the winner’s trophy, then laughs. “However long it goes on, it has proved to me that it is possible to find new adventures and new fulfilling opportunities at this age – and long may it continue. There is a sort of feeling that you get to a certain age and you should, as a woman, fade into the background. Well, sorry, we’re not doing that any more.”"
2020-10-20T19:35:17Z,politics,Politics,UK police 'unable to cope' if no-deal Brexit cuts EU data sharing,"Police in the UK “will be increasingly unable to cope” in the event of a no-deal Brexit because existing data-sharing agreements with the EU will be cut, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has said. David Anderson is one of a number of senior figures increasingly concerned that failure to strike a Brexit deal could have a serious impact on Britain’s ability to fight cross-border crime, as UK-EU talks remained stalled for their fifth successive day on Tuesday. “Without the ability to exchange data and intelligence across frontiers, law enforcement will be increasingly unable to cope,” the crossbench peer said. “Everything from extradition to notification of alerts, crime scene matches and criminal record searches will be much slower, at best.” Anderson’s warning comes a day after the former prime minister Theresa May openly mocked the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in the Commons after he claimed border security could be better in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The growing standoff in negotiations between London and Brussels has raised the prospect that no agreement will be reached on security and law enforcement cooperation because it is bound up with the overall deal. Without a deal, the UK would lose real-time access to EU databases of criminal records, arrest warrants and passenger information, dramatically slowing investigations, Anderson said.
Currently police in the UK can obtain fingerprints and DNA information from their EU counterparts in 15 minutes using the Prüm system. Prior to its introduction, the Met police said “it used to take four months” to receive the same information. Border officials at Dover and elsewhere have real-time access to systems that allow officials to immediately arrest someone wanted in an EU country. Experts have said it is not clear what would replace this. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, told the Guardian: “Police would be trying to solve crime in a fast-moving world with one hand tied behind their backs.” Falling back on pre-EU agreements was not viable in a world where population movements had rapidly increased, the crossbench peer said. British police checks via the European Criminal Records Information System are instantaneous. Similar checks via alternative systems would take, on average, 66 days, according to evidence given by the Met to a Lords committee earlier this year. Anderson called on both the UK and the EU “to mitigate the damage as far as possible, and that means putting operational concerns ahead of ideology”. He said he hoped that at some point “mutual self-interest” would kick in and a security agreement would at least be reached. Labour also called on both sides to strike a security deal, arguing that cooperation with the EU was needed to combat terrorism, human trafficking and the drugs trade. “The government’s negotiations must provide certainty to UK policing and the security services,” said Conor McGinn, the shadow security minister. Earlier on Tuesday, Michel Barnier accused Downing Street of wasting precious time after a 30-minute afternoon phone call with David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator. Barnier hinted at the frustration in Brussels over the continued suspension of talks. “My message: we should be making the most out of the little time left,” the EU’s chief negotiator tweeted. “Our door remains open.” Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, told the country’s National Assembly that there would be “no new approach” from the EU. He said: “It is up to them to tell us now, beyond tactics, if they want to continue negotiating. We are ready for it.” Boris Johnson has insisted since Friday, when the government declared the talks in effect to be over, that the EU must show willingness to move on its negotiating positions before he would be willing to re-engage with Brussels negotiators. Downing Street said Tuesday’s call with Barnier had still not met the government’s threshold of there being a “fundamental change” in the EU’s approach to talks. A spokesman said: “Lord Frost and Michel Barnier had a constructive discussion. The situation remained as yesterday, and they will remain in contact.” Senior EU diplomats in Brussels remain confident, however, that the impasse will be broken within days, given the EU’s evident willingness to meet Downing Street’s calls for a more flexible approach. EU leaders held a two-hour debate last Friday at the end of a summit, during which leeway was found within the bloc’s red lines. Johnson told business leaders on Tuesday, in a conference call which one described as “totally underwhelming”, that companies might have been “terribly busy with Covid” but must now “make haste” and prepare for the end of the Brexit transition on 31 December. He insisted the UK would prosper outside the EU, telling them: “Rien ne va plus,” which a croupier calls to say “no more bets”. The business leader said: “There was a stunning lack of detail when he was pressed on the transition and how it might work. It is a desperate situation.” The House of Lords also voted by 395 to 169 to express its disapproval of the controversial internal market bill permitting the government to breach international law by overwriting parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The rebel majority was 226 and a total of 39 Conservatives voted against the government. Further votes are scheduled in the coming weeks as the Lords consider the legislation in detail but it highlights the slim hope Downing Street has of getting the bill through parliament with the contentious clauses intact."
2020-10-20T19:32:08Z,politics,Politics,My final offer: Honest Bob checks his pockets for Covid loose change,"You’d have thought that if anyone was capable of brokering a financial deal between central government and Greater Manchester it would have been the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick. After all, Honest Bob has a track record of magicking money out of thin air. Just weeks after sharing a table with the pornographer turned property developer, Richard Desmond, Honest Bob had unlawfully overturned a planning permission refusal on the Westferry development to save Dirty Des £45m with just a day to spare. But this time there was no deal to be had. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, along with other local leaders, had calculated that £90m was the minimum the region needed to boost the lowest paid workers to 80% of their former salaries after being moved into tier 3 lockdown restrictions. That would take the region through to the end of the current financial year. No one is now even bothering to pretend that any region will move down a coronavirus tier in under six months. Honest Bob shook his head. No can do. Not even if Greater Manchester were to make a small donation to the Tory party in gratitude. The best he could offer was £55m. Burnham reduced his demands to £65m, the bare minimum he reckoned he could get by on without people starving on the streets. Honest Bob checked his pockets and found another £5m. But that was his final offer. Come on, said Burnham, some of the consultants who were brought in to set up the test-and-trace system that doesn’t work will have trousered up to £6,000 a day. And what about the £25m hardship fund that Honest Bob’s junior minister had handed over to Jenrick’s own Newark constituency? Even though Newark only ranked 270th on the deprivation list. Surely there must be another £5m where that came from. Honest Bob shook his head. Sadly he had to take care of his junior minister’s own constituency, so there was no more money from that source – £60m was as far as he would go. There would be no extra £5m. And with that he broke off talks at around 2pm. A couple of hours later Burnham gave an informal press conference on the street outside Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall. His dress was casual – black shirt, black hair, black shoes, Sweet Gene Vincent – but his performance was white-hot. A passionate take down of the government in a few well-formed sentences. For the sake of £5m Boris Johnson was prepared to grind the least well-paid workers into poverty. All the talk of a levelling-up agenda had been just bullshit. The real agenda was levelling down. A government that had talked at the beginning of the pandemic about doing “whatever it takes” had switched to the punishment beating of “whatever you get”. Manchester had done everything that had been asked of it and was now getting shat upon. It had, to all intents and purposes, been in tier 2 since the end of July and that had not worked. So now it was being forced into a tier 3 that even the chief medical office and chief scientific adviser did not expect to be effective. So if the region was going to be forced into measures it didn’t believe would help stop the virus spreading, the least the government could do was offer an appropriate level of financial support. But we were where we were. All the manic street preacher could do was urge people to observe the rules and hope that MPs in northern constituencies remembered that if they tolerated this then their people would be next. Anyone hoping that Johnson’s own Downing Street press conference at 5pm would help clear things up was in for disappointment. Even by Boris’s own standards of shambolic incompetence this was something special. Glib, evasive and mendacious, it was almost as if he were on a mission to alienate just about every working-class northern Tory whose votes had won him a landslide victory last December. His red-wall MPs will not have been impressed. Five times Johnson was asked the one question everyone wanted answered. Would Manchester still be getting the minimum of £60m that Honest Bob had offered earlier in the day? And five times Boris was unable to give a straight answer, either mumbling something about the £22m already underwritten for test and trace, muttering about universal credit and other unspecified pots of money, or saying that he couldn’t offer a better deal to Manchester than he had to Liverpool or Lancashire. Even though no one from any of these areas had ever suggested that he might. “My door remains open to Andy Burnham,” Boris said, hastily avoiding the question of whether he had actually visited anywhere in the north-west in the past few weeks to see how people were getting by. Given that he had been the one to shut the door on Burnham, that last piece of information must have come as a shock to the Greater Manchester mayor. But then most of Britain was in shock. It was almost as if this was Johnson’s way of saying he had given up. On himself and the country. An admission that he was the wrong man in the wrong job at the wrong time. How else do you explain a prime minister declaring war on the north-west for the sake of what in Covid-19 bailout terms was loose change?"
2020-10-20T19:31:14Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Hancock says financial support 'remains on table' after Greater Manchester tier 3 imposed – as it happened,"Thatâ€™s it for today as the conflict between central government and local leaders in Greater Manchester rumbles on â€“ hereâ€™s a quick recap of the key points. Some welcome clarification this evening from the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, as he confirmed the governmentâ€™s offer of financial support for Greater Manchester businesses â€œremains on the tableâ€�. It came after Boris Johnson confirmed the government was imposing tier 3 on the region from 12.01am on Friday, but failed to clarify in his press conference the situation regarding financial support. Earlier, at his own press conference, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said Â£60m had been on the table for business and employment support but he rejected it, because he said the region needed Â£65m as a bare minimum. He found out during the conference on live TV that the government was steaming ahead with tier 3 despite talks having broken down. Labour will force a vote in the House of Commons tomorrow on local lockdown restrictions to ensure a â€œfair, one-nation dealâ€�. For all the latest coronavirus updates head to our global liveblog"
2020-10-20T17:56:32Z,politics,Politics,Highways England rebrand accused of being an 'offensive' waste of £7m,"The government is planning to spend an estimated £7m to rebrand Highways England as National Highways, just five years after its last multimillion-pound rebranding. The change of name, which is understood to have been forced on the agency’s leadership by the Department for Transport, has bemused observers. Labour said the move was perplexing, while the decision to rebrand a purely English agency as “national” has provoked anger in Wales, with Plaid Cymru calling the new name “self-aggrandising and offensive”. Government sources suggested a final decision had not been taken but that the name change would reflect its strategic importance. The arm’s-length government agency, which runs the strategic road network of motorways and major A-roads, is understood to have only recently completed the updating of signage from its last name change in April 2015. Extensive instructions on how to ensure the Highways England branding was painted across every brochure, roadworks sign, public document and works vehicle were issued to contractors just last year. Matt Rodda, Labour’s shadow roads minister, said: “At a time of national crisis, going through a national rebranding five years after the last one will be perplexing and seem a potential waste of taxpayer money to most people. The government need to justify why they are doing this and how they came to the decision on the new name.” A Welsh government source said the move would “unnecessarily confuse people as to where responsibility for roads lies – in Wales, with the Welsh government”. The planned rebranding comes weeks after the government reignited a row over the M4 motorway in Wales. The Welsh government scrapped a planned relief road around Newport in 2019 on environmental grounds, but Boris Johnson this month suggested that he would find a way to restart the scheme. Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: “Given this Westminster government’s obsession with rowing back our devolution settlement, this rebrand is wrong, self-aggrandising and offensive. “Regardless of the UK government’s moves to undermine Welsh powers through the UK internal market bill, the fact remains that powers over the operation and maintenance of highways are fully devolved. “It is beyond baffling that the UK government has to be reminded of this fact, over 20 years since the establishment of devolution.” The chief executive of Highways England, Jim Sullivan, resigned in August. A successor is expected in early 2021 to implement the next phase of the government’s £27bn roadbuilding programme. The DfT declined to comment."
2020-10-20T15:29:18Z,politics,Politics,May's challenge to government 'unlikely to be her last',"It was exactly the kind of grimace and shake of the head that dogged Theresa May when she addressed mutinous Tory MPs from the Commons’ dispatch box in her time as prime minister. As Michael Gove argued on Monday that the UK could cooperate better on border security from outside the EU, the former prime minister’s mouth fell open. Her eyes narrowed, her top lip curled. And she glanced right and left to fellow backbenchers before mouthing the words “what?” and “utter rubbish”. It was not the first time May has opposed the current regime. And former colleagues believe her reaction may be the beginning of further active challenges to Boris Johnson’s government, particularly over security as a potential no-deal Brexit looms. Paul Harrison, who was Downing Street’s press secretary under May, said that Gove’s claim – that the UK could “co-operate more effectively” in many areas over borders outside the EU than “we ever could inside” – challenged May’s fundamental political motivations. “Anyone who has worked with her for any length of time would tell you that the security consensus, international cooperation on that – those issues are fundamental,” he told the Guardian. “All of her time as home secretary she tried to further that cause … she thinks it’s the primary duty of governments to protect their citizens, and she thinks that international cooperation is the best way of doing that. So I don’t think anyone who knows her would have been surprised by yesterday. It is a deeply held principle.”
May has been building up to this moment with a number of pointed interventions since she was forced out of office last year. In June, she challenged Johnson at prime minister’s questions to warn about the security implications of a final no-deal Brexit, and then against the coronavirus quarantine plans and the harm they would do to the aviation industry. “Without [international air travel] there is no global Britain,” she said. “So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard?” Later that month, May challenged the prime minister’s appointment of the EU negotiator David Frost as the UK’s national security adviser, describing him as someone “with no proven expertise”. Unlike other national security advisers since the role was created in 2010, Frost had little experience in security and was not a civil servant but a political appointee. This month, she led several senior Conservatives in a rebellion over plans to relax the house-building process in England. Ministers have since indicated that a U-turn is possible. One former cabinet minister said May, MP for Maidenhead since 1997, has been determined to find a new role and believes there are other topics she feels deeply about which she could also be expected to address. “She cares deeply about other issues – violence against women and modern slavery are two of the subjects she worked upon whilst home secretary and in No 10.” The former minister added: “What is so different with Theresa is that she has stayed on in active politics and wants to play an active part. Gordon Brown took a much less prominent role after losing an election. Tony Blair walked out of parliament as did David Cameron. “The recent tradition is for prime ministers to stand back. She has gone back to older traditions where it is the politics and the policies that really matter to her.”"
2020-10-20T14:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Former Tory justice secretary condemns government attacks on 'lefty lawyers',"David Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary, has condemned Priti Patel and Boris Johnson for their attacks on lawyers, saying they highlight an authoritarian-minded government with “a distrust for the law in general”. In a strongly worded article for the Guardian, Gauke echoed concerns from legal groups that comments by the home secretary and prime minister about “lefty human rights lawyers” risked prompting violence.
Gauke, who was the justice secretary and lord chancellor until July last year, criticised the government for what he said was a wider antagonism to the rule of law, as illustrated by its decision to breach international law by seeking to unilaterally re-write elements of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. “This antagonistic attitude to the law is a departure from the traditional position of the Conservative party,” he wrote. Gauke was the MP for South West Hertfordshire from 2005 until last year’s election. He lost the seat after being stripped of the Conservative whip for rebelling in a Brexit vote, and then finishing second behind the Tory candidate while standing as an independent. The former minister noted Patel’s speech at the Conservative conference earlier this month, when she condemned “the do-gooders, the lefty lawyers” for undermining the asylum system. Johnson made similar comments in his speech. Gauke wrote: “The argument that lawyers are upholders of a broken system that is favouring themselves and illegal migrants over decent, honest British folk is designed to provoke anger. In some cases, that anger may turn to violence.” He cited the case of a man charged with an alleged racist attack following an incident in September at the offices of a law firm involved in immigration cases. Gauke said he welcomed the condemnation of violence against lawyers from his successor as lord chancellor, Robert Buckland. “But there is wider concern that this criticism of lawyers reveals a government that appears to have a distrust for the law in general,” he said. “‘Activist lawyers’ work to ensure that their clients get the protections they are entitled to under the law. We do not have a system whereby immigration officials have unfettered discretion to deport individuals, but rather a system constrained by laws.” More widely, Gauke argued, Johnson’s government “gives the impression that striking a balance is something of which it disapproves”, adding: “Anything that constrains its ability to do what it wants – whether it be the European Union, an impartial civil service or the rule of law (or, prior to the general election, the House of Commons) – is an illegitimate source of power that should be diminished, abolished or suspended.” He wrote: “Conservatives are supposed to believe in the rule of law. Lawyers – ‘lefty’ or otherwise – are essential in upholding the rule of law. Conservative cabinet ministers should cease to speak of them as enemies of the people.”"
2020-10-20T12:57:35Z,politics,Politics,"Scots should get new independence vote if SNP wins, says Tory-linked consultancy","A leaked memo given to senior Conservatives suggests the UK government should agree to a fresh independence referendum if the Scottish National party wins an outright majority next May. The document written by Hanbury Strategy, a consultancy with very close links to the Tories, argues the UK government could offer significant new powers to the Scottish parliament and put both options to the vote. The memo was shared with Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister charged with leading the UK government’s efforts to counter a surge in support for Scottish independence, Bloomberg News reported. Bloomberg said the memo also recommends a two-pronged attack on the case for an independent Scotland quickly rejoining the EU – a key argument put forward by Nicola Sturgeon to attract remain voters who rejected independence in the 2014 referendum. Hanbury suggests “co-opting the EU into demonstrating that there is no viable pathway to renewed membership” while at the same time presenting policies on the environment and immigration which are good enough to persuade pro-remain voters to reject independence post-Brexit. Describing the new anti-independence strategy as a “velvet no”, it suggests that it could include allowing Scotland to have different policies in areas such as immigration, a proposal repeatedly pushed by Sturgeon in the run-up to Brexit. The memo summarises the potential strategy for the Tory government in three steps: “New accommodation, new constitutional settlement, and cooperation rather than confrontation.” Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted he will not support a second independence referendum, a stance some Tories believe would be untenable if Sturgeon wins a majority in May but others strongly support. The memo follows a series of opinion polls showing a majority of Scottish voters who have made up their minds now prefer independence. An Ipsos Mori poll last week put backing for independence at 58%, the highest on record, excluding don’t knows. The polls also suggest the SNP is on track to win a majority, a result that Sturgeon insists would give her a clear mandate to stage a second independence vote. Kirsten Oswald, the SNP deputy leader in Westminster, said the memo showed the Tories were now in “panic mode” and had realised Scottish voters believe the prime minister could not be trusted to act in Scotland’s interests. Regardless of the Hanbury memo suggesting much greater devolution, Oswald said the Tories were in fact launching a power grab with the internal market bill which would rob Holyrood of its policymaking powers. “The whole Westminster system is broken and it is time decisions about Scotland were taken by the people who live here,” she said. Senior Scottish Tories admit the polls are an accurate reflection of public mood in Scotland, driven largely by widespread dissatisfaction with and dislike for the prime minister and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “The polls worry the hell out of us because we feel they’re about right,” said one Tory. “We can all feel the ground has shifted. For the first time in our lives, independence is now a majority opinion in Scotland.” The Scottish Tories believe their priority is to prevent the SNP winning a majority in May, and have attracted significant funding to bolster their campaigning and policy development. They claim the greatest challenge facing the anti-independence camp is the Labour party’s weakness in Scotland, with many potential Labour voters now switching to back Sturgeon and the SNP."
2020-10-19T18:49:48Z,politics,Politics,The horrors of Covid swapped for those of an hour with Michael Gove | John Crace,"It made a change to have a break from the horrors of the coronavirus. Even if it was for only an hour. The downside was that we got the horrors of Michael Gove giving a Commons statement on Brexit instead. And like almost all of the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster’s performances, it was conducted entirely without sincerity. At least with Boris Johnson you get the feeling that his past is catching up with him and his untruths are beginning to take their toll on his physical and mental wellbeing. Gove appears to have no vestigial sense of shame. Politics for him is just a theatre in which truth and lies are interchangeable, and he retains an outward appearance where excessive politeness is merely a front for outright contempt. He is the original tabula rasa: every day – or even several times a day – he is the chameleon that reinterprets himself according to his surroundings. His mistakes are not merely forgiven, they are erased from memory. Gove began with a rehash of the prime minister’s Brexit summary of last Friday. The EU had shown bad faith by not devoting all its spare time to engaging with Boris’s three missed deadlines to achieve a deal before the end of the year – apparently they selfishly wanted one day off a week to get on with other business, such as managing a global pandemic – and so unless Michel Barnier agreed to everything we wanted, we were inexorably heading for no deal. Or an “Australian-style” deal, as he called it. Mikey has yet to realise that even the Aussies want more than the deal currently on offer with the EU. But have no fear. “I am not blithe or blase,” he said. Sometimes, a politician’s lack of self-awareness is breathtaking. According to the Govester, 10 weeks was more than enough time for all those businesses that were hopelessly unprepared for a no-deal Brexit to put in place all the systems they needed should the all too thinkable become a reality. In her reply, Labour’s Rachel Reeves openly mocked Gove for his shamelessness. Johnson’s promise that he had “an oven-ready” deal. Mikey’s own insistence from four years ago that a deal between the EU and the UK would be “the easiest in human history” and that “the UK held all the cards”. It was just unfortunate they were are all twos and threes. But Gove looked confused. None of this computed. Because in Mikey-world none of this had happened, despite the video evidence. Now was the time to stop posturing. If anyone was guilty of bad faith, it was the UK for planning to break international law and renege on the withdrawal agreement we had signed less than 10 months previously. A no-deal Brexit would mean 10% tariffs on UK cars and 40% tariffs on lamb. Was that what the government wanted? And talk of no-deal preparations was just delusional as most businesses didn’t have a clue what it was exactly they were meant to be preparing for. Even Theresa May couldn’t resist putting the boot in as she highlighted the dangers no deal posed to policing and national security. Now the Govester just blatantly started lying, insisting we couldn’t sign up to the European court of justice under any circumstances and that we were probably better off not relying on European crime agencies. May looked suitably bewildered and exclaimed: “W-h-a-a-a-t?” She must be bitterly regretting ever having said a no deal was better than a bad deal. Because even she can now see it really isn’t. Next to embarrass himself was Iain Duncan Smith, who despite having recently admitted that no one had ever understood what they were voting for in the withdrawal deal, was adamant that the deal was perfectly clear and that it was time for the EU to start negotiating in good faith. Fortunately for IDS, before anyone had time to pick the bones out of his latest piece of self-inflicted idiocy, Gove received the bombshell news that everything he had said up till now was complete doggybollox and that the EU was now prepared to negotiate the legal texts. It was as if Mikey had spent the first 30 minutes acting Julius Caesar and during the interval had switched to The Comedy of Errors. Since all politics is merely theatre for Gove, he managed the transition seamlessly. No one could be more thrilled than him that the EU had seen sense, and he was looking forward to them caving in to all our demands on fishing quotas, state aid and a level playing field. But he hoped they were serious this time. Again, the lack of self-awareness was rank. But the Tory Philip Hollobone – what has Kettering ever done to deserve a dimmer MP? – took him seriously and demanded that the Royal Navy be on hand to blow any French fishing boats out of the water. The Govester humoured him by promising lethal force. Thereafter, the session rather petered out. Several opposition MPs wanted to know how Farage’s Garages – the lorry parks in Kent now cluttered with bottles of urine as there are no toilets – along with the recruitment of the 50,000 new customs officials that would be required, were coming along. Mikey just blanked those questions. He wasn’t here to talk to problems, he was here to sound vaguely threatening to Johnny Foreigner. The whole play had merely been a charade. A piece of posturing. Because everyone knew how the comedy would end. The UK could not afford a no deal on top of the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic. So the EU would give a little and the UK would give a lot and some sort of deal that Boris had always insisted he could never agree to would be negotiated. And the Govester would be first on his feet in the Commons to declare the deal that was noticeably worse than had been on offer under the Maybot a government triumph. What’s more, he might even believe it."
2020-10-19T17:48:11Z,politics,Politics,UK refuses to restart Brexit talks despite EU accepting its demands,"Downing Street has refused to restart Brexit deal negotiations despite Michael Gove performing a U-turn at the dispatch box in which he praised a “constructive move” by the EU minutes after declaring the talks “effectively ended”. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, seemingly agreed to all the government’s demands for the resumption of Brexit talks in pursuit of a deal – sending a tweet just as Gove was making a statement in the Commons castigating the bloc. A No 10 spokesman said the prime minister had noted the EU’s offer to “intensify” the talks during a call between Barnier and his British counterpart on Monday but insisted there remained no basis yet to resume the negotiation. The spokesman said: “This was a constructive discussion. The UK has noted the EU’s proposal to genuinely intensify talks, which is what would be expected at this stage in a negotiation. However, the UK continues to believe there is no basis to resume talks unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU. “This means an EU approach consistent with trying to find an agreement between sovereign equals and with acceptance that movement needs to come from the EU side as well as the UK. The two teams agreed to remain in close touch.” The knockback means the Brexit standoff continues, with just four weeks left in which worthwhile negotiations may be conducted in pursuit of a comprehensive trade deal before the parliamentary ratification process will need to begin. Speaking in the Commons, Gove had initially welcomed the offer by Barnier. The EU negotiator who spoke to his British counterpart, David Frost, a few hours earlier, tweeted: “I just spoke to David Frost. As stated by [the European commission president] Ursula von der Leyen on Friday, I confirmed that the EU remains available to intensify talks in London this week, on all subjects, and based on legal texts. We now wait for the UK’s reaction.” Barnier’s statement appeared to meet all the requests No 10 had been making as the price of new talks. Gove told MPs: “Even while I have been at the dispatch box it has been reported that there has been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that … obviously we need to work on the basis of the proposed intensification they propose. And I prefer to look forward in optimism than look back in anger.” In response to a further question in the chamber, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster added: “If there has been movement, and it seems there has been today, then no one would welcome it more than me.” The government’s final response once Gove had left the chamber caused some bemusement in Brussels. Both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had said on Friday that they were willing to compromise on the most contentious issues of domestic subsidy control and EU access to British fishing waters.
EU sources suggested that Downing Street simply felt unable to reverse Johnson’s suspension of the talks so quickly. Moments before admitting that the outlook was looking newly positive, Gove had claimed a litany of failures of the EU to engage in good faith with the UK, in a statement to the Commons. He claimed the “EU was only willing to conduct negotiations on fewer than half the days available” for a deal; that it would “not engage on all of the outstanding issues” and “refused to discuss legal texts”. The final insult was its deletion of the chance of an “intensification” of talks in a statement by the council of EU leaders last Thursday, it was claimed. In short, he said, the EU had “refused to negotiate seriously for [the] last month or so”, leading to Johnson’s decision to end talks last Friday unless the EU came back with “fundamental challenges”. He said the preparations for no deal were “now intensifying”, with reports that he has instructed the special “exit operation” committee to meet five times a week as of Monday. The blunt assessment came hours after a “constructive” meeting of Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, at the joint committee charged with implementing January’s withdrawal agreement. It was out of tune with a lengthy statement by Šefčovič an hour following his meeting with Gove. Šefčovič welcomed the clear political steer and commitment given by Gove outlining progress on key areas.
He said that “today’s meeting demonstrated the political will to move at pace on both sides”, but warned that “despite some progress, much work remains to be done by the UK” in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol. One EU insider described the progress at the joint committee meeting as “a turning point”, coming just weeks after the UK threatened to blow up the process with the UK internal market bill’s powers to “disapply” the withdrawal agreement. At the meeting the two sides agreed a number of issues including access to EU databases and IT systems for the UK to implement the protocol. The Irish broadcaster RTÉ also reported that the EU had asked to have 15 border officials present in Northern Ireland in place of a permanent office in Belfast to ensure the EU rules are maintained in relation to customs and veterinary checks."
2020-10-19T17:19:25Z,politics,Politics,'Utter rubbish': Theresa May incredulous at Michael Gove's Brexit claims,"Theresa May has expressed contempt for the government’s post-Brexit policing plans by appearing to mouth “utter rubbish” as Michael Gove declared the UK could do “better” without joint law enforcement operations. The former prime minister made her feelings known as Gove claimed the UK could “cooperate more effectively” in many areas over border security outside the EU than “we ever could inside”. She was caught on camera grimacing and mouthing an incredulous “what?” when Gove said the UK had “a variety of methods and arrangements open to us, open to Border Force and open to our security and intelligence services” after Brexit. A PA Media reporter in the Westminster press gallery said that off-camera May also appeared to mouth “utter rubbish” as Gove went on to explain the no-deal contingencies. Police have expressed deep concern over their capabilities if they lose the European arrest warrant or access to live passenger data, critical in fast-moving counter-terror operations.
May told the Commons that “the government appears resigned to the prospect of no deal, yet one area which they should not be resigned to the prospect of no deal is in security”. She noted that neither Gove, in his update to the house on Monday, nor Boris Johnson, in his letter to parliamentarians on Friday, had mentioned security in recent statements. “Will [Gove] confirm that if the UK walks away with no deal then our police and law enforcement agencies will no longer have the necessary access to databases, such as PNR (passenger name records), in order to continue to identify and catch criminals and potential terrorists in order to keep us safe?” Gove said “significant progress” has been made over security cooperation, but added that in the case of a second tool at the disposal of police – the Schengen Information System 2 (SIS2) – the EU was demanding a role for the European court of justice in the event of disputes, which the UK “cannot accept”."
2020-10-19T17:15:00Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock warns deaths doubled in 12 days; no agreement in Manchester tier 3 talks - as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has indicated that more areas of England could be subject to the strictest tier 3 restrictions. In a statement to MPs he said further discussions are planned this week with south Yorkshire, west Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the north-east and Teesside about moving them into tier 3, the very high alert level. But talks with Greater Manchester about moving it into tier 3 remain deadlocked. (See 5.35pm.) Hancock told MPs the situation was perilous. He said: Weekly deaths in Europe have increased by 33% and here in the UK deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous. During a long statement many MPs complained to Hancock about the performance of NHS Test and Trace. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the liaison committee, told Hancock: One of the reasons why public confidence is in somewhat decline in the governmentâ€™s strategy is because we have yet to see the transformation of the leadership of test and trace about which I have discussed with him many times. Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, has told a committee of MPs and peers that it is â€œunlikelyâ€� that a coronavirus vaccine will stop the disease completely. Speaking to the joint national security strategy committee, Vallance said: I think it is unlikely that we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine that completely stops infection. It is likely that this disease will circulate and be pandemic. My assessment - and I think thatâ€™s the view of many people - is thatâ€™s the likely outcome. Clearly as management becomes better, as you get vaccination that will decrease the chance of infection and the severity of the disease - or whatever the protocols of the vaccines are - this then starts to look more like annual flu than anything else and that may be the direction we end up going in. A temporary national lockdown will be imposed in Wales, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced. In a report Welsh government advisers say this measure could save almost 1,000 lives by Christmas. (See 5.31pm. Tourism businesses in Wales are spending Monday cancelling customersâ€™ holidays after the first minister Mark Drakeford announced a two-week national lockdown designed to be a â€œshort, sharp shock to the virus to slow down its spreadâ€�. The UK has recorded 851 deaths over the past week - up 68% on the previous week, the latest daily figures show. (See 4.36pm.) About a third more deaths in England are occurring at home than before the Covid-19 pandemic, data has revealed, with the majority down to causes other than the coronavirus. Downing Street has said a procedural concession by the EU does not go far enough to justify restarting the UK-EU trade talks. (See 5.43pm.) The archbishop of Canterbury has led criticism of the internal market bill in the House of Lords during its second reading debate. Referring to the way the legislation would allow the government to break international law, by ignoring pledges made in the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Justin Welby said: In the Church of England, we are all too clearly aware of the shame that comes with failing morally. Letâ€™s not make the same mistake at national level. This House exists to amend and improve legislation, not to derail it, and that must be our urgent aim now. Michael Howard, the former Tory leader and Brexiter, also criticised the bill. He quoted Margaret Thatcher, who said: â€œBritain does not break treaties. It would be bad for Britain. Bad for relations with the rest of the world and bad for any future treaty on trade.â€� That said it all, Howard told peers. He went on: I want the United Kingdom to be an independent and sovereign state. But I want it to be an independent sovereign state that holds its head up high in the world, that keeps its word, that upholds the rule of law, that honours its treaty obligations. I want it to be an independent sovereign state that is a beacon unto the nations. I do not want it to be an independent sovereign state that chooses, as one of the first assertions of that sovereignty, to break its word, to break the law and to renege on a treaty it signed barely a year ago. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-10-19T10:50:50Z,politics,Politics,Yasmin Qureshi MP in hospital with pneumonia after positive Covid test,"The Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi is being treated for pneumonia in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus. Qureshi, the shadow international development minister, said she was admitted to the Royal Bolton hospital on Saturday after her condition deteriorated. The 57-year-old MP for Bolton South East said she had started to feel unwell two weeks ago before testing positive for Covid-19. She had been self-isolating for 10 days before feeling “much worse” on Saturday. She said in a statement on social media: “Two weeks ago, I began to feel unwell. I then tested positive for Covid-19, so my family and I immediately self-isolated at home. I have not travelled to Westminster or anywhere else. “I continued to work as best I could remotely, attending virtual meetings and doing casework, but after 10 days, I began to feel much worse and on Saturday I was admitted to the Royal Bolton hospital with pneumonia. “I’m being very well looked after and have nothing but praise and admiration for the wonderful staff at the hospital. They have been amazing throughout the process and I would like to extend my thanks to everyone working here in such difficult circumstances.”
Qureshi has represented Bolton South East for a decade and was a shadow justice minister under Jeremy Corbyn from 2016 until April, when she was appointed to her current role by Keir Starmer. Qureshi has continued to work while self-isolating at home in Bolton, asking written questions of the Department for Education on Thursday and Friday last week. She spoke briefly to the Guardian on Wednesday but was too unwell to continue the phone call. MPs from across the political divide wished Qureshi a speedy recovery. Starmer tweeted: “My thoughts are with my friend @YasminQureshiMP who has been admitted to hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19. My thanks go to the staff caring for Yasmin at the Royal Bolton hospital, along with NHS staff across the country who are on the frontline against Covid-19.” The Conservative MP Angela Richardson said: “Very sorry to hear of the hospitalisation of @YasminQureshiMP due to Covid-19. My thoughts with her and her family and friends for a speedy recovery.” Linda Thomas, the mayor of Bolton council, added: “Sorry to hear you are in hospital @YasminQureshiMP Hope you improve soon. Thinking about you. Take care!” Like many other MPs, Qureshi cancelled her weekly constituency surgeries in March and has not been meeting constituents face to face. She told the Guardian in June there was a “serious and genuine concern” among many MPs from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background about working in the Commons: “When I’ve been talking to some of my BAME colleagues, they’re really worried. They’re worrying about being forced to turn up at parliament because BAME communities are at the highest risk. Somebody literally said, it’s gonna kill us off. “Maybe they were saying it for dramatic purposes, half in jest, but I think it’s fair to say that there is serious and genuine concern among MPs that they will get infected and spread it on to their families.”"
2020-10-19T06:11:26Z,politics,Politics,How Downing Street's coronavirus 'diktats' tore Britain apart,"After six days of difficult and largely fruitless discussions with Downing Street, tempers were fraying among Greater Manchester council leaders and MPs on Thursday morning. In a meeting at 9am between the region’s mayor, Andy Burnham, and local government chiefs, the leader of Rochdale Borough Council, Allen Brett told his colleagues he was so fed up with London that he wanted to make his feelings clear to Edward Lister, the prime minister’s close adviser, with whom the group was preparing to open yet another online discussion at 9.30am. “I said I was angry, annoyed and frustrated,” Brett recalled. “I said I just felt like saying [to Lister], just stop messing us around. Tell us if you have the evidence for all this and that it will work – or not. Just tell us.” Brett thought his colleagues might disapprove of him going for Lister’s jugular, but instead they urged him on and said they all felt the same way. Lister had been trying since the previous Friday to convince the area’s leaders to agree to move into the new tier 3 level of restrictions to combat rising Covid-19 infection rates – a move that would mean the complete closure of all Greater Manchester’s pubs and bars again. But the talks had gone nowhere.
With Liverpool already having been forced to accept tier 3 restrictions because of high infection rates and hospital admissions, Lister was desperate for Greater Manchester to fall into line before ministers held online talks with local MPs, including its nine Tories, at 10.30am. If they too agreed, the plan was that it could all be announced as a sealed deal, with everyone in the north-west united, in a statement to the Commons by health secretary Matt Hancock at 11.30. But the Greater Manchester leaders wanted answers and evidence from London – not instructions and orders, or fake shows of unity. They feared the measures would inflict severe economic damage on local people, and leave many thousands unable to pay their bills in the run-up to Christmas. Over previous days anger had been building for many reasons. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had said just 67% of wages would be paid to those affected by the latest tier 3 closures, rather than the 80% that applied under the furlough scheme announced in March. Why were people in the north-west being offered less than those in the spring national lockdown, they asked? Manchester leaders had also had problematic meetings with Prof Jonathan Van Tam, the government’s deputy chief medical officer for England, which made them wonder if there was any science at all behind the plan. They had asked Van Tam if he could guarantee that closing pubs and clubs would bring the virus under control in their areas – and Van Tam said he couldn’t. When the meeting with Lister began it was Burnham who piled in first, telling the man from No 10 that he had failed to provide any evidence of why closures would work, or reassurances about improved economic support. “You are doing all this and telling us to go into tier 3 but you haven’t even answered the questions we gave you last time,” he said.
At 10.30am, things got even more fractious when the 29 local Labour and Tory MPs began a meeting with junior health minister Helen Whately. Van Tam was present again. When Van Tam told the MPs – who included five Tories who had won their “red wall” seats for the first time last December – that people in pubs and bars who talked above loud music were more likely to spread the virus, the Labour MP Lucy Powell was so cross she un-muted herself and told him in no uncertain terms that for 12 weeks it had been table service only in Greater Manchester, and that households had only been able to mix outside anyway. Then, when Whately tried to hurry the meeting to an end, Jim McMahon, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, protested, telling the minister: “Well I am sorry if you haven’t got time. But people in this meeting represent 2.9 million people and you are going to have to listen to what we have got to say!” When Whately summed up saying that she had heard many different views, most of the MPs – Tory and Labour – un-muted too, saying that was rubbish because they were all 100% united. They did not want to go into tier 3 and that was that. Conservative MPs had been just as critical as the Labour ones. Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP for Altrincham and Sale West and chair of the 1922 committee, said: “The case has not been made for Greater Manchester to move into a tier 3 lockdown.” Another Conservative, William Wragg, who represents Hazel Grove, was most outspoken of all. He said: “I have news from Greater Manchester where the impossible has been achieved. All of the MPs, the leaders of the councils and indeed the mayor, surprisingly, are in agreement with one another, the meeting we had earlier today was entirely pointless. I may as well have talked to a wall, quite frankly.” Greater Manchester was far from alone in breaking ranks last week. At the very time the government needed national unity behind the new three-tier system, different areas of the UK were pulling in different directions. In England resentment about rules being forced on them from London had grown among local leaders who had for more than six months been calling, largely in vain, to be given additional local powers to run their own anti-Covid-19 strategies. It had all built up into an ugly mood. “We have got Liverpool feeling cheated, Lancashire feeling bullied, and Manchester angrily determined,” the Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “ I think what we have seen in the last few days is that even long-held party loyalties are giving way to a widespread belief that the most urgent threat to life and livelihoods is not what is going on in Liverpool gyms and Lancashire pubs: it is 200 miles away in an increasingly disconnected Westminster bunker that seems to lack either the care or competence to get us through the crisis.”
The spirit of regional defiance saw cities and areas put local interests first. Liverpool City Region’s metro mayor, Steve Rotheram, agreed midweek to accept tier 3 restrictions because of the area’s acute problems with rising virus rates and hospital admissions. But he made clear he would have preferred a short “circuit break” or national lockdown, as would Burnham. Rotheram insisted he had been left with little option. “The government didn’t give us a choice on Tuesday, we were going into tier 3 no matter what,” he said, adding that he was still fighting for more economic support. “Of course, we want to preserve life but we need a package of support to preserve the livelihoods.” London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, says he too would prefer a national lockdown, as well as Essex and York, were put under tier 2 controls, meaning tighter restrictions on household mixing. Scotland closed pubs across its central belt earlier this month. Wales’s first minister, Mark Drakeford, last week imposed a ban on people from Covid-19 hot spots in other parts of the UK travelling to his country. Pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland were ordered to close and schools will have an extended half-term break as part of a four-week “circuit-breaker” to deal with soaring cases. First minister Arlene Foster announced that the partial lockdown would also mean a ban on indoor sport, close-contact services such as hairdressing, and public events involving more than 15 people. Across England, Tory concerns were not confined to “red wall” areas of the north west. Andy Street, the mild-mannered former businessman who is now the Tory metro mayor for the West Midlands, issued a statement on Monday revealing that he did not agree with the decision to place the majority of the region into tier 2. Street had been pushing for more flexibility to be placed in the tiering system. Tier 2 would increase restrictions on hospitality, which he argued was not a big transmitter of the virus in the region. After weeks of close cooperation, relations “have soured”, said one insider. On the night he won his stunning general victory last December, Boris Johnson said he wanted to run a “one nation” government. The Tories had taken dozens of Labour seats in the north and Midlands. Johnson promised to repay the trust of those former Labour voters by working night and day on their behalf. The UK would be “levelled up”. Just as David Cameron and George Osborne had promoted the idea of a “northern powerhouse” the Conservatives under Johnson were again promising big things for their new voters in working-class areas.
Over the past week, however, the fight against Covid-19 has, in the eyes of many voters in those areas, made a mockery of such pledges. Centralised policy-making, diktats from the centre, and refusals over recent months by the Johnson government to devolve authority to local leaders in the fight against coronavirus have instead fuelled intense anger. Some now predict that Covid-19 could turn out to be as damaging to the Tories in the north under Johnson as the miners’ dispute was to the party under Margaret Thatcher. Lord (Jim) O’Neill, who served as a minister under David Cameron, and who helped promote the northern powerhouse, said he did not know how the government could get out of the mess it had got itself into. “How can you have a government with a prime minister who made his first two trips to the north to make passionate speeches about how he is going to do something about levelling up, now be pushing ideas that would do the reverse? I can see why the Treasury might want to penny-pinch a bit but how on earth, when the government happily introduced the 80% furlough in March, now – when it relates to the north – can they say they will chop it to 67%?
“If it is just about pubs and bars, why don’t they just guarantee the revenue of the pubs and bars?” Asked if the pandemic had demonstrated the case for more devolution, O’Neill added: “100% it has. The theme of the northern powerhouse is about treating the regions more seriously, including devolving policies seriously; and I think the crisis has demonstrated the case better than any words that ever came out of me or anybody else.” Even before the latest rows, Conservative MPs were angry with their own government for ignoring them and being too centralised. Now that anger has spread to the regions and cities amid cries that One Nation promises have been betrayed.
Deborah Mattinson, author of a recent book on the red wall seats won by Tories at the last election, returned to voters she spoke to then. Their responses suggest a shift in opinion might be under way. Ian, a Tory convert from Lancashire was scathing, she reports for an article on theguardian.com. “The whole lockdown thing isn’t working and needs a rethink. You can’t impose these ideas from the top. Andy Burnham knows the area and the likely impact on the area, but he hasn’t been listened to. I’m increasingly unconvinced by Boris Johnson, he’s not impressed me at all,” he said. Courteney, from Middleton, was still more negative, saying: “I don’t think the north will recover fully for a long time if the Tier 3 lockdown is imposed.” Professor Tony Travers, an expert in local government at the London School of Economics, said the combination of Covid 19 and Brexit had highlighted the need for a “constitutional re-set” involving real devolution, if trust in government was not to be further eroded. “Attempting to deliver politically sensitive local lockdowns based on confidential data analysed in Whitehall was bound to end in trouble,” he said. “Telling people in Bolton, Liverpool and Gateshead they had further to curtail their freedoms because of decisions by the cabinet on the basis of numbers analysed in London could only have worked if civic leaders had been brought fully into decision-making.” He added: “Until such power and resource-raising powers are shifted to mayors such as Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram and Andy Street, levelling-up has no chance of success.” Yesterday, as the deadlock continued between Greater Manchester and central government, it was clear where most people in the city were placing their trust. Inside the popular Wilson’s Social bar on Oldham Street, chef Romin Farahani said: “Burnham’s right on this, he’s the only one who’s stood up to them.” Across the road, Mike Davis, barman at the Freemount pub, was withering about the prime minister’s handling of the crisis. “There is no science backing it [tier 3]. The 10pm curfew? What’s the point?” And along nearby Hilton Street, Colin White, who runs Vinyl Revival, said his record sales were hugely down. “Any impact on the night-time economy has a massive knock-on effect for us, we’re already 50% down. It’s a complete shitshow, but at least Burnham is trying to help the working man,” he said."
2020-10-18T23:01:03Z,politics,Politics,"Scrapping in-work training fund will harm economic recovery, warn trade unions","Scrapping a “vital” work-based education fund would harm Britain’s post-coronavirus recovery, according to a coalition of trade unions and employers urging the government to reverse cuts to its support for the union learning fund (ULF). Although the government’s annual funding for the programme is only £12m, the coalition led by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) argues that it helps more than 200,000 workers a year to get access to education and training that they would struggle to receive elsewhere. The group lobbying to restore the funding includes the TUC and its members, as well as major employers such as Tesco, Heathrow airport, Arla Foods and Tata Steel.
Paula Stannett, Heathrow airport’s chief people officer, said: “The announcement that funding support for the union learning fund is to be ended is as disappointing as it is perplexing. The unprecedented impact that this pandemic is having on jobs across the UK means there has never been a more critical time to invest in upskilling. We urge the government to rethink its decision.” The ULF was established in 1998, and is administered by UnionLearn, the TUC’s education and skills arm, under an agreement with the Department for Education (DfE), which directs the learning activities to be supported by the fund. It offers workplace access to literacy, language and maths classes as well as technology skills, apprenticeships and professional development. The TUC said it had been “stunned” to receive notification from the DfE of the impending cut, without any consultation over the fund’s future, only a few days after Boris Johnson promised that a lifetime skills guarantee would be part of the government’s “build back better” strategy.
“Every year we hear from workers who couldn’t read confidently before union learning came into their life. Now they not only read their work emails, they can finally read their children a bedtime story,” said Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary. “The prime minister has been clear on the importance of improving skills to rebuilding the economy. Union learning is a national asset and a vital plank of building back better. The prime minister must reject this proposal.” The most recent evaluation of the programme found that two-thirds of those with no previous qualifications gained a qualification after taking part, and 80% overall said their new skills helped them get another job. It calculated that for every £1 spent, workers using the ULF gained £7.60 in better pay, while employers gained £4.70 through higher productivity, and the Treasury benefited by £3.57 from savings and revenue gains. “At a time when the country is on the brink of mass unemployment, and when ministers themselves are talking about the need for upskilling and retraining, it would be ludicrous to cut one of the most effective programmes allowing workers to expand their skills,” said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. “For 22 years, the union learning fund has provided crucial training and guidance to thousands of firefighters. For injured and retiring firefighters, it’s a vital means of gaining new skills.” A DfE spokesperson said: “We have taken the decision not to continue to provide grant funding to UnionLearn in the next financial year. We will instead be investing the money to directly support further education colleges, other training providers and our new £2.5bn national skills fund to help more people learn new skills.”"
2020-10-18T21:36:29Z,politics,Politics,Brexit negotiations expected to resume despite UK's tough rhetoric,"Brussels expects the Brexit negotiations to resume within days, as Michael Gove confirmed that despite Downing Street’s tough rhetoric the door remained “ajar” on re-engagement. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will hold a video conference call with his British counterpart, David Frost, on Monday afternoon to discuss the structure of future talks. While it is probable that Downing Street will need to appear tough by pushing back against an immediate resumption of the trade and security negotiations, sources on both sides expect the current suspension to be short. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and BusinessEurope, the body representing European industry, have urged the British government and the European commission to show leadership and swiftly return to the negotiating table. “Now is the time for historic political leadership”, read a joint statement by the CBI and organisations representing 190,000 businesses and 7 million employees in the UK. “With compromise and tenacity, a deal can be done.” BusinessEurope’s director general, Markus Beyrer, said: “An agreement is still possible and it is the only way to avoid uncertainty and major disruption.” There remains a further four weeks when there could be worthwhile negotiations before a deal would need to be ready for the ratification process in Westminster and the European parliament. Gove confirmed on Sunday that he wanted a trade deal and that the government had not closed the door on the negotiations. “It is ajar,” he said during an interview on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. “We hope that the EU will change their position – we’re certainly not saying that if they do change their position that we can’t talk to them.” One senior EU diplomat said they did not expect the standoff to last long given the British government’s evident desire to avoid a double hit to the economy from a no-deal outcome and the second wave of coronavirus. “If they want a deal, they will need to continue talking and not leave the negotiating table for long,” an EU source said. “In any case, the EU position very clear: let’s keep talking. There is a deal somewhere out there. [It is] up to the UK to make up its mind.” “We will just need David [Frost] and Michel [Barnier] to kiss and make up,” said a second diplomat. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had said on Friday that further negotiations with the EU would be pointless without a “fundamental change” in Brussels’ position. When it announced the “effective” ending of the trade talks, Downing Street had pointed to the failure of the EU leaders in their summit communique to commit to “intensified” negotiations, a pledge that existed in an earlier draft. It is understood the word had been taken out before the leaders signed it off on the basis that commitment was extraneous given a similar pledge had been given in previous summit statements. There was also a concern that it could be seen as putting pressure on Barnier. EU sources said that the reason given by the government for its reaction was disingenuous. “They had full sight of what was going to be in the conclusions – they just wanted a moment of crisis and would have used any excuse to engineer one,” said one. “But the prime minister had set the summit as a deadline for a deal, and he needed to do something apparently.” The bar reportedly set now by Downing Street for a renewal of talks includes daily negotiations, an acceptance that there needs to be movement on both sides and work on legal texts across the various parts of the trade deal. Barnier has already said he wants to speed up the talks. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, speaking on Friday, had said there was “leeway” in the negotiations. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, offered to compromise on fisheries, even though until now there has been stubborn resistance from Paris to any changes in the distribution of catches in British waters. There remains some resistance in Brussels to working on legal text until the landing zones on the most contentious issues are in sight. But EU sources said that did not seem a major obstacle to fresh talks, given the new willingness to compromise on fisheries and the so-called level playing field provisions sought by Brussels to ensure neither side can undercut through deregulation or unfairly skew the market through domestic subsidies. Meanwhile, the government has launched a “time is running out” campaign to urge businesses to prepare for the end of the transition period. From 1 January, whether there is a trade deal or not, the UK will be outside the single market and customs union, creating extra paperwork for businesses. HMRC is writing to 200,000 firms that trade with the EU to set out the new customs and tax rules coming into place, and advise how to deal with them."
2020-10-18T07:30:43Z,politics,Politics,Experts claim Boris Johnson’s ‘thin’ EU deal will cause major economic upset,"The narrow EU deal sought by Boris Johnson will act as a “dead weight” on Britain’s ability to trade, the former boss of the Brexit department has warned, amid rising concerns that the country remains dangerously ill prepared for such an outcome. Negotiations with the EU remained stuck this weekend after Downing Street told EU negotiators not to bother making a planned trip to London without offering a “fundamental change of approach”. The prime minister stopped short of calling off talks, which will continue this week. In a sign of the severity of business unease, more than 70 trade associations and professional bodies today issue an extraordinary joint plea to both sides to carve out a deal. However, there are concerns within government and industry that the dire threat of a no-deal outcome has masked the impact of a “thin” EU deal on trade. While a deal will remove tariffs on trade, significant “non-tariff barriers” will be imposed, adding serious costs on manufacturers and practical difficulties for hauliers – while the UK’s large services sector is also expected to be subject to new barriers. Philip Rycroft, who ran the Brexit department until last year, said that negotiators were essentially hammering out “the extent of new barriers to trade”. “No deal is certainly worse than a deal, but it is just worth remembering – customs declarations, security declarations, regulatory checks, rules of origin, compliance – all of the panoply of a border applies if we get the deal,” he said. “The change that happens at the end of this year, either way, is a massive logistical challenge and a very expensive one.
“You have the short-term impact, but then you have a dead weight on trade for ever, because that’s the nature of being out of the [EU’s] single market. It puts friction into our trading relationship with the EU – that friction equals cost. It will change the nature of the trade relationship between the UK and the EU. If you believe in free trade, that’s clearly not a good thing.” Talks held last week between the Cabinet Office and industry figures saw both sides express concerns over readiness for the changes due in January. Industry disquiet also remains around the readiness of a new border computer system, as well as the impact on sectors such as financial, legal and business services. Ben Fletcher, executive director of policy at Make UK, said even the best deal now on offer was “a long way from the kind of deal that was being discussed as a starting point during Theresa May’s discussions – which itself was a very long way away from the status quo”. “Across the big business sectors there is a real nervousness that too many firms think that the potential deal is actually largely the status quo – there is a dangerous underlying belief that ultimately, someone will emerge from a building in Brussels with a deal and things will carry on as normal. There are real fears that the hidden shock here is that the scale of change, from where we sit today to where we might sit even with a deal on 1 January, is pretty significant – and pretty scary.” Some in industry said they were reluctant to raise concerns about the potential deal because no deal was the immediate threat. Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe, said: “One of the things the current furore over deal v no deal serves to disguise is the fact that even if there is a deal, it will be a relatively ‘thin’ one which will lead to potentially serious disruption and have a significant impact on the economy.”
No deal remains a danger because talks have stalled over fishing rights in British waters and so-called level playing field (LPF) rules in relation to Britain’s future use of state aid. Industry sources said they expected shortages in supermarkets to force the UK back to the negotiating table in the event of no deal. Nick Macpherson, the Treasury’s top civil servant from 2005 to 2016, said the UK government would have little choice. “The deal on offer will cause economic damage since there will still be friction at the border which will discourage trade with our biggest market,” he said. “But no deal would do much more harm, in particular to manufacturing industries such as cars and chemicals and would make Britain’s return to the negotiating table at some point inevitable.” However, Ivan Rogers, Britain’s former EU ambassador, suggested political pride may prevent that from happening. “The [EU] aim would be to force the British side back to the table. But as LPF conditionality would still be on the table for any negotiation after a no deal, I find it hard to see how Johnson could go back to the table when the terms from the other side were clearly unchanged. He is now boxed in. No deal has, for many years, been a substantial risk – not least because, for so many on the right, it was always the objective, and the ‘only true’ Brexit. If we go that route, it is in the EU’s strategic interests to make it rough. And they would.”"
2020-10-18T07:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Young Scots rally to independence banner for 2021 elections,"When Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum, Valentina Servera Clavell was 14 and living in Barcelona amid a burgeoning movement for Catalan independence. “We were looking to Scotland for an example that we could use to justify asking for our own referendum,” she said. “When the results came in, we were deeply sad because [the pro-independence side] were not only fighting for Scotland but for all the other independence movements across the world.” Now 21 and a student at Glasgow Caledonian University, Servera Clavell is hoping to be selected as the SNP candidate for the city’s Shettleston constituency in next year’s Scottish parliament elections. Her candidacy comes as new polling shows huge support for independence among young voters, with 79% of 16- to 24-year-olds and 68% of 25- to 34-year-olds saying they would support leaving the union. Overall, the Ipsos Mori poll suggested 58% of voters in Scotland now backed independence. “These are going to be the elections of independence,” she said of the 2021 contest. “There were people who were undecided in 2014, or who voted for a stable union in the UK. Brexit and Covid-19 and the disaster of Boris Johnson’s administration have made people realise they can’t offer Scotland anything.” Servera Clavell is one of a new generation of candidates hoping to secure another pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament and make the case for a second referendum. While the SNP does not currently have a majority, the Scottish Greens’ pro-independence stance means a majority of MSPs already support the move. Were the pro-independence parties to win a fresh majority, the SNP is likely to call for a new referendum. Also vying to become an MSP next year is 31-year-old Roza Salih, prospective SNP candidate in Clydebank and Milngavie in the west of Scotland. One of the “Glasgow Girls”, a group of activist schoolgirls who fought the Home Office over the detention of an asylum-seeker friend in 2005, Salih hopes to be the first refugee elected to the Scottish parliament.
“I grew up in Kurdistan, where members of my family were executed for their support of independence,” she said. “The idea that Scotland could become independent through democratic and peaceful means was a really radical concept to me.” Salih’s support for Scottish independence comes from a belief that “decisions taken in Westminster just do not benefit the Scottish people. We didn’t want austerity; we didn’t want a Conservative government; we didn’t want to leave the EU. I want a radical country that takes a different approach to things like jobs and social justice and the climate crisis.” The 2014 referendum has often been credited with politicising a new generation of young Scots. Leòdhas Massie left school just months before the vote and joined the yes campaign as his first foray into politics. Now 25, Massie is a candidate for the Scottish Greens in the north-east region. “I remember talking about it in school and I began to form these ideas of what I wanted Scotland to be. I wanted a republic, reformed land ownership, more representative parliamentary democracy,” he recalled. “And then I started to realise none of that was possible in the UK.” Since the 2014 referendum, Massie has moved from the SNP to the Greens and evolved his thinking on independence. “I used to think we needed independence and we’d be able to do all this stuff overnight,” he said. “Now I see it more as the beginning of a process and not the endpoint in itself. We have to achieve it and then harness all the opportunities that presents.” The Scottish Conservatives and Liberal Democrats remain firmly opposed to independence, as does the Scottish Labour leadership. But at the Labour party’s grassroots, a number of young activists are pushing for the party to rethink its position.
“So many young people support independence, and if you want a left-leaning Labour party then you’re not going to get it by chasing an ageing cohort of more socially conservative unionists,” said Patricia Johnston, 24, who is standing to be a candidate for Labour in the Lothian region. “If voters keep returning pro-independence majorities, I think it’s pretty clear what they’re saying to us.” Having voted no in 2014, it was the 2019 general election result which changed Johnston’s mind on independence. “Most young members I know are agnostic or pro-independence,” she said, pointing particularly to the influx of members under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. “But people definitely feel there’s a disincentive to talking about it within the party.” Dr Iain MacLeod, lecturer in politics and strategy at Robert Gordon University, urges caution over reading too much into polling due to small sample sizes and generally lower turnout among young people. However, he said, “the overall findings of the poll across all age-groups certainly seem consistent with other recent polls, all of which have shown that support for independence is moving upwards.” For Struan Mackie, 27, a Conservative councillor in the Highlands, the arguments of 2014 still stand. “We have a shared history, culture and identity that needs to come to the fore,” he said. “Young people will not forgive us for taking our eye off the ball on the issues that matter to them because of a fixation on the constitution and dividing our country further.” But, for 2021’s young pro-independence candidates, the time has come for change. “We’re bold, we’re not afraid of speaking our minds, we’re more radical,” said Salih. “That’s the change we need in politics.”"
2020-10-18T06:15:42Z,politics,Politics,Top ministers urged Priti Patel to stop attacks on 'activist lawyers',"Home secretary Priti Patel ignored warnings from at least two senior colleagues to stop targeting immigration lawyers after a knifeman threatened to kill a solicitor last month in an attack linked to her rhetoric, the Observer can reveal. Lord chancellor Robert Buckland and attorney general Suella Braverman intervened after the attack to tell Patel that her targeting of the legal profession was already believed to have inspired an incident that might have left a solicitor dead. Both asked Patel to cease her attacks on the legal profession, warning that more violence could materialise following the 7 September incident when a man entered a law firm in London armed with a “large, heavy duty knife” and embarked on a “racist, violent attack” that injured a staff member before the assailant was overwhelmed. Patel, however, ignored the pleas from her two senior colleagues and during her speech to the Tory party conference on 4 October intensified her targeting of “do-gooders” and “lefty lawyers”. Two days later Boris Johnson went even further, telling the annual Conservative conference the criminal justice system was “being hamstrung by lefty human rights lawyers”.
Downing Street on Friday night refused to answer questions from the Observer about what Johnson knew of the attack, Patel’s alleged role in inspiring it and, if he did know, why he felt comfortable risking fresh attacks against lawyers. Legal sources have confirmed that the first requests from fellow ministers to Patel to desist came two days after the knife attack, when officials from the Bar Council and Law Society contacted Buckland and Braverman to pass on their concerns and tell Patel her anti-lawyer rhetoric needed to stop. “The message was please help us, this can’t go on. Speak to the home secretary and tell her not to keep going with this because it’s putting people’s lives at risk. They also specifically told the Home Office that this is really serious,” said the source. The lord chancellor is said to be particularly perturbed by Patel’s rhetoric. On Wednesday, speaking at David Greene’s inauguration as the 176th president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Buckland robustly defended the legal profession and launched a thinly veiled attack on Patel’s judgment. “No one should be vilified for doing their job, whether we be public servants or professionals in private practice,” said Buckland. He added: “Lawyers play an important role in upholding the law, representing their clients – and their sometimes political views – and ensuring that people have access to justice. I, and this government, are absolutely clear that any form of violence or abuse against lawyers is utterly unacceptable.” On Friday night Greene told the Observer: “We have made our position clear to government and we will continue to do so on behalf of members and on behalf of the public in terms of the rule of law.”
Meanwhile political pressure continues to grow over Patel’s conduct in office. Stuart McDonald, SNP spokesperson on immigration, asylum and border control, has tabled a series of questions asking why the home secretary appears to have ignored representations concerning her use of the phrases “activist lawyers” and its implications for the safety of members of the profession. One of the questions asks if Patel, Buckland or Braverman told the prime minister “of any representations received from legal professional bodies concerning the rhetoric aimed at lawyers” prior to Johnson’s conference speech. The attack at the law firm came days after Patel claimed that “activist lawyers” were frustrating the removal of migrants. It was this choice of language that documents provided by the targeted law firm believe led to the attack, stating that: “Responsibility and accountability for this attack, in the eyes of this firm, lies squarely at the feet of Priti Patel.” A 28-year-old man has been charged with possession of, and making threats with, a bladed article in a public place; racially aggravated public disorder; assault; and making threats to kill in connection to the 7 September attack."
2020-10-17T06:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Cabinet Office to hire photographer in effort to level up government’s image,"Downing Street’s critics might argue that making the government look good at present is a tough task as it faces a bruising time, lurching from one Covid-related crisis to another. But No 10 is seemingly attempting to remedy the situation – by hiring a £60,000-a-year photographer. A job advert posted by the Cabinet Office, which supports the prime minister, states that the job of the photographer will be to “promote the work of ministers and the wider government visually”. In what could be a nod to the chaotic goings-on in government, it adds: “No two days will ever be the same in this role. One day you may accompany a cabinet minister on an international visit, working closely [with] press officers across Whitehall to deliver a series of coordinated announcements, and the next you will be working in the Cabinet Office producing innovative visual content.” A key feature of the Whitehall-based role, whose holder will be paid a salary of between £54,700 and £60,635, will apparently involve out-of-hours working, including travelling domestically and overseas with ministers. The successful candidate will “require a high level of tenacity, confidence and determination combined with a good news sense, a high degree of political awareness and exceptional relationship management skills”. As well as being “highly motivated”, the post holder will need to be “comfortable working autonomously in a high-pressure environment”, the advert states. The photographer, who will work across departments, will be employed in addition to Boris Johnson’s in-house one. Earlier this year it emerged that the prime minister had hired a personal photographer at taxpayers’ expense. Andrew Parsons, who had previously been employed by the then prime minister David Cameron and was taken off the public payroll in 2010 amid criticism of so-called “vanity staff”, was appointed as a media special adviser in January. Separately, Parson’s firm, Parsons Media, received four payments totalling £45,525.25 from the Conservatives for work during last year’s general election, electoral commission figures show. A government spokesperson said: “We are recruiting an experienced photographer to capture and share the government’s work through engaging visual content. This post will work across departments and play a leading role in upskilling the government’s digital communications professionals.”"

2020-10-16T15:48:45Z,politics,Politics,What did Boris Johnson mean by an Australia-style system of trade?,"What has Boris Johnson said? The prime minister claimed that due to the stubborn intransigence of the EU he had to conclude that the “Canada-style” trade deal that he was seeking was not going to be successfully negotiated without a “fundamental” change in Brussels’ negotiating position. He said it was therefore important that business prepare to trade with the EU on the basis of “arrangements that are more like Australia’s, based on simple principles of global free trade”. What is a Canada-style trade deal? The EU has a trade deal with Canada called the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta). It is the type of arrangement that Michel Barnier said four years ago would be possible at the start of the Brexit talks if the UK wished to leave the single market and customs union. There would be checks on imports and exports and a great deal more red tape for businesses as the UK would be outside the EU rule book. But such a deal does involve reducing tariffs, or taxes, on imports and quotas – the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges.
What the UK and EU have been attempting to negotiate is something more than that enjoyed by Canada, however. Both sides say they want a “zero tariff, zero quota” agreement by the end of the year. The Ceta deal gets close to doing that – 98% of products are tariff-free, but they do remain on poultry, meat and eggs, for example. Quotas also remain on some goods. “If they actually wanted a Canada-style deal they should have extended the transition period and then we could have gone through all the products and put tariffs and quotas in place in return for lower demands on maintaining EU standards,” said one exasperated EU official. Why does Boris Johnson say this is now off the table? Because Downing Street says the EU is offering less generous terms than are included in the Ceta deal. There are various examples including the length of stay for short-term business visitors and the lack of sector-specific provisions for key industries with particular technical barriers such as motor vehicles, medicinal products, organics and chemicals. The UK rightly says the demands on level playing field provisions also go beyond anything contained in the Ceta deal. These include non-regression from EU standards, with the raising of that baseline together over time, and a UK commitment to follow the bloc’s state aid, or domestic subsidy, rules. The EU has said the sheer level of trade between the UK and the EU means it needs to be vigilant in maintaining fair competition. It has also watered down its original demands on standards and state aid, but not enough, as far as Downing Street is concerned. What are Australia-style arrangements? Downing Street started using the term at the beginning of the year as a more palatable shorthand for a no-deal. The EU does not have a free-trade deal with Australia, although they are in negotiations. The two sides operate mainly on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, with huge tariffs on imports and exports. It would be more accurate to describe the outcome that would be secured by a no-deal as an Afghanistan-style arrangement, given the lack of formal cooperation in that trading relationship. This is because the EU does have a few agreements in place with Australia that it would not have with the UK in the event of a failure of the trade and security negotiations. These include an agreement on the transfer of EU passenger name records to Australian border authorities to help combat crime and terrorism and an agreement on the mutual recognition of conformity assessments, so that a product tested to EU standards in Australia is regarded as compliant, eliminating the need for duplicative testing when it is imported."
2020-10-16T15:46:05Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson tells UK: prepare for a no-deal Brexit,"Boris Johnson has claimed there will be no more trade and security talks unless the EU adopts a “fundamental change of approach”, as he seeks to increase pressure on Brussels to give ground in the negotiations. In a televised statement on Friday, the prime minister said the country would have to prepare for a no-deal scenario on 1 January, with his spokesman further toughening up the rhetoric later in the day. “The trade talks are over – the EU have effectively ended them yesterday when they said they did not want to change their negotiating position,” the spokesman said, while stopping short of announcing the UK’s intention to decisively walk away. Downing Street’s bravado was swiftly undermined in Brussels, where officials and leaders leaving an EU summit said they had no reason to believe the negotiations would not continue.
The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: “The EU continues to work for a deal, but not at any price. As planned, our negotiation team will go to London next week to intensify these negotiations.” The olive branch was quickly rebuffed by No 10, with the UK chief negotiator, Lord Frost, telling Michel Barnier on Friday afternoon in a phone call that there was no need to come to London next week. Frost told the EU chief negotiator there was “no basis for negotiations in London as of Monday” unless Brussels came up with a new plan over the weekend, said a Downing Street spokesman. However, a European commission spokesman said: “As agreed during this week’s negotiations, Michel Barnier held a videoconference today with his UK counterpart David Frost to discuss next week’s negotiations. Both chief negotiators agreed to talk again on Monday to discuss the structure of these talks.” Describing the move to halt negotiations as a “controlled explosion”, the Brexit analyst Mujtaba Rahman said there was still hope that a deal could be done by the next time the EU leaders meet in Berlin on 15 November. “Despite the noise – and it is loud – the fundamentals have not changed for both sides,” said Rahman. He added that there was movement from France on the issue of fisheries, which could open the door to talks restarting as long as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, did not have to “sign the death warrant” for Channel fishing fleets in the Boulogne region. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said: “We intend to focus on the negotiations and these negotiations will continue in the next few days.” Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, suggested Johnson’s call for intensive talks and compromise, both of which were on offer, was simply an invitation to continue with the negotiation, despite Johnson’s claim that this summit had been his deadline for a deal. He said: “I look with a positive sense to Boris Johnson’s reaction now that he is implicitly stating that he also now wants the talks to continue.” In his statement, Johnson said that with only 10 weeks left until the Brexit transition period ended, he had to make a judgment about the likely outcome and to prepare the country. “A lot of progress has been made on such issues as social security and aviation, nuclear cooperation, and so on,” he said, but “for whatever reason, it’s clear from the [EU] summit that after 45 years of [UK] membership they are not willing, unless there’s some fundamental change of approach, to offer this country the same terms as Canada”.
“I concluded that we should get ready for 1 January with arrangements that are more like Australia’s – based on simple principles of global free trade,” he told reporters in the pooled broadcast statement. Johnson’s spokesman later said there was “only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week” if he undertook talks on the basis set out by Johnson, discussing all areas of contention and working on legal text. But such a change in approach was already evident on Friday, following a two-hour discussion by EU leaders the previous day on the bloc’s flexibility, during which they were made to hand over their tablets and phones to avoid leaks. Macron accused Downing Street of using fisheries tactically and insisted it was not his job to make the British prime minister “happy”, but he conceded that the post-Brexit arrangements for British seas would not maintain the status quo for the EU fishing fleet. “If there is a deal, it must allow us to define the modalities of access for our fishermen to British waters,” he said. “Will the situation be the same as it is today? No, it will not, that’s for sure. Our fishermen know it. We know that too. We are going to help them. We need to have a compromise on access, but we know it will not be of the same nature. It won’t be as ambitious. It will come with conditions, perhaps we will have to pay for it.” Merkel said the EU should find a way to accommodate the UK’s wish to diverge from the EU rule book, while ensuring fair competition. “If we want to have an agreement, then both sides need to make a move toward each other,” she said. “We need to react quickly. We can’t mutually rule out that each of us has different rules to a certain extent.” Rutte later said of his fellow leaders’ comments: “The positive of the last two days is the EU has, by implication, signalled we’re ready to compromise, which has always been our position. “We will not get 100% of what we want, that’s impossible in a negotiation, you always have to find compromise, you always have to find ways within the mandate Michel Barnier has received from the European council … He is a skilled negotiator, he will be able to explore where within the mandate there is room for compromise and that room is there.” The UK financial services industry expressed its deep disappointment at the “political game of chicken”, with Catherine McGuinness, the policy chair at the City of London Corporation, saying businesses and households on both sides of the Channel “stand to be the main losers”."
2020-10-16T15:26:34Z,politics,Politics,What was the point of Johnson's Brexit statement? To save face,"It was as if nothing had happened. Michel Barnier would be jumping on a Eurostar to London early next week “to intensify these [Brexit] negotiations”, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted on Friday. The EU intended “to focus on the negotiation and these negotiations will continue in the next few days”, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters in Brussels. An hour earlier, Boris Johnson, reading from a sheet of paper, had announced that following the publication of an uncompromising EU summit communique on Thursday, he had concluded that the UK should prepare for a no-deal outcome on 1 January. “The trade talks are over – the EU has effectively ended them, and we aren’t going to take part in a nonsense process,” a UK source said, filling in the gaps in the prime minister’s statement. “Only if the EU fundamentally changes position will it be worth talking.” But Brussels simply did not believe him. “What a load of nonsense”, said one EU official. “What was the point of that?” The reason for the EU’s disbelief is that Johnson had given himself plenty of wriggle room. “It was an invitation to continue to talk – it was very balanced, actually,” said a second senior EU official. In his statement, Johnson demanded that the EU’s chief negotiator come to London if he wanted to talk – 24 hours after Barnier had said in a press conference that he was coming to London for talks. Downing Street was demanding a new intensity in the talks; Barnier had already offered to speed up the process in his post-summit comments. As for Johnson’s insistence on a “fundamental” change in the EU’s negotiating position, that has naturally been the call from both sides from the start. During a two-hour discussion among the leaders on Thursday afternoon, flexibility had indeed been found. As they opened their talks, Charles Michel, the European council president, asked that the leaders’ tablets and mobile phones be secured in lockers to avoid any leaks, in a sign of the significance of that discussion. “Both sides have to take a step in the direction of the other party,” Merkel said on Friday after Johnson’s statement. “Leeway is there. There is room for compromise.” What, then, was the point of the prime minister’s statement? Johnson had said on 7 September that this summit was his deadline for an agreement and that without one, both sides at that stage would need to “move on”. He needed to sail past that deadline without undue embarrassment. It was also in his interest to renew his demand for a Canada-style deal in the confident knowledge that should a deal be finally secured, it will look similar. It will also be of little surprise to him that the EU negotiators were examining their levels of flexibility on the most contentious issues: fishing, governance of the deal, and the so-called level playing field provisions, including control of domestic subsidies. Johnson’s desire for some movement would be sated, although it may not be enough, A tub-thumping prime minister always plays well back home. Barnier has suggested there will be three more weeks of talks. UK sources suggest they see 12 November as being the actual deadline for a deal in order for leaders to sign it off when they meet a few days later. That will be a moment of significance. Johnson’s latest statement should join the pile of other meaningless prime-ministerial statements that have littered the Brexit process."
2020-10-16T13:13:01Z,politics,Politics,"UK economy not ready for no-deal Brexit, say business leaders","Business leaders have warned Boris Johnson that Britain’s economy is ill-prepared for a no-deal Brexit while companies face severe disruption from the coronavirus pandemic. Business groups called for an urgent resolution in the Brexit talks after the prime minister told UK businesses to get ready for trading with the EU on terms “that are more like Australia’s” – code for leaving without a deal and relying on World Trade Organization terms. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, said: “After four years of negotiations and so many hurdles crossed, this is no time to give up. Neither side can afford to fall at the final fence. A deal is the only outcome that protects Covid-hit livelihoods at a time when every job in every country counts.”
Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said firms were not ready to cope with a no-deal Brexit with only 10 weeks before the end of the transition period at the end of December. “They’re being told to both prepare and simultaneously manage a fresh set of Covid restrictions. Many simply don’t have the time or money to make adjustments, even if they want and need to,” he said. The pound fell on the international currency markets after Johnson’s televised intervention, sliding from a high of $1.2956 against the US dollar on Friday morning to a low of about $1.2869, before gradually recovering its losses. The currency also sold off against the euro, falling from €1.1050 to a low of about €1.0991 before staging a recovery. The fightback for the currency came after Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said talks would continue next week in London – fuelling bets among global investors that a compromise could still be reached. Analysts said the UK prime minister’s statement was a choreographed set piece designed to force the EU to back down, but warned the chances of no deal were rising. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the financial trading platform Markets.com, said: “It’s not entirely bluff – the UK would through gritted teeth accept no deal because politically Johnson is taking so much flak over the pandemic that he has no room to ‘let the country down’ over Brexit.” Although time is tight, he said an agreement could still be made at the 11th hour, suggesting that an informal meeting of heads of state in Berlin on 16 November could be the crunch point. Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said a no-deal Brexit would cause severe disruption for business, damage food security and push up prices in the shops for consumers. “The prime minister’s statement signals that we are heading into very dangerous territory. The perils of a no-deal exit for GB food and drink manufacturing remain as real as ever. We need leaders on both sides to find a way past the current impasse in order to progress talks,” he said. Earlier this week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that a disorderly Brexit would threaten Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The group, which represents more than 30 of the world’s most advanced economies, said failure to secure a free trade agreement before the UK leaves the Brexit transition period at the end of December would leave the economy 6.5% lower in the next few years than would have been the case if existing arrangements with the EU had been maintained. Warning that businesses were ill-equipped to cope with disruption after more than six months responding to the Covid emergency, the OECD said a disorderly departure would have the most significant impacts for manufacturing, with the UK car industry, food and textiles producers hardest hit, suffering a fall in exports of more than 30%. Susannah Streeter, the senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With the economy still reeling from the effects of the coronavirus crisis, the prospect of a potentially chaotic exit from the EU will be hard to stomach for struggling companies.’’"
2020-10-16T08:23:30Z,politics,Politics,Merkel urges Johnson not to abandon Brexit negotiations,"Angela Merkel has called on Boris Johnson to keep negotiating over Brexit, saying the EU will need to compromise, ahead of a statement by the prime minister on whether he will walk out of the trade and security talks. In comments designed to cool the temperature of the troubled talks, the German chancellor said both sides needed to find common ground. Johnson had threatened in September to abandon negotiations if an agreement was not in place by this weekend. “In some places things have moved well, in other places there is still a lot of work to be done,” Merkel said. “We have asked the United Kingdom to remain open to compromise, so that an agreement can be reached. This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises.” Downing Street had reacted in dismay as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, led EU leaders at a summit on Thursday in demanding the UK swallow the bloc’s conditions or face a no-deal exit. The EU had proposed a further “two to three weeks” of negotiations but the summit communique said it was up to the UK to “make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”. Issued on Thursday afternoon, the leaders’ statement had asked the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to “continue negotiations in the coming weeks”. Barnier said he would be in London on Monday. However, to the frustration of Downing Street, a call for an “intensification” of talks, included in an earlier draft of the statement, was deleted by the time leaders signed it off. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeted in response: “Disappointed by the [summit] conclusions on UK/EU negotiations. Surprised EU is no longer committed to working ‘intensively’ to reach a future partnership as agreed with [the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen] on 3 October. “Also surprised by suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from UK. It’s an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Friday morning he had also been “disappointed by the lack of flexibility that seems to have come out of the European council”. But he emphasised that a deal was still possible. “We’ve been told that it must be the UK that makes all of the compromises in the days ahead, that can’t be right in a negotiation, so we’re surprised by that, but the prime minister will be saying more on this later today,” he said. “Having said that, we are close [to a deal]. With goodwill on both sides we can get there.” EU officials said they believed Downing Street was seeking to create a moment of political crisis. According to EU sources, the summit statement had been seen by No 10 and there should not have been any surprises. The change to the original draft had been made ahead of leaders seeing the communique and it was merely done as a call for intensified talks had been made in the last summit conclusions, the source said. Raab noted in his comments on Friday morning that there had been more “emollient” language from other quarters in Brussels, in a reference to a statement from Barnier in which he promised to “speed up” negotiation. “We’re available, we shall remain available until the last possible day,” Barnier said. “The negotiations aren’t over – we want to give these negotiations every chance to be successful. I shall say to David Frost we’re prepared to speed up negotiations in the next few days.” Following the issuing of the summit communique, the leaders had held a two-hour discussion on the most contentious issues that stand in the way of agreement: how to hold both sides to the deal, EU access to British fishing waters and the so-called level playing field demands, sought by Brussels to ensure neither side can undercut standards or over-subsidise parts of the economy to give its companies a competitive advantage. The heads of state and government were asked to put their phones and tablets into lockers to avoid any leaks during the discussion. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Barnier had provided a presentation on the most thorny issues remaining. “Fisheries loomed large in the presentation and in the subsequent debate, and of course a dispute mechanism to have a proper process in terms of how to resolve any subsequent disputes if an agreement was to be arrived at,” he said. “I think [Barnier] senses that he will continue negotiating until the very end to get a deal, but there are difficulties. I think that it would be fair to say that there are challenges, and particularly on those last three items that I referenced – in terms of level playing field, in terms of fisheries, in terms of governance, that there hasn’t really been sufficient movement on those fronts to at this stage suggest that there could be an agreement, so there’s significant work to be done yet.”"
2020-10-16T06:56:18Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: No 10 startled by EU insistence that UK accept trade terms,"Downing Street reacted in dismay as Emmanuel Macron led EU leaders in warning Boris Johnson that he must swallow the bloc’s conditions, in what appeared to be taken as a direct challenge to the British prime minister’s threat to walk out on the talks. At a summit in Brussels, the EU proposed a further “two to three weeks” of negotiations but Europe’s heads of state and government offered Johnson little succour, demanding that he alone needed to “make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”.
The intervention was evidently regarded as incendiary in No 10 as Johnson had said he would make a decision on Friday on whether there were grounds to continue the talks. In September, he had said that without agreement by the time of this summit the government would “move on” to focus on no-deal preparations. The summit communique issued on Thursday afternoon noted the lack of progress but asked the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to “continue negotiations in the coming weeks”. To the frustration of Downing Street, a call for an “intensification” of talks, included in an earlier draft of the statement, was deleted by the time leaders signed it off. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeted in response: “Disappointed by the [summit] conclusions on UK/EU negotiations. Surprised EU is no longer committed to working ‘intensively’ to reach a future partnership as agreed with [the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen] on 3 October. “Also surprised by suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from UK. It’s an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation.” Downing Street had been seeking a commitment to round-the-clock talks along with work on a joint legal text. Barnier said in a post-meeting press conference that there was a prospect of a deal and he would “speed up” and continue with “intensified” talks, in what appeared to be an attempt to give Johnson a reason to continue the negotiations. “We’re available, we shall remain available until the last possible day,” Barnier said. “The negotiations aren’t over – we want to give these negotiations every chance to be successful. I shall say to David Frost we’re prepared to speed up negotiations in the next few days.” Barnier said he would come to London on Monday to start the new round of talks. Frost tweeted: “Boris Johnson will set out UK reactions and approach tomorrow in the light of his statement of 7 September.” Johnson spoke by phone with Von der Leyen on Wednesday evening, but she was forced to leave the summit early on Thursday after a person with whom she had been in contact tested positive for coronavirus. The outstanding issues in the trade and security talks remain how to hold both sides to the deal, EU access to British fishing waters and the so-called level playing field demands, sought by Brussels to ensure neither side can undercut standards or over-subsidise parts of the economy to give its companies a competitive advantage. Speaking at the summit, Macron, who faces an election in 2022, had said defending the interests of France’s fishing boats and coastal communities was a priority although he fell short of demanding the EU’s original position of maintaining the status quo.
“Under no condition can our fishermen be sacrificed during Brexit,” Macron said. “We didn’t choose Brexit. It’s the British people’s choice. So protecting the access of our fishermen to British waters, finding a good compromise for our fishermen – and I’m talking about all European countries concerned including France – is an important point in this discussion, for us.” France is insistent that there is no margin for negotiation over catches in the Channel, where French vessels enjoy 84% of the cod quota. It is understood that Paris is willing to be more flexible about the catches in the Celtic and Scottish seas. Losses to EU hauls there could be compensated for by eating into UK quotas in EU waters. On level playing field provisions, the UK has agreed on non-regression from current environmental, labour and social standards but Brussels wants a “ratchet” mechanism so that this baseline develops over time. On controlling domestic subsidies, a number of principles on how each side’s system will work are being written into the deal but there is a dispute about how prescriptive these need to be, with Brussels seeking lengthy sector-by-sector provisions. “I want to be clear: this deal will not be made at any price,” Macron said. “If these conditions are not met, it’s possible there won’t be a deal. We are ready for that. France is ready for that. We are in the process of finalising … We are ready for a no-deal.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he remained “cautiously optimistic” that agreement would be found. But he added: “For a breakthrough, movement from UK side is really necessary.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said an agreement would not be secured at any cost. “It has to be a fair agreement from which both sides can profit,” she said. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Europe could not afford a double economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic and a no-deal exit of the UK at the end of the transition period in December. “I am urging the British side to engage meaningfully with the EU’s team to accelerate progress in the period ahead.”"
2020-10-16T05:00:01Z,politics,Politics,Government spending on Covid consultancy contracts rises to £175m,"The bill for private consultants hired by the government to help combat the coronavirus pandemic has climbed to £175m, as the chair of an influential parliamentary committee revealed that MPs would investigate the multimillion pound use of management consultancies. The government has bought consulting services from almost 90 different companies as it scrambled to fill gaps in the civil service’s pandemic response. Disclosed spending on consultants has risen by £65m since the end of August, a 35% increase, according to contracts collated by the data company Tussell. The newly disclosed spending included work on setting up and running the malfunctioning test-and-trace system, procuring medicines, buying personal protective equipment and supporting the government’s contact-tracing app.
The rapid increase in the consultancy bill in recent weeks to a new total of £175m was partly driven by belated publication of contracts. Tussell’s analysis showed that government bodies took 80 days on average to publish the contracts. The statutory maximum is 30 days. The latest figures emerged in the same week it was revealed that executives at Boston Consulting Group, the fourth biggest recipient of coronavirus consulting contracts, were being paid as much as £6,250 a day to work on the struggling NHS test-and-trace system. The government’s reliance on expensive management consultants has come under scrutiny during the pandemic. Lord Agnew, the Cabinet Office and Treasury minister, last month said the civil service had been infantilised by an unacceptable reliance on consultants. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said on Thursday she was shocked by the increase in consultancy costs, adding that her committee had launched an inquiry into the government’s use of consultants. “What on earth are they doing? It is a very steep increase in a very short space of time. You cannot just tear up the rules and dish out taxpayers’ money in this way,” Hillier said. Referring to the delay in publishing contracts, she said: “Not publishing them on time is not acceptable and there is no excuse. At a time when we have given the government huge powers to bypass the usual tendering process the government should be more transparent not less. “It appears as if there is a general disdain for parliament and the public. The public are not fools.” Many of the largest contracts – including those published in the last 45 days – date from March or April, when the government brought in the emergency procurement rules. The largest consulting firms have been among the biggest beneficiaries. The value of contracts awarded to Deloitte has risen to £22.7m while its rival PricewaterhouseCoopers’s has increased to £24.4m, according the latest data. Senior partners in consulting firms often charge thousands of pounds for a day’s work. The Cabinet Office, which has coordinated much of the government’s pandemic response, was the biggest single buyer of consulting services, with £53.8m of contracts awarded. The Department of Health and Social Care has spent £44.2m on consultants.
Tamzen Isacsson, the chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association, a lobby group, said consultants can provide the government with skills and value for money. “Government departments have faced an unprecedented volume of workload with Brexit planning and Covid-19 and using external resources has enabled the government to work quickly and with intensity on major initiatives,” she said. A government spokesman said: “We are building a huge diagnostic network and to achieve this we need to work with both public- and private-sector partners who have the specialist skills and experience we need, to work at pace. “Every pound spent is contributing towards our efforts to keep people safe as we ramp up testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.”"
2020-10-15T18:44:52Z,politics,Politics,Two Labour frontbenchers quit over failure to oppose MI5 bill,"Two Labour frontbenchers have resigned in protest at the party’s failure to oppose legislation allowing MI5 and police informants to commit crimes, as 34 MPs rebelled over the issue. They included five Labour MPs serving as personal private secretaries. Margaret Greenwood, the shadow schools spokesperson, quit immediately after the early evening vote, joining the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Dan Carden, who had resigned earlier in the day. The two were among a handful of leftwingers remaining on Keir Starmer’s frontbench. “I cannot stand by and allow a bill to go through that will profoundly impact on our civil liberties and the environment in which individuals can get together to have their voices heard,” Greenwood wrote in her resignation letter. But the rebellion could have been larger had a second group of leftwing frontbenchers also decided to defy the whip. Instead, after intense lobbying from senior party figures such as the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, they made a “collective decision to stay on the frontbench and use their roles to ensure the left has a stronger voice in future party policy”, according to a source close the group. They included MPs Andy McDonald, Imran Hussain, Rachael Maskell, Cat Smith, Marsha de Cordova, Alex Sobel, Sam Tarry and Charlotte Nichols. They said they were given “clear assurances” by Starmer that the party would campaign on union issues. However, Labour insiders said no specific concessions had been made. Other MPs who did quit were five parliamentary private secretaries – shadow junior ministers – including Navendu Misra and Kim Johnson, both of whom were aides to Rayner, and Rachel Hopkins, Sarah Owen and Mary Foy.
Starmer had wanted Labour MPs to abstain on the bill once their amendments were defeated, arguing that statutory regulation of informants’ conduct would have been necessary if the party had been in power. The bill was introduced by the Conservative government after a series of legal challenges had made it necessary to put the existing policy of allowing informants to be a party to criminal activities on a statutory footing. But critics of the covert human intelligence sources bill argued it did not explicitly rule out crimes such as murder, torture or serious sexual offences – and that it could authorise spying by undercover agents or police, including on groups such as trade unions. In a statement released to Tribune magazine, Carden said he had supported the party’s decision to abstain on the bill at its second reading, but felt he must vote against it when it returned to the House of Commons. “As a Liverpool MP and trade unionist, I share the deep concerns about this legislation from across the Labour movement, human rights organisations, and so many who have suffered the abuse of state power, from blacklisted workers to the Hillsborough families and survivors,” Carden said. A Labour spokesperson said: “We are disappointed colleagues have stepped down. They were valued members of Keir’s frontbench and will continue to play an important role in ensuring a Labour government after the next election.” Priti Patel, the home secretary, sought to highlight the Labour divisions: “Once again, Labour has refused to stand up for those who protect our country and keep us all safe. Their leader may have changed, but Labour still can’t be trusted on national security.”"
2020-10-15T17:21:22Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Andy Burnham  says England's north must not be 'sacrificial lamb' for flawed lockdowns – as it happened,"The north-west of England will not accept being treated â€œas canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategyâ€� that even the governmentâ€™s own medical advisers donâ€™t think will work, the mayor of Greater Manchester has said. London is to be formally moved up to the second tier of coronavirus restrictions later this week, a decision backed by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, but which prompted protests from a number of Conservative MPs in the capital. Italy is being removed from the UKâ€™s travel corridor in a fresh blow to holidaymakers who will have to quarantine for a fortnight on their return from the country. The Welsh governmentâ€™s plan to ban people entering Wales from coronavirus hotspots in other parts of the UK risks stirring â€œdivision and confusionâ€�, Simon Hart, the Welsh secretary, has claimed. The Metropolitan police has said it will not charge the MP Margaret Ferrier with breaching Covid travel restrictions, because her positive test took place three days before the legal requirement to self-isolate came into force. Franceâ€™s president, Emmanuel Macron, has led EU leaders in sending Boris Johnson an uncompromising message at a summit in Brussels â€“ that the UK must swallow the blocâ€™s conditions or expect to face a no-deal outcome in the ongoing trade negotiations. As Daniel Boffey reports, far from seeking to sugar-coat the EU position as the prime minister considers whether he should walk out on the Brexit talks, Europeâ€™s heads of state and government called on Downing Street to â€œmake the necessary moves to make an agreement possibleâ€�. In a summit communique issued on Thursday afternoon, the leaders noted â€œwith concern that progress on the key issues of interest to the union is still not sufficient for an agreement to be reachedâ€�. David Frost, the UKâ€™s negotiator, has responded on Twitter.
Sir Keir Starmer has faced a series of resignations as he suffered a major rebellion over the so-called â€œspy copsâ€� law. As PA Media reports, the Labour leader ordered his MPs to abstain on the third reading of the covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) bill. But 34 decided to oppose the legislation, including former leader Jeremy Corbyn, ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Margaret Greenwood tendered her resignation as shadow schools minister and Dan Carden quit his post as a shadow Treasury minister so they could vote against the bill. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-10-15T16:55:25Z,politics,Politics,Travellers from Italy must quarantine on arrival in UK,"Italy is being removed from the UK’s travel corridor in a fresh blow to holidaymakers who will have to quarantine for a fortnight on their return from the country. In a move revealed earlier by the Guardian, Italy – which this week recorded its highest ever daily tally of Covid-19 cases – is being dropped from the dwindling list of locations that UK travellers can visit without facing quarantine when they come home. Italy last week imposed new requirements meaning visitors from the UK and some other nations must provide evidence of a negative Covid test taken 72 hours before travel – although some Italian airports have been providing tests on arrival.
Italy was one of the last major European holiday hotspots that UK travellers could visit without quarantining on their return, after France and Spain were dropped from the travel corridor in recent months, prompting chaos for tourists. Last year UK residents made more than 5m visits to Italy, according to Office for National Statistics estimates. Vatican City and San Marino are also being removed from the UK’s travel corridor, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, confirmed on Thursday. The UK’s devolved administrations, who have their own powers to impose travel quarantine restrictions, are making the same changes to remove Italy, Vatican City and San Marino, meaning they are UK-wide. Separately, the Greek island of Crete is being added to England’s travel corridor following a fall in cases, meaning arrivals will no longer have to isolate, in a move that Shapps said aligns all of the UK’s approach to Greek islands. The changes for Crete, Italy, Vatican City and San Marino will come into effect from 4am on Sunday – an extra 24 hours’ warning than has been given for corridor changes in recent weeks.
Wales is also adding Crete to its travel corridor. Scotland, which imposed quarantine restrictions on travellers arriving from Greece last month, is re-adding the country to its travel corridor – with the exception of the island of Mykonos. Scotland’s community safety minister, Ash Denham, said: “Lifting quarantine restrictions on those travelling from most of Greece, in line with the public health data we have received, is not a signal that it is safe to book foreign travel. All travel carries a risk and people should think long and hard before choosing to go abroad.” Shapps has been under pressure from the aviation sector over the government’s failure to introduce a testing regime to cut quarantine times for visitors. Last week he launched a “global travel taskforce” to explore the issue, which is due to report next month. Italy has the second highest Covid death toll on the continent, with 36,289 fatalities since the pandemic began as of Wednesday, but its daily cases are currently below the UK’s. Following the announcement, a spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents said: “The removal of Italy from the travel corridors list is a major blow for many winter operators in the UK travel industry, and again demonstrates that travel businesses are effectively being forced to close by the government’s measures to control coronavirus yet, unlike other sectors such as hospitality, travel has received no sector-specific support.”"
2020-10-15T15:54:40Z,politics,Politics,Teetering Matt Hancock ignores head and heart and sticks to PM's script | John Crace,"If Matt Hancock believes in karma, he must be wondering what the hell he did in his previous existence. His fall from grace has been spectacular. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Matt looked as if he was one of the few ministers to have grasped the severity of the situation and to be prepared to take the necessary action to contain it. A rare outbreak of responsibility in cabinet. But over the last three or four months, Matt has become Door Matt. For a while the health secretary’s one sanctuary was that at least he could claim to be following the science. Even when he missed nearly every testing target and his decision to outsource the track-and-trace system proved disastrous, he could kid himself that he had failed in a more or less scientific way. But even that escape clause for his conscience was snatched away once the prime minister chose to ignore Sage’s recommendation to introduce a circuit breaker in September and then chose not to disclose the evidence until this week. Now Door Matt finds himself ground down by Boris Johnson’s desperation to please the crowd and he just reads from whatever script is put in front of him. He doesn’t even bother to check the details as he can be fairly certain they are incorrect. His latest Commons appearance being a case in point. This wasn’t the statement he had been expecting to give. He had imagined he would be putting Greater Manchester and parts of the north-west into tier 3. Tier Very, Very High. He had even managed to brief the media that this was going to happen. Only it turned out that Tory and Labour MPs and local leaders from those areas were kicking off about the lack of warning and the cack-handed way the hopelessly ineffectual junior health minister Helen Whately had tried to dump it on them, and weren’t in the mood to play ball. In a week of shitshows this was perhaps the pièce de résistance. So after the usual spiel about coronavirus being a terrible disease, Door Matt hastily skirted over what he described as “ongoing discussions” with the north-west and moved on to the decision to upgrade London, Essex, Barrow, York and several other regions to tier 2. Tier Very High. Though the thought did occur that he could have saved everyone a lot of time if he had announced this on Monday when the government first announced its hopelessly confused tiering system. After all, it wasn’t as if the infection rates had changed significantly in the intervening three days. “Things will get worse before they get better,” Hancock concluded. He wasn’t kidding. We now have a government masquerading as a piece of self-destructive performance art. Recent exchanges with Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, have verged on the spiky, with each accusing the other of acting in bad faith. But, perhaps sensing that Door Matt was teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown, Ashworth went relatively easy on him. He didn’t go hard on the ongoing row between the north-west and Westminster other than to point out that the Tories needed to offer more in the way of financial support to businesses and workers that could find themselves destitute. Rather, Ashworth pointed out that a lot of this could have been avoided if the government hadn’t put track and trace in the hands of consultants on £6,000 a day and if it had accepted Chris Whitty’s advice that the tiering system was not going to make a massive difference to bringing down the rate of infection. So wasn’t it just best if it accepted what the scientists, the public and the Labour party were calling for: a two- to three-week national “circuit breaker”? At this point Hancock looked almost teary. Because he knows it’s the right thing to do. It’s what his head and heart are telling him to do. But he can’t do it because he doesn’t have the cojones to say no to Boris. Better that 8,000 people lose their lives unnecessarily than he has to give up his ministerial car. The health select committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, injected a rare moment of humour by asking if Door Matt could give a date by which everyone in the country could have a weekly test. Hancock can’t even give a date when the track-and-trace figures will improve rather than get worse. Poor Matt is so far gone he can’t even tell when he is being trolled. On Wednesday night he tweeted that Emmanuel Macron had congratulated him on the success of the testing system, not realising its success lay in making most of the rest of Europe look quite good. Thereafter the main interest in the debate was MPs from the north-west laying into Hancock for the disastrous way in which they were being railroaded into the highest tier. Labour’s Lucy Powell observed that she had no objection in principle to Tier Very, Very High, only there was no evidence to show it made any difference. Tory William Wragg came at it from a slightly different perspective: it was an Englishman’s right to do whatever he liked, including spreading the coronavirus. Or something like that. It all ended unsatisfactorily, as these statements increasingly do, and Door Matt looked relieved to make his escape. Everyone knows Hancock will be back once or twice a week for the foreseeable future to announce further lockdowns until he accepts the inevitability of Tier Keir. Even those regions that have just been upgraded to tier 2 know there’s a fair chance of them being upgraded further. After all, almost every region that has effectively been in tier 2 for the last few months has seen infection rates rise. We’re seven months on and it feels as if we are almost back where we started. Only this time the nights are closing in and people have less hope that the government knows what it’s doing. The country has done everything that has been asked of it and been repaid with one of the highest death rates in the world and a £12bn test-and-trace system that the government’s own scientists regard as marginally effective at best. Worse still, the prime minister has abandoned the science. He is saving neither lives nor jobs. His moral authority is shot."
2020-10-15T08:13:20Z,politics,Politics,New Brexit law will let vulnerable EU citizens apply late to stay in UK,"The government is to fast-track legislation that it believes will stop vulnerable EU citizens becoming Windrush-type victims of Brexit, it has emerged. Under the secondary legislation, vulnerable citizens already lawfully living in the country, such as children in care and homeless people, may be able to apply for settled status years after the 30 June 2021 deadline. All they will need to do is prove they had a “reasonable excuse” for not doing so, said Kevin Foster, a Home Office minister. He also said there would be no time limit for their future applications. The move is seen as a victory for Alberto Costa, the Italian-heritage Conservative backbencher who for the past two years has been working behind the scenes to persuade the government to safeguard the rights of vulnerable EU and EEA citizens. Foster unveiled the statutory instrument at the little-watched eighth delegated legislation committee on Wednesday. This will now go through the House of Commons without a vote. His accompanying formal statement can now be used as guidance in potential future court disputes over EU citizens’ right to be in the country, said Costa. Foster told the committee that the government would “take a generous approach as to what reasonable grounds are”, adding that the Home Office would publish guidance, which would be “illustrative guidance, not exhaustive guidance”, to allow each individual’s case to be assessed on its merits. He gave the example of a child in foster care who may not discover their application had not been made until they were an adult, as someone who could apply in 10 years’ time for settled status. “There isn’t a set time period in which reasonable grounds [apply]. So, for example, in the case of a looked-after child, the Home Office accepts it could actually be some period of time before they ran into this [issue]. “For the sake of argument, an eight-year-old child now who would become an adult in 10 years’ time, and may discover, for example when they went to their first job, that the local council 10 years before had not made that application, that would be seen as a reasonable ground,” he said. Costa, who resigned his post as a parliamentary aide last year over a row on citizens’ rights, said it would “help stop a repeat of the Windrush scandal” but he would continue to scrutinise the government’s moves. “It is to be welcomed that even though the government opted for a system where EU nationals had to apply for rights, the minister has assured parliament that EU nationals who fail to apply by the grace period deadline of 30 June will remain legally here if they have a reasonable excuse, and that excuse will be given the widest possible interpretation by the Home Office,” said Costa. The plans do not address concerns among campaigners about the safeguarding of rights of EU citizens who do not receive settled status in time. Luke Piper, a lawyer who works with the3million campaign group, said there were profound concerns about what would happen to those who did not receive their settled or pre-settled status by 1 January because of Home Office delays. What would happen if they were turned down for a job or told they could not rent a flat or return to the country, he asked. He also expressed concern for first-year EU students, who can establish their free-movement rights if they set foot on UK soil before 31 December but may lose out if they have remained in their birth country because classes are online during the pandemic. He said he was concerned that the government was trying to limit the grounds for remaining in the UK to “reasonable” when EU citizens were exercising their legal right to be in UK regardless of the government’s settled-status scheme. “By limiting legal rights in this way, we worry about the implications on people’s ability to legally live in the UK and access healthcare and other vital services in the UK,” he said. While the example of an eight-year-old was helpful, he said, it was “still unclear whether a person who simply didn’t realise they had to apply to the EUSS can be considered to have a ‘reasonable excuse’ to applying late”. He added: “We would welcome insight into this and other likely scenarios”."
2020-10-15T07:13:53Z,politics,Politics,UK doctors and health experts back Covid-19 'circuit breaker',"Hospital doctors and public health experts have backed growing calls for a “circuit breaker” to stem the resurgence of Covid-19 and protect the NHS, as fresh signs of a cabinet split emerged. As up to 95% of intensive care beds were reported to be full in some hospitals in Liverpool – half with coronavirus patients – growing concerns were raised about the NHS becoming overwhelmed. This week Liverpool said it would scale back non-urgent operations. Labour backed the idea of a circuit breaker – a short lockdown severing some social contact – on Tuesday but cabinet ministers are understood to be split over its effectiveness and the desire to protect the economy.
On Wednesday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, made clear that a national lockdown of any length would have significant and potentially irreversible economic costs. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, who chairs the Covid-19 operations committee, are the most spooked by the surge in case numbers and most open to a circuit breaker. Daily new lab-confirmed infections in the UK reached a new record of 19,724 on Wednesday. There are fears that a shutdown might be extended beyond two weeks to help its effectiveness, and that high-level curbs would have to continue afterwards across many parts of the UK. “It doesn’t change the fundamental path of the virus, it’s just a delay,” said a Whitehall source. “What you really need is to design a version of normal that can get you through the winter.” Even those most sceptical about a circuit breaker concede that more drastic action might not be ruled out. “It is a last resort,” one cabinet minister said. A cabinet source added: “No one is enthusiastic about this. Everyone is worried about lockdown but also worried about the virus being out of control. The camps in the cabinet are not straightforward.” The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, which represents 3,500 senior hospital doctors, told the Guardian on Wednesday that a series of two- to three-week mini-lockdowns might be needed across the UK to get the population through winter without the NHS becoming overwhelmed, and to buy time for a coronavirus vaccine. “We are in favour of a circuit breaker,” said Claudia Paoloni, the association’s president and a consultant anaesthetist in Bristol. “Unfortunately we find ourselves in an inimitable situation in that it’s one thing that we can do to buy ourselves some time and suppress this down to a more manageable level again. “Covid is increasing in every area. Therefore we need to put some brakes on everywhere to try and reduce the extent of the Covid growth to a manageable level. That would buy us time to improve our testing capacity and enable us to keep hospital beds free to do elective work.” Failure to introduce a circuit breaker as a matter of urgency risked the government having to order a prolonged return to the sort of full lockdown put in place in the spring, Paoloni added. “The circuit breaker should start as soon as possible. To get us through the winter … you might need a series of circuit breakers to keep the transmission suppressed.” The British Medical Association said it supported a temporary short-term lockdown but only as part of a new “robust prevention plan” involving stronger restrictions than the three-tier system that Boris Johnson announced this week, and clearer public health messaging to encourage compliance. Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council, said: “National lockdown was previously lifted with absolutely no strategy for how to contain the disease afterwards, so it’s no surprise that the government and the country finds itself in this terrible position once again.” Sue Crossland, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, speaking in a personal capacity, said some hospitals were at a tipping point. “ A circuit breaker may act as a pressure valve to release some much-needed breathing space.” The Royal Society for Public Health said a circuit breaker would save many lives. “The virus is out of control in much of England and the majority of scientific opinion is that action needs to be taken swiftly – and indeed is likely overdue – if we are to avoid thousands of unnecessary deaths, said Christina Marriott, its chief executive. Katrina Stephens, the director of public health in Oldham borough, where there is a surge in infections, said a circuit breaker over the October half-term was needed. “I think infection rates have got to a level where the circuit breaker approach could potentially be a good move,” she said. However, health officials conceded that time was running out for minimising the disruption in schools should a circuit breaker be used. Cabinet ministers underlined Johnson’s commitment not to close schools and the incompatibility with a circuit breaker lasting longer than the week of half-term. Keir Starmer, Labour’s leader, said he would prefer schools to stay open. Speaking in the Commons, Sunak said any form of national lockdown would cause “significant damage” to lives and livelihoods. He said evidence still supported a regional, tiered approach. “The entire country would suffer, rather than targeting that support preventing a lockdown in parts of the country where the virus rates are low.” • This article was amended on 15 October 2020 to describe Claudia Paoloni as a consultant anaesthetist rather than an intensive care consultant."
2020-10-15T05:00:15Z,politics,Politics,Is it decision day on Brexit talks – and what is still to be resolved?,"Is the EU summit on Thursday the make-or-break moment for the Brexit negotiations? Boris Johnson said on 7 September that if there was a lack of agreement by the time EU leaders meet in Brussels on 15 October then he could not see any hope of a deal at all, and both sides should at that stage “accept that and move on”. That day has come. There is no agreement. Johnson clearly has a decision to make, but his chief negotiator, David Frost, will not be advising him to walk away. Sources close to the negotiation say Frost believes a deal is still possible in the next few weeks. A decision from the prime minister is expected on Friday once the EU leaders have given their assessment of the negotiations. The UK negotiating team complain that the “intensive” talks of the last few weeks have not really been that intensive. They are looking for the leaders to back daily negotiations with both sides committing ink to paper on a joint legal text. They also want to avoid a Salzburg moment for Johnson. Theresa May was humiliated by her fellow leaders during a summit in the Austrian city when they lined up to trash her proposals. Downing Street is sensitive to the atmospherics. What is likely to happen? It is unlikely that Johnson would ignore Frost, who is a trusted confidante. More talks can be expected. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, even suggested this week that the next EU summit, on 15 November, could be the next target date for an agreement. There is certainly some scepticism in Brussels that another couple of weeks, to the end of October, will provide enough time for the gaps between the two sides to be bridged. Frost will tell Johnson that there is a good deal to be signed off on a range of issues, covering law enforcement cooperation, aviation, road haulage, social security coordination and access for the UK to EU programmes such as its research and innovation scheme Horizon Europe. The UK negotiator believes the agreement will be thinner than it could need to be, with less mutually advantageous cooperation. The EU has rejected British demands for mutual recognition agreements, for example, which would allow products approved in the UK to be sold in EU member states without the need for Brussels’ regulators to give their approval. But for all the talk of the UK prospering with a trading relationship with the EU on “Australian terms” – in other words, a no-deal outcome – Frost evidently believes there will be enough in the agreement for it to be worthwhile. What are the gaps? There are three obstacles, and the first of these is how to decide future EU access to British fishing waters. The EU has been insisting on the status quo, with catch quotas staying in line with the common fisheries policy. There are signs, however, of some movement. While France is insisting there is no margin for negotiation on the arrangements in the Channel, where French fishermen catch 84% of the cod quota, there appears to be more flexibility in the Celtic and Scottish seas. But the EU would cut into the British quotas in European waters to make up for any losses. The second issue, more important to many member states than fisheries, is the so-called level playing field provisions, which the EU wants to ensure neither side can undercut standards or overly subsidise parts of the economy to give its companies a competitive advantage in the market. Here, again, there is movement. The UK has agreed with non-regression from environmental, social and labour standards as they stand at the end of the transition period. The EU wants more. It wants that baseline to be raised over time as Brussels develops its standards. It is a hard sell to the British, who will not want to be tied to EU law. The two sides are looking at other mutually satisfactory solutions. One senior diplomat likened the process to trying to get a child to eat their greens. “What do you do? Do you force it through? The other option is try and find a way around the issue and mix it with bananas. But in the end, it is the same. He or she will eat their veggies.” The other level playing issue is state aid, or domestic subsidy control. The two sides are writing up principles for inclusion in the deal that would shape either sides’ state aid rulebook. The UK is concerned that Brussels wants quite lengthy rules, with a lot of sectoral provisions. But talks are ongoing. Downing Street appears willing to establish an independent regulator for state aid, which has been a key EU demand. And finally … There is the issue of governance: how either side will be able to keep the other to their word. The EU wants to be able to suspend parts of the trade and security deal if the UK reneges on an obligation in any given part of the deal. Both sides would accept binding rulings from a new body. The UK says it will talk about this, but not until all the other contentious areas are fleshed out."
2020-10-14T17:28:43Z,politics,Politics,"Starmer has the intellect, the economics, the science. Johnson has his apathy | John Crace","Maybe Keir Starmer should consider going back to basics. It’s been so long since Boris Johnson gave a direct – or even an indirect – answer to the Labour leader at prime minister’s questions that the time has come for Starmer to work out at what level Boris is prepared to tell the truth. Simple control questions, such as “What is your name?” “What is your job?” “How many children do you have?” On second thoughts, maybe we should scrub that last one. We’ll never get an honest answer to that. Not least because Boris may not actually know. This week’s PMQs promised much, coming less than a day after Starmer had put a clear dividing line between Labour and the Conservatives on how to deal with the coronavirus pandemic by calling for a circuit breaker. Call it Tier Starmer. Yet somehow their 15-minute exchanges felt something of a letdown. Not so much because Starmer was asking the wrong questions, but because of Johnson’s now trademark tactic of refusing to engage. Playing the idiot unsavant is an easy way of getting the Labour leader off his back when he knows he’s only got to survive six questions. Starmer started with some basic detail. On 11 May Johnson had promised the country he would be guided by the science at all times. On 21 September the Sage scientists had recommended a short circuit breaker. So at what point did the prime minister decide to abandon the science and cobble together a three-tier regional system with which almost no one was happy? Despite having had the whole morning to prepare for such an obvious question, Boris looked genuinely bemused. As if he had quite forgotten it was Wednesday and had been hoping for a lie-in. So he did what he always did. He filled dead air with dead words. When he had said he was going to follow the science, he had never intended to imply he would do so faithfully. Rather he was going to pick and choose the bits he liked. He reminded me of a builder I once used who, when I observed the kitchen floor was not level, replied that I had never specified it should be “dead level”. Besides, Boris added, he was trying to balance the effects on livelihoods as well as lives. Not to mention the concerns of many Tory MPs who thought his three-tier lockdown plan already imposed far too many restrictions. So what had changed since Monday, when the Labour leader had seemed to back his new proposals? Now it was Keir’s turn to look startled. What had changed was that the September Sage documents had only been published hours after the prime minister had finished making his Commons statement. It was a bit tricky trying to follow the science when the evidence had been withheld for the best part of a month. Hell, even all the council leaders in Greater Manchester were now on his side, saying they supported Tier Starmer rather than being dumped into tier 3. This wasn’t quite true in fact, as the Tory council leader in Bolton had not signed up to this, but Starmer could rely on Boris not to be across this level of detail. “Opportunism is the name of the game for the party opposite,” Johnson concluded. This was an open goal for Starmer and he didn’t miss, saying this was a bit much from someone who had been an opportunist all his life. Not even the prime minister’s allies could quibble with that. There again, even Boris had enough self-awareness to realise this might not be the most profitable line of attack and hastily backtracked. Keir then upped the ante on the stats. Sage thought the £12bn track-and-trace system was having a marginal effect at best. What had happened to the “world-beating” system? Not even the scientists believed it was working well enough to reduce the R rate so the only logical conclusion was that bit by bit every region of the country would be moved up a tier or two as the infection rate increased, so we would just end up with a national lockdown by default. So why not act early and decisively to try to make a difference? Changing strategies when your own isn’t working wasn’t a sign of weakness. It was a sign of intelligence. Some hope. By now Boris was beginning to look a bit bored. Even someone with his notoriously short attention span can get fed up with mouthing the same non-answers week after week. Not even the few diehard loyalists in the chamber who were cheering on his every bit of mindlessness, could clear his Mogadon fug. First he confused a two-month lockdown with a short circuit breaker – he seemed so pleased at that piece of ignorance he repeated it twice – before adding: “I rule out nothing.” It was as good an admission we were likely to get of the inevitability of a circuit breaker, but for Boris it was much more fun to see how many people died and how many businesses went under as he messed around with his three-tier system first. Death by a thousand cuts.
And with that it all rather petered out. There was time for an obligatory dig at the Scottish National party – every time Boris opens his mouth he makes Scottish independence more likely – but mostly the prime minister looked as if he couldn’t wait to get away. Being beaten by Starmer at PMQs isn’t something he enjoys but it has long been priced into Johnson’s balance sheet. His only goal is to keep his losses to a minimum by maintaining the impression the session is a meaningless charade. And today he had managed to do just that, despite Starmer having the intellect, the science, the economics and public opinion on his side. The Labour leader is going to have to rethink his approach. It won’t be easy. Boris is as careless with other people’s lives as he is with his personal relationships. In Boris world, he is the sun god whose continued existence is paramount. Everyone and everything else is expendable. But a change is going to have to come from somewhere. Otherwise we really are all totally screwed. There isn’t a single thing which the government can be said to be doing well. The coronavirus, Brexit, the economy and levelling up are all disaster areas. And despite the pallor and fatigue, Johnson just ain’t that bovvered."
2020-10-14T16:45:47Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 19,724 new cases recorded, a daily rise of nearly 2,500 – as it happened","The UK has recorded 19,724 new coronavirus cases - a new daily record and an increase of almost 2,500 (or 14%) on the figure for yesterday. (See 4.27pm.) People who live in Covid-19 hotspots in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are to be banned from travelling to Wales, the Welsh first minister has announced. Northern Ireland is to close schools, pubs and restaurants as part of new restrictions to try to contain exploding rates of Covid-19 infection. Keir Starmer has piled more pressure on Boris Johnson over his refusal to implement a national â€œcircuit breakerâ€� lockdown in England, confronting the prime minister about why he ignored top scientific advisers who urged him to impose the measure.
A â€œcircuit breakâ€�, in the form of a two-week lockdown during the half-term or Christmas school holidays, could cut Covid deaths by January by between 29% and 49%, depending on the rate of infections in the country, say experts. Talks have been taking place about including more areas in the north of England and the Midlands in the very high alert tier 3, which would see them being subject to the strictest restrictions. But no decisions have yet been taken, according to the BBCâ€™s Matt Cole.
Hundreds of dedicated Covid-positive care homes are to be set up in an effort to keep patients discharged from hospitals from spreading the virus more widely, as happened in the first wave of the pandemic. The UK travel association Abta has accused the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, of failing to â€œbat for his sectorâ€�, being too slow to provide support and create an airport Covid-19 testing regime. Boris Johnson will be advised by his chief negotiator that a trade deal with the EU is still possible should the prime minister ditch his deadline and continue to negotiate with Brussels as tentative signs of a compromise on fisheries emerged.

2020-10-14T15:34:16Z,politics,Politics,"EU deal still possible, PM to be told, as potential fisheries plan emerges","Boris Johnson will be advised by his chief negotiator that a trade deal with the EU is still possible should the prime minister ditch his deadline and continue to negotiate with Brussels as tentative signs of a compromise on fisheries emerged. David Frost, who has been in talks with the EU team led by Michel Barnier this week, will inform the prime minister that a further two weeks, at least, of daily talks could result in the remaining gaps being bridged.
Downing Street will look for confirmation from the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU leaders meeting at a summit on Thursday that the bloc’s negotiators are willing to start writing joint legal text. But Frost remains hopeful that the arduous negotiation could still bear fruit, according to UK sources close to the talks. Johnson said on 7 September that if there was a lack of agreement by the summit then both sides should “accept that and move on”. Sources insisted that the prime minister had never threatened to walk away. A UK government spokesman said: “There are still differences, with fisheries being the starkest. We need to get substance settled and not having a common text to work from has made progress doubly difficult. “The prime minister’s 7 September statement was very clear about the significance of 15 October. He will need to take a decision on next steps following the European council in the light of his conversation with President Von der Leyen, and on advice from his negotiating team. We cannot prejudge that decision.” Should Johnson accept Frost’s advice, as is almost certain, sources suggested it would require a step up in intensity by the EU in order for a deal to most likely emerge by mid-November.
France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, suggested this week that the next EU summit on the 15 November could be a target, as some signs of compromise between the two sides emerged. One of the outstanding issues remains the level of access granted to EU fishing fleets in British waters after 1 January 2021, when the transition period ends. The Guardian understands that the French EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, a former adviser to the president, Emmanuel Macron, made a point of raising the need to maintain the status quo in the English channel during a meeting of the bloc’s ministers on Tuesday. He said that Paris did not believe there was any margin for negotiation on the current fishing arrangements in the UK’s six- to 12-mile exclusive economic zone, where 84% of the cod quota is landed by French fishermen. Any loss for French fishermen on that coastline is regarded by Paris as too politically toxic, with communities generally using small boats that have fished in British waters for centuries. But EU diplomats suggested there might be room for manoeuvre in the wider seas, including the Celtic sea, Irish Sea and the waters around Scotland, where large fishing vessels operate. France among others would, however, insist that any losses for European fishermen in British waters should be made good through taking away UK rights to EU waters. In an indication of a possible opening, Barnier had told MEPs on Tuesday that Downing Street needed to offer Scottish fishermen an opportunity to develop fisheries in their own waters, in light of the growing independence sentiment in Scotland. Following a phone call with Von der Leyen and European council president Charles Michel on Wednesday evening, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had “noted the desirability of a deal, but expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks”. The spokesman added: “The prime minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European council and would reflect before setting out the UK’s next steps in the light of his statement of 7 September.” In a tweet following the call, Von der Leyen said the EU wanted a deal “but not at any price”. “Conditions must be right, on fisheries, level-playing field and governance”, she wrote. “Still a lot of work ahead of us. Michel tweeted: “On the eve of the [summit] we pressed again for progress to be made at the negotiating table”. The EU leaders will discuss the latest developments with Barnier on Thursday afternoon. According to a draft summit statement seen by the Guardian, the heads of state and government will ask Barnier to further “intensify” the negotiations. On the major issues of contention beyond fisheries, the two sides are seeking to write in a set of common rules on domestic subsidy control that allows two distinct arrangements to exist and interact with each other. The UK has indicated that it will have an independent regulator, a key EU request. The British side has agreed to non-regression on EU environmental, social and labour standards but Brussels wants a mechanism to allow base-line standards to develop in parallel. A senior diplomat said the UK was resisting but that it was akin to trying to get a child to “eat veggies”. “What do you do? Do you force it through? The other option is try and find a way around the issue and mix it with bananas. But in the end, it is the same. He or she will eat their veggies.”"
2020-10-14T12:30:23Z,politics,Politics,Roadside portable loos planned for lorry drivers delayed by Brexit checks,"The government is to install portable toilets on roads in Kent for lorry drivers whose journeys could be delayed for up to two days in the event of traffic congestion post-Brexit. Rachel Maclean, a parliamentary undersecretary of state in the Department for Transport, said sanitary facilities would also be provided on roadsides elsewhere in the country. Government modelling suggests that in the reasonable worst-case scenario there could be queues of up to 7,000 trucks as a result of new checks and controls in Dover and Calais. Maclean told MPs on Wednesday: “We have detailed plans that we’ve worked up for provision of not only Portaloos but other facilities for drivers, and not only in Kent, should it be necessary, should there be stationary traffic, but also in a range of other areas throughout the country, because we really want to minimise the impact on those drivers who are already working really hard.” The comments prompted jokes on social media that Kent would be turned from the “garden of England to the toilet of England”. But the plans will be welcomed by the haulage industry and by residents of Kent who for years have been lobbying for toilet and shower facilities for drivers who legally are obliged to pull over for rests but have no truck stops to go to, unlike in France. The Conservative MP Karl McCartney told the transport select committee of a “proliferation of bottles that look like they’re filled with Irn-Bru but they’re not” discarded by truckers on laybys. Maclean told the committee that her department was working flat out to mitigate the impact of Brexit on truckers and residents, but “there are going to be a number of unknown unknowns”.
Brexit talks are due to continue despite Boris Johnson’s self-imposed deadline of 15 October for a deal. Maclean admitted that the government had only a tiny fraction of the 33,000 international driver permits needed for hauliers if the talks collapse. The committee heard that there were 8,000 haulage firms in the UK involved in EU transportation, with 39,000 trucks. Maclean said the UK had only a fraction of the permits needed for hauliers to operate legally in the EU in the event of no deal. “The UK has up to 1,668 annual and 5,040 short-term permits available for 2021,” she said. “We know that that is not adequate for all of the UK drivers driving to the EU, but it is just one option that we would look to rely on in the eventuality that we’re not able to agree a more widespread access arrangement.” The Road Haulage Association said the lack of permits would be devastating to all trade, with 33,000 licences needed, according to the traffic commissioner’s report. It also pointed out that the temporary permits were valid for just one month."
2020-10-14T12:10:56Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings allowed to avoid backdated council tax on second home,"Council tax must be paid on the second home in Durham in which Dominic Cummings and his family stayed during the lockdown, a government agency has ruled. But the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) decided not to backdate thousands of pounds in unpaid council taxes on the property since it was built on his parents’ North Lodge estate in 2002 without permission. The issue was referred to the VOA in June after Durham county council found there had been historical breaches of planning and building control regulation during the construction of the property and the conversion of another into two homes. At the time the council said it could not take enforcement action against the family because of a time limit on such measures. The council has now confirmed that after the VOA’s ruling, the Cummings family will, from this month, have to pay three separate council tax bills for the homes at North Lodge, instead of the one bill the family has been paying until now. The two extra bills relate to a converted home occupied by Cummings’ sister, and the separate home that Cummings occupied during lockdown. Despite guidance specifically banning the use of second homes during the lockdown, the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed that Cummings and his family travelled to the Durham property at the height of the lockdown. He made the 260-mile trip after his wife became sick with suspected coronavirus on 27 March, a day before he also became ill. In his rose garden statement about the trip he described the property as “an isolated cottage on my father’s farm”, and did not mention that, as co-owner of the property, it was also his second home. He insisted he had done nothing wrong and that the rules allowed such arrangements to look after a child in exceptional circumstances. The VAO refuses to comment on individual cases. But its decision not to backdate council tax has infuriated some Durham councillors. Speaking to the Northern Echo, John Shuttleworth, an independent councillor, said: “If it was anybody else, they would be getting charged and it would be backdated, or they would be getting taken to court. “It just proves there is two sets of rules: one for them and another for everyone else. It is not right.” In a message to the Guardian, the Liberal Democrat councillor Liz Brown said: “Words fail me. It appears once again there is one law for the government’s cronies and another for ordinary people. I’m fairly sure that you or I wouldn’t be given an amnesty over back council tax.
“Quite apart from that, council tax is used in a great many ways to benefit the whole county. By making this decision, in a way DCC is penalising all the residents of the county.” John Hewitt, the council’s director of resources, said: “The current single assessment [for council tax on North Lodge] will be replaced with three entries in the rating list going forward. “These changes will be implemented with effect from 4 October 2020, which is the date we have been instructed to apply the changes from. The day which the rating list is to be amended is a matter for the Valuation Office Agency.” In a statement the VOA said: “We treat all taxpayers equally and we value domestic properties in line with legislation.”"
2020-10-14T10:32:46Z,politics,Politics,Trade department links with rightwing thinktank under fresh scrutiny,"Links between Liz Truss’s Department for International Trade and a powerful rightwing thinktank have come under fresh scrutiny, after the government defeated efforts to enshrine high food safety and animal welfare standards in UK law. Last month, Truss appointed the former Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan and the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott to the Board of Trade, which is intended to help shape post-Brexit trade policy. Hannan is the president of the Initiative for Free Trade, while Abbott sits on its board. Amendments to the government’s agriculture bill, which were aimed at protecting animal welfare standards and received the backing of several prominent Tory MPs, were struck out on Monday evening in the House of Commons. Hannan vociferously criticised the amendments, calling Labour’s approach “almost North Korean”. In a 230-page “ideal” US-UK free trade agreement, published by the IFT in 2018, the group warned against protections for farmers being smuggled in under the guise of public health or animal welfare – and urged the opening up of the NHS to private sector competition. Abbott sits on the IFT’s international board, as one of a group of “statesmen who have liberalised their own economies”. He had previously boasted that he succeeded in striking trade deals with China because he had not been “sidetracked by peripheral issues such as labour and environmental standards”. Labour has expressed concern about the influence of Hannan, Abbott and their worldview on US-UK trade negotiations. The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: “When it comes to a UK-US trade deal, the agenda of Daniel Hannan and the rightwing thinktanks has always been clear: open up our markets to all US meat imports, decree that whatever is legal there is legal here, and remove any domestic standards getting in the way. “Liz Truss has always been close to that agenda, but now she has put its architects in positions of direct power and influence within her department. That is not just deeply worrying for our food safety, our animal welfare standards, and our farmers, but also for our democracy – no one voted to put Daniel Hannan or Tony Abbott in control of our trade policy.” The IFT, whose launch was hosted by Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office, says its mission is to “recapture the moral case for open commerce”. The IFT worked with Washington’s free market Cato Institute to bring together 11 conservative thinktanks and draw up a radical “ideal” US-UK trade deal, which recommended opening up the healthcare sector to foreign competition along with a bonfire of consumer and environmental regulations. “Health services would benefit from foreign competition, although we recognise any change to existing regulations would be extremely controversial,” the blueprint said. It recommended testing the waters by opening up education and legal services first. On food standards, the report said a deal should ensure “measures to protect animal, human, or plant health are based on sound science and that the parties do not adopt measures that are disguised barriers to trade and competition”. Speaking at the report’s London launch, its lead editor, Dan Ikenson, the director of the Cato Institute, was blunt about what it could mean for the NHS. “Healthcare is a service, we call for opening services to competition. And I know some people are worried about what happens to the NHS, for example. We think competition is a good thing and it would lead to better quality healthcare,” he said. Truss, then chief secretary to the Treasury, was in Washington on that day, speaking at a separate meeting hosted at the Cato Institute. She was introduced by Ryan Bourne, the former head of public affairs at the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) and a champion of Truss’s swashbuckling trade ideals. Truss said that “a thicket of regulation and control ... is holding people back, which is about managing risk rather than taking opportunities”, adding: “Our economies work best at full tilt, when individuals and businesses are liberated.” During a three-day visit to the US capital, Truss also held meetings with three of the five other US contributors to the IFT report: the Heritage Foundation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Enterprise Institute. DIT officials recently deleted two meetings between Truss and the IEA – one of the UK thinktanks involved in the project – from the public register of contacts with ministers, claiming they were personal discussions about trade. The meetings were later restored to the record. Thornberry accused Truss of trying to “hide her dealings with these thinktanks”. A DIT spokesperson said: “The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic. The government is committed to the guiding principles of the NHS – that it is universal and free at the point of need.” In Monday’s debate, the junior environment minister Victoria Prentis promised a food white paper within six months, and insisted “the government are firmly on the side of British farmers and high standards”. The Board of Trade is expected to meet quarterly, and its advisers will “engage extensively with industry, communities, farmers and consumer groups across the UK, to ensure a range of voices are heard as the UK develops its independent trade policy”, the DIT said."
2020-10-13T22:09:09Z,politics,Politics,MPs reject attempts to strengthen post-Brexit fishing protections,"Environmental campaigners failed in their attempts to strengthen post-Brexit protections against over-fishing on Tuesday night, as the government rejected a series of amendments to the fisheries bill. Attempts to enshrine in law a commitment to keep fishing quotas within the sustainable limits advised by scientists failed, and an amendment aimed at banning supertrawlers from marine protected areas was also defeated by 331 votes to 197. The battle will now move to the House of Lords, where peers are expected to try to restore some measures on sustainability and destructive fishing practices. However, the government’s 80-strong majority means only minor tweaks are likely to be accepted. Victoria Prentis, a junior minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told MPs during a four-hour debate that the bill had to “balance environmental, social and economic needs”. But campaigners said MPs had ignored government promises that sustainability would be a legal commitment in the reorganisation of the UK’s fishing rights. Melissa Moore, head of UK policy at the conservation group Oceana, said: “It’s a sad day for UK fisheries as the bill will enable overfishing to continue as there is no deadline or clear duty to fish sustainably. This is bad news for fishermen as more stocks will be at risk of collapse, bad news for coastal communities and bad news for the public who love fish suppers.” She said the bill weakened protections that the UK had under the EU, which has a deadline to phase out overfishing this year. “The UK government’s rhetoric that it would develop ‘gold standard’ fisheries management is a joke,” she said. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “The Tories have again voted against creating new jobs in our fishing communities, and stopping supertrawlers destroying marine habitats. Britain’s fishers and our seas deserve better.” For more than four decades, Britain’s fishermen have been governed by the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP), under which catch quotas are divided up among member states at annual meetings in Brussels. But the UK’s fleets have long been disadvantaged by the arrangement because governments agreed small catches to gain entry to the Common Market in the 1970s. About 60% of the fish stocks in UK waters were allocated to other EU member states under the CFP. Fisheries reform was championed by proponents of Brexit as a key win from leaving the EU. Within the Brexit negotiations it has become a fiercely contested issue. Ministers made a small concession on marine protected areas, by agreeing to conduct further research into whether destructive practices such as bottom trawling should be allowed. Charles Clover, executive director of the Blue Marine Foundation, told the Guardian: “The minister is now considering enforcing the existing law in 5% of our offshore marine protected areas. Why is this government so afraid of doing what is patently the right thing?” Greenpeace also slammed the plans, under which very large vessels – supertrawlers, which can scoop up 250 tonnes of fish in a single day – will still be permitted to fish in marine protected areas, without trawling the seabed. Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: “Despite enormous public and cross-party political support for banning destructive fishing like supertrawlers and bottom trawling from our offshore marine protected areas, the government’s ambition remains pitifully weak. Fishing boats over 100-metres long have absolutely no place in so-called protected areas. Just because their nets do not touch the seabed should not mean they are given every right to haul hundreds of tonnes of fish every day from vulnerable habitats.” The Conservative manifesto pledged that the fisheries bill would contain a legal commitment to fish sustainably, which campaigners said had not been met. Helen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager at WWF, said: “The UK has missed an opportunity to take the first crucial steps towards ocean recovery.”"
2020-10-13T19:18:43Z,politics,Politics,Nervy Keir Starmer offers alternative to tiers of a clown | John Crace,"It was quite the moment. For months now, Boris Johnson’s only comeback to Keir Starmer at prime minister’s question has been that he didn’t have a policy of his own. Rather forgetting it was the government’s job to come up with the ideas and for the opposition to oppose. But in his first ever televised press conference since he was elected Labour leader, Starmer chose to put clear blue water between himself and Johnson by calling for a two- to three-week “circuit break” to halt the spread of the coronavirus. This wasn’t Starmer in his natural habitat. He has still to master the art of looking relaxed in front of the TV cameras, but his 10-minute speech was delivered with the conviction of someone who knows he has the Sage scientists and most of the public on his side. It might have looked a little awkward, but it was the closest thing to true leadership the country has seen in months. Alongside Keir, Boris looks increasingly like a startled, desperate wrecking-ball. Starmer began where he had left off in his reply to Johnson’s statement in the Commons the day before with a run down of the latest coronavirus statistics. Then he took out the scalpel. The government had no plan, had lost control and was no longer even listening to the scientific advice. Not so long ago Boris used to say he followed the science. Now he has downgraded Sage to mere guidance. AKA something to be ignored at will. With the test-and-trace system only having a marginal impact and the rate of infection going up in 19 out of the 20 regions in which local lockdowns had been imposed, now was not the time for half-measures. Boris’s three-tier system were the tiers of a clown: as doomed to failure as his previous compromises to bring down the infection rate. Now was the time for the two- to three-week national lockdown that government scientists had called for back in September. Only schools – the circuit break could be timed to coincide with half-term – and essential work and travel would remain open. Everything else would be shut down – even parliament would go to remote working – and those businesses affected by the closures would get financial compensation. Keir ended with a personal message to Boris. The Labour leader might not trust the prime minister, but it’s never a bad look to appear to be the last person in the country who believes Johnson has a conscience worth appealing to. That sound you just heard was Boris throwing up in a corner. He has always had problems swallowing his pride. Come on, he said. You know the scientific evidence is on my side. You know you can’t carry on trying to keep all the Tory MPs with competing interests onside with a series of half-arsed measures that please no one and achieve nothing. Even if you added a tier 4, where only people in urgent need of eyesight tests were allowed out provided they were in possession of a burger and chips, it would still be a disaster. We all know the circuit breaker is coming down the line at some point, so you might as well do it now before the death toll rises much higher. Starmer quickly moved on to take a few questions from the broadcast media. Yes, he did want mayors and council leaders to be involved – especially in running a more targeted, localised test-and-trace system – but the circuit breaker had to be the priority. It was the only way to save lives, protect the NHS from being overloaded and would give the country a chance to rest itself. Chris Whitty had even said as much when he was standing next to the prime minister at the Downing Street press conference the night before. Just how much more evidence did anyone need? And yes, it would cost money but not nearly as much as the government’s attritional rate of failure that would be bound to end in a circuit breaker anyway. Starmer didn’t have any exact figures in mind, but then, to be fair, neither has the government a clue how much its own measures would cost. And yes, he wouldn’t be voting against the government’s three-tier system because doing something had to be better than doing nothing. But not by much. Boris was merely hell bent on killing us with acts of futile kindness. It hadn’t been a pitch perfect appearance. Starmer had at times looked nervous about putting his head above the parapet for the first time and he looked relieved to scuttle off unscathed. But it had been more than good enough. Not least because he had got in first with a policy the government is certain to have to adopt at some point soon, because not even half his own MPs believe in Boris these days. Then neither does Boris, so they are in good company. Nor could Keir be certain that one circuit breaker would be sufficient. But that was a problem that could wait for another day. If things got that bad then we’d all be screwed. There again, we probably were anyway. But at least we had been given a glimpse of a man who sounded as if he had the authority of a prime minister. And that was as good a place as any to start."
2020-10-13T17:23:47Z,politics,Politics,Starmer calls for England-wide circuit breaker after most daily Covid deaths since June – as it happened,"Keir Starmer has urged the prime minister to impose a two- to three-week national “circuit breaker” lockdown across England to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed, in a dramatic escalation of his criticism of the government’s approach. Matt Hancock criticised lockdown sceptics in his own Conservative party as rebel MPs prepared to vote against new virus control measures for England in protest at the 10pm curfew. Ministers won a vote on the 10pm compulsory pub closing time, but dozens of MPs voted against. The result has just been announced, and the regulations were passed by 299 votes to 82. Labour were abstaining and, with the government at no risk of losing, many Conservatives were using the vote to register their disapproval, A full breakdown of the vote, showing the exact number of Tory rebels, will be available later. Chris Green, the Conservative MP for Bolton West, has resigned as a parliamentary private secretary because he is opposed to the government’s coronavirus restrictions. In a letter to the PM he says restrictions in Bolton have driven many businesses “to the brink of collapse” and that he now thinks “the attempted cure is worse than the disease”.
The number of people who have died in the UK as a result of Covid-19 has gone up by 143 in one day, the highest increase in four months. The number of people being made redundant in the UK has risen at the fastest rate since records began as the economic fallout from Covid-19 and the scaling back of the government’s furlough scheme drives up unemployment. More than 2 million people in England on the government’s shielding list, considered vulnerable to Covid because of their health, will be advised to take precautions and follow social distancing as cases surge, but most will not be told to stay home, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. Michel Barnier has mocked Boris Johnson for issuing a “third unilateral deadline” during a meeting with EU ministers, warning that the Brexit talks remain difficult with little prospect yet of the two sides entering a decisive “tunnel” negotiation. That’s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-10-13T16:28:58Z,politics,Politics,Tory peer apologises for ministerial rule breach in Uganda deals,"A former minister who denied breaching the ministerial code after her family firm signed multimillion pound deals with Uganda’s government has apologised for breaking the rules to a parliamentary watchdog, it has emerged. Lady Verma, the former energy minister, told the Guardian last month she did not have to inform the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba) after Nexus Green Ltd signed solar deals worth more than £88m with the sub-Saharan country. Letters released on Tuesday by the committee show she has been rebuked for a breach of ministerial rules by failing to seek advice about her role as a director in the firm. The former mayoral candidate has written to the committee to offer her “sincere apologies” for not understanding the rules and for failing to seek advice. Verma was a junior minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, and then the Department for International Development (DfID) from May 2015 to July 2016. Seven months after leaving the government, she was present when Nexus Green signed an £8m deal with Uganda’s notoriously homophobic president, Yoweri Museveni, to provide the military with solar power. Verma has attended several meetings with Museveni and became a director of Nexus Green in March 2018. The firm signed another deal with the Ugandan government last year, this time worth £80m, to build a factory to make solar equipment. Most of this deal is supposed to be financed with a loan from UK Export Finance, a government department. The deals have surprised other suppliers in the African solar power market. Verma and her son Rikki are the firm’s only directors and have no previous experience in the industry. According to rules to ensure transparency, ministers are supposed to declare all roles and jobs for up to two years after leaving office. When approached by the Guardian last month, Verma said she did not break the rules because Nexus Green was an energy firm and not connected to her last government role in DfID. “I did not have to declare this because I had left energy many years earlier,” she said. Lord Pickles, the chair of Acoba, wrote to Verma on 17 September, saying he was “concerned to see commentary in the media suggesting you did not need to seek Acoba’s advice” and disclosed that she had separately contacted the committee to apologise. “Failure to seek advice is a clear breach of the requirement set out in the ministerial code and the government’s appointment rules,” he wrote. In reply, Verma said she had broken the rules but insisted that her role is unpaid, advisory and has no executive powers. “My son, who is the CEO, asked me to join in an advisory capacity only because of my many years of business experience. “I am truly sorry for my misunderstanding of the rules which I accept is my failing and sincerely hope that the committee will accept my deepest regret at this failure. I would not deliberately disrespect the rules and sincerely apologise to the committee,” she wrote."
2020-10-13T14:35:43Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Barnier mocks Johnson's 'third deadline' on talks,"Michel Barnier has mocked Boris Johnson for issuing a “third unilateral deadline” during a meeting with EU ministers, warning that the Brexit talks remain difficult with little prospect yet of the two sides entering a decisive “tunnel” negotiation. With 48 hours remaining before an EU leaders’ summit in Brussels, by which time the British prime minister has demanded a breakthrough moment, the bloc’s chief negotiator suggested a deal was “very difficult but still possible”, according to diplomatic sources. He noted that Johnson had twice previously suggested that the UK needed the certainty of a deal by a specific date, only to later backtrack. “It is the third unilateral deadline that Johnson has imposed without agreement,” Barnier was said to have remarked. “We still have time.”
Johnson had said he wanted a deal before the end of summer, and then by the middle of October, before saying in recent weeks that a confident sign of a deal was all that was required. The UK urgently wants to open a short “tunnel” negotiation during which the two chief negotiators would be given the freedom by Downing Street and the EU member capitals to be creative in solving outstanding problems on the basis that any outcome would be subsequently backed. But after hearing Barnier’s assessment, diplomatic sources said this final phase did not appear to be on the cards “by far”. “The negotiations are in a difficult phase,” Barnier had told the EU ministers in Luxembourg, according to multiple sources. There was a more “constructive tone”, Barnier said, but “movement on three key issues was still necessary”. Discussions on the level-playing-field provisions, including state subsidy control, were continuing but the UK was seeking to keep the issue of EU access to British fishing waters “on the table to the last moment to ensure it can command the highest price for it”, he said. “Both sides need to have something to show to their public. It needs to be balanced.” Separately, in a speech on Tuesday, the German chancellor Angela Merkel said an agreement had “to be in the interests of both parties, in British interests as well as the interests of the 27-member European Union”. Barnier told ministers it was important to put the issue of access to British waters in perspective. The UK was asking to in effect stay part of the EU’s energy single market, the economic value of which was “five times” that of fish, he said. There was also a lack of UK engagement on how the terms of the trade and security deal would be policed, Barnier told ministers, according to sources. “This is now holding up further progress”, he had said. Barnier later tweeted: “The EU will continue to work for a fair deal in the coming days and weeks.” Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said he was concerned by attempts by London to open bilateral negotiations with member states on the outstanding issues but declined to comment further on his claim. Johnson has recently held calls with Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron. He is due to speak to the European commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday. Roth also suggested, however, that the EU was willing to move from its insistence on the status quo in terms of access to British waters for European fishing fleet. “We have to move towards each other’s positions”, he said during a post-meeting press conference. As details of Barnier’s sombre assessment emerged, a UK government source claimed Brussels was to blame for the lack of time in the negotiations and called for an urgent injection of “creativity”. “The EU have been using the old playbook in which they thought running down the clock would work against the UK,” the source said. “They have assumed that the UK would be more willing to compromise the longer the process ran, but in fact all these tactics have achieved is to get us to the middle of October with lots of work that could have been done left undone. “This is all the more frustrating because it is clear that we have come a long way since the beginning of the year. We need the EU to urgently up the pace and inject some creativity.” French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that the possibility of a no deal Brexit was “very real” and that the time for “playing games” was over. Speaking to the foreign affairs committee of the National Assembly on Tuesday he took an apparent swipe at Johnson. “One knows the British are skilled at tactics,” Le Drian said. “But even if the British are skilled tacticians, now is not the time for tactics. We have finished playing games, we have reached the due date,” he said."
2020-10-13T05:00:00Z,politics,Politics,Harman calls on Ofcom to publish data on older women in broadcasting,"Harriet Harman, the longest continuously serving female MP, has called on the media regulator, Ofcom, to publish data on the gender of older broadcasters to highlight the “double discrimination” facing senior female presenters on TV and radio. In an opinion piece in this week’s Radio Times, Harman complained of a “cull” of women over the age of 50 in broadcasting that she said meant they were now “as rare as hen’s teeth”. She suggested media companies would be more open to prosecution under the Equality Act if official data was available about the scarcity of older women in broadcasting and the widening pay gap between male and female broadcasters as they age. She wrote: “It’s telling that while Ofcom publishes the data on the percentage of men and women at each level of broadcasting, and that of older broadcasters, they don’t publish the data on older men compared to older women. They should, as it would show that women are pushed out when they are over 50.” Harman, a former deputy leader of the Labour party and now the mother of the House of Commons, added: “The provisions in the 2010 Equality Act that allow for claims on the grounds of ‘double discrimination’ have lain dormant on the statute book. They should be brought into effect now.” She said there were sexist double standards operating in broadcasting under which older men were seen as mature “but somehow the public needs to be protected from hearing, let alone seeing, an older woman”. She added: “There are young (usually glamorous) women in broadcasting, but they face a cull at 50.”
Recently a number of high-profile senior female broadcasters have departed BBC programmes, including Sue Barker from A Question of Sport and Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey from Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. Last month Libby Purves accused the the corporation of “lookism” in relation to older women. Harman, a guest during Murray’s final appearance on Woman’s Hour this month, said in the Radio Times that she was already missing hearing her on the long-running show. She said Murray was the voice of a generation of women who rejected having to choose between motherhood and a career. She said Murray demonstrated that bringing up children made her better at her job, and that “shamefully” this point was “lost on the world of broadcasting”. Vikki Cook, Ofcom’s director of broadcasting policy and diversity and inclusion, said: “We agree that the TV and radio industry needs to better understand how the diversity characteristics of their employees overlap and intersect. That’s why we’re working closely with broadcasters to explore how data collection can be improved, and ensure that meaningful comparisons can be made across the industry.”"
2020-10-12T22:38:51Z,politics,Politics,MPs reject calls by campaigners to enshrine food safety in UK law,"Farmers and food campaigners were defeated on Monday night in their attempts to enshrine high food safety and animal welfare practices in British law. Several prominent backbench Tory MPs rebelled against the government to vote for amendments to the agriculture bill that would have given legal status to the standards, but the rebels were too few to overcome the government’s 80-seat majority and the key amendment fell by 332 votes to 279 after an often impassioned debate. The government argued that giving current standards legal status was unnecessary as ministers had already committed to ensuring that UK food standards would be kept in any post-Brexit trade agreements. However, critics fear that the lack of a legally binding commitment in the agriculture bill will allow future imports of sub-standard food that will undercut British produce and expose consumers to risk. Kath Dalmeny, chair of the Future British Standards Coalition, said: “It’s dismaying that the government has opposed attempts to put into law its own commitment to maintain British food standards. It is perfectly possible to have high standards at home and sign trade deals with new trading partners who meet them. It’s what consumers have repeatedly said they want.” The bill, with its defeated amendments, will now return to the House of Lords and there will be further chances this week for debate. But the government’s majority gives proponents of a tougher bill a high bar to clear, despite a recent YouGov poll that showed nine out of 10 people want to protect British standards on food and animal welfare in trade deals. Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said: “We hope the Lords take this public mandate to deliver the Conservative manifesto commitment to maintain standards, especially after it was significantly backed by Conservative MPs. We call on peers to secure guarantees that the public and MPs are told upfront about any changes to standards that might happen as a result of trade deals, and that the final say on any changes will be a decision for our elected representatives.” The votes came as a Dispatches documentary on Channel 4 revealed poor hygiene and welfare among livestock on intensive farms in the US. Although the government has given repeated assurances that chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef would not be imported to the UK under any trade deals, campaigners point out that banning these two products would still allow the import of many types of other food produced under conditions and with drugs, including antibiotics, that would be illegal in the UK. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary, said: “The Conservatives have again broken their promise to British farmers and the public. No one wants lower quality food on our plates, but there is an increasing risk that this could happen because the prime minister is refusing to show leadership. Labour will always back British farmers and it is a disgrace that the Tories won’t do the same.” Neil Parish, the Conservative MP and chair of the select committee on the environment, food and rural affairs, gave an impassioned speech. “Why are we not a great beacon of animal welfare and the environment as we negotiate these trade deals?” he asked, calling for the government to have the “armour” of legal status for the standards. “We the British believe in agriculture, we believe in farming.” Sir Roger Gale, the leader of Scotland’s Tories, Douglas Ross, George Freeman and several others joined Parish. On Tuesday, the fisheries bill also will come back to MPs. Marine campaigners want stronger commitments from the government that future fishing quotas will be set in line with scientific advice. Ministers insist that they will ensure future fishing limits are within the “maximum sustainable yield”, but that setting such a commitment in law would tie the hands of negotiators in the expected annual talks with the EU and other countries over shared fishing grounds. The government is also resisting calls to require fishing vessels to carry monitoring equipment, in order to ensure they are landing their catch in line with the rules, and to end destructive fishing practices such as “bottom trawling” in marine protected areas."
2020-10-12T19:48:45Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson’s latest Covid strategy: no hope and no end in sight | John Crace,"History repeats itself. Sort of. There are now more people in hospital with coronavirus than there were in March when the prime minister imposed a lockdown on the entire country. The difference back then is those restrictions came with the promise of some kind of strategy. Measures to reduce the pressures on the NHS while an effective local track-and-trace system could be introduced that would allow targeted lockdowns where necessary. Six months on with countless broken promises on testing targets, including the deranged Operation Moonshot, and a track-and-trace system clearly unfit for purpose, Boris Johnson was back in the Commons to announce a new plan for the country. Only this one came with no end in sight. There was no glimmer of hope. Just an exhortation to keep aimlessly buggering on. The only upside was that if you did get Covid-19 then you were less likely to die of it than before as hospitals had become better at treating it. Unless the hospitals got completely overloaded. Then it was back to as you were. Johnson looked knackered before he even started. His complexion even more pallid than usual and his eyes mere pinpricks. For a moment it looked as if the narcissist had been confronted with his own sense of futility. A situation that he couldn’t bend to his will, no matter how delusional the thought process. He is cornered by hubris: a man hating every second of his life but condemned to experience its unforgiving horror. Not even the health secretary could be bothered to attend to watch this latest meltdown. “We have taken a balanced approach,” Johnson began. As in he was too slow to react back in March with the result that the government has one of the world’s highest death tolls. As in he did next to nothing during the summer when we had a chance to prepare for autumn. As in he actively encouraged people to go back to work for weeks before switching to advise them against it. As in unlocking the north at the same time as the south, even though infection rates in the north remained higher. That kind of balanced.
What Boris had to offer now was a new three-tier approach. Bad, very bad and very, very bad. Bad would apply to most of the country and would involve people doing pretty much what they had been doing for the last couple of months. Rule of six and all that. Very bad would mean that those areas that had already been under the more stringent lockdown restrictions would remain so, though if you wanted to meet a few friends outdoors in the garden for a beer to let each other know how depressed you were feeling you now could. And very, very bad meant that you could only see your mates if you happened to be in the pub at the same time and order five Cornish pasties to go with your bottle of scotch. It was all verifiably a bit nuts. Because as of yet the government has no scientific evidence that the hospitality industry is the prime source of infection, so it could all have been a waste of time. Because the government was in a fight with local leaders from around the country as to which tier they should be in: so far only Merseyside is classified as very, very bad and London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, was pushing for London to be upgraded within days. Because local areas were economically better off to be classified as very bad, mostly because the R rate was between 1.2 and 1.5 nationally, so the virus was going to continue to spread whatever happened.
Often in the past, Keir Starmer has been unequivocal in his support for the government’s coronavirus measures. This time he was rather more circumspect. Mostly because it was hard to see how much difference the new measures were going to make other than to relabel every area of the country, but partly because there are a lot of Labour MPs who fear for the economies of their constituencies and are keen to be downgraded as far as possible. Not to mention those MPs who didn’t trust the government to know where their constituencies actually were and to wrongly allocate them. For Boris, anything further north than Islington is the wilderness. It was no surprise that most other opposition MPs were sceptical, wondering whether stopping community transmission and an effective test-and-trace system would have been of more value, but what was most striking was how few Tory MPs were wholehearted in their enthusiasm. Some because they believe that any restriction on an Englishman’s liberty should be resisted – if you die, you die: get over it – but most because they too have no faith in Boris. The loss of trust in the prime minister is more contagious than the pandemic. It’s slowly dawned on them that he really is just fumbling around in the dark. Boris still had to endure a Downing Street press conference where he was called on to repeat much of what he had said in the Commons. Though this time he had Rishi Sunak and Chris Whitty to offer a limited helping hand; the chief medical officer’s most uplifting message was that things could easily have been a great deal worse and that the restrictions in all tiers would have to become more severe to be effective. Which rather undermined most of what the prime minister had been saying. Johnson did his best to retrieve the situation with the vague hope that things might be a bit better by Christmas. But even the eternal optimist didn’t sound confident. Boris had intended his new simplified guidelines to be reassuring. To let the country feel he had the situation in hand. Yet all he had really achieved was to remind everyone that he was out of his depth and had no real answers to anything. Like all of us, he was just dancing in the dark. Beam me up, Whitty."
2020-10-12T19:41:18Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Chris Whitty warns tier 3 measures alone 'not enough to get on top' of spread — as it happened,"Boris Johnson warned northern leaders that a failure to agree tougher coronavirus restrictions within days would be â€œunforgivableâ€� as he faced doubt and frustration over a new system designed to prevent the â€œinexorableâ€� spread of Covid-19. But Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, warned that even the toughest curbs would probably not contain the spread of the virus in the worst-hit areas and said local authorities would need to add extra restrictions. â€œThe base will not be sufficient. I think thatâ€™s very clearly the professional view,â€� he said. The full story is here."
2020-10-12T18:11:10Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond row: MSPs call for inquiry into Sturgeon to be extended,"Nicola Sturgeon should be investigated over alleged false statements to Holyrood, two members of the inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond have said. The Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said the ongoing Holyrood investigation into whether the current first minister broke the ministerial code over meetings with her predecessor should expand its remit. Sturgeon previously told the Scottish parliament she first heard about allegations of sexual misconduct made against Salmond at a meeting with him at her home on 2 April 2018. However, it has since emerged that she was told about them by his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein at a meeting in her office a few days before on 29 March. Then, during an interview with Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Sturgeon acknowledged that messages in November 2017 between her and Salmond made “an oblique reference” to a Sky News investigation into claims of inappropriate conduct against him. Scottish Labour’s Jackie Baillie supported Cole-Hamilton’s call, saying: “Contradictory statements made by the first minister suggest that knowledge of the complaints against Mr Salmond were known about even before 29 March. That being the case then it is important that the ministerial code investigation is widened.” In written evidence to the Holyrood committee published last week, Sturgeon claimed she had “forgotten” the meeting with Aberdein and also denied “in the strongest possible terms” conspiring against or colluding with Salmond over the allegations, as her husband and Scottish National party chief executive, Peter Murrell, admitted sending leaked text messages that appeared to endorse “pressuring” the police to investigate the former first minister. During the interview with Ridge, Sturgeon said: “I think the reason perhaps he [Mr Salmond] is angry with me – and he clearly is angry with me – is that I didn’t cover it up, I didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away, and perhaps that is at the root of why he is as annoyed as he appears to be.” She told Ridge much of the criticism she had endured was “age-old”, “that a man is accused of misconduct against women and often it’s a woman that ends up sitting answering for them”, adding that the allegations could not be “brushed under the carpet”. In response, Salmond made his first public comment since he was acquitted of 13 charges of sexual assault in March, stating that “the first time I will comment is in front of the parliamentary committee”. He said: “This committee was established to inquire into the conduct of the first minister, her special advisers and civil servants after her government’s behaviour was found to be ‘unlawful’, ‘unfair’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’ and at enormous cost to the public purse.” A source close to Salmond said he was not angry, “just astonished at the ever-shifting sands of [Sturgeon’s] story”. The source went on: “Her claims of an attempted ‘collusion’ are not only untrue but unsupported by the written evidence and directly contradicted by her own previous parliamentary statements. She claims to have ‘nothing to hide’. That is not the impression she is giving.”"
2020-10-12T17:18:01Z,politics,Politics,MPs hit out after being excluded from local lockdown briefings,"MPs have voiced anger at being excluded from briefings about local lockdown restrictions in their areas, learning of plans via internal WhatsApp groups or being offered briefings with less than 20 minutes’ notice. Several MPs told the Guardian they had listened to briefings from the Department of Health on what restrictions would be placed on their constituencies while standing in the vestibules of trains to London.
Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she learned via Twitter that her home constituency of Wigan was being placed in a tier 2 lockdown, suggesting ministers had not thought to include her in a call with Greater Manchester MPs. “Apparently there was a government briefing for GM MPs but I can’t provide details because I wasn’t invited,” she tweeted. “I suspect this is because they don’t know where Wigan is. What an absolute shambles.” Barbara Keeley, the Labour MP for Worsley and Eccles South, also said she had been left off the invite list. Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP for Warrington, said she had been invited to a briefing for Merseyside MPs which was then withdrawn. “Warrington is not in Merseyside, it is not in the Liverpool city region, it never has been and if you’re going to make decisions that affect us the very least you could do is recognise that fact,” she tweeted.
Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary and MP for Oldham, said he received an invite to a briefing with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, 21 minutes before it was due to start, while he was on a train to London. The Commons sits from 2.30pm on a Monday, in part to allow MPs time to travel to Westminster from their constituencies. “This is really poor even by current standards, like most things it appears an afterthought,” he said. Navendu Mishra, the Labour MP for Stockport, said the timing showed “complete disdain by this government for all those who live and work in Greater Manchester”. Labour’s Alex Cunningham, the MP for Stockton North, said he had been invited to a briefing eight minutes after the 20-minute meeting had started. “I got there with three minutes to go. How can people have confidence in ministers when they behave in such a way?” he said. Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary and the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said she only found out about a briefing for South and West Yorkshire MPs five minutes after it began. A West Yorkshire MP said he did not receive an invite to the meeting, and only became aware of it when other MPs in their WhatsApp group starting discussing the measures."
2020-10-12T14:24:28Z,politics,Politics,Labour MPs urge Starmer to get tough with government on Covid,"Keir Starmer is facing pressure from Labour MPs whose local economies could be hit by the latest Covid curbs to take a tougher stance against the government’s approach. MPs are expected to be offered votes on Tuesday on the 10pm pubs and restaurants curfew and aspects of the new tiered restrictions. The Labour leader, who has adopted a policy of “constructive opposition” throughout the pandemic, said last week his party would abstain on any vote on the 10pm curfew. But a growing number of Labour MPs believe the time has come for what one called “a parting of the ways” with the government on its management of the crisis.
The former shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said he would oppose 10pm closing if MPs were given a straight vote. The MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester said a briefing by the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, last week was unconvincing. He said: “They just have to be seen to be doing something and this is the easy hit, but speaking to [local health officials], they’re all saying exactly the same: that the 10pm curfew has been completely counterproductive because … you’re diverting people away from Covid-secure businesses, where there’s table service, there’s social distancing, there’s mask-wearing, where there’s track and trace. And there’s enforcement powers. “Everybody’s spilling out at the same time, they’re all getting on buses or waiting for taxis in a non-Covid-secure way, they’re going to the supermarket and getting a load of booze, and then they’re going to each other’s houses drinking it.” The shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, another Greater Manchester MP, said local data showed just 9% of new cases could be traced back to a hospitality setting. She called for a “really well-resourced” local tracing system to help prevent the spread of the virus in homes. John Spellar, the MP for Warley in the West Midlands, said he was sceptical about the 10pm curfew and the possibility of entire sectors being shuttered, potentially for months. He said he had not yet decided how to vote on the curfew but pointed out that Starmer had demanded evidence from Johnson to justify the policy. “Nothing I’ve seen … seems to show that they have come up with that evidence,” he said. “I’m waiting to see how this evolves, as it becomes clearer and clearer that the government don’t know what they’re doing – and this is clear not just to Labour members, but to a great number of Tory members as well … There are no good grounds now for bailing this government out.” Final whipping decisions are unlikely to be taken until Tuesday’s shadow cabinet meeting but Labour strategists say the leadership is concerned about being seen to oppose measures to control the virus as cases rise, even if the party remains critical of ministers’ approach. Asked about the curfew on Monday morning, Starmer said: “I doubt there’s any real scientific basis behind it. It isn’t working as it was intended because it was a hard stop and you’ve seen loads of examples of people going out on to the streets.” But he said MPs would only get a yes/no vote, and Labour wanted changes to make the rule work better, adding: “We won’t vote against it because in the end we are voting against a restriction and then there’s nothing in its place.” After Starmer said his party would abstain on 10pm closing last week, the Tory MP Steve Baker, who is leading a group of Conservatives opposing the measure, said he and colleagues would have no chance of success without Labour’s support."
2020-10-12T05:00:25Z,politics,Politics,Campaigners in last-ditch push to protect farming standards post-Brexit,"Campaigners are staging a last-ditch attempt to enshrine food safety and animal welfare standards in UK law after Brexit, as the agriculture bill returns this week for debate and a series of votes in both houses of parliament. The government is said to be adamantly opposed to legislating for a continuation of the high standards required under EU law, with farmers asked instead to rely on ministerial assurances that standards will be upheld after Brexit. A spokesperson dismissed concerns as “unhelpful scaremongering”. Thousands of people signed online petitions and wrote to their MPs over the weekend, as green campaigners and farmers’ groups raised awareness of the issue. The National Farmers’ Union has gathered more than 1m signatures for its campaign, which is also supported by the chef Jamie Oliver. Farmers are concerned that allowing food to be imported that does not meet the UK’s current safety and animal welfare standards will open the country up to inhumane and unsafe imports, and undermine domestic production. They are not convinced by assurances that ministers will uphold standards post-Brexit without a legally binding commitment in the agriculture bill. Several amendments thave been tabled in the bill’s passage through the Lords, but most are likely to fall unless a last-minute deal can be found with wavering “green Tory” MPs. Katie White, the head of campaigns at the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: “MPs must seize this historic moment to support British farmers and protect the health of people and planet by voting through improvements to the bill that enshrine our high food and environmental standards in tough nature laws for generations to come.” The Guardian understands, however, that a sizeable Tory rebellion is unlikely and major concessions are likely to be rejected, although there could be compromise on other issues. Ministers have repeatedly said that chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef from the US would continue to be banned in the UK, but have offered less concrete assurances on other aspects of food safety. In the government’s view, enshrining a commitment to EU or equivalent standards in the agriculture bill would tie the hands of negotiators seeking a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, which wants its agricultural producers to have full access to the UK market. Sonny Perdue, the US agriculture secretary, said last week: “We absolutely will not agree to policies that restrict our methods of production to any other standards outside of this country [the US]. While we will absolutely accede to international standards of health and safety which we believe to very measurable and objective, we do not intend to abide by any types of methods of production based on perception or anything else that’s not scientific.” The Future British Standards Coalition published a report on Monday showing that trade bills were possible even if the UK were to mandate higher standards in domestic law. The FBSC is concerned that current provisions in the agriculture bill have loopholes that would allow standards to be weakened without consultation. Under current government plans, the Food Standards Agency would prepare reports on foods and agricultural products and imports before they could enter the UK market. The reports would be sent to ministers, who would then make the decision on whether or not to accept the advice. Ministers could also change existing food and agricultural production standards without the need for a parliamentary debate or vote. The government has set up a Trade and Agriculture Commission to provide assurances that standards will be upheld, but it has been criticised as lacking real powers. A government spokesperson said: “This government has been clear it will not sign a trade deal that will compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards, and claims to the contrary are unhelpful scaremongering. We are a world leader in these areas and that will not change. “Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are not permitted for import into the UK. This will be retained through the EU Withdrawal Act and enshrined in UK law at the end of the transition period. The government is focused on getting trade deals that protect and advance the interests of our farmers and consumers. If a deal isn’t the right one, we will walk away.” Campaigners are also hoping that an amendment on the use of pesticides may garner some support from MPs. Under the amendment, which had substantial support in the Lords, pesticide use would be restricted around schools, nurseries, hospitals and homes. There may also be further assurances from ministers on government plans to pay subsidies to farmers based on the actions they take to protect the environment, instead of payments based mainly on the hectarage of land they farm, as at present."
2020-10-11T14:24:15Z,politics,Politics,Iain Duncan Smith calls for review of Chinese investment in UK,"Chinese ownership of British businesses should be subject to a national security review by the UK government to assess the impact of Beijing’s growing economic power, according to the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. The senior backbencher – a leading figure in the rebellion that forced Downing Street to introduce tougher controls on Huawei – believes ministers have failed to deal with the scale of China’s influence on strategic industries in the UK. The MP highlighted Britain’s leading supplier of blood plasma, BPL Group, which was once part of the NHS before it was privatised in 2013. It has been owned by a Chinese investment firm, Creat Group, since 2016. BPL obtains blood plasma from patients in the US, using it to derive treatments in labs in Elstree in the UK. “An important priority” for the company is to derive an effective treatment for Covid-19 from antibody-rich plasma taken from recovered patients, several trials of which are going on globally. But according to BPL’s most recent accounts, filed in August, the US committee on foreign investment asked the company to sell its US operation in 2019 to address “a series of national security concerns … regarding Chinese control of a US-based plasma collection business”. “What’s going on is the insertion of Chinese influence in all sorts of areas,” Duncan Smith said. “It’s going on piecemeal, and it’s not been properly collated. I believe the government has to pull it together in a strategic review and wonder what the overall impact on the UK is.” A Chinese company is a minority investor in Britain’s new nuclear power station at Hinckley Point and wants to build a reactor in Bradwell in Essex, while the position of telecoms supplier Huawei remains a source of contention. Last week, the Commons defence committee warned that the remaining presence of Huawei in UK 5G networks until 2027 represented “a significant risk to individuals and government” – a statement rejected by Huawei and Beijing. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said at a daily news conference: “The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning.” Concerns about China are growing significantly in Westminster, amid concerns about the country’s handling of Covid-19 and the treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority. On Wednesday, peers are due to debate a cross-party amendment to the post-Brexit trade bill, which says any trade agreements would be revoked if the high court formally determines that the other country is party to genocide. Alan Mendoza, the chief executive of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, said: “The US has rightly forced one Chinese firm to divest its US business, owing to the rapidly increasing importance of blood plasma treatments. The UK must now review its own strategic dependency on China in order to avoid being potentially held to ransom by an authoritarian state.” BPL said it had benefited from Creat’s ownership. “Since the acquisition, Creat has invested over £100m in enhancing processes, talent and equipment to support the development of BPL Ltd into one of the world’s leading suppliers of plasma-derived therapies.”"
2020-10-11T14:03:27Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick admits approving funds for town in Jake Berry's constituency,"Robert Jenrick has admitted that he and a junior minister approved payments to towns in each other’s constituencies from a government fund earmarked for deprived areas. The communities secretary confirmed that communities minister Jake Berry gave the go-ahead for Jenrick’s Newark constituency to be selected for a £25m fund award even though it was 270th on the list of the UK’s most deprived areas. Jenrick said he signed off the decision for money to be allocated to Darwen, a town in Berry’s Rossendale and Darwen constituency. On Sunday, Jenrick insisted there was a “robust and fair” methodology behind the government’s towns fund and dismissed as “completely baseless” allegations that he had any involvement in Newark’s selection. Last year, Jenrick announced details of a £3.6bn towns fund to be shared between 101 left-behind areas. Under the scheme, select towns were able to bid for up to £25m each from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Jenrick and Berry, his junior minister, were allegedly responsible for choosing 61 of the towns. At a hustings during the election last year, Jenrick told voters: “I helped to secure a £25m town deal which I hope will improve the public realm and make the town centre a more attractive place to spend time in.” After the election, Jenrick sat on a board convened by Newark and Sherwood district council that petitioned his own department for the maximum amount available of £25m. Jenrick told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “If the question you’re coming to is was I involved in selecting my own community, absolutely not. Ministers do not get involved in their own constituencies. That decision was made by another minister in my department.”
Asked which minister made the decision, Jenrick replied: “It was made by Jake Berry.” When Marr pointed out that a town in Berry’s constituency also received money from the fund, Jenrick confirmed that he was the individual to have given that decision the go-ahead. Earlier this year, Jenrick rebuffed calls for his resignation after he ensured a controversial housing development was agreed before a levy was introduced that would have cost its backer millions. Documents showed that the former porn baron and Conservative party donor Richard Desmond urged Jenrick to approve his Westferry Printworks development in east London before a new community infrastructure levy was introduced, a move which, it is believed, would have saved Desmond £50m. Desmond had given the Conservatives £12,000 two weeks after the scheme for 1,500 homes was approved, and the housing secretary had sat next to him at a fundraising event. Jenrick denied any wrongdoing but expressed regrets for sitting next to Desmond and exchanging messages with him. Labour is demanding an inquiry into the way money was allocated from the towns fund. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, has written to Simon Case, the head of the civil service, requesting a cabinet office investigation."
2020-10-11T10:00:02Z,politics,Politics,‘Everyone is fighting’ – how Downing Street lost its grip on a divided nation,"When he addressed the nation on 23 March to announce a national lockdown, Boris Johnson knew he had most of the British people with him. “Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together to halt the spread of this disease,” the prime minister said in his TV broadcast. “We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.” Six and a half months on, as he prepares to announce the introduction of more restrictions and a new three-tier system across the country – at what ministers say is a “critical” moment – hospitals are filling up and death rates are rising once more. Unlike March, however, calls for the British people to unite behind a response directed from No 10 no longer command the attention or respect they did then. The many changes in rules and regulations have left people confused and choosing to rely on their own instincts as much as on what politicians tell them. Trust in the government to handle the pandemic, say local leaders who monitor the crisis daily, has been shot to pieces. “I would say that trust in authority has completely gone,” said one senior official at the heart of the fight against Covid-19 in the north of England on Saturday. That crisis of confidence in central government is borne out in the latest Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday. It shows that just 31% approve of the way the government has handled Covid-19. At the end of March the approval rate was above 60%. National targets on testing have not been met. False expectations have been set. Rules have changed at dizzying speed. “One day people are told one thing, the next another to the point where they have stopped even trying to follow,” said one public health director. This weekend, when unity is needed, the cabinet is split. Tory MPs are split. The media is split. Public opinion is split. And council and public health leaders in some of the biggest cities of the north and Midlands are in revolt. So what can be done?
On Friday the prime minister’s close adviser Edward Lister and senior civil servants were locked in long, tense virtual meetings with local health chiefs and council leaders, trying to get them to agree to the new three-tier approach. After two hours of talks, one of those who took part said he and many other leaders in the north of England were so furious at what took place that they were thinking of issuing a statement refusing to comply with government orders. “They say they are listening to us but they are not. What they seem to want to do is punish the north. The extra financial support announced by the chancellor is welcome but it is two-thirds of people’s wages, not 80% which it was before. This is not enough for people and the businesses which will have to close.” Another official involved in talks with the government over the weekend said: “It is toxic and everyone is fighting.” The reason for the anger, on display at a press conference of northern mayors on Saturday, is twofold. First the mayors demand to know why the government will only pay two-thirds of the wages of people in businesses in their areas that have to close as a result of the latest decisions by No 10, whereas they paid for 80% under the national lockdown. This, they say, is “grossly unfair” and discriminatory. It will leave many in the hospitality sector earning way below the minimum wage and unable therefore to pay their rent through no fault of their own. Many will therefore face eviction in the run-up to Christmas. Second, they do not see why central government should have the power to shut their pubs and hospitality venues, when local politicians and health leaders could do so themselves if granted so-called “summary closure powers”. In essence they want the power to make those decisions themselves. For months council leaders and mayors have been asking ministers to allow them to fight the pandemic locally, with their own test and trace systems, rather than having decisions dictated from the centre. Mayors such as Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester have also called for greater financial help for people on low incomes required to self-isolate, arguing that without it many would not do so as they would feel they could not afford to. Leaders in the regions wanted more central government help – but it had to be help to allow them to manage their own responses, tailored to local needs.
This is not what they were hearing from No 10 this weekend, however. “There are lots of warm words,” said one senior figure. “But they are not listening. They are telling us to agree what they want. There is no consultation. We have different factors in different areas. In some university cities like Newcastle and Nottingham the virus is mainly being spread among students and has yet to spread to older people. In other areas like Merseyside we hear it has spread to older people. We need the ability to respond locally.” In some cases local leaders believe restrictions do not go far enough. Liverpool’s Labour mayor Joe Anderson saidon Saturday that he expected his city – where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people – to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions. This would mean closing all the city’s pubs from Wednesday, though not its restaurants. Anderson said, however, that government would be wrong to allow Liverpool’s bars and pubs to stay open until Wednesday because the infection was spreading so fast in the city. In Merseyside things are so serious there are suggestions that local hospitals are already resigned to cancelling all elective surgery in the coming days because Covid admissions are rising so fast. Anderson said his other worry was that the public no longer listened to diktats from London. “I’m not convinced people trust the government’s decisions.” On Monday the prime minister hopes to be able to announce the new three-tier system to parliament and to have it voted on within days. Many of his own MPs are dubious that stricter lockdowns are necessary. To add to the confused picture Labour has said it will abstain in a vote expected early next week on extending the 10pm curfew for pubs across England. It is not just the north and Midlands where tighter restrictions appear imminent. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned people to expect new measures to be announced in the capital this coming week. “My prediction is, there will be additional restrictions being brought in because we’ve got to make sure we don’t have a situation with the NHS being overwhelmed and lives being lost.” Another local health director told the Observer that to make any of these restrictions stick, faith had to be restored in those announcing the changes: “The only way is to do that is locally with local decisions. It is too late to rebuild trust at national level.”"
2020-10-11T09:15:01Z,politics,Politics,Former Islington mayor quits Labour party over racism,"The UK’s first hijab-wearing mayor has resigned from the Labour party citing racism and a “system that allows white men to have what they want, when they want”. Somalia-born Rakhia Ismail said she had stepped down because she felt she was marginalised as a woman of colour and was not taken seriously by some male colleagues. After leaving her ceremonial post as mayor of Islington, north London, late last month Ismail has informed Labour members of Holloway Ward that she is resigning as councillor after eight years. She said: “I’m saddened deeply that the party I thought was for justice and fairness and ‘for the many’ is the opposite, from my personal experience. “Therefore, I find it hard to represent Holloway Ward as a Labour councillor because I was battling with a party system that simply allows white men to have what they want, when they want.” Listing reasons for quitting the party, Ismail pointed to a letter she received in February 2019 inviting her to Labour’s first national women’s conference which, beneath her address, was printed the word: “Somalia.” “What has my birthplace got to do with this invite? I was shocked,” said Ismail. Ismail also claimed she was initially blocked out of the official mayoral Twitter account and alleged Islamophobia among some colleagues which she felt was behind the decision by the council not to organise an event to mark the major Muslim festival of Eid in 2019. Islington Council, however, say the event was cancelled by community representatives due to organisational challenges and issues with public liability insurance Ismail also alleged that a Labour colleague shouted at her for tarnishing the reputation of the area after she highlighted to the media the issue of knife crime and was reduced to tears after being told to be quiet during a Labour group meeting. “It felt like me as a BME woman that I had no voice. In the end I thought what’s the point?” she said. A Labour Party Spokesperson said: “Cllr Ismail’s decision to resign is disappointing especially coming so soon after her term as Mayor of Islington, having served the borough admirably through an incredibly challenging time. “Islington Labour has a diverse and talented group of councillors serving their community. The Labour Party takes any allegations of discrimination received extremely seriously, which are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures.”"
2020-10-11T06:15:04Z,politics,Politics,Lindsay Hoyle: a palace down south? I’d rather be in Chorley market,"Lindsay Hoyle is in high spirits as he reels off a list of challenges that the past 12 months have thrown his way, since he became Speaker of the House of Commons last November. “No sooner had I been elected than we went into a general election,” he says. “Then in the election I decided to develop Type 1 diabetes. “Then it was Brexit. Then Brexit was whisked off platform one, and along came Covid.” After his elevation and following almost 10 years as a deputy in the Commons chair, Hoyle, the MP for Chorley, moved into the Speaker’s large, splendid residence in parliament. It was all fine decor, huge rooms and wonderful paintings, which might sound like a perk. In reality, he suggests, it has proved to be anything but. “It would be nice if that was the case,” he says in his rich Lancastrian accent, hooting with laughter. “I have had to bring a cat because of all the mice. So Patrick comes with me. At the moment there are works on fire safety, and asbestos is being removed, so it is not the best time to be around to be quite honest.
“And we had a water leak with major water damage that’s bought the ceiling down [in the residence above the state rooms].” “So,” he points out to those who might think he is living a pampered life down south like royalty: “I wouldn’t get too carried away!”
As he approaches his first anniversary in the job, Hoyle is already stamping his style on the Commons. Where his predecessor, John Bercow, became a global celebrity for crying “Orderrrrr Orderrrrrrrr” during interminable Brexit debates, Hoyle is establishing his own identity defending the rights of backbench MPs and their constituents in the uniquely uncertain and confusing conditions created by the pandemic. Week after week he tells ministers in Boris Johnson’s government that the way they treat parliament, by leaking statements to the media and failing to answer MPs’ questions, is “simply unacceptable” and that he will not put up with it any longer. If they continue to hold parliament in contempt he will drag them before the house to answer urgent questions day after day until they comply. The greatest achievement of his time in charge so far has been simply keeping parliament working during a pandemic, he says. “We have had 700 years of how we did business in this house and we turned it over in 24 hours.
“The fact that we could have people who voted online, the fact that we could have people who asked questions online. Who would have thought that after 700 years we could do it? I am so proud of the staff in this house.” But after his team kept democracy open, the government failed to honour its side of the constitutional bargain by respecting parliament’s place in the system. “What we did see was a new style of government,” Hoyle says, making clear he thinks there was far too much concentration of decision-making on Downing Street. “The house matters to me. I represent the house. It is about ensuring the house has got somebody who will stand up for members. In the end whatever the government might think, including the prime minister, we are all MPs, there to represent our constituencies. We are there to pose the questions to government. We have got to hold them to account and ministerial statements were bypassing the house. They were using Downing Street. “We have not got a presidential system. We have a prime minister and that prime minister is answerable to the House of Commons, and the same with the secretary of state for health.” Recently, breaking with tradition, Hoyle has appeared on television news programmes to make his points, in his role, as he puts it, as “the referee” of the House of Commons, flashing the equivalent of yellow and red cards at ministers for foul play. A few weeks ago he ordered health secretary Matt Hancock to apologise to the Commons, saying he would not tolerate MPs being treated with such disdain over the release of key information about the pandemic. Asked how he sees himself in comparison with Bercow, he says they are like chalk and cheese. Bercow told Hoyle to call him if he ever needed advice, but Hoyle hasn’t, suggesting they were never exactly close. “I am the 158th Speaker, and the previous 157 were all different. I am a big cricket fan and a rugby league fan and John was a tennis fan. He was an Arsenal fan, I am a Bolton fan. We are always going to have differences, the north versus the south. It is not about how John Bercow did it, it is about how I do it, how I take this job forward.” Before new announcements this week about further tightening of lockdown measures, Hoyle is doubtful that parliament will be told first. “I have never seen so much speculation about lockdowns, who is going to be affected, how it is going to affect them, not least in my area of Lancashire.” As for prime minister’s questions, he recognises that it is all “theatre” but it is important theatre nonetheless. “It is very important to MPs,” even if the prime minister often doesn’t give clear answers. “They get up there to speak for their constituents. It works for them.” For all the difficulties, he has loved his first year. It has been an enormous privilege and “enormous fun”. That said, the new Mr Speaker likes nothing more than fleeing back up to Lancashire at weekends – getting away from Westminster and his supposedly palatial residence. “Lancashire is where I spend my weekends. I love going home. My home is Chorley, my friends are in Chorley, my family. There is no better experience to get your feet back on the ground than walking round Chorley market talking to real people about real things. “My weekends are not spent in some palace. They are spent in Chorley – and that matters to me.”"
2020-10-10T22:12:19Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for investigation over funding for Robert Jenrick's constituency,"Labour has demanded a Cabinet Office investigation into the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, over how government funding was allocated to his Newark constituency. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, has written to the head of the civil service requesting the investigation into Jenrick and his involvement in the multibillion-pound Towns Fund. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government allocated the investment to Newark, along with 99 other towns, as part of its drive at “levelling up” deprived areas with £3.6bn in funds. Newark is reportedly the 270th most deprived area in the country and thus not as poor as many other towns in the UK. The call for an investigation follows a report in the Times that 32 towns on the list fell outside the 300 worst-off in England, according to the Office for National Statistics. Jenrick, a former corporate lawyer and director at auction house Christie’s, and Jake Berry, his junior minister, were allegedly responsible for choosing 61 of the towns to receive funding. They also chose Darwen, a town in Berry’s constituency. Reed has requested an investigation into how Newark was chosen for inclusion in the Towns Fund and whether officials advised against it. Reed also wants to know if Tory-held seats in comparatively affluent towns were prioritised under the initiative, which before the last general election, ministers said was aimed at levelling up so-called left-behind towns. Earlier this year, Jenrick withstood calls for his resignation after he ensured a controversial housing development was agreed before a new levy was introduced which would have cost millions to its backer, multimillionaire Conservative party donor Richard Desmond. Documents released showed Desmond, in personal text messages, urged Jenrick to approve his Westferry Printworks development in east London before the community infrastructure levy was introduced. It is believed that this would have saved Desmond £50m. “We don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Desmond told the minister. Jenrick faced accusations of “cash for favours” after it emerged that Desmond had given the Conservatives £12,000 two weeks after the scheme for 1,500 homes was approved, and that Jenrick had sat next to him and viewed a video about the development at a fundraising event. Jenrick originally approved the development plan in January, overruling Tower Hamlets council and a planning inspector. In the ensuing scandal, a Tory minister suggested voters could consider attending Conservative fundraising events if they wanted to raise planning issues with MPs. “Hot on the heels of the Westferry scandal, Robert Jenrick yet again has serious questions to answer about allegations that he used the Towns Fund to channel public money to help Conservative party candidates ahead of the general election,” Reed said. “Mr Jenrick has made an unfortunate habit of overruling officials’ advice to get his own way, just as he did during the Westferry cash-for-favours scandal. Now he has done the same with this blatant example of pork-barrel politics, with public money making its way to help his own re-election campaign. “Misuse of public funds is a very serious abuse of public trust. Robert Jenrick must come to the House urgently to make a statement on how this money was awarded and submit himself to a full Cabinet Office investigation.” Jenrick insisted he was not part of the decision-making process regarding Newark as funding for the town was determined by another minister. A spokesman for Jenrick said: “This reporting is incorrect as the secretary of state did not select his constituency for Towns Fund money. “To suggest otherwise is misleading, and another minister in the department is responsible for decisions around Newark’s Towns Fund bid, as is normal practice. As made clear in the National Audit Office report, the process was comprehensive, robust and fair – and the Towns Fund will help level up the country. “Delivering the Towns Fund was a manifesto commitment that the Labour party opposed and offered no alternative to, so it was not surprising that Conservative candidates mentioned it during their campaigns. “Conservatives in government are investing in our towns to improve the life chances of local people, Labour are resorting to baseless political point-scoring.” A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “These claims are wrong as the secretary of state did not select Newark for funding. This decision was taken by another minister based on a robust and objective process. That process is set out in the NAO’s detailed report.”"
2020-10-10T21:00:47Z,politics,Politics,Labour and Tories neck and neck in polls after opposition's lead evaporates,"Labour and the Conservatives are neck-and-neck again and the public is also split over who they prefer as prime minister, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. Both main parties recorded 40% support, with Labour’s 3-point lead from a fortnight ago evaporating. Labour was down 2 points, with the Tories up 1 point. It comes at the end of a disrupted conference season, where all parties held virtual events. On the question of who voters prefer as prime minister, 32% opted for Boris Johnson and 33% backed Keir Starmer. The chancellor Rishi Sunak was the only senior minister to emerge with a net positive rating over his handling of the Covid crisis – 45% approve of how he has responded, with 23% disapproving. Almost two-fifths (37%) think he has acted competently and 31% think he has made the right decisions. Meanwhile, 42% think Johnson is out of his depth handling coronavirus, with 39% stating he has acted incompetently and 39% saying he has made “wrong decisions”. Overall, 31% approve of the way the prime minister has handled the crisis while 47% disapprove. The polling shows that the public still supports the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Seven in 10 (72%) back working from home wherever possible and 71% agree that face masks should be compulsory for bar staff and non-seated customers, shop workers and waiters. However, there has been a drop in support for the 10pm closure of pubs, bars and restaurants. A fortnight ago, 58% supported the measure while 16% opposed. This week, 44% supported this measure while 27% opposed it. Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said: “The consistent pattern of the Covid period has been that the government’s economic responses have been seen as far more successful than more medical responses such as management of test and trace or PPE for NHS workers. That has fed into public perceptions of key members of the cabinet with Rishi Sunak being the only cabinet minister with a net positive rating.” Opinium surveyed 2,001 people online, on 8-9 October."
2020-10-10T18:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers claim knife attack at law firm was inspired by Priti Patel's rhetoric,"Britain’s top lawyers have written to Priti Patel to express their concern after a knifeman threatened to kill an immigration solicitor last month in an attack colleagues say was directly motivated by comments made by the home secretary. On 7 September a man with a large knife entered a London law firm and launched a “violent, racist attack” that injured a staff member before the assailant was overwhelmed. A confederate flag and far-right literature were allegedly found in a bag he was carrying. According to documents about the incident, police described the knife as a “weapon designed to cause serious harm”. Days before, on 3 September, Patel dismayed the legal profession by claiming “activist lawyers” were frustrating the removal of migrants. It was Patel’s remarks which the law firm – not being named for security reasons – believe inspired the incident. “Responsibility and accountability for this attack, in the eyes of this firm, lies squarely at the feet of Priti Patel,” say documents containing witness statements and details of the attack. The day after the incident, the firm wrote to the Law Society asking it to raise the issue with Patel, government lawyers, the lord chancellor and the Ministry of Justice to “ensure that public attacks on the legal profession are prevented from this point forth”. The letter said: “It must be ensured that no further lives are endangered as a result of her untruthful and deliberately inflammatory rhetoric. Put simply, this must stop now, before innocent lives are taken and other irreparable damage is done to those who work in this field.” It added: “This must involve all previous statements made by Priti Patel being publicly retracted, and an apology or acknowledgment that such action to date has been inappropriate. Urgent reassurance is required from the government that this will not be repeated. The position as it stands is untenable, dangerous, and cannot be allowed to persist.” On Saturday the Law Society confirmed it sent correspondence last month on the attack to the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. Patel appears not only to have ignored its concerns but doubled down on her attacks against immigration lawyers. Last Sunday, almost a month after the knife attack, Patel used her speech at the Conservative party conference to target “do-gooders” and “lefty lawyers,” claiming those who represented asylum seekers were “defending the indefensible”. Two days later, in his keynote speech, Boris Johnson went even further, claiming the entire criminal justice system was “being hamstrung by lefty human rights lawyers”. It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the PM was aware of the knife attack.
Last night the body representing the legal profession reminded the government that inflammatory rhetoric had consequences. The Law Society revealed it had heard from other law firms which had received increased “levels of abuse, threats and hostility” in response to the intervention of the home secretary and PM. It also emerged that some immigration law firms have been forced to hire security guards and introduce protective measures for staff. One, whose anonymity was granted for safety reasons, said: “We’re not being cowed but we’re taking precautions and have upped security because we have received threats. “We’ve had to be more vigilant and brought in security in our offices and we’ve had to report certain social media posts and inform the police who have been very supportive.” The documents on last month’s attack reveal that a receptionist at the firm was “assaulted and wounded” and “a number of our staff members are fortunate to be alive [and] not to have suffered serious injury.” The documents add: “The attack was intended to take the life of a member of the Law Society.” A 28-year-old man has been charged with possession of, and making threats with, a bladed article in a public place; racially aggravated public disorder; assault; and making threats to kill in connection with the incident. Yesterday the Law Society of England and Wales warned that it was already witnessing the consequences of comments made by the prime minister and home secretary. President Simon Davis said: “We are extremely concerned about the safety of solicitors and barristers in the current climate, firms that deal in emotive issues such as immigration are being targeted. “We are monitoring the situation closely and urge both government and media to be mindful of the rhetoric they employ. The role of solicitors is to apply and uphold the laws set down by parliament and they have a right to do so on behalf of their clients without intimidation.” Pressure on Johnson intensified on Saturday when the chair of the Bar Council, Amanda Pinto QC, wrote to the prime minister urging him to withdraw his comments. She said: “I deplore your remarks at the Conservative party conference which wrongly seek to politicise and attack lawyers for simply doing their job in the public interest.” The letter, seen by the Observer and also sent to Patel, attorney general Suella Braverman and justice secretary Robert Buckland adds: “I urge you to withdraw your comments and to reassure thousands of key workers – including lawyers employed by your own government – that they are not being attacked by their prime minister for their important contribution to the justice system.” On Friday even the Home Office official Twitter account continued to take aim at immigration lawyers, conflating foreign nationals with asylum seekers and complaining that attempts to deport the latter were “frustrated by legal claims”."
2020-10-10T16:10:56Z,politics,Politics,Johnson and Macron hold talks on coronavirus and Brexit,"Boris Johnson has held Brexit telephone talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the clock ticks down to the deadline for a deal. The two leaders spoke on Saturday with seemingly just days remaining for an agreement on a future trade deal to be reached, after UK and EU negotiating teams met on Friday for what sources said was a positive meeting. With the negotiators, led by UK’s David Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier, due to reengage on Monday, No 10 said the prime minister “set out the latest state of play in the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU”. The No 10 spokesperson added: “[Johnson] confirmed the UK’s commitment to exploring every avenue to reach an agreement. He underlined that a deal was better for both sides, but also that the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found. “The prime minister emphasised that progress must be made in the coming days to bridge the significant gaps, notably in the areas of fisheries and the level playing field, through the process of intensive talks between chief negotiators agreed with the president of the European commission. The leaders agreed to keep in touch on the issue.” Johnson has suggested publicly that the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday is his deadline for a deal. He said in September that failure to reach an agreement would mean it was time to “accept that and move on”. Frost reiterated the comments during a parliamentary hearing this week, but a senior EU diplomat said this was not Brussels’s understanding following private discussions. “I don’t detect any readiness on the British side to suspend the negotiations,” the source told the Guardian on Friday. “This is going to continue. It is not a deadline.” The talks are expected to go right up to Thursday afternoon when the 27 heads of state and government sit down. “We need to get a little bit more from the UK side, or Michel Barnier needs to, before he is ready to use, as he says, the ‘submarine’ or the ‘tunnel’,” the senior EU diplomat said. Both sides have said an agreement needs to be struck in October to ensure sufficient time for ratification. Johnson and Macron also discussed the coronavirus crisis in their bilateral discussions."
2020-10-10T13:22:16Z,politics,Politics,"Government 'bobbing all over the place' in Covid response, says Starmer","Keir Starmer has accused the government of “bobbing all over the place” in the face of the coronavirus crisis and making more than a dozen significant U-turns. Stepping up his personal criticism of the prime minister, the Labour leader claimed Boris Johnson has presided over “serial incompetence” while dealing with the pandemic. “At the moment, among my concerns is that the government hasn’t really got any anchors,” Starmer told a Co-operative party virtual conference. “It’s bobbing all over the place.” He said: “I think it is 13 or 14 U-turns now. If it was one or two, I think many people across the country, if the government made a mistake and then U-turned, would say: ‘Well, fair enough, we are dealing with a pandemic.’
“But when you have 12, 13, or 14 U-turns the only thing that can be read into that is serial incompetence.” With new restrictions expected to be imposed in parts of England next week, Starmer was critical of the business aid package unveiled by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Friday. “The scheme that was unveiled yesterday goes a bit further, but there are still gaps in it,” he said. “I think, though, that the government has lost sight of the guiding principle, and the guiding principle should be that restrictions are always accompanied by appropriate economic support. “If that had been the principle throughout, we wouldn’t be in the mess that we are in at the moment.” On the test-and-trace system, Starmer suggested Johnson had been spouting rhetoric rather than ensuring it worked properly. “Test, trace and isolate is critical,” he said. “The prime minister said we would have a world-beating system – we didn’t need that, we just need an effective one that works. ‘World-beating’ is just Johnson rhetoric. “Getting a test quickly, getting the result quickly and then reaching the contacts so that self-isolation works – that’s not working properly, which means that thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation. So, that bit needs to be fixed.” Last weekend, Starmer told the Observer that the prime minister was governing “in hindsight”. He said: “He charges forward, he has a car crash, looks in the rear-view mirror and says: ‘What’s that all about?’” Johnson had faced questions over ordering people back to work and the eat out to help out Scheme – widely considered to have contributed to the rise in infections."
2020-10-09T16:46:49Z,politics,Politics,EU and UK teams pin hopes on 'tunnel' talks to deliver Brexit deal,"British and EU Brexit negotiators have renewed belief that the bloc’s leaders will be able to usher in an intense and decisive “tunnel” negotiation for the last weeks of October when they meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. A meeting between the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, in London on Friday morning was said by diplomatic sources to have been positive, with the negotiating teams now due to reengage on Monday. “There is media reports of the summit being a stocktake – there should be more ambition than that,” said one EU source. The prime minister has publicly suggested that the EU summit in Brussels is his deadline for a deal. He said in September that without agreement it would be time to “accept and move on”. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, reiterated the comments during a parliamentary hearing this week, but a senior EU diplomat said this was not Brussels’ understanding following private discussions. “I don’t detect any readiness on the British side to suspend the negotiations,” the source said. “This is going to continue. It is not a deadline.”
Downing Street’s repeated public threats reflect the hope that the summit will be a springboard to a period of so-called “tunnel” negotiations in which the two teams negotiate without consulting outside political stakeholders or briefing the media on possible compromises. The talks are expected to go right up to Thursday afternoon when the 27 heads of state and government sit down. “We need to get a little bit more from the UK side, or Michel Barnier needs to, before he is ready to use, as he says, the ‘submarine’ or the ‘tunnel’,” a senior EU diplomat said. In an analysis that the EU side does not share, Frost had suggested this week that significant progress was being made on the issue of state aid, and that fisheries were the biggest stumbling block to an agreement that could be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of December. Downing Street is pushing for a radical change in the share of catches in British waters, but the EU has so far insisted it will not accept anything less than the status quo. Eight member states – Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden – have a particular interest and are yet to offer Barnier any flexibility. Barnier has privately said that the key will be how the French president, Emmanuel Macron, reacts in the coming weeks to Downing Street’s increasingly forthright rhetoric about the need for the EU to budge on its position or risk scuppering a deal.
“What I see now is that the UK is, you know, trying to say ‘OK you know this is really valuable’. But they see it as a lever to gain market access to the European Union, I think that’s the game that we’re seeing right now,” said a senior diplomat. “For France, this is something they look at, and maybe it’s even going to be the number one issue in the EU UK negotiating talks [for France].” Barnier has informed the 27 member states that Brexit will necessarily mean a reduced level of catches for them in British waters in an attempt to persuade the bloc to present a more realistic negotiating position. The loss of any revenues currently earned by the EU’s fishing fleet in British waters would be relatively small compared with the wider trade deal, but it risks creating internal division as those who lose out seek to be compensated with extra catches elsewhere in European waters. “It’s an issue that is of concern to eight member states, and for at least five or so of them it is a quite big political issue,” said a senior diplomat. “I mean, even if we’re talking about an annual volume over €650m [£590m], in fact it’s not that much, but politically it is.”"

2020-10-09T14:01:03Z,politics,Politics,Conference season: the winners and losers as party politics goes virtual,"Party conference season in 2020 may have meant online debates and live-streamed speeches instead of karaoke and warm white wine – but politics must go on, and it was still possible to discern a few winners and losers from the past three weeks. Up: Keir Starmer: the Labour leader used a series of interviews, and his set-piece conference speech – delivered from an arts centre in Doncaster – to press home his chosen themes of patriotism and Labour values: “Decency, fairness, opportunity, compassion and security.” There was little solid policy; but he had a few memorable lines, including putting voters on notice that Labour’s 2024 general election manifesto will “sound like the future arriving”, and stressing his determination to win. He continues to face a revolt from the disgruntled leftwing of the parliamentary party, not least his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, whose presence might have been much more noisily felt if members had been gathered in Liverpool, instead of around their laptops. And there is a growing clamour for him to put some policy flesh on the bones of his electoral strategy. But his team were pleased that Starmer was not completely crowded out of the headlines by the latest set of Covid curbs, announced on the same day as his speech. Douglas Ross: The Conservatives’ 37-year-old new leader in Scotland has only been an MP since 2017, but his conference speech to the Tories’ virtual event on Saturday cemented his reputation as one to watch. His charismatic predecessor Ruth Davidson never shied away from telling her party home truths about how it is perceived north of the border – and Ross stuck with that tradition. He delivered a stark warning to party members and colleagues at Westminster that their own “defeatism and disinterest” could allow Scotland to break away, which would, he said, “wash out the union flag”. The SNP’s conference is yet to come, but Nicola Sturgeon may well pick up on some of Ross’s candid admissions about his own party’s neglect of Scotland. Amanda Milling: The Conservative co-chair, who sits in Boris Johnson’s cabinet, spent much of the past few months on a low-key tour of many of the constituencies the Tories gained in 2019, meeting the new intake and trying to work out what they need to do to hold onto their seats. Last week she was everywhere, welcoming party members to the virtual conference with a cheery “hi everyone” and encouraging them to enjoy conference events with chilled white wine from their own fridge. Milling announced that the party will set up a new HQ in Leeds, as a signal of its determination to hold on to the “red wall” seats. Asked by House magazine what new MPs should do to win next time around, she said, “work really, really hard”. Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley: In polling terms, the Green party is not currently in such a happy place, bumping along at 5% or below. But in another way, they are arguably as influential as ever, with long-standing party policies including reshaping the economy on sustainable grounds, and a universal basic income, being seriously discussed by the bigger parties – and in the case of the latter, adopted by the Lib Dems. The Greens are phlegmatic about such imitation, but confident their time could be coming. The main conference speech by the party’s popular (and newly re-elected) co-leaders, Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley, explained how the government response to coronavirus showed that “a different world might be possible”. They also believe that with Keir Starmer taking Labour more to the centre, the space to explain such ideas is their own. Down: Boris Johnson: The build-up to conference season could hardly have been worse for the prime minister, with the second wave of the pandemic crashing over the UK, just as his own troops are becoming increasingly fretful about swinging restrictions on daily life. His big, set-piece speech on Wednesday was sprinkled with classic Johnson optimism, promising a “new Jerusalem” and a “green industrial revolution” – and attacking rumours that Covid-19 had robbed him of his “mojo”. But his policy promises, including 95% loan-to-value mortgages, and a solution to the funding crisis in care homes, came with few details, and his spokesperson was unable to fill in any more afterwards, leaving the lingering sense that it had been much more rhetoric than substance, and would be quickly forgotten. Everyone’s web connection: The Conservatives’ efforts at an online conference were much more ambitious than Labour’s, featuring a virtual conference centre complete with breakout lounges and merchandise stalls selling “Builders tea” mugs to match Johnson’s “Build, build, build” slogan. But the ambition was not always matched by the technology, and journalists and members hoping to watch Saturday’s sessions spent much of the day struggling to log in. For half an hour, the connection appeared to drop completely. Hanging in there: The Liberal Democrats: Conferences can always be very different year-by-year, but for the Lib Dems the contrast was quite something. In autumn 2019 the excited talk among delegates was winning 80 or 100 seats in the general election. Fast forward 12 months and they have just 11 MPs, and are searching for a new focus after Brexit. If this year’s conference was one of transition, it was at least smooth, albeit with the occasional brutal policy arguments the delegates relish – this time taken online. Ed Davey won the summer’s leadership election convincingly, and used his speech to present himself as the voice of carers. On Europe, a new policy emerged – EU membership is off the table for now, but not ever. And as Lib Dem MPs like to say, picking themselves up after disastrous election results is not exactly a new experience."
2020-10-09T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,Could being the face of Boris Johnson be the worst job in politics?,"Westminster insiders on both sides of the aisle were in rare unanimity on Thursday: Allegra Stratton is taking on one of the toughest roles in government. “Awful job,” said one sympathetic Labour adviser. The 39-year-old former broadcaster, currently an adviser to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will soon be formally announced as the face of Downing Street’s new televised daily press briefings, becoming a high-profile spokeswoman for the prime minister. Her appointment follows months of speculation about who would take on the White House-style briefings after Downing Street announced the role in July. Discussing the creation of the televised briefings, Johnson said: “We do think that people want direct engagement and want stuff from us and so we’re going to have a go at that … I will pop up from time to time, I have no doubt.” A senior Conservative claimed Johnson had personally asked Stratton more than once to become the public face of his embattled government before she finally accepted. If Stratton did hesitate, it would be understandable. The new role will involve explaining the government’s every move, as it battles to get to grips with an unprecedented public health emergency. When the public think of spin doctors, foul-mouthed Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It probably comes to mind: but Peter Capaldi’s lovably loathsome character could exercise the dark arts of political communication behind closed doors. Stratton will be on public display, as political journalists quiz her about ministers’ latest missteps and manoeuvres. And she arrives at a moment when the government is besieged by restive backbenchers sceptical about Covid restrictions, and facing fierce criticism over the way they are being communicated. In the past 10 days alone, Johnson “misspoke” about restrictions in the north-east (after junior minister Gillian Keegan also couldn’t say what the rules were) and suffered a car-crash interview with ITV’s Hannah Miller in which he couldn’t say if Oldham faced tighter rules than the rest of Greater Manchester. In the lobby briefing after Johnson’s bombastic “new Jerusalem” party conference speech on Tuesday, his spokesman faced a rough ride as every question from journalists seeking more detail about policies scattered throughout the speech – social care funding, 95% loan-to-value mortgages, digital IDs – were met with “you have the prime minister’s words”. And on Thursday, leaked details of tougher curbs expected to be brought in across much of the north of England next week infuriated local leaders, who had not yet been properly consulted. There are currently two daily lobby briefings for political journalists, which are on the record but take place behind closed doors. One of these will be replaced by the new televised briefing. Daily lobby briefings have been on the record – directly quotable by journalists – since Tony Blair’s director of communications Alistair Campbell sought to make them more accessible. But they have continued to be held behind closed doors – most recently in 9 Downing Street, before coronavirus forced them to become virtual. The briefings are currently taken by Johnson’s official spokesman, James Slack, the former Daily Mail political editor who did the same job for Theresa May. He is expected to be promoted to a more strategic role. Stratton’s post is part of a shake-up masterminded by Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain, who is increasingly centralising government communications in Downing Street, and intends to significantly reduce the number of civil servants dealing with the press. Cain is having a large room in 9 Downing Street fitted out as a new broadcast studio for the briefings. Downing Street hopes the public will warm to Stratton, and footage from the briefings will pop up in evening news bulletins, as clips from the daily coronavirus press conferences regularly did during lockdown. Stratton is a Cambridge University graduate whose move to the chancellor’s director of strategic communications role in April followed a successful career in journalism. She started out as a producer at the BBC, followed by a stint as a political correspondent at the Guardian. In 2012, she rejoined the BBC when she became Newsnight’s political editor. She was appointed national editor at ITV News in late 2015 and also co-presented ITV’s Peston on Sunday. In a 2016 interview with the Telegraph, Stratton spoke about how she refused to take part in the infamous 2012 Newsnight broadcast that wrongly linked former Conservative party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, to false historical allegations of child sexual abuse. “I was jogging, on my day off, when my editor called me on my mobile and asked me to come in and do a two-way in the studio,” Stratton recalled. “I thought about it a lot, but I was unconvinced by the story and, having raised my concerns, I decided not to take part. I was proved right, but I hesitate to say as much because that story ruined my editor’s career.” In 2013, Stratton told the Evening Standard that her heroes were 19th-century author George Eliot, ex-BBC journalist Stephanie Flanders and comedian, actor and writer Tina Fey. Asked if she had ever had a run-in with the police, she told the newspaper: “Yes, but I was with them not against them. It was in the aftermath of the riots and some chippy kids were trying to start a fight with the police and I stepped in to defend them.” She also cited her favourite discovery as the cupboard in the House of Commons crypt where suffragette Emily Davison hid on the night of the 1911 census so she could say that her address was “the House of Commons”. Stratton married James Forsyth, the political editor of the Spectator magazine, which the prime minister used to edit, in 2011 at a ceremony where Sunak was the best man."
2020-10-08T19:00:59Z,politics,Politics,"Planned new Covid rules for north of England are not enough, say scientists","Scientists advising the UK government believe the planned new Covid restrictions do not go far enough and that “fringe” anti-lockdown epidemiologists are gaining too much attention, the Guardian has learned. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) believe that a potential shutdown of pubs and restaurants in the north and Midlands, which is expected next week after delays that one MP has called “reckless”, are unlikely to bring cases down to a more manageable level. Speaking anonymously, some of the experts maintained that a circuit breaker-style intervention of the type being imposed in Scotland from Friday should have been enacted in England two or three weeks ago when such a move was discussed with ministers. This would have involved a two-week shutdown for hospitality venues and other parts of society to drive down cases and hospital admissions. With the UK recording more than 17,500 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, up almost 25% on the day before, and leaders in northern England in open revolt over imminent lockdown plans, some scientists believe more should have been done already. One senior scientist said the UK was at a critical point and that deeper measures were needed to bring the resurgence under control. Another epidemiologist, Prof John Edmunds, who sits on Sage, said a circuit breaker was needed to prevent the health service from becoming overwhelmed. “The epidemic is increasing and widely,” Edmunds said. “It is, of course, more severe in the north and north-west but it is increasing everywhere and so we have to take action unless we want to face really large numbers of hospitalisations in the quite near term and, unfortunately, large numbers of deaths. This is still a killer virus, despite improvements in treatment.” There is also worry within Sage about the influence of a relatively small number of public health academics who oppose new lockdown moves, with some members understood to be annoyed at the level of coverage they have received. This week thousands of advocates for the Great Barrington declaration urged governments in the UK, US and elsewhere to abandon strategies to suppress the virus and instead let the infection spread among the healthy while protecting the vulnerable. It is unclear how the vulnerable would be identified and protected, and whether allowing the epidemic to grow unchecked in healthy people would lead to the kind of so-called herd immunity that its authors hope would protect everyone. “I can’t see where the evidence is to back it up,” the senior scientist said. Concern about the government’s ability to rein in the spread of coronavirus in coming weeks has been prompted in part by uncertainty over what new measures will be introduced and when. The Guardian understands that the majority of northern England, from Barrow in Cumbria to Merseyside, Greater Manchester, much of Lancashire and Yorkshire and most of the north-east, as well as Nottinghamshire in the Midlands, expects to be under Covid restrictions as part of a new three-tier alert system whose announcement was originally expected this week. On Thursday a government source said the plan was now to make the announcement on Monday, with the measures coming into force on Wednesday. MPs from the affected areas were summoned for a video briefing on Thursday with the health minister Edward Argar and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England. The briefing warned that the number of Covid patients in intensive care in the north of England would surpass the April peak if infections continued rising at the current rate. MPs were also shown early Public Health England research suggesting that bars, pubs and restaurants account for 41% of cases in which two or more under-30s had visited the same venue in the week before testing positive. This fell to a quarter of infections across all age groups. One of the MPs later expressed their frustration. “We got some interesting data but questions about policy were banned,” said Lilian Greenwood, the Labour member for Nottingham South. On Thursday Nottingham had the UK’s highest Covid infection rate, at 689 cases per 100,000 people. “I asked how the science supported delaying extra restrictions in Nottingham until next Wednesday, especially now they’ve been announced to the media so everyone knows this is their last weekend to meet friends and family indoors. “Unsurprisingly, I got a hopeless answer. A load of waffle and excuses about ‘there are lots of things to take into consideration’, ‘regulations take time’ and ‘that’s a decision for ministers’ – the ones who won’t answer questions. I’m fuming, it’s reckless.” Another complication is an expected package of support for businesses affected by the new restrictions, expected to be announced by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, most likely a day after the measures are announced. Treasury sources said Sunak had drawn up a menu of options over the summer and acknowledged that the job support scheme, which was the centrepiece of his winter economic plan announced a fortnight ago, would not be adequate for areas where an entire sector was being shut down. Allies of Sunak denied he had held up the introduction of new lockdowns, insisting he was keen to give businesses clarity about what new rules they would face."

(See 4.29pm.) The figures were published a few hours after a health minister said hospitals in England were only 10 days away from reaching a critical point if the virus was not contained. (See 11.27am.) Boris Johnson is now expected to announced further restrictions for England shortly, which could see pubs and restaurants in the worst-affected areas facing full or partial closure. The number of coronavirus patients in intensive care in the north of England will surpass the April peak in 22 days if infections continue rising at the current rate, MPs have been warned in a briefing chaired by Chris Whitty and a minister.

2020-10-08T17:17:12Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls Rishi Sunak plan for UK jobs 'throwback to Thatcher era',"Labour has called for stronger action to prevent a winter surge in unemployment after releasing figures that show the UK government is providing less generous wage support to employers than other major European countries. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, accused Rishi Sunak of adopting a “sink or swim” approach as Labour published a report unfavourably comparing the Treasury’s jobs support scheme with what was on offer in Germany, France and the Netherlands. The opposition party said in three of the sectors most at risk of seeing significant job losses in the coming months – hospitality, manufacturing and arts, entertainment and recreation – employers in the UK had much less of an incentive to employ staff part-time. It said employers who wanted to bring two staff back for half the working week instead of keeping one employee on full-time and making the other redundant faced much higher wage costs in the UK than they would in the three eurozone countries. In his winter economic plan last month, the chancellor announced the replacement of the government’s furlough scheme with a jobs support scheme under which an employee who working at least a third of normal hours has their pay topped up by the state and their employer. Labour said that for someone working half-time, the cost to employers across the three sectors was twice as large in the UK as in France and two-thirds higher than in the Netherlands. German employers pay no wage tops for those working part-time.
Sunak has said his £1,000 job retention bonus (JRB) – which is payable for every worker brought back off furlough and kept on the payroll until next January – provides an added incentive for employers to retain staff. However, Labour said that even if the two UK workers qualified for the JRB on top of the job support scheme payment, wage costs remained significantly higher. In manufacturing, the difference in wage costs for a UK business employing two workers on median earnings half-time compared with one full-time was £197 a week, or £159 a week once the JRB was taken into account. That compared with £118 a week in the Netherlands, £83 a week in France and nothing in Germany. Dodds said: “The chancellor should have introduced a job recovery scheme that incentivised employers to keep more staff on. Instead, his JSS makes it more expensive to bring staff back than many other international schemes. “Viable businesses just need support to cope with the restrictions the government has imposed on them. They pinned their hopes on the chancellor to deliver, but he’s forcing them to flip a coin over who stays and who goes. “This wasn’t by accident – it was by design. The chancellor’s sink or swim job support scheme is a throwback to the worst days of Thatcher, and just like in the 1980s people on the lowest incomes will pay the highest price.” The Treasury said total UK support had been higher than France’s and around the same as Germany’s. A spokesperson said: “The JSS is targeted to provide what employers have told us they need – support to keep employees on even whilst they are experiencing lower demand, with greater flexibility. “Our unprecedented and comprehensive package of support has helped millions of businesses and individuals across the UK get through the crisis, and the scheme is just one part of that.”"
2020-10-08T16:53:01Z,politics,Politics,Belgian ambassador throws King Charles II treaty into EU fishing debate,"All is fair in love and cod war. And with the EU’s coastal states under pressure to give way on Britain’s demands for greater fishing catches in its waters post-Brexit, any old argument is worth a try. When the issue of the future access of European fishing fleets was being discussed by EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday the Belgian government’s representative, Willem van de Voorde, made a notable intervention. To the confusion of some, and the delight of others, the ambassador cited a treaty signed some 350 years ago by King Charles II which had granted 50 Flemish fishermen from Bruges “eternal rights” to English fishing waters. It was an important historical footnote illustrating the long relationship between Belgian fishermen and British waters, Van de Voorde suggested. When the Privilegie der Visscherie was given in 1666, Bruges was part of the Southern Netherlands, controlled by Spain. The offer had been Charles’s way of showing gratitude for the hospitality he received when he stayed there during the interregnum that followed the decapitation of his father, King Charles I, and his own restoration to the throne. “I wasn’t quite sure what he was on about but I think he was joking,” said one confused diplomat who had listened to Van de Voorde’s intervention. “But, then, you never know.” While the validity of the Belgian claim is somewhat unlikely, the tensions in Brussels over fishing access for European fleets from 1 January are very real. The UK has demanded a radical increase in fishing catches in its exclusive economic zone as it leaves the EU’s common fisheries policy. Some in Brussels recognise the need to satisfy this demand – it was one of the key arguments made for Brexit during the 2016 referendum – certain coastal countries, including France in particular, are insisting on the status quo. During the same meeting of ambassadors, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, pointed out that EU revenues from fishing in UK waters was around €650m, compared with €150m for British fishing in UK waters. “I think he was suggesting that there was an argument for a change in the balance,” said one EU source. “It is going to be difficult though; no sign of France changing its mind yet.” On Thursday, France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said Paris would not “sell out” its fishing communities to get a deal. After meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Stef Blok, in The Hague, Beaune told reporters: “Our fishermen will not be a bargaining chip for Brexit, they will not have to pay the price for Britain’s choices.” Beaune said a deal was still possible but “not by sacrificing the interests of our fishermen”. “A bad deal would be the worst outcome. And so we are ready for a no-deal scenario, and we will not accept a bad compromise.”"
2020-10-08T15:24:50Z,politics,Politics,Former Tory minister criticised for new job at firm she lobbied for,"Former Tory shipping minister Nusrat Ghani is facing criticism for taking up a £60,000 role at a firm leading a maritime consortium which successfully bid for a £33m grant she had lobbied a fellow minister for while she was serving in government. The Belfast Maritime Consortium, led by Artemis Technologies, won the multi-million pound UK government innovation grant in May to develop zero-emission ferries in Belfast, pledging to “revolutionise the future of maritime transport”. Now the Guardian can reveal that while serving as a transport minister in September 2019, Ghani wrote a letter to then business minister, Chris Skidmore, in support of the consortium’s bid for the funding. Ghani also visited Artemis Technologies’ facility in January 2019 and met its CEO, double Olympic champion sailor Iain Percy. The £33m comes via the UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) Strength in Places Fund, aimed at boosting local economic growth. UKRI is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Ghani will serve as non-executive chairman of the Belfast Consortium Supervisory Board at Artemis Technologies Ltd for a year from 4 September 2020, receiving £60,000 for seven hours of work per month, according to the latest register of MPs’ financial interests. The board is responsible for the oversight of the newly established 13-partner consortium led by Artemis. It means she will earn the equivalent of more than £700 an hour for the job, on top of her MP’s salary of nearly £82,000. Labour’s shadow maritime minister, Mike Kane, said: “This again shows the revolving door between ex-ministers and private firms. This can’t be right. The maritime industry like so many others is desperate for government action to protect jobs and livelihoods in the face of wholesale redundancies. The timing of this just won’t sit well for ordinary people when as recently as last week over 100 jobs at P&O alone were lost.” Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Sarah Olney, added: “With a role like this, the public deserve to know that MPs are on the side of public interest and not the pockets of private firms. To allow a conflict of interest would be an outrage.” It comes after it emerged last month that the former transport secretary Chris Grayling had been given a £100,000 job advising the owner of some of the UK’s top ports. Ghani, who served as transport minister for just over two years until February 2020, stated in the register that she consulted the independent advisory committee on business appointments, a watchdog which oversees public appointments. A letter sent to Ghani in August by the committee’s chair, Lord Pickles, outlining the watchdog’s consideration, states: “You stated that 18 months ago whilst on a regional tour of the area you visited the company offices but that you did not have any other contact whilst you were in office. You had no access to commercially sensitive information about Artemis’s competitors nor had engaged in any official dealings with these competitors. “Your former department, DfT [Department For Transport], was contacted about this application. It confirmed the above details in your application. It added however that you had written a letter to then minister of state for universities, science, research and innovation (Chris Skidmore) at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in support of a bid for funding the Belfast Consortium made to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), in September 2019 whilst still in office.” The letter added: “BEIS confirmed that your letter of support was not included in the bid application to UKRI. BEIS further confirmed Mr Skidmore did not consider the submissions for the second stage funding (the £33m), as he had left office. This was therefore approved by the new science minister. BEIS said that as your letter was not presented to the SIPF assessment panel it ‘would not have had a bearing on the decision-making process’.” Pickles’s letter further explained that the DfT had “no concerns under the rules” in relation to Ghani taking up the appointment, that it supported the bid independently of her letter and that it was not unusual for a minister to write such letters. Pickles stated that the committee advised that the role be subject to conditions, including that Ghani should not draw on “any privileged information available to you from your time in ministerial office”, or for two years from her last day as minister become personally involved in lobbying the UK government on behalf of Artemis Technologies or the Belfast Consortium. Ghani did not provide a comment. A spokesperson for Artemis Technologies said: “We engage with a range of stakeholders, including politicians, on an ongoing basis as we seek to raise the profile of the Belfast Maritime Consortium project that is set to lead a global revolution in water transport, producing zero-emissions foiling ferries that will reinvigorate the maritime sector and create thousands of new jobs in the process. “We are proud to welcome Ms Nus Ghani to the supervisory board of the Belfast Maritime Consortium, for which she will provide critical insight into understanding the complexities of effective maritime transport worldwide.” UKRI said: “The decision taken to fund Artemis Technologies Ltd under UK Research and Innovation’s flagship Strength in Places Fund was taken by an independent panel without ministerial intervention. The independent panel made a formal funding recommendation to both UK Research and Innovation and BEIS; this recommendation was accepted in full.”"
2020-10-08T14:30:53Z,politics,Politics,"Ably led by Honest Bob Jenrick, the government plumbs new depths | John Crace","One common definition of insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting a different result. It also appears to be a guiding principle behind government policy that Boris Johnson is testing to destruction. Right now it’s hard to think of anything the government is managing to do with even a basic level of competency. Other countries appear to be able to run an efficient test-and-trace system. The UK, not so much. Scarcely a day goes by without some cock-up at a private laboratory. This week it was revealed that 16,000 positive results were omitted from the national statistics because of an out-of-date spreadsheet. And just this morning, it was announced that the test-and-trace service had recorded its worst proportion of contacts it has managed to trace. For weeks if not months now, mayors and council leaders from cities in the north and the Midlands that are under local lockdown have been begging the government to consult them before taking any further action in their communities. But on the very day when it was revealed that the rate of infection had risen significantly in 19 of the 20 regions under lockdown restrictions, the government chose to brief the national media that further measures would be introduced next week without even bothering to tell the people in charge of running those areas. Nor giving them a whisper of what financial support, if any, would be on offer for those businesses affected. Understandably almost every mayor and council leader, with the exception of Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands and close ally of Boris, has gone ballistic. While Street was using his Twitter account to extol the virtues of both walking to school and its “Gateway Construction” scheme, the Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham was in near meltdown. He tweeted: “No discussion. No consultation. Millions of lives affected by Whitehall diktat. It is proving impossible to deal with this government.” Burnham’s sentiments were quickly echoed by the Liverpool mayor, Steve Rotheram, Newcastle city council leader, Nick Forbes, Nottingham council leader, David Mellen, and the Labour MP and Sheffield mayor, Dan Jarvis. The incompetence at work here seems almost wilfully self-destructive. The government has had months of bad news headlines, so why actively chase even more? Why leak a story that not only seems bound to turn the next few days into party central, with people taking their pleasures while they still can, but also seems certain to increase the infection rate in the short term? Even a five-minute chat with local leaders could have been a win-win for Johnson. If it turned out that they came up with a more effective, better targeted plan, then the government would have got credit with its “red wall” supporters both for reaching out to their communities and for reducing the infection rates. And if after all the consultation, the net result was that no one was able to come up with a better plan than the one already dreamed up in Westminster, then at least the government would have had someone with whom to share the blame. But the only possible conclusions are that the government has totally lost all grip on reality and/or that it actually doesn’t give much of a toss. A possibility that seemed all the more plausible by its decision to send out the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, on the morning media round. Now I know every cabinet minister has to take their turn and that the gene pool of talent is thinly spread, but with Jenrick you really are scraping the barrel. This is the man, don’t forget, who broke the lockdown rules to drive 300 miles to his third home to deliver some paracetamol to his parents and unlawfully overruled a planning refusal for the Tory donor Richard Desmond. A decision that saved Dirty Des £50m. In some politicians, it’s a necessary contrivance to play dumb when faced with a series of tricky interviews. For Honest Bob it’s the only way he knows how to roll. Asked why the government was planning to bring in new measures without consulting the regions concerned, Jenrick’s stock answer was that nothing had yet been decided and in any case, even if it had been, then he would be the last person to know about it. How about the new traffic light scheme? Honest Bob merely shrugged. No idea at all. These are the first traffic lights that will be phased red, very red and very, very red. “So you’ve come on here to say nothing,” said an exasperated Charlie Stayt of the BBC. Jenrick looked blank. Of course he had. Neither could he give any evidence for any of the measures the government was planning to bring in. It was a need-to-know basis and his colleagues had long since decided he didn’t need to know anything. Just about the best explanation for the change of measures that he had already professed to know nothing about was that they were “commonsensical”. They had initially closed the bars and restaurants at 10pm because it was well known that the virus was vampiric and only came out late at night. Now there was new data that the virus might actually be out and about a bit earlier. Time and again, as Keir Starmer had with the prime minister the day before, the interviewers asked for evidence. Wasn’t it more the case that the virus was spreading more in homes, university halls of residence, care homes and hospitals rather than in bars? So why pick on them? In the absence of a vaccine, wasn’t an effective test-and-trace system the best way to minimise the effects of the pandemic? Time and again Honest Bob merely went into shut down. Probably the best place for him. And us. But at a time when the country is heading for a second wave and appears to have learned very little from its previous mistakes, it might have been nice to have a minister who could offer some hope or reassurance. Even Liz Truss might have done a bit better. Then again ... • This article was amended on 9 October 2020 to correct a misspelling of Steve Rotheram as Rotherham."
2020-10-08T14:03:42Z,politics,Politics,UK reveals plans for up to 10 inland border sites to cope with Brexit chaos,"The government has announced plans for up to 10 inland sites to cope with Brexit congestion and border checks including in Birmingham, Warrington and at a former airfield near Epping Forest in Essex. The inland border sites are being acquired to relieve ports including at Dover and Liverpool and could be in place for up to two years, according to one of councils where the planning process for infrastructure has already begun.
Among the proposed sites is a second facility for Ashford in Kent, adjacent to the recently acquired “Mojo” lorry park that will enable “about 2,000 HGVs” to queue on the coast-bound carriageway while other traffic continues to flow in both directions. The details were disclosed in a long-awaited update on the government’s border operating model and are part of the plan to avert congestion and queues of up to 7,000 trucks in Kent. On Wednesday Michael Gove, in charge of implementing Brexit, said of the potential for chaos in Kent: “If things do go wrong, then to paraphrase Rag’n’Bone Man – put the blame on me.” The document sets out new rules for border controls for travelling with EU member state national ID cards, no longer acceptable from 2021 when passports will be mandatory for entry to the UK. It also confirms that hauliers will need a “Kent access permit” to get into the county if they are heading for a ferry in Dover or a Eurotunnel train in Folkestone as part of congestion management.
The government says it will be putting new infrastructure in place at Ebbsfleet international station in Kent, North Weald airfield in Essex and Warrington in the north-west. Along with the second Ashford site – which would be used for processes around transit including “passport for goods” checks – two further sites are being considered primarily for the same processes in Thames Gateway and Birmingham. Additional potential sites could be put in place by July next year in Holyhead, Fishguard/Pembroke and Dover. Industry leaders including the Road Haulage Association, which Gove has accused of not being “constructive”, welcomed the report. The government had identified 29 areas last month for potential use for border infrastructure but has already stood some of these boroughs down. Medway council in Kent said it had been notified by the government that land in its area would not be needed. Anglesey council has already rejected an approach for a potential customs facility at an agricultural showground near Holyhead, the second busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port in the country. One executive at the council, Carwyn Jones, said: “They can’t sit in London and just look at Google Maps, and we can’t be strong-armed into accepting a site that isn’t appropriate.” Essex county council said: “HMRC is proposing to use and operate North Weald airfield as a common transit convention (CTC) site. This is not a lorry park, but a customs facility which enables exporters to defer paying duties when importing goods into Europe. We expect HMRC to engage stakeholders, including local residents, shortly as part of its planning application under special development order legislation. The site will operate alongside other inland border sites in Kent for up to two years.” The 138-page document will be a must-read for all hauliers and businesses and particularly the estimated 145,000 companies that have never traded outside the EU. They will have to become familiar with complicated processes including customs declarations on both imports and exports and sanitary and phytosanitary checks on both sides of the border. Also to be put in place will be checks for endangered fauna and flora, which may take place away from ports such as Dover and Liverpool, where there is no capacity near the docks. The government confirms that “it is the UK’s intention that EU, European Economic Area and Swiss citizens will not be required to obtain a visa” and they will continue to be be able to use electronic passport gates at airports. The document reminds members of the public who want to travel to and from the EU with pets that the documentary requirements will change. If the EU accepts the UK as a “part 1 listed third country” the checks will be similar to now but the UK is urging pet owners to get necessary veterinary checks in place four months before travel as a contingency."
2020-10-08T13:50:17Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May leads Tory rebellion against planning changes,"The government faces a potentially serious rebellion over its plans to centralise and accelerate the housebuilding process in England after Theresa May led a string of senior Tory MPs in expressing opposition to the proposals in parliament. May, speaking in a Commons backbench debate organised by another Conservative MP, Bob Seely, said that while she and others fully supported the need for more homes to be built, ministers must “think again on this”. The former prime minister, who has in recent weeks also been a vocal critic of the government’s plans to break international law by unilaterally rewriting parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, said the plans would remove local decision-making, build over rural areas, and not deliver the affordable homes needed. “We do need to build more homes, but we won’t do that by forcing local authorities to grant more planning permissions to developers so that they can build more homes to bring the price down – because developers simply won’t do it,” she said. “The government does need to think again on this and it needs to understand the impact that the proposals it has put forward are going to have.” The planning changes, set out in a white paper in August, would remove councils from many routine decisions and instead use an algorithm to set new housing targets for local areas. Analysis of the algorithm has alarmed many Tory MPs and councillors after it suggested that many of the homes needed for an annual target of 333,000 would be built in Conservative heartlands such as Kent and Surrey. The backbench motion by Seely, which has no force on the government, requests that the new system is not introduced without a debate and a vote in the Commons. Seely, the Isle of Wight MP, said the algorithm risked ensuring that with new homes, “the biggest housing increases will be to rural shires and suburbs, and the biggest falls are in the urban north and Midlands”. Virtually every Tory MP who spoke criticised the plans, with former May-era cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt saying they risked “eroding local democracy, reducing affordable housing and encroaching on our beautiful countryside”. He added: “The government must think again.” Damian Green, the Ashford MP and former de facto deputy to May, said he and other Kent MPs were deeply worried. “Algorithms are a tool for mathematicians, not politicians,” he said. “We are in danger of turning the garden of England into a patio.”
Other Tory former ministers who joined in the criticism included Chris Grayling, who said the plans would merely “suck growth” into the south-east of England, Damian Hinds and Caroline Nokes. Nokes, the former immigration minister, said local councils were better able to decide where new housing should be built. “Let local councillors who have a track record of delivery carry on delivering,” she urged. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said no action would mean people being less able to buy a home. He said: “That’s why we must reform the planning system to cut red tape and make the system faster, while ensuring that councils and local people can decide where developments should and shouldn’t go.” Asked about the Tory MPs’ worries that the algorithm would mean building money being pulled into the south of England rather than the north or Midlands, he said: “The changes that we have put forward are part of a consultation, so naturally we will listen to the feedback to ensure we do this in the best way.”"
2020-10-08T13:43:25Z,politics,Politics,"Only 150 of 1,000 mentors will be in England's schools before 2021","Just 150 of the 1,000 academic mentors promised as part of the government’s £1bn education catchup plans will be in schools in England by the end of the year, the Guardian has learned. The remainder will be placed in two waves in January and February, in a programme due to end in July, prompting outrage from teaching unions who said the response was “completely inadequate” to the scale of the challenge. The plan contained eye-catching promises when it was announced in June, including a national tutoring programme offering one-to-one and small-group coaching by approved private providers. Headteachers have warned, however, that the £650m extra funding, amounting to £80 per pupil and which will go direct to all state schools, will be wiped out by costs incurred as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Like the academic mentors, the private tuition strand of the £350m national tutoring programme offering subsidised tuition to disadvantaged children will not get fully under way until the new year. Headteachers said rather than waiting for a complex new system to be implemented, all the money should have gone to schools for immediate and more effective use. Russell Hobby, the chief executive of the teacher training organisation Teach First, which is recruiting and placing mentors in schools, confirmed 150 would be in place in November after half-term. A further 400 would start in January and the rest in February. “We are on track at the moment. I think it’s probably not a bad thing that we wait a month or two to start this. Schools have got a lot on at the moment,” Hobby said. “The advantage of the mentors is they are under the school’s control and direction. They are supporting and building on what the school is doing. This would have have even greater impact if we can keep this going beyond the first year.” Teach First received 2,000 applications for the roles – which are aimed at recent graduates, newly qualified teachers who have not secured jobs and people changing career – and 700 schools have expressed an interest. The government is paying the £19,000-a-year salary, though in reality many will work for only six months. This week, Boris Johnson returned to his theme of one-to-one tuition during his speech to the virtual Conservative party conference, suggesting it could be used more widely beyond the catchup programme to help children who are left behind and those who excel.
Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, described the 150 mentors as inadequate. “It should have been obvious to the government that the quickest and most effective way of supporting children and young people who have not been able to learn effectively at home during school closures was to give the money to schools. “Schools know their pupils. They know what’s needed. They would have used the extra money to put support in place now.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “It was always likely that the government’s decision to dedicate £350m to setting up from scratch a complex programme of tutors and mentors would be difficult to deliver in a timely manner, and so it is proving. “If it is not fully up and running until some time in the new year, there won’t be very much time left to use it to support students sitting exams, and the longer it takes to deliver the risk is that it will become a largely pointless exercise.”"
2020-10-07T23:01:20Z,politics,Politics,Former ministers to hold 'rapid' inquiry into government's Covid-19 response,"A pair of Conservative former ministers have announced they are to lead a rapid, cross-party investigation into the UK’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, amid worries a government inquiry will take too long for lessons to be learned in time. In a rare set of joint hearings, the Commons health committee, led by ex-health secretary Jeremy Hunt, and the science committee, chaired by Greg Clark, who was business secretary, are to hear from witnesses in the hope of producing a report by the spring. Announcing the plan, Hunt and Clark said the inquiry would aim to produce interim recommendations along the way. It will hold weekly joint sessions, with early witnesses set to include Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the government’s top scientific adviser. While the pair stressed the aim will be constructive, and they do not want to pre-empt any future official inquiry, the testimony and findings could nonetheless be uncomfortable at times for Boris Johnson and his ministers. Clark and Hunt have been among the most assiduous questioners of Matt Hancock, the health secretary, during his recent Commons appearances. Hunt said he would expect the inquiry to cover the need for regular, large-scale coronavirus testing, an issue he has repeatedly raised in parliament, and whether this could help people visit loved ones in care homes. The hearings begin next Tuesday with a session on social care. Other promised areas of examination include the efficacy of lockdown measures; how well modelling and statistics have been used; the efficacy of government messaging; wider preparedness for a pandemic; and the impact on BAME communities. Hunt said while Johnson had not yet set out what sort of official inquiry he would like to set up, the expectation was that this would not be quick. “If it is a public inquiry, it will take several years before it’s ready to report,” Hunt said. “Whereas this will be an inquiry that I think will be in a position to report by spring of next year, so a much shorter timescale.” Clark said the aim was “to uncover and describe lessons that should be learned, but have application during the weeks and months ahead, before any further inquiries that the prime minister might commission”. While the final report was unlikely to arrive before spring, he added, there would be “staging posts on the way” to highlight any lessons. The inquiry will hear from witnesses in person, with Clark and Hunt alternating who chairs each weekly session, and will accept written evidence. Hunt said the assumption was that ministers would attend if requested: “We would expect excellent cooperation to continue, as we’ve have had in the past in this scrutiny process.” The pair have already met the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, which says it represents 1,600 bereaved families and is campaigning for a swift public inquiry. The group has been trying to arrange a meeting with Johnson, so far without success. Hunt said the relatives’ group wanted lessons to be learned as soon as possible, notably over testing: “What I took away was the vital importance of mass testing, given that half of all transmission is from people who are asymptomatic. You have to find a way of being able to test large numbers of people in every high-risk environment.” The Covid-19 families group said it welcomed the joint committee plan, but that a full public inquiry would be even better. Jo Goodman, the co-founder of the group, whose father, Stuart, died from the virus, said: “The fact that MPs have had to begin their own investigation highlights how this government has avoided scrutiny by refusing to launch its own judge-led public inquiry. “That inquiry would be able to compel witnesses to give evidence. And it could have a ‘rapid review’ first phase, as was held after the Hillsborough disaster.” Hunt said one of the key themes of the inquiry would be the way scientific and medical advice was given to ministers, and how they then acted on it, and that he expected Whitty and Vallance to also be called to give evidence nearer the end of the process. “To really understand what lessons we need to learn from this pandemic, it is impossible to do so without understanding the intersection between scientists and politicians,” he said."
2020-10-07T18:00:14Z,politics,Politics,Couple who allege Cummings made second lockdown trip accuse police of bias,"A couple who allege Dominic Cummings made a second lockdown trip to north-east England have accused Durham police of trying to help the government deny the claim in an internal review of the investigation. The two-and-a-half page review insisted the force did take seriously an alleged sighting of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser in woods on the southern outskirts of the city on 19 April by Dave and Clare Edwards. But it is standing by its investigation in May, which found there was “insufficient evidence” for the claim. Now the Edwardses, both 59, have accused the force of siding with Downing Street because they say the review cherrypicked press reports that only tallied with Cummings’ version of events, while ignoring their accounts, and those of two others, who all claim they saw Cummings that morning. They also point out the press stories cited in the review all came after the conclusion of Durham police’s initial investigation. Speaking to the Guardian and the Daily Mirror, Dave Edwards, who works for a company that supplied some of the Nightingale hospitals, said: “How one-sided can you write a report to be? I’m just gobsmacked that anyone in Durham police thought that was adequate. To me it is evidence that the police haven’t done their job.” He added: “If there was ‘insufficient evidence’, is it because the police weren’t actually looking for it? The report doesn’t answer that, it just selectively quotes the media to suit [the government’s] case.” He also questioned why the attorney general, Suella Braverman, had tweeted support for Cummings before the police investigation began. Clare Edwards, a nurse practitioner, said: “This looks like complicity of the police with the government.” In his rose garden statement in Downing Street, Cummings denied making a second trip to Durham on the weekend of 18-19 April and claimed he had evidence to prove it. But he has refused repeated requests to release the evidence. In August, the Guardian and the Mirror revealed that the Edwardses – two of four people who claim to have seen Cummings in Houghall Woods on the morning of the 19 April – had complained to the police watchdog that their testimony had not been properly investigated. The independent office for police conduct referred the complaint back to Durham to review. The review said there was no evidence from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras that Cummings was “in the Durham area on 19 April”. But it made no mention of whether officers checked the national ANPR database to verify if Cummings’ vehicles had made the journey from Durham to London that day. Dave Edwards, a Conservative voter, said: “We are aware of how difficult it is for the police at the moment. But I believe this to be a failure of the senior leadership team at Durham police in dealing with this matter. It needs to be pushed and further investigation is required. It doesn’t say they have checked ANPR regarding 19 April. I’m questioning why.” The review also noted a Guardian report on 7 August that cited a witness who claimed to have seen Cummings at 3.31pm on Hampstead Heath in north London. The Durham police review said: “This supports the account provided by Mr Cummings.” But it ignored that the Guardian report also noted it was possible to drive between London and Durham in well under four hours in lockdown conditions. Such a journey time would have made it possible for someone to be seen in Durham as late as 11.15-11.30am, the latest time one of four witnesses claimed to have seen Cummings in Durham, and to be seen in London at 3.31pm. Dave Edwards said: “They have selectively taken media reports that suit their version, and not included a balanced media report to say there were other people on the day who also said Mr Cummings was in the woods. The Guardian’s report actually said you can do the journey in a 17-year-old Honda in under four hours.” He added: “This has massively eroded public trust in the police.” Johnson told the liaison committee in May that he had seen the evidence that Cummings claims he had that proved he was not in Durham on 19 April. But the prime minister refused to release it to the cabinet secretary to verify. A No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed. Durham constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations.” A spokesman for Durham constabulary said: “We received a complaint which has been dealt with under appropriate procedures and the investigation is now closed.”"

Here is a guide to the new rules.
Boris Johnson must set out the scientific evidence behind the introduction of further lockdown measures in England, Keir Starmer has said, hinting his party could vote against implementing the 10pm hospitality curfew if the government fails to provide further evidence. England’s poorest communities are nearly four times as likely to face lockdown restrictions as the wealthiest areas, a Guardian analysis has found, as local leaders warned of a “winter of dangerous discontent” in the north of England without urgent financial support. More than £10m is being spent on a network of NHS clinics across England for people with “long Covid”. David Frost, the government’s chief Brexit negotiator, has hinted that the UK is now willing to agree to robust joint rules with the EU covering state aid. This has been seen as the key obstacle to a trade deal, because the UK government has been resistant to an agreement that would significantly constrain its state aid policy in the future. But today, in evidence to a Lords committee, Frost said he could imagine a situation where the UK would welcome a robust dispute resolution mechanism - because it would want to use it against the EU. (See 5.55pm.) Giving evidence to a committee of MPs later he said: The point I was trying to make on state aid is that whatever the final agreement, whatever the form of dispute settlement on subsidies, I could imagine we would be at least as assiduous users of it as the EU would be. He also said that he thought the two sides might be able to reach agreement on this within the next two weeks. He said: The EU in its text in March this year did not want to make certain aspects sensitive to it subject to [state aid] arbitration. We are likely to do the same. And I think what we’re trying to do in the next couple of weeks is find a balance between those two things. During the same hearing Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, put the chances of a deal at 60/40. And Frost said fisheries was now the most difficult issue between the two sides to resolve. These are from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll.
Boris Johnson is prepared to make a major compromise to secure security ties with the EU by pledging in a deal on the future relationship not to rip up the Human Rights Act, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-10-07T15:55:27Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson asks the questions as he runs out of answers | John Crace,"It wasn’t the most orthodox of openings to prime minister’s questions, with Tory MP Sir David Amess plugging his new book – out next week – and asking whether Boris Johnson agreed with his central proposition that the country had not voted for the Conservatives at the last election because it believed the party would be good at dealing with the coronavirus, but because it wanted “to get Brexit done”. Boris was caught cold and was surprisingly quick to agree. Thereby implicitly admitting that the government’s response to the pandemic had become increasingly clueless. None of which was lost on Keir Starmer, who challenged Johnson on the out-of-date spreadsheets that led to 16,000 cases being left out of official Covid figures and another 48,000 people not being warned they had been in contact with the virus. Lives had been put at risk, said the Labour leader. It does no harm to sometimes point out the obvious.
Johnson looked downbeat, defeated even, from the very start. His insistence during his party conference speech the day before that he had “rediscovered his mojo” had looked like hollow rhetoric then, and now seemed more so in the flesh. None of this is what Boris had ever wanted or planned. He had signed up for the glory and the applause. Not to see the country through its biggest health crisis in 100 years. Six months in and he’s all but out of ideas. He knows that. And more importantly his own backbenchers know that. Even though the whips have tried to get MPs to sound more enthusiastic, no one is fooled. PMQs has become as excruciating for the Tory ground troops as it is for Johnson. Boris could barely raise his eyes as he mumbled something about the missing test results being a technical issue that had now been resolved. Nothing to see here, time to move on. The Labour leader is now used to the prime minister dodging questions but even he seemed taken aback by such a lacklustre reply, utterly devoid of any personal responsibility. This was serious, he explained. Some of the data that had gone missing was from two and a half weeks earlier. Once again the prime minister was almost mute. Starmer was making a big deal out of not very much. All the epidemiology pointed to the fact that all the missing cases and contacts had come from areas where we already knew there was a high incidence of the virus. So if a few more people in the north-west or the north-east happened to die or be exposed to the disease then there was no real harm done. After all, they’d probably have caught the disease at some point anyway. What would have been worrying was if the disease was found to have spread to areas that weren’t already in local lockdowns. Let them eat cake. What followed wasn’t pretty for the prime minister. The missing contacts weren’t an isolated case, Starmer pointed out. They were just part of a series of ongoing problems with the test-and-trace system. Worse still, the government was like a rabbit in the headlights, unable to react to a changing situation. Local lockdowns might have seemed like a good idea a month or so ago – and Labour had been first to back the government on them – but there was now clear evidence that they weren’t working. Infections in 19 out of 20 areas had actually gone up since lockdowns had been introduced. So something needed to change. What needed to change, said Boris, was Labour continually heckling from the sidelines and failing to offer support. Did Labour actually support the “rule of six” or not? The sense of deja vu was deadening. Whenever he’s on the ropes and has no answers, the only way Boris knows how to respond is to go on the offensive and start asking questions himself. On another day, the speaker might have intervened and pointed out that the session was actually an opportunity for questions to be asked of the prime minister. “Yes, we do support the rule of six,” said Starmer. At least one party leader is capable of giving a straight answer to a straight question. The only reason Labour had abstained on the vote the day before was because they had known it was going to pass anyway. “Now if the prime minister would just listen to the questions, we might get on a little better.” What was really at stake here was that there was no consistency in any of the rules. Johnson’s own constituency of Hillingdon had a greater incidence of the virus than some other areas that had been put under local lockdown.
And Labour had been happy enough to go along with the 10pm curfew initially because it had assumed the government must have some scientific evidence to back it up. Starmer’s mistake had been to treat the prime minister as a proper grown-up. So now he wanted to see the evidence before he continued to offer his support, as there was little sign the curfew was having the desired effect. If Johnson had the data to prove that things would have been even worse than they already were, then by all means publish it. We were in the grip of a pandemic and the government must be prepared to change course when necessary. Everyone made mistakes in a fast-moving situation; it was the failure to acknowledge these mistakes and react to them that was unforgivable. Boris chuntered on, but by now no one was listening. Rather there was a general feeling of futility on both sides of the house. The Tories despair of a leader who gets weaker with each outing and no longer appears to really want the job. Nor do Labour take much satisfaction from Starmer out-thinking and out-performing Johnson. Partly because his victory is already priced in, but also because the stakes are too high. People are dying because of the decisions being taken. PMQs used to be part-pantomime, with moments of high comedy. Now it is just pure tragedy. Even though the leading actor is a clown who can’t even be trusted to tell the Commons his own name."
2020-10-07T15:27:43Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon denies colluding with or conspiring against Alex Salmond,"Nicola Sturgeon has denied “in the strongest possible terms” conspiring against or colluding with Alex Salmond over sexual harassment allegations, as her husband and Scottish National party chief executive, Peter Murrell, admitted sending leaked text messages that appeared to endorse “pressuring” the police to investigate the former first minister. In written evidence to the inquiry into her government’s botched handling of the complaints against Salmond, published on Wednesday, Sturgeon said the ensuing events had caused her “a great deal of personal anguish, and resulted in the breakdown of a relationship that had been very important to me, politically and personally, for most of my life”. Members of the inquiry claimed her evidence proved she had misled parliament over when she first knew about the allegations, and exposed an unacceptable blurring of her roles as head of the Scottish government and the SNP. The committee is investigating the government’s handling of an internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct by two female officials against Salmond, which was found to be unlawful in January 2019 after Salmond took the government to court. Salmond was subsequently prosecuted on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, after Police Scotland launched its own investigation. He was acquitted of all charges in March 2020. Sturgeon also stated in evidence that she had “forgotten” a key meeting with Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, on 29 March 2018, maintaining that she first learned of the allegations on 2 April, when she “agreed to meet a friend of 30 years when I was told he was in distress and wanted to talk to me about a serious matter”. Murdo Fraser, a committee member and Scottish Conservative MSP, said: “We are expected to accept that Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister renowned for her grasp of detail, has the memory of a sieve when she’s told that her mentor of 30 years is facing allegations of sexual misconduct.” Sturgeon’s evidence also included transcripts of text messages between her and Salmond, in which he expresses frustration that the Scottish government has rejected arbitration to resolve the complaints. In her evidence, Sturgeon also said that she had “no general concerns at the time about Scottish government culture” during the years that Salmond was first minster, “and certainly not about sexual harassment”, though she added that he “could be challenging to work for”. The committee has previously heard the Salmond was known for “bullying and intimidatory behaviour”. She also stated that she sought to ensure the Scottish government’s new process for dealing with sexual harassment would include allegations of a historic nature “in the light of the #MeToo movement” and not because she had a concern that allegations about her predecessor could materialise. The Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, another committee member, said Sturgeon’s evidence had “as many holes as a Swiss cheese” and exposed “the blurring of lines between the Scottish government and the SNP, and the fact that they seem to live in each other’s pockets”. The inquiry committee also published a submission from Murrell that addressed leaked texts between himself and a senior SNP party official that appeared to suggest Murrell was eager for the police investigating the claims against Salmond to come under pressure, and for Salmond to face investigations from different police forces. Reminding the committee that there was an ongoing police investigation into the circumstances in which the texts were obtained, Murrell insisted his intended meaning was that “any and all complaints should be appropriately investigated”. Murrell told the committee: “The messages were sent the day after Mr Salmond had been charged with a number of serious offences. In the aftermath of this, the SNP was contacted by individuals who had specific, personal questions in relation to that criminal case. My intention was to advise that their questions should be addressed to the police and not the SNP. I acknowledge that I did not express myself well.” Describing Murrell’s admission as “a shattering, extraordinary revelation [that] leaves Peter Murrell’s position as chief executive of the SNP completely untenable”, Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, called for Sturgeon to sack her husband."
2020-10-07T15:25:59Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson set for compromise on Human Rights Act – EU sources,"Boris Johnson is prepared to make a major compromise to secure security ties with the EU by pledging in a deal on the future relationship not to rip up the Human Rights Act. The UK is said by EU sources to be “moving” in negotiations on the issue in Brussels after previously insisting that the government would not tie its hands in any agreement on the future relationship. While welcomed by EU negotiators as unlocking progress in the security talks, the move risks angering senior backbenchers in his party including within the powerful European Research Group, whose former chairman, the cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, has been an outspoken critic of the act, voting to repeal it in 2012 and 2016. The European convention on human rights (ECHR) is incorporated into British domestic legislation by the Human Rights Act (HRA). The EU has since the start of the trade and security negotiation said that future cooperation on internal security would be conditional on a written commitment that the ECHR would continue to apply. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, argued in response that it would be an infringement of the country’s “sovereign independence” to write in such a commitment to a deal, raising concerns in some quarters about the government’s motivations. But EU sources said a compromise was now in play under which the trade and security deal would include a commitment by the government not to “materially alter the spirit” of the Human Rights Act. Either party would then have the right to suspend or terminate the agreement if there were serious concerns about the protection of fundamental rights and the rule of law. It is a key development, which offers to open up access to EU databases and other forms of crime-fighting cooperation to British law enforcement agencies. “That opens the door to get to work on the open internal security files,” said one senior diplomatic source in Brussels. A UK government spokesman said: “The UK remains committed to the ECHR – we have been clear on that time and time again, including in parliament. “We agree that cooperation with the EU should be based on our shared values of respect for fundamental rights and for the rule of law. The UK’s approach to these issues in the context of law enforcement is based on precedent for EU-third country agreements in this area.” As recently as last month, it had been reported that the prime minister had been looking at weakening the hold of the Human Rights Act so as to curb its use by migrants and asylum seekers seeking to avoid deportation. The Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto had also promised a review of the legislation. In a blogpost in 2018, the prime minister’s now chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had written that the ECHR creates “legal problems all the time”. But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had publicly warned that adherence to the ECHR was a red line for Brussels. “If the United Kingdom’s position does not move, it will have an immediate and concrete effect on the level of ambition of our cooperation, which will remain based on international conventions but will not be as ambitious as we wish,” he said in March. There remain significant obstacles to securing the type of security deal being sought by the British government, however. Last month the Guardian revealed that a radical “pro-tech” plan championed by Cummings to rewrite Britain’s data protection laws was endangering future cooperation. The European commission is currently examining whether the UK’s data laws will be in line with the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR) and law enforcement directive after 1 January 2021, allowing the movement of data vital to the law enforcement agencies. Downing Street hopes that positive “adequacy” decisions can be made by Brussels before the end of the year when the transition period ends. But EU sources said the government’s recently published national digital strategy had caused concerns by suggesting that there would be wholesale changes to the UK’s domestic data protection laws, imperilling a positive decision. Following a phone call with the prime minister on Wednesday, the European council president, Charles Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders, tweeted: “Just talked to Boris Johnson. The EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost. Time for the UK to put its cards on the table.” With the problematic issues of EU access to British fishing waters and domestic subsidy control yet to be solved, the negotiation is expected by EU officials to go into November. Johnson had told the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, during a call on Saturday that he would like “clarity” by the time of an EU leaders’ summit on 15 October whether a deal is doable. But EU diplomats believed the October meeting was likely to be a “staging post” rather than a breakthrough moment. Barnier is in London to lead the EU negotiators in the trade and security talks on Thursday and is set to meet Frost on Friday."
2020-10-07T14:55:16Z,politics,Politics,Gove says UK has '66% chance' of Brexit deal amid breakthrough,"Michael Gove has put the chances of a Brexit deal at 66% amid fresh optimism over a breakthrough on the dispute over state aid, one of the key sticking points in negotiations. The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster said the high percentage chance of a deal “sounded about right” when pressed about the talks during a session of parliament’s Brexit select committee. But experts seized on remarks made by the UK negotiator Lord Frost at the same meeting over a potential state aid dispute resolution mechanism. “I imagine we will be as assiduous users of it [dispute resolution] as the EU will be,” Frost said. He declined to detail how this governance mechanism would work but the fact it was mentioned formally was seen as new. “This is a big shift,” said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. The EU has been worried that the UK could achieve competitive advantage in future by pumping subsidies into failing companies but the UK had refused to share its own plans for subsidies post-Brexit, merely declaring the country would maintain a low-subsidy regime. “I think what Frost was saying was that the UK has accepted that state aid is going to be subject to dispute resolution. This is the opening we were looking for to pave the way for an agreement on enforceability,” he said. State aid has been identified repeatedly as one of the biggest stumbling blocks in trade negotiations by both sides, but in a further indication of a breakthrough Frost said this was no longer the case. “Fisheries is the most difficult issue remaining in my view, I think we’ve been clear about that but I would not want to suggest that any issue can’t be solved.” He told the committee he thought that a deal was “eminently achievable and could be achieved”, suggesting the prime minister’s deadline of 15 October could be broken if there was an outline deal visible by then. “My job is to get as far as we can before the 15th, and then I’ll have to advise the PM as to whether the conditions for an agreement, the basis for an agreement are in place at that point,” Frost said, indicating that 15 October was not a red line. The outspoken Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Peter Bone told Gove he was struck by what he said was the “optimistic mood about a comprehensive free trade agreement that is really good news for everyone”. The upbeat tone raised hopes that sufficient progress could be made to enter the “tunnel” phase of intense negotiations by the time EU leaders meet next week. Earlier the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney warned that the EU’s Michel Barnier will not move Brexit talks into the tunnel phase unless he gets a “very clear signal” from the UK that it is “willing to show some flexibility and realism” in its approach to a deal. Boris Johnson spoke to the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, on Wednesday to outline the UK’s “commitment to get a deal” and “underline a deal was better for both sides”. Conspicuously, there was no mention of state aid but a reiteration that “significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries”.
After the phone call Michel said in a tweet it was “time for the UK to put its cards on the table” over a post-Brexit trade deal.
Coveney told an Irish parliamentary committee on Wednesday that no one should be offended by the UK’s desire to drive a hard bargain, but its refusal to budge on state aid and fair competition rules was “very problematic” because it had agreed in detail to work at a solution when it signed the political declaration in January. “Michel Barnier has been very insistent on this. He is not going to move this process into a more intensive phase, which many people will describe as a tunnel, to try to close out through it the remaining issues unless he gets a very clear signal from the UK that they’re willing to show some flexibility and some realism around the need for fair and open competition between these two big economies,” said Coveney.
He said the finance bill, which is due to be published imminently, could unsettle or even collapse the talks. “If the finance bill is introduced with that provision in it [to give UK ministers unilateral powers in Northern Ireland], I think many in the EU will see that as an indication that the British government simply doesn’t want to deal because it would be a second piece of legislation designed to deliberately break the withdrawal agreement,” he told the Irish parliament’s European affairs committee."
2020-10-07T12:54:29Z,politics,Politics,"Conservatives spent £16m on 2019 election win, figures show","The Conservatives spent more than £16m on achieving an 80-seat majority in December, including paying for a £500 cab journey from York and £22,000 on fast-food deliveries, official figures show. Data released by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday shows that the party spent £16,486,871 to claim its biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher’s 1987 victory. Each winning seat cost about £200,000. The payments included nearly £6m sending unsolicited material across the country. The party also paid more than £1.6m to CTF, the polling firm set up by the Australian election guru Lynton Crosby. Johnson is a longtime friend of Crosby, who worked on his London mayoral campaigns, and the pair are understood to have talked informally on the phone regularly during his leadership campaign. The Australian strategist and polling expert was a key figure in the general election campaign, despite the two having disagreed over the role of the prime minister’s partner, Carrie Symonds. One notable expense in the newly released data was a £500.80 journey in an Addison Lee taxi from the University of York where the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, was appearing on BBC One’s Question Time. The destination of the journey is blacked out on the bill. Recording of the programme ended at about 10pm, informed sources said, and other guests were booked minicabs by the BBC or took the train out of York. Jenrick’s office has been approached by the Guardian and asked if he was a passenger in the taxi. Another election expense was for Uber Eats deliveries to campaigners that came to £22,735.14. Those based in Millbank Tower, the campaign headquarters, would regularly order in deliveries of sushi, pizza and beer, one said. The party also spent £458,688 on Twitter graphics and videos from the New Zealand-based PR firm Topham Guerin, which controversially rebranded the Conservatives’ Twitter account as FactCheckUK during the leaders’ debate last November. The picture agency Parsons Media received three payments totalling £44,975 from the Tories. Andrew Parsons of Parsons Media subsequently worked as a photographer for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, at taxpayers’ expense. The party spent £4,471,937 on marketing and canvassing, and £3,011,665 on advertising. A further £529,650 was spent on rallies. Just over £1m was spent with Facebook and another £700,000 was paid to the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy, which is run by the former Vote Leave executive Paul Stephenson. The Tories were fined a record £70,000 in 2017 for making false declarations about their election expenses in 2015, when David Cameron’s party beat Ed Miliband’s Labour party. The commission found the party failed to declare or accurately report more than £275,000 of campaign spending at three byelections in 2014 and at the 2015 general election. The spending return for the UK general election was missing payments worth at least £104,765 and payments worth up to £118,124 were either not reported to the commission or were incorrectly reported by the party. Invoices and receipts were missing for £52,924 worth of payments. Labour’s expenses have yet to be published because its financial submissions to the commission were late owing to the coronavirus outbreak. Official figures show the pro-Corbyn activist group Momentum spent just over £500,000. The report shows that the cost of the SNP campaign was £1,004,952, Plaid Cymru spent £183,914, and the doomed campaign of the Independent Group for Change spent £29,556. The cost of Ukip’s failed general election push was £8,761. The commission said that spending returns for parties who spent over £250,000 at the 2019 general election were due to be reported by June, but due to Covid-19 not all parties – including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party – were able to deliver returns before the deadline. Further batches of spending information are expected to be released later."
2020-10-07T07:58:19Z,politics,Politics,Taxpayers face losing up to £26bn on Covid-19 business loans,"Taxpayers stand to lose up to £26bn on the government’s most popular Covid-19 business loan scheme because of fraud or an inability to repay the money, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has warned. The concerns were raised in a National Audit Office (NAO) report into the 100% government-backed bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS), which was designed to quickly distribute cheap loans of up to £50,000 to small businesses hit by the Covid-19 crisis. The watchdog has warned that up to 60% of customers may fail to pay back the loans because of minimal credit checks and fraudulent applications. In the latest available figures from the Treasury, a total of £38bn has been borrowed under the scheme by 1.3 million firms. Assuming lending through the scheme totals £43bn by the time it closes at the end of November, taxpayers could end up footing a bill of between £15bn and £26bn to cover bad debts, the NAO warned. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, said: “The scheme’s hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer’s expense. Sadly, many firms won’t be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem. “The government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad – this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money.” The NAO is now calling on the government to take action to try to avoid losing so much public money. Head of the NAO Gareth Davies said: “Government will need to ensure that robust debt collection and fraud investigation arrangements are in place to minimise the impact of these potential losses to the public purse. It should also take this opportunity to consider now the controls it would put in place to protect against the abuse of any future such schemes.” The report comes just weeks after the government extended the application deadline for Covid loans including BBLS by two months to the end of November, as it tries to avoid further fallout from the coronavirus crisis. The spending watchdog conceded that the BBLS programme “succeeded in quickly supporting small businesses” since May, but the speedy application process – which scrapped credit checks and relied on self-reporting from customers – has come at a cost. The NAO said the lack of affordability checks means that hundreds of thousands of customers will struggle to repay their debts, triggering the government guarantee that sees taxpayer money used to cover banks’ losses. Meanwhile, the decision to provide funds quickly left public money exposed to fraud – the scale of which the NAO said would not be clear for months. However, the Cabinet Office’s government fraud function estimates that losses will be significantly above the usual levels of fraud linked to public sector schemes, which usually range between 0.5% and 5%. Together, the fraud and affordability risks mean that between 35% to 60% of firms that had borrowed may default on the loans, the NAO said. However, the NAO warned that these estimates were “highly uncertain” and the full extent of the losses would only become clear once loans start being repaid in May 2021. Police have already made multiple arrests linked to the BBLS. In one case, two men in London claimed more than £500,000 from the emergency loan programme by recruiting multiple people to set up fake companies and bank accounts to launder the cash. Davies warned ministers weeks ago that there would be “no excuse” if billions of pounds worth of fraud within government schemes continues under a second coronavirus lockdown. Davies told the Guardian that there had already been “significant” abuse of the furlough scheme and the BBLS, which would take months to identify. The National Crime Agency and state-owned British Business Bank – which oversees the Covid loan schemes – have also warned about fraud linked to bounce back loans. A government spokesperson defended the Covid loan schemes, saying they had provided a lifeline to thousands of UK businesses. “We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won’t apologise for this. “We’ve looked to minimise fraud – with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both.”"
2020-10-07T06:00:30Z,politics,Politics,"Planning changes would drastically cut affordable homes, councils say","Close to half of affordable homes in some of the most expensive areas of England will not be built if ministers proceed with changes to the planning system, analysis by councils suggests. The government’s proposal to scrap the duty of developers to build affordable housing on sites for up to 40 or 50 homes, would have led to 30,000 of such homes going undelivered over the last five years, according to the Local Government Association (LGA). Some areas likely to be most affected are the least affordable and under greatest housing pressure, the cross-party grouping said. Elmbridge in Surrey, where the average house price is over £760,000, has 486 affordable homes either built, under construction or with planning permission over the past five years. This would be reduced to 271 if the proposed 40 or 50-unit threshold were introduced, the LGA said. Lewes district council in East Sussex could lose up to 37% of its affordable homes, based on past trends. Council leaders in Cornwall have complained the change could result in 300 fewer affordable homes in the county every year. The warning comes as several Conservative councils voice objections to the planning changes, which they also complain will limit local power over developments. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, defended the plans in an interview with the Guardian, telling rebellious shire Tories their party had a “moral mission” to build more homes. The government admits lifting the threshold at which affordable housing must be included from sites with more than 10 homes to those with over 40 or 50 could cut affordable housing delivery by between 7% and 20%.
But its consultation on changes to the planning system states: “We anticipate that raising the threshold would make more sites viable for [small and medium-sized] developers and would increase the pace of their delivery as the need for negotiation would be removed.” The LGA’s housing spokesperson, David Renard, who is the Conservative leader of Swindon borough bouncil, said the proposals were “of huge concern”. “We need to build homes that are affordable to local people and help to reduce homelessness, rather than contributing additional funds to developers’ and landowners’ profits,” he said. “These current proposals risk allowing developers to game the system by only putting forward schemes for fewer than 40 or 50 homes, and so avoid building any affordable homes at all.” Karen Randolph, portfolio holder for planning at Elmbridge, said: “We are strongly opposed to this approach. There is a significant need for affordable housing in Elmbridge, which coupled with limited land supply and reliance on small sites, means that every opportunity must be taken to secure affordable housing.” She said the average size of the development site in the borough was 0.11 hectares – around a quarter of an acre.
William Meyer, the Liberal Democrat cabinet member for housing at Lewes district council said: “We have massive land shortage in Lewes and if small sites are going to be excluded it will make a difficult situation worse.” Lewes town is in the South Downs national park, which has a rule that half of any developments of more than 10 homes must be affordable. But the change would affect other settlements in the district outside the park boundary, including Seaford and Newhaven. Meyer said building council housing rather than relying on private developers was the answer and that a cut in March to the cost of central government loans for that purpose had helped. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the LGA was overstating the risk, because its proposal to lift the threshold for affordable housing contributions was planned to only be in place for 18 months. They added: “Our proposals will bring in a new, simpler infrastructure levy to ensure developers pay their way and deliver at least as much, if not more, onsite affordable housing than today.”"
2020-10-07T05:00:29Z,politics,Politics,How to curb a consultancy addiction - and love employees,"The new analysis of government invoices may well confirm the fears of Lord Agnew, the civil service minister who last week called for senior civil servants to stop “depriving our brightest [public servants] of opportunities to work on some of the most challenging, fulfilling and crunchy issues”. A former businessman and Brexiter who joined the government in February, his eyes will fall on the stark figures showing that departments at the forefront of leaving the EU have become increasingly reliant on sharp-suited City specialists who can command up to £3,500 a day. The statistics, which covered 11,000 government invoices filed until April this year, do not take into account the additional problem for Whitehall of dealing with the many complications of Covid-19. As previously disclosed by the Guardian, government departments have spent more than £56m on consultancy firms to help deal with the pandemic, mostly without giving other companies the chance to compete for the work.
Neither Brexit nor Covid-related turmoil can be guaranteed to subside for at least six months and could continue for longer. So how might Agnew and minister for the cabinet office Michael Gove force the government machine to move away from its reliance on management consultants and instead learn to love its employees? Given the declared mission of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings to take on senior civil servants, this may be a harder task than first imagined. Cummings has made no secret of his plans to shake up the structures of Whitehall or challenge what he perceives as “group think” among public servants. In January, he went as far as to plead for “misfits” with odd skills to apply for jobs. And in the meantime, five leading senior civil servants including the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill and four permanent secretaries have left Whitehall this year, with colleagues claiming they were forced out. One union representative said that there was a contradiction in the faith that Agnew has expressed in the civil service and the obvious distrust that Cummings has voiced. “It is not surprising that the government has turned to management consultants because the civil service has been dealing with huge and complex changes because of Brexit and rapid changes in government. Back-up was needed,” said Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union which represents civil servants. “But there does seem to be a conflict in the statements that civil servants have heard from Lord Agnew and those that have come from Cummings and his friends. Does the government trust the civil service or not?” Some within the government believe that Lord Francis Maude, who reformed Whitehall under David Cameron, could be the person to draw up a plan to a move away from reliance on consultants. The minister in charge of the Cabinet Office between 2010-15 has been asked to review the central department’s performance and its relationship with the rest of Whitehall following concerns that the department has failed to cope during the coronavirus crisis. A Whitehall source said the Cabinet Office would address issues around the use of outside consultants but challenged claims that Cummings had expressed hostility towards the civil service. “Dom regularly recognises and champions brilliance in the civil service,” the source said. • The headline of this article was amended on 7 October 2020 to better reflect the piece."
2020-10-06T23:01:45Z,politics,Politics,MP Margaret Ferrier attended church the day after Covid test,"The Roman Catholic church in Glasgow has expressed its “disappointment” after it was reported that the SNP MP Margaret Ferrier attended a church service and gave a reading to the congregation the day after she took a test for coronavirus. Ferrier has faced a barrage of criticism and calls for her to stand down after revealing last Thursday that she travelled to London and spoke in the Commons while awaiting the result of a coronavirus test, then returned by train from London to Scotland after testing positive. The Daily Record newspaper reported on Tuesday morning that Ferrier attended a mass at St Mungo’s Church in Townhead, Glasgow, on Sunday 27 September, the day after she took the test. She is also believed to have given a Bible reading from the altar. The MP’s social media posts also show that she visited a gift shop, a beauty salon and a leisure centre in her constituency on Saturday 26 September, the day she developed symptoms and took the test. Responding to the report, the archdiocese of Glasgow said: “For the good of the whole community, it is important that anyone who is required to self-isolate does so in accordance with the government’s guidance, so anyone in that situation should not attend mass. It is disappointing if this has not happened but we would like to reassure people that we fulfil all the government and church guidelines.” The church’s website states public mass is limited to 50 people and those who are shielding, self-isolating or feel unwell should not not attend.
The SNP moved quickly to suspend Ferrier on Thursday night, with the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, continuing to call on her former colleague to “do the right thing” at her daily briefing on Monday, while constituents and colleagues have expressed their disappointment and anger. The Rutherglen Reformer published a furious open letter to Ferrier, the local MP, on the front page of Wednesday’s edition, calling for her to resign “before you become a social pariah and not just a political one”. The Reformer said it has been inundated with messages from angry readers. But friends are believed to be encouraging Ferrier to take time before reaching her decision, pointing to other former SNP MPs who stayed on as independents as well as the former finance minister Derek Mackay, who remains an MSP eight months after he was suspended following reports that he sent inappropriate messages to a 16-year-old boy on social media. Writing in the National on Monday, the former MP George Kerevan claimed Ferrier was a victim of a trial by media fuelled by “virtue signallers” in his own party. Supporters of Ferrier’s also pointed to an email issued by parliamentary authorities to MPs and other workers in the parliamentary estate on Monday as evidence Ferrier may not have fallen foul of the rules when she took a train back to Glasgow. It advised workers in the Palace of Westminster that if they develop symptoms of Covid or receive a positive test result they should make their way home immediately and “use private transport to travel whenever possible” but added they could use “public transport wearing a face covering there is no alternative”. Opposition parties have questioned why the SNP has not expelled Ferrier. Also on Monday, the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said: “If the SNP expect the public to keep making sacrifices, they’ve got to take action; warm words won’t cut it. It’s baffling that they’re still dragging their heels. Margaret Ferrier knowingly went on public transport with Covid, recklessly risking the lives of others. This is not a trial by media. It’s a trial by her own sheer stupidity and there is no doubt she’s guilty, so the SNP must expel her.” As well as the police, Ferrier has referred herself to the Commons standards commissioner but it is not expected to conclude its investigation for some time. The shortest investigation it has undertaken took two weeks. If the standards investigation results in suspension from the house for 10 days or more, this would trigger a recall petition, which would allow her constituents to decide whether they want a byelection. On Wednesday afternoon, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will host an online Call Keir session with voters in Ferrier’s constituency. Ferrier’s office has been approached for comment."
2020-10-06T18:24:52Z,politics,Politics,Brexit drives government consultancy fees to £450m in three years,"The scale of the government’s reliance on management consultants has been laid bare as analysis shows that spending with eight top firms has risen by 45% to more than £450m in three years. Deloitte, the professional services firm, was the biggest winner, earning fees of £147m from public funds in 2019-20, compared with £40m two years earlier, amid a bonanza related in large part to Brexit.
The Home Office had the biggest increase in consultancy spending over three years, jumping 788% to £57m as the department dealt with security, immigration and border preparations for leaving the EU. The results of the analysis of more than 11,000 government invoices came on Tuesday as Boris Johnson promoted the private sector, saying “free enterprise” must lead the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. In his speech to Conservative party conference, the prime minister sounded a warning about the extent of state intervention on schemes such as furlough and said: “There comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it. We must not draw the wrong economic conclusion from this crisis.” However, last week the minister in charge of curbing Whitehall spending, Theodore Agnew, wrote a letter to senior civil servants saying the civil service had become “infantilised” by an “unacceptable” reliance on expensive management consultants. While 1% of civil servants are paid more than £80,000 a year, day rates for management consultants working in the public sector range from about £1,000 for junior consultants to about £3,500 for partners. Research carried out by the data provider Tussell has identified how much each of the government’s ministries has spent with eight consultancies between 2017-18 and 2019-20.
The highest-spending department on consultancies in the last financial year was the Department for Transport, which has paid out £88m, a three-year increase of 156%. The Cabinet Office, the department from which Lord Agnew and his close political ally Michael Gove oversee civil service expenditure, has nearly trebled its spending on outside consultancies over three years to reach £37m, the analysis showed. The Department for International Development spent £67m on management consultancies in 2019-20 while the Ministry of Defence, which has been criticised in the past for its reliance on contractors, cut expenditure on consultancies from £93m in 2017-18 to £58m this year. Deloitte appears to be the preferred consultants for the Home Office, having received £73m out of £110m spent on external advisers since 2017-18. Although many of the Home Office contracts are related to Brexit, the biggest Deloitte contract with the department is £60m, spent on the Emergency Services Network. PricewaterhouseCoopers was the second biggest-earning consultancy from the public purse last year, receiving £106m, according to the analysis. It has earned a total of £294m over three years. The data shows that PwC was paid £32m by the Cabinet Office over three years out of a total departmental spend on the eight consultancies of £121m. Over that period, PwC has recruited key figures who know the Cabinet Office well, including Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, and Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary who held senior positions across Whitehall.
The Ministry of Defence appears to have a close relationship with KPMG, having paid the firm £76m out of a total consultancy spend of £203m between April 2017 and March 2020. Several senior figures have left the MoD to become paid advisers to KPMG, including Air Marshal Sir Simon Bollom who left his job as chief of materiel (air) in defence equipment and support in 2016 and soon after advised the management consultancy on RAF Brize Norton. He has now returned to the MoD as the chief executive of defence equipment and support. Over the last year, EY earned fees across Whitehall worth £75m, while KPMG was paid £57m from government departments, according to the analysis. The other four major consultancies – PA Consulting, McKinsey, BCG and Bain & Co – signed deals worth a total of £76m last year, the analysis showed. Management consultants are typically brought in where it is thought specialist advice or expertise is needed, but there have been longstanding concerns over the extent of their use in the public sector. Many senior civil servants or ministers work for consultancy firms at some stage in their career, so there are often strong personal links or relationships between staff on both sides. Cabinet Office data reported by the National Audit Office last year showed a significant drop in spending on consultants after the introduction of new controls in 2010, from almost £2bn in 2009-10 to £400m-£700m in each of the following six years. A spokesperson for Deloitte said: “We are confident that our work adds significant value to the public sector organisations we work with. “Deloitte works closely with the Home Office, its agencies and police forces, assisting on their largest and most complex programmes and building and delivering new technologies.” A PwC spokesperson said the firm follows all relevant rules and regulations when employing former politicians and civil servants. “We are brought in to provide specialist skills at speed where the breadth and depth of our experience makes a positive difference. We work alongside public sector clients to help tackle complex problems and situations where our expertise is needed,” he said. A government spokesperson said they did not recognise some of the figures in the analysis. “We continue to take considerable steps to reduce unnecessary spending and protect taxpayers’ money,” they said. “Ministers are concerned that the government is too reliant on consultants and have written to departments to make clear that services should only be procured when external expertise is essential and represents value for money. Where possible, we want to harness the wide range of skills within the civil service.” KPMG declined to comment. EY has been approached for comment."
2020-10-06T18:18:39Z,politics,Politics,"Covid can change UK like 'new Jerusalem' of 1940s, Johnson claims","Boris Johnson claimed the “ructions” of the Covid pandemic can pave the way for a transformation akin to the “new Jerusalem” pledged by the postwar cabinet as he sought to restore Tory morale with an upbeat party conference speech. With Keir Starmer’s Labour party gaining in the polls, and mounting disquiet among colleagues over Johnson’s handling of the pandemic, the prime minister used his set-piece speech to set out an optimistic vision of change. Delivering his address to the virtual conference, the prime minister said the UK was and would be “the greatest place on Earth”, and that it was “the measure of the greatness of this country that we are simply not going to let [the pandemic] hold us back or slow us down”. But Labour accused him of failing to acknowledge the scale of the challenge. The party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “The British people needed to hear the prime minister set out how he and his government will get a grip of the crisis. Instead we got the usual bluster and no plan for the months ahead.” Johnson said he was confident Britain would “repel” the virus, “just as this country has seen off every alien invader for the last thousand years” but he insisted there must be no return to “normal”. “After all we have been through, it is not enough just to go back to before. We have lost too much, we have mourned too many,” he said. “We have been through too much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quo and to think that life can go on as before the plague, and we will not.” In a speech that pledged investment in wind power and electric vehicles, a focus on homebuilding and home ownership, and made a staunch defence of the private sector, he said the government would: Fix care home funding, hinting at the prospect of an insurance-style model. Explore the value of one-to-one teaching, both for pupils falling behind and those with exceptional abilities. Encourage 95% mortgages to help young people on to the housing ladder. Invest in high-skilled, green-collar jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy, and in carbon capture and storage. Comparing the crisis to devastating wars and famines, he said: “History teaches us that events of this magnitude … they don’t just come and go. They are more often than not the trigger for social and economic change.” “In the depths of the second world war, in 1942, when just about everything had gone wrong, the government sketched out a vision of the postwar new Jerusalem that they wanted to build. And that is what we are doing now – in the teeth of this pandemic,” he went on to say. Downing Street was unable to offer any details about the policies announced, including the plan for funding social care which Johnson first claimed to have “prepared” when he arrived at No 10 last July. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, who was energy secretary in the coalition government, said: “Johnson’s plans were unambitious at best – the money being spent on wind power is just a fraction of what is needed to ensure we achieve a green recovery. Equally, it is more than ironic for the prime minister to cast himself as the saviour of the care sector, given the treatment of carers by his government during this crisis.” The prime minister also faced down his critics over questions about his own health. “I’ve read a lot of nonsense recently about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo,” he said, calling the claims “self-evident drivel” and “propaganda you’d expect from people who don’t want the government to succeed”. However, he said he was “too fat”, which had exacerbated the disease – he has since lost 26lbs (11.8kg) – and he compared his condition to the UK economy. “The UK economy had some chronic underlying problems: long-term failure to tackle the deficit in skills, inadequate transport infrastructure, not enough homes people could afford to buy – especially young people – and far too many people, across the whole country, who felt ignored and left out, that the government was not on their side. And so we cannot now define the mission of this country as merely to restore normality.” Johnson said he would stop the criminal justice system from being “hamstrung by what the home secretary would doubtless, and rightly, call the lefty human rights lawyers and other do-gooders”, triggering fury in the legal profession. While he said the private sector will be at the forefront of the economic recovery, his speech outlined many new public spending commitments including the introduction of one-to-one teaching for both gifted and struggling students, and the overhaul of social care. “We will fix the injustice of care home funding, bringing the magic of averages to the rescue of millions,” he said. “Covid has shone a spotlight on the difficulties of that sector in all parts of the UK, and to build back better we must respond; care for the carers as they care for us.” However, he said free enterprise would be at the heart of future growth, a key theme of previous Johnson speeches, and sounded an early warning about the extent of state intervention on schemes such as furlough. He said Rishi Sunak had “done things that no Conservative chancellor would have wanted to do except in times of war or disaster”. “There comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it,” he said. “We must not draw the wrong economic conclusion from this crisis.” He said the state would help the private sector by “becoming more competitive, both in tax and regulation”. The prime minister also set out plans briefed by Downing Street overnight to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade, a move he said would create “hundreds of thousands, if not millions of jobs” in the next decade. He added that the UK would “become the world leader in low-cost, clean power generation – cheaper than coal and gas”, comparing its offshore wind resources to Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth. Downing Street said the initial investment would rapidly create about 2,000 construction jobs and enable the sector to support up to 60,000 jobs directly and indirectly by 2030 in ports, factories and the supply chains. In a nod to Tory backbenchers who have threatened to vote down any future curbs on freedoms because of the pandemic, Johnson said he hoped there would be no more restrictions on daily life by the time of the next Conservative conference in 2021. Hours after his speech, 12 Conservative MPs voted against approving the “rule of six” regulation which limits social gatherings. Rebels included the chair and a vice-chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady and Charles Walker, a select committee chair Huw Merriman and the former cabinet minister Esther McVey. Johnson is likely to face more opposition when MPs are due to approve the 10pm curfew. Tory MPs and the Labour frontbench have called on the government to publish further evidence of its effectiveness. The Tory former minister Steve Baker said people were being “destroyed by this lockdown, strong, confident people, outgoing people, gregarious people … reduced to repeated episodes of tears on the phone”."
2020-10-06T17:38:10Z,politics,Politics,Up to 2m UK lambs may 'go to waste' under no-deal Brexit,"Sheep farmers are likely to be among the worst hit if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, farmers have said, with estimates showing that as many as 2 million lamb carcasses could go to waste and thousands of farmers could go out of business. The EU is the UK’s biggest export market for lamb with no other farming sectors as reliant on that market, making it the most exposed to economic harm if tariffs are imposed. While about 82% of annual beef exports from the UK are sold in the rest of Europe, along with about 78% of the dairy produce not consumed in the UK, 90% of all lamb and other sheep meat exports go to the EU. Estimates by the Country Land and Business Assocation show that if exports remain around the same level as last year, but tariffs are imposed, about 3 million lamb carcasses normally destined for export to the EU would not find a market there. Sarah Hendry, the director general of the CLA, which represents 30,000 UK landowners and rural businesses, said many farmers could be forced to give up their livelihoods if tariffs followed a no-deal Brexit. “Many farmers are under the most enormous pressure,” she said. “They fed the nation through lockdown and are readjusting their business for a new life outside the common agricultural policy. Now many face the complete collapse of their market.” She called for the government to put emergency financial support in place for farmers facing potential ruin if there is no deal with the EU. “If the EU imposes tariffs, many farmers will no longer have customers for their produce, and their businesses could easily collapse,” she said. “Lamb is one of the most obvious sectors to be hit, and a no-deal could see them affected in spring next year when they go to market.” Some unsold lambs would return to the UK market, where they would depress prices and leave thousands of farmers facing hardship and potentially going out of business. Even if UK lamb consumption increased, and as many unsold carcasses as possible were put in cold storage, the CLA estimates that up to 2 million could go to waste. Farmers will struggle to find a market in the UK for their smaller lambs, in particular, as the whole carcasses are often sold as a delicacy in the rest of Europe, unlike in the UK where cuts from larger animals are preferred. The prospect of steep tariffs being imposed comes after a year in which, for many, lockdown meant the loss of crucial catering and restaurant markets and a scramble to find other ways to get their produce to market. Extreme weather, including the wettest February on record followed by one of the driest springs, has also made for a poor harvest of some staples, with wheat yields plunging by close to a third. Farmers who have diversified into other businesses, such as opening B&Bs, campsites or farm visits, have also had a rollercoaster year. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are fully committed to agreeing a trade deal with the EU from 1 January 2021. However, as any responsible government would, we are also preparing for the possibility of no deal, and have contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for the farming sectors as much as possible. “No decisions have been taken on any sector specific interventions, including the sheep sector, post the end of the transition period. Any possible intervention must be dictated by the actual market situation at the time.”"
2020-10-06T17:22:23Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: daily UK Covid cases continue to soar, rising by almost 2,000 to 14,542 – as it happened","Coronavirus cases are continuing to soar, with todayâ€™s figures showing the UK total at 14,542 - almost 2,000 more than yesterday and a new daily high. (See 4.32pm.) Boris Johnson has said the UK must not return to the status quo after the coronavirus pandemic, promising a transformation akin to the â€œnew Jerusalemâ€� the postwar cabinet pledged in 1945. Additional coronavirus restrictions to be announced in Scotland on Wednesday will not amount to another lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon has said, moving to reassure the public that the country would not be â€œgoing back to Marchâ€�. Some Tory MPs have been using a debate in the Commons to express concern about the operation of the rule of six. In the debate, which is still going on, the health minister Helen Whately has come under repeated pressure to explain why children are included in Englandâ€™s rule of six, when that is not the case in Scotland or Wales. She was also asked to produce evidence that the rule is having an impact. Sir Christopher Chope told her she had failed to justify the law. Weâ€™re talking about draconian powers which are restricting the liberty of the British citizen, we shouldnâ€™t be introducing draconian powers without the strongest possible justification - I donâ€™t think the minister has set out any justification in her remarks. A vote is likely soon, but any backbench revolt tonight is expected to be minimal. Ministers are much more worried about what would happen in a vote on the compulsory 10pm closing time, which is deeply unpopular with Conservative and, unlike the rule of six, also opposed in its current form by Labour. The head of the International Monetary Fund has said the recovery in the global economy since the spring is fragile and warned Rishi Sunak and his fellow policymakers against an over-hasty withdrawal of support. A ban on residential school trips risks an â€œeconomic, social and cultural disasterâ€� and the loss of 15,000 UK jobs unless it is lifted by spring, ministers are being warned. Students in lockdown must have access to food and basic toiletries, university leaders have said, as the government made deliveries of just one litre of hand sanitiser to campuses in England. The Roman Catholic church in Glasgow has expressed its â€œdisappointmentâ€� after it was reported that the SNP MP Margaret Ferrier attended a church service and gave a reading to the congregation the day after she took a test for coronavirus. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-10-06T16:06:43Z,politics,Politics,Johnson does the Tory conference shuffle but misses his audience,"Boris Johnson’s Tory predecessors tried to add pizzazz to their conference speeches by declaiming them while striding up and down without notes, or in Theresa May’s case, bopping on to the platform to Abba’s Dancing Queen. But without the buzz of a live audience to perform to, Johnson went for the more traditional approach of shuffling through the pages of a printed script – on which, aides say, he likes to scrawl last-minute changes. When he appears at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons, Johnson’s notes often include a small photo of the backbench MP whose query he is due to answer, in an attempt to help him create a personal note. Without an audience, he was left instead to direct his upbeat promise to rebuild Britain beyond Covid straight into the camera and press on immediately after making jokes, instead of waiting for Conservative members to collapse into guffaws. Despite his brush with coronavirus, Johnson arguably sounded healthier than May during her 2017 conference speech, when she coughed incessantly, was handed a fake P45 by a comedian and ploughed on while the lettering fell off the conference backdrop. Afterwards, as the audience rose to applaud May – not least because they were glad the ordeal was over - television cameras captured then home secretary, Amber Rudd, ordering Johnson, sitting next to her in the front row, to “get up!”. The following year, May was comprehensively overshadowed by Johnson, who had resigned as foreign secretary and swept in to the Birmingham conference centre to deliver a packed-out speech trashing her Brexit plan. And last year, in Manchester, Johnson’s first speech as leader was frequently interrupted with bursts of applause, and peppered with jokes, including a promise to blast “communist cosmonaut” Jeremy Corbyn into space. A pre-election, pre-Covid crowd-pleaser – from a different age."
2020-10-06T15:23:33Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's tone-deaf lies fall flat as UK grows up | John Crace,"Even the very best conmen have their tells. Those little tics that give away the lies. And Boris Johnson has never been a particularly good conman. His tells are hidden in plain sight. The more pronounced the hand gesture, the greater the lie. You can just imagine the pounding the kitchen table must have got when he returned home after yet another IT lesson. But up until now, he’s got away with it – in his public life at least – because the country has been happy to collude with him. It wanted someone who could tell a few gags and promise that everything would be OK in the end. The narcissistic fantasist as national saviour. But the last eight months have changed all that. The country has grown up in the time of coronavirus. Tens of thousands have died; hundreds of thousands have become ill; millions are feeling frightened and insecure about their jobs. Yet even though the prime minister has had time to move on, he appears to have learned nothing. Boris may himself have wound up in intensive care, yet he still wants to be Mr Good Time Guy, with gags about losing weight and arm-wrestling. But it’s becoming more and more of a struggle. His eyes that used to sparkle from the acclaim are now mere dead hollows. It’s possible that not even Boris believes in Boris. The scepticism is contagious. These weren’t the circumstances in which he wanted to be making this year’s party conference speech. He needs to feed on the thrill of the lights, applause and laughter. But even if he had been addressing a full hall in Birmingham, rather than an empty cupboard, this would still have been the wrong speech at the wrong time. Seldom can someone have so badly misjudged the mood of an empty room. Boris began by saying that he and everyone else were fed up with the coronavirus and that he was working to get things back to normal, only to then contradict himself by saying there would be no going back to normal. Rather, it would be the trigger for major social and economic change. Try to think of the virus as an opportunity rather than a disaster. It wasn’t a million miles away from one of Donald Trump’s tweets. There was nothing on the toll the last eight months had taken. No apologies for government inaction, failure and incompetence that has seen the UK leap to near the top of the global Covid mortality scale. No mention of the black hole into which the “world-beating” test-and-trace app and Operation Moonshot have disappeared. Even more unforgivably, there was no acknowledgment that things could get much grimmer still over the next six months. More deaths, more local lockdowns, more confusing government guidelines and possibly millions of people being laid off as the furlough scheme ends. What Johnson wanted was a period of suspended animation from which we would awake into a “new Jerusalem”, as the postwar cabinet pledged in 1945. Of course, he was forgetting it was a national coalition that planned the rebuilding of a broken country and a Labour government that implemented it. From there on in we were into fantasy land with fantasy economics. The previous day, Rishi Sunak had said there were tough choices to be made and not all the manifesto promises could be delivered: Boris continued as though everything was still possible. Though none of it was costed. It was as if the prime minister was lazily running through a checklist of all the things he would quite like to happen. He was bored of talking about 40 new hospitals so now he was arbitrarily upping the number to 48. Social care would be fixed. He didn’t know how, but it would. The details were in the paper that he had said would be published a year ago but has yet to see the light of day. There would be so many teachers there would be one-to-one tuition for anyone who needed it. And the distinction between further and higher education was over because he had made a 15-minute speech about it last week. The bigger the lie, the harder Boris hit the lectern. Johnson then came to the top of the Santa wish list he had scrawled in front of him. Try to forget the next 10 years – too tricky and too much like hard work to experience – and imagine Britain totally reliant on offshore wind power. Yes, some people, including him, had rubbished the idea 20 years ago but now it was a possibility. Except even when he is telling a joke against himself he can’t resist lying. Because Boris hadn’t said 20 years ago that the idea was like “blowing the skin off a rice pudding”. He had said it seven years ago when he was the London mayor; about the same time Ed Miliband had been championing the green revolution. Boris was reinventing himself as Dr Feelgood again.
Thereafter, Boris just appeared to get a bit bored. Talking to a camera that stared back impassively was no substitute for the adrenaline hit of being on stage. Like Trump, he only knows he really exists when there are other people kissing his arse. So he took a sideswipe at “lefty, do-gooding human rights lawyers” – possibly the first time a party leader has spoken out against human rights in a conference speech – whittered on about home ownership and almost totally forgot to mention Brexit. After all, why bother? It wasn’t as if the negotiations were going badly or that people were worried about what a post-Brexit UK might look like. Having said almost nothing the country had actually wanted to hear for the past 25 minutes, Boris shuffled his papers and realised he had come to the end. “This is the moment when people would normally clap,” he said forlornly. But they were clapping, only he couldn’t hear the slow handclap. The conman can still just about con himself. But on this showing, not for much longer."
2020-10-06T14:58:12Z,politics,Politics,MI5 bill prompts rebellion by 20 Labour MPs against Starmer,"A total of 20 Labour MPs rebelled against the party leadership at the second reading of a bill confirming MI5’s right to let informants commit crimes in pursuit of intelligence material. Keir Starmer wanted his party to abstain on the security bill but the Socialist Campaign Group, led by the party’s former leader Jeremy Corbyn, defied the whip and voted against it on Monday night – the second rebellion in less than a fortnight. In the previous rebellion, on an armed forces bill that raised similar issues, 18 MPs including Corbyn, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, voted against. Three frontbenchers were fired as a result. On Monday, the bill passed at the second reading by 182 to 20. Labour sources had initially said the rebellion was 21 but the figure was first reported as 19, according to Hansard’s record of proceedings, including two tellers for those voting against. Labour’s Jon Trickett then said his vote against the bill had not been recorded because of an “admin error” and the tally was changed on Tuesday afternoon, taking the final total of rebels to 20. The overall vote result was also amended to 182 for to 21 against. Socialist Campaign Group sources had earlier predicted the number defying Starmer this time would be “in the low 20s” – about 10% of the parliamentary party – if Labour continued to insist that its MPs abstained. Rebel MPs said there should be clear rules governing what informants can do. Apsana Begum, a newly elected Labour MP, said: “Covert operations must have thorough oversight and clear parameters of limitation. The limits in this bill are vague.” Trickett, an MP close to Corbyn, said the bill “seeks to give legal cover to illegal undercover actions”. The Labour rebels were: Corbyn, Abbott, McDonnell, Begum, Trickett, Paula Barker, Olivia Blake, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Byrne, Ian Lavery, Grahame Morris, Kate Osamor, Kate Osborne, Zarah Sultana, Mick Whitley, Nadia Whittome, Beth Winter plus tellers Bell Riberio-Addy and Lloyd Russell-Moyle. None were on the frontbench and they would not be subject to any disciplinary proceedings from the whip’s office, party sources added. Frontbenchers said Labour, while abstaining, would make clear that it intended to put down amendments and seek further explanations and assurances as the bill completes its passage through the Commons. MI5 has long had a policy of allowing its officers and informants to participate in criminal activity if the offences involved are proportionate to the evidence gained, but at the end of last year a court ruled only narrowly that this was legal. As a result, ministers want to put the policy on the statute books for the first time, but human rights groups say there is too much ambiguity in the bill because it does not explicitly rule out serious crimes, such as murder, torture or sexual violence. The government says the covert human intelligence sources bill does not amount to a “licence to kill” because it will be compliant with the European convention on human rights, which safeguards the right to life and prohibits torture. Opening the debate, James Brokenshire, the security minister, said: “I know there are concerns about somehow providing a licence to kill or to commit torture. Let me be clear, there are upper limits to the activity that could be authorised under this bill and these are contained in the Human Rights Act.” Critics of the government point to the 1989 murder of Pat Finucane, a Belfast lawyer who was shot 14 times by loyalists at his family home in front of his wife and children, in an attack found to have involved British state collusion. It eventually led to an apology in 2012 from the then prime minister, David Cameron. MI5 says it has foiled 27 Islamist and rightwing terrorism plots since 2017 in conjunction with the police, and some of the operations have required the help of confidential informants who have broken the law. Naa’imur Zakariyah Rahman was jailed for life in 2018 for plotting to kill Theresa May, Cameron’s successor as prime minister. Rahman was caught after an undercover operation in which he was provided with what he thought was a jacket and rucksack packed with explosives. In last month’s Labour rebellion, three junior frontbenchers – Whittome, Winter and Blake – lost their posts after voting against the overseas operations bill. That legislation aims to introduce a presumption against prosecution for British soldiers serving abroad. • This article was updated on 6 October 2020. An earlier version said that “more than 20 Labour MPs were expected to ignore the party whip”. In fact the number who did so was 20."
2020-10-06T14:10:43Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: UK must not return to status quo after Covid-19 pandemic,"Boris Johnson has said the UK must not return to the status quo after the coronavirus pandemic, promising a transformation akin to the “new Jerusalem” the postwar cabinet pledged in 1945. The prime minister also mounted a robust defence of the private sector, saying “free enterprise” must lead the recovery and that that he intended to significantly roll back the extraordinary state intervention the crisis had necessitated. In a markedly upbeat speech, Johnson said the UK was and would be “the greatest place on Earth”, and that it was “the measure of the greatness of this country that we are simply not going to let [the pandemic] hold us back or slow us down”.
Speaking at the Conservative party’s virtual conference, the prime minister said the “ructions” caused by the pandemic would lead to a transformation of the UK by 2030, with mass home ownership, electric vehicles, better broadband and blue passports. “After all we have been through, it is not enough just to go back to before. We have lost too much, we have mourned too many,” he said. “We have been through too much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quo and to think that life can go on as before the plague, and we will not.” In a speech that pledged to invest millions in wind power and electric vehicles, and a new settlement for care homes and homebuilding, he said the country would “learn and improve on the world that went before”. Among the key pledges in the speech, Johnson said the government would: Fix care-home funding, hinting at the prospect of an insurance-style model Explore the value of one-to-one teaching, both for pupils falling behind and those with exceptional abilities Encourage 95% mortgages to help young people on to the housing ladder Invest in high-skilled, green-collar jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy, and in carbon capture and storage Comparing the crisis to devastating wars and famines, he said: “History teaches us that events of this magnitude … they don’t just come and go. They are more often than not the trigger for social and economic change. That’s what we’re doing now, in the teeth of this pandemic. We’re resolving not to go back to 2019 but to do better.” The prime minister also faced down his critics over questions about his own health. “I’ve read a lot of nonsense recently about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo,” he said, calling the claims “self-evident drivel” and “propaganda you’d expect from people who don’t want the government to succeed”. However, he said he was “too fat”, which had exacerbated the disease, and he compared his condition to the UK economy. “The UK economy had some chronic underlying problems: long-term failure to tackle the deficit in skills, inadequate transport infrastructure, not enough homes people could afford to buy – especially young people – and far too many people, across the whole country, who felt ignored and left out, that the government was not on their side. And so we cannot now define the mission of this country as merely to restore normality.” Reiterating his pledge to recruit 20,000 new police officers, Johnson criticised the legal profession, saying his government would stop the criminal justice system from being “hamstrung by what the home secretary would doubtless, and rightly, call the lefty human rights lawyers and other do-gooders”. Though Johnson underlined how he expected the private sector to be at the forefront of the economic recovery, his speech outlined many new public spending commitments – including the introduction of one-to-one teaching for both gifted and struggling students, as well as the overhaul of social care. “We will fix the injustice of care-home funding, bringing the magic of averages to the rescue of millions,” he said. “Covid has shone a spotlight on the difficulties of that sector in all parts of the UK, and to build back better we must respond; care for the carers as they care for us.” However, he said free enterprise would be at the heart of future growth, a key theme of previous Johnson speeches, and sounded an early warning about the extent of state intervention on schemes such as furlough. He said Rishi Sunak had “done things that no Conservative chancellor would have wanted to do except in times of war or disaster”. “There comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it,” he said. “We must not draw the wrong economic conclusion from this crisis.” He said the state would help the private sector by “becoming more competitive, both in tax and regulation”. The prime minister also set out plans briefed by Downing Street overnight to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade, a move he said would create “hundreds of thousands, if not millions of jobs” in the next decade. He added that the UK would “become the world leader in low-cost, clean power generation – cheaper than coal and gas”, comparing its offshore wind resources to Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth. Johnson was a prominent critic of wind power during his career as a columnist, and joked in his speech that “some people used to sneer at wind power 20 years ago and say that it wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”, a phrase he himself used. Downing Street said the initial investment would rapidly create about 2,000 construction jobs and enable the sector to support up to 60,000 jobs directly and indirectly by 2030 in ports, factories and the supply chains. In a nod to Tory backbenchers who have threatened to vote down any future curbs on freedoms because of the pandemic, Johnson said he hoped there would be no more restrictions on daily life by the time of the next Conservative conference in 2021. “I don’t know about you, but I have had more than enough of this disease that attacks not only human beings but so many of the greatest things about our country – our pubs, our clubs, our football, our theatre and all the gossipy gregariousness and love of human contact that drives the creativity of our economy,” he said. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “The British people needed to hear the prime minister set out how he and his government will get a grip of the crisis. Instead we got the usual bluster and no plan for the months ahead. “We end this Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system, millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of this virus and is holding Britain back.”"
2020-10-06T13:50:37Z,politics,Politics,What did Boris Johnson's conference speech really mean?,"Boris Johnson’s speech at Conservative conference drew on a number of themes, and was as notable for what it did not talk about as what it did. Here were the main ideas, and the arguments behind them. Coronavirus What he said: “I don’t know about you, but I have had more than enough of this disease that attacks not only human beings, but so many of the greatest things about our country.” The background: Conference speeches tend to be light on detail, and Johnson’s survey of Covid-19 was a particularly blancmange-like mix of jokes about visor-wearing hairdressers dressed “as though they are handling radioactive isotopes” and a sober acknowledgement that the UK has “mourned too many”. The PM was keen to stress his hope for a relatively quick return to a more normal life, and the watching Tory faithful would expect the speech to focus more on optimism than specifics about test-and-trace. But Johnson has previously been bullish about an end to many restrictions by Christmas, which is very obviously not going to happen. There are only so many more times he can get by just on blithe confidence. A post-Covid world What he said: “In the depths of the second world war, in 1942, when just about everything had gone wrong, the government sketched out a vision of the postwar new Jerusalem that they wanted to build. And that is what we are doing now – in the teeth of this pandemic.” The background: Johnson is the latest politician to make this parallel. Ed Miliband summoned up the image of the reforming Clement Attlee government as a model for a green transformation for the economy. The PM was less specific, mainly saying a key goal would be to boost growth. It was notable how he compared this with the last “12 years of relative anaemia” – 10 of which have been under Conservative prime ministers. His own health What he said: “I have read a lot of nonsense recently, about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo … I could refute these critics of my athletic abilities in any way they want: arm-wrestle, leg-wrestle, Cumberland wrestle, sprint-off, you name it.” The background: A good rule of thumb about whether criticism of a politician has hit home is how earnestly they rebut it. While Johnson was typically colourful in his language, this section shows how the PM is worried about the impression of someone waylaid by long-term symptoms following his serious brush with Covid-19. This ties into the narrative of a broad-focus leader for the good times struggling with the serious, detailed logistics of a global pandemic, and potentially set to stand down soon. Johnson spoke again how his weight could have exacerbated his symptoms, saying he has now shed almost two stone. Wind power and green issues What he said: “I can today announce that the UK government has decided to become the world leader in low cost clean power generation … and we believe that in 10 years’ time offshore wind will be powering every home in the country.” The background: Perhaps the one real policy idea in the speech, this was the element trailed in advance. While the amounts pledged so far have been dismissed as nowhere near enough for this wind-powered transformation, it is notable in the longer context for a Conservative leader to focus on clean energy, let alone wind turbines, which for years has been an object of derision, even hate, for many in the party. Role of the private sector What he said: “We must be clear that there comes a moment when the state must stand back and let the private sector get on with it … We must not draw the wrong economic conclusion from this crisis.” The background: A general nod to the concerns of the Tory faithful about the massive state response to the coronavirus pandemic and the colossal levels of borrowing this brought. Consider this just a statement of intent, and one which could easily get abandoned amid the tough economic realities of the coming months and years. Culture wars What he said: “We are proud of this country’s culture and history and traditions; they literally want to pull statues down, to rewrite the history of our country, to edit our national CV to make it look more politically correct.” The background: Complete with a dismissive mention of “lefty human rights lawyers and other do-gooders”, this was Johnson on what he still sees as strong political ground, contrasting his embrace of tradition with Labour’s supposed metropolitan effeteness on such matters. Whether it hits home is another matter, given Keir Starmer’s embrace of patriotism in his own conference speech, and the Labour leader’s disinclination to dig himself into the trenches on such issues. Brexit What he said: “Be in no doubt that they are secretly scheming to overturn Brexit and take us back into the EU.” The background: The dog that did not bark. Aside from this mention of Labour’s supposed – and not actually true – desire to stop Brexit, Johnson barely mentioned the defining issue of the 2019 election. Why? One possibility is the type of Brexit discussion that would thrill the watching membership might also annoy the EU at a crucial time for talks about a departure deal the PM still wants to seal. Policies What he said: “We will fix the injustice of care home funding, bringing the magic of averages to the rescue of millions” … “explore the value of one-to-one teaching, both for pupils who are in danger of falling behind, and for those who are of exceptional abilities” … “this government is pressing on with its plan for 48 hospitals – count them”. The background: Light on detail even by the standards of conferences speeches, the plan for care homes was, literally, just a sentence, and a particularly opaque one. Similarly, there were no clues about how one-to-one teaching could be funded, or achieved amid an ongoing recruitment shortfall. As of this week we do have some facts about the hospital building programme – that the majority will not happen until as late as 2030, and most projects are rebuilds or new wings."
2020-10-06T10:22:14Z,politics,Politics,Court to rule on UK freedom of information bids from overseas,"The rights of those living abroad to submit freedom of information requests are to be tested in court after more than a dozen cases – including one relating to Julian Assange’s extradition – were blocked. A combined hearing involving the Home Office, Metropolitan police, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and 13 separate cases is to be held at an information tribunal in London. At issue is whether applicants overseas are entitled to a response when submitting freedom of information requests to UK government departments and agencies. It is not clear who triggered the “stay” imposed on the 13 requests. The ICO has declined to comment. No date has been set for the case. The Cabinet Office, which has responsibility for FOI policy, says it complies with ICO guidance, which states: “Anyone can make a freedom of information request – they do not have to be UK citizens, or resident in the UK.” The tribunal, however, has told parties in the suspended cases that it has “decided to deal with the territorial scope” of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. All of the stayed FOI requests are from applicants not resident in Britain. The hearing will also examine whether there is a requirement that those who make FOI requests have a connection to the UK. “The main principle behind freedom of information legislation,” the ICO has said, “is that people have a right to know about the activities of public authorities, unless there is a good reason for them not to.” One of the blocked cases is an appeal by the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi, who works for daily newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano and writes about WikiLeaks. She has been pursuing information about how the Crown Prosecution Service dealt with its Swedish counterpart during initial attempts to extradite Assange to Sweden. Her work has been covered by the Guardian. Maurizi has also studied at Imperial College in London. Barristers Jennifer Robinson, who represents Assange, and Estelle Dehon, who specialises in freedom of information, are representing Maurizi. They have asked the tribunal to lift the stay and allow their appeals for the release of further information to proceed. They argue that Maurizi has worked on UK publications and has carried out investigations relating to the UK and UK citizens. She has also taken several other cases to information tribunal hearings. Dehon said commercial courts in England and Wales regularly deal with cases where people do not live in the UK. Maurizi, she added, had always acted responsibly in pursuing her cases. “Will this mean that if I’m a UK citizen and working abroad, say in Spain, I will be excluded from making any information requests?” Dehon suggested. Maurice Frankel, the director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: “The government has always acknowledged that the FOI Act was not restricted to British citizens or people living in the UK. “Government guidance issued just before the act came into force in 2005 said requests could be made by ‘any person, anywhere in the world’ and that has been the position of the information commissioner, tribunal and upper tribunal. Attempting to reverse it now might delay or block current appeals, for example on the Assange case, but will otherwise be pointless.” A government spokesperson said: “We are aware of these cases and will continue to comply with ICO guidance and the outcome of the tribunal.”"
2020-10-06T07:21:49Z,politics,Politics,"Covid: how Excel may have caused loss of 16,000 test results in England","A million-row limit on Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software may have led to Public Health England misplacing nearly 16,000 Covid test results, it is understood. The data error, which led to 15,841 positive tests being left off the official daily figures, means than 50,000 potentially infectious people may have been missed by contact tracers and not told to self-isolate. PHE was responsible for collating the test results from public and private labs, and publishing the daily updates on case count and tests performed. But the rapid development of the testing programme has meant that much of the work is still done manually, with individual labs sending PHE spreadsheets containing their results. Although the system has improved from the early days of the pandemic, when some of the work was performed with phone calls, pens and paper, it is still far from automated.
In this case, the Guardian understands, one lab had sent its daily test report to PHE in the form of a CSV file – the simplest possible database format, just a list of values separated by commas. That report was then loaded into Microsoft Excel, and the new tests at the bottom were added to the main database. But while CSV files can be any size, Microsoft Excel files can only be 1,048,576 rows long – or, in older versions which PHE may have still been using, a mere 65,536. When a CSV file longer than that is opened, the bottom rows get cut off and are no longer displayed. That means that, once the lab had performed more than a million tests, it was only a matter of time before its reports failed to be read by PHE. Microsoft’s spreadsheet software is one of the world’s most popular business tools, but it is regularly implicated in errors which can be costly, or even dangerous, because of the ease with which it can be used in situations it was not designed for. In 2013, an Excel error at JPMorgan masked the loss of almost $6bn (£4.6bn), after a cell mistakenly divided by the sum of two interest rates, rather than the average. The news led James Kwak, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut, to warn that Excel is “incredibly fragile”. “There is no way to trace where your data comes from, there’s no audit trail (so you can overtype numbers and not know it), and there’s no easy way to test spreadsheets, for starters. The biggest problem is that anyone can create Excel spreadsheets – badly. Because it’s so easy to use, the creation of even important spreadsheets is not restricted to people who understand programming and do it in a methodical, well-documented way,” Kwak wrote. Errors from the spreadsheet software have even changed the very foundations of human genetics. The names of 27 genes have been changed over the past year by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee, after Microsoft’s program continually misformatted them. The genes SEPT1 and MARCH1, for instance, have been changed to SEPTIN1 and MARCHF1 after they were repeatedly turned into dates, while symbols that were common words have been altered so that grammar tools didn’t autocorrect them: WARS is now WARS1, for instance."
2020-10-06T05:00:01Z,politics,Politics,Commons rebellions expected at votes on curfew and rule of six,"MPs could signal growing discontent with the government’s coronavirus restrictions at key votes on the regulations this week, amid growing calls for the government to publish the scientific advice behind the 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants in the UK. Conservative and Labour MPs have signalled they could withdraw backing for implementing the rule of six regulation and the curfew at votes expected this week. One senior Conservative MP said a small rebellion was expected on Tuesday on the rule of six statutory instrument – a retrospective vote on the implementation of the new measure under existing legislation. Another vote is expected by MPs to take place on Wednesday on the 10pm curfew – which could attract a more significant rebellion given the measure has also been criticised by the Labour frontbench. One source said it was likely to be “a major problem on the government side”. The government has not yet confirmed that vote will go ahead. The government would not be expected to lose the vote – but should it do so the legislation ordering pubs and restaurants to close at 10pm would expire. MPs are also likely to use the vote as a platform to demand more scientific evidence to support the measure. “There is no basis for it, it is crippling the hospitality sector for no good reason and it chucks everyone out on the street at the same time,” one MP said. “Things could get interesting if the Labour frontbench decide not to support it.” A Labour source said no decision had been made. Johnson’s spokesman urged MPs to approve the measures. “The PM understands the frustrations that people have. But, as prime minister, he has to take a course of action that prevents the spread of the virus and therefore protects the NHS and saves lives,” the spokesman said. “What we are seeking to do is to get the right balance between protecting lives and livelihoods: which is why we’re trying to keep as much of the economy moving as we can. In terms of the rule of six, we think it gives clarity to the public, and is a sensible and helpful step in helping us to control the spread of the virus. He would urge all MPs to vote for it.” Last week, the government agreed a compromise deal with Tory MPs, up to 100 of whom had threatened rebellion on renewal of the Coronavirus Act, promising any new England or UK-wide restrictions would be put to a vote in advance. Downing Street said there was “regular engagement” with MPs on the issue, as well as with the chief whip.
A legal challenge has also been launched against the 10pm curfew, which demands to see the scientific advice behind the restriction. The owner of London nightclub G-A-Y, Jeremy Joseph, has said he is seeking a judicial review to overturn the curfew, writing to health secretary Matt Hancock with a formal challenge to obtain the scientific justifications for the policy. “This government has failed to show why the 10pm curfew was put in place and has published no scientific evidence to substantiate its implementation,” Joseph said.
The legal team has asked the government to highlight scientific evidence provided by Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) or other bodies and any impact assessment relating to the curfew by Tuesday. The Guardian revealed on Monday that the government is considering a draft proposal for a three-tier lockdown system, where the most strict measures would include closures of restaurants and pubs, as well as sports clubs. Should those measures be proposed they are also likely to prompt significant disquiet among Conservative MPs. In an interview on Monday, Johnson said it would become clearer over the coming days if the new measures like the curfew and the rule of six were having an effect on the case numbers. “The crucial thing is that in the next few days, week, we’ll see more clearly whether some of the restrictions that we put in – the extra enforcement of the rule of six, the extra enforcement of self-isolation, the rules on masks and so on – all the stuff that has come in, we’ll see whether that starts to work in driving down the virus,” he said."
2020-10-05T21:30:50Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to unveil plan to power all UK homes with wind by 2030,"Boris Johnson will promise to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade, pledging to make the coronavirus pandemic a catalyst for green growth. In a speech to the virtual Conservative party conference on Tuesday, he will say that the government will invest in a clean energy future to create “hundreds of thousands, if not millions of jobs” in the next decade. The prime minister said the UK would “become the world leader in low-cost clean power generation – cheaper than coal and gas”, comparing the UK’s resources in offshore wind to Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth. “We believe that in 10 years’ time offshore wind will be powering every home in the country, with our target rising from 30 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts,” he will say. “Your kettle, your washing machine, your cooker, your heating, your plug-in electric vehicle – the whole lot of them will get their juice cleanly and without guilt from the breezes that blow around these islands.” The government has come under fire in recent months for failing to set out plans for a green recovery that would put the UK on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Apart from £3bn for insulating homes, there were no green measures in the Covid-19 recovery plan. No 10 said the pledge was the first step in a 10-point “Build Back Greener” plan, which the prime minister would set out later in the year and includes new targets and investment into industries, innovation and infrastructure. The prime minister made no mention of onshore wind, which is the cheapest form of wind energy, but has been subject to stringent planning regulations brought in under David Cameron, which have meant few onshore turbines have been built in the UK in the last five years. Johnson will say that the government will invest £160m in manufacturing the next generation of turbines, including floating windmills capable of delivering 1GW of energy by 2030, over 15 times the current floating offshore volumes worldwide. Downing Street said the initial investment would rapidly create about 2,000 construction jobs and enable the sector to support up to 60,000 jobs directly and indirectly by 2030 in ports, factories and the supply chains. “Far out in the deepest waters we will harvest the gusts, and by upgrading infrastructure in places like Teesside and Humber and Scotland and Wales we will increase an offshore wind capacity that is already the biggest in the world,” Johnson is expected to say. “As Saudi Arabia is to oil, the UK is to wind – a place of almost limitless resource, but in the case of wind without the carbon emissions and without the damage to the environment.” In a tacit acknowledgment of how wind power has been controversial among the Conservative grassroots, Johnson said it had been used throughout key moments of British history. “I remember how some people used to sneer at wind power 20 years ago and say that it wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding,” he will say. “It was offshore wind that puffed the sails of Drake and Raleigh and Nelson, and propelled this country to commercial greatness.” Johnson said the target would help the UK reach its target of net zero by 2050 – a target which has been criticised by campaigners as under-ambitious.
Downing Street said new floating offshore technology would allow windfarms to be built further out to sea in deeper waters, boosting capacity even further where winds are strongest and ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of the next generation of clean energy. The boost for offshore wind was welcomed by green campaigners, who urged him to go further with his plans by providing incentives for electric vehicles and other low-carbon infrastructure. Caterina Brandmayr, head of climate at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “A green recovery is the best way to create jobs in every part of the UK, to lead the world in tackling climate change, and to protect our precious natural world. The race is now on for the government and British businesses to replicate the success story of offshore wind in electric vehicles, smart grid technology and future-proofed homes.” John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “If carried through, [the commitment] would help cement the UK’s global leadership in this key technology. But delivering 40 gigawatts of power on to the grid by 2030 requires action in this parliament. We now need to see the prime minister’s newly found enthusiasm is followed through by knocking down all the barriers that the offshore wind industry faces in delivering its ambition.” The UK is set to chair the next round of UN climate talks, Cop26, which have been delayed from November to next year because of the pandemic. Later this autumn, Johnson is expected to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, another step in the planned green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to end the sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 would put the UK ahead of France, which has a 2040 ban in the pipeline, and in line with Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. Norway will bring in a ban in 2025. The announcement of the Build Back Greener plan is tentatively scheduled for November and is expected to follow the advice set out by the Committee on Climate Change, including support for the UK’s nascent clean hydrogen industry to help cut carbon emissions from homes and heavy industry."
2020-10-05T18:49:49Z,politics,Politics,"NHS races to reach 50,000 Covid contacts missed in data blunder","Contact tracers are scrambling to reach up to 50,000 people who should be self-isolating after ministers were accused of “putting lives at risk” with a spreadsheet blunder that led to coronavirus cases going unreported. MPs from across the political spectrum rounded on the health secretary, Matt Hancock, after it emerged that official figures missed 15,841 positive results due to a “catastrophic” data error.
A million-row limit on Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software may have led to the error, which meant an estimated 50,000 people who were in close contact with someone with coronavirus had been circulating in the community for days when they should have been told to quarantine. About half of the 16,000 missed cases are thought to have been in north-west England, where the added cases saw Manchester’s infection rate double to more than 500 cases per 100,000 people as it became the worst-hit part of the country. Health officials were racing to track down contacts but only 51% of the 15,841 positive cases had been asked to hand over contact details by Monday morning, Hancock said. The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advises that all close contacts should isolate within 48 hours if contact tracing is to be effective.
Hancock told MPs: “This incident should never have happened. The team have acted swiftly to minimise its impact and now it is critical that we work together to put this right, and to make sure that it never happens again.” Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, had assessed the updated data, Hancock said, and concluded that no assessments of the spread of Covid had substantially changed. No local lockdowns would need to be reassessed, he added. Blaming a “failure in automated transfer for files”, Hancock said that no care homes, NHS sites or schools had been affected. But responding for Labour, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said up to 48,000 contacts had been missed over a period of days. “Thousands of people blissfully unaware they have been exposed to Covid, potentially spreading this deadly virus at a time when hospital admissions are increasing and we’re in the second wave,” Ashworth said. “This isn’t just a shambles. It’s so much worse than this. And it gives me no comfort to say it, but it’s putting lives at risk, and he should apologise when he responds.”
Hancock also faced some scepticism from his own benches over his argument that the data issue had been fixed and would not be repeated. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health committee, said the incident had shown an “underlying problem” of laboratories being overwhelmed by demand. Hunt told MPs the testing system should be fully revamped to shift testing for NHS and care staff to hospital and university laboratories, and warned Hancock against complacency. Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP who chairs the influential liaison committee, also called for a rethink, suggesting that the military could assist with the process. “This is another incident which further undermines public confidence in the delivery of the government’s Covid response. It is another example of where logistics and planning have let us down,” he said. Experts said the error could increase Britain’s already rising rate of infections and put extra pressure on a testing system in England that was buckling under the strain of demand.
“All those individuals with positive results that were not entered into the system have contacts who remained an infection risk to others over this period and so we can expect that they will have already contributed extra infections which we shall see over the coming week or so,” said Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University. Local leaders made fresh calls for more control over the testing system. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, accused ministers of a “pandemic of incompetence” that was damaging the region’s fragile economy. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, described the incident as “yet another catastrophic failure from an incompetent government that is moving recklessly from one avoidable disaster to another”.
The mistake arose during the data processing Public Health England (PHE) undertakes to ensure that people who have tested positive for coronavirus are only counted once, even if they have had two or more tests, as some people have. Referring to the idea that the error might have been caused by the use of Microsoft Excel files to transfer data, Ashworth asked Hancock why a complex system costing £12bn had used an off-the-peg programme. The health secretary said a new contract had been signed in August, and work was under way to replace the system. But Ashworth said the failure epitomised problems with test and trace: “The prime minister told this house on 20 May we would have a world-beating system in place by June. It’s now October. The system is neither competent nor improving. Problems are getting worse. The government is failing on the basics. When will he finally fix this mess?” The failure meant 22,961 Covid cases were reported in Sunday’s figures, after 12,872 on Saturday. The error also meant the information was not passed on to data dashboards used for contact tracing, PHE said. A further 12,594 people were reported on Monday to have tested positive."
2020-10-05T18:23:01Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit risks violence in Northern Ireland, MPs warn MI5","MI5 cannot afford to cut resources devoted to countering terrorism in Northern Ireland because of the risk of a rise in violence in the event of a hard or no-deal Brexit, parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) has warned. The watchdog said dissident republicanism remained resilient, actively recruiting young members, and could inflame further if “border infrastructure” were to reappear along the frontier with the Republic of Ireland. “Any infrastructure erected at the Irish border to handle customs or security checks would immediately become a target,” the cross-party committee said, “and would increase the risk of political violence in border areas.”
MI5 devoted 20% of its resources to countering terrorism in Northern Ireland in the year to March 2018 and the ISC said that “any change at this time would seem to be premature in the light of the uncertainty” posed by the looming conclusion of the Brexit trade negotiations this year. Although most of the terrorism threat in Northern Ireland comes from dissident republicans, the ISC also said Brexit could “reignite the threat from loyalist groups that have previously held a ceasefire”. Committee members sought reassurances from MI5 that it would be able to tackle a sudden deterioration in the security situation, although the agency’s full response was redacted. “I think we can be reasonably confident,” it began, before being cut off for security reasons. The UK, Ireland and the EU have all said they are well aware of the security risks if the Brexit talks were to breakdown to a point where a hard border would have to be reintroduced on the island of Ireland. A final deal has yet to be reached as negotiations on a trade deal reach their critical phase. Dissident republicanism is concentrated in four small groups, the most active of which is the New IRA, which admitted it was behind the killing of the journalist Lyra McKee, 29, who was shot dead in April 2019 while observing rioting in Derry. Despite public revulsion over the killing, the number of attacks has been increasing from very low levels. In 2018, only one dissident republican terrorist attack was carried out. Last year there were three successful attacks involving improvised explosive devices. One was a postal bomb sent to Heathrow airport that partially exploded. At least six others failed. The Labour MP Kevan Jones and the SNP MP Stewart Hosie, who served on the ISC during the last parliament when the report was largely written, said: “Northern Ireland-related terrorism has not gone away. The threat requires sustained pressure, more now than ever.” In September last year, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said he wanted to recruit 800 more officers to deal with a rise in paramilitary activity. A particular concern was the growing strength of the New IRA, which appeared to be consolidating some members from other dissident groups. The ISC – a special committee of MPs and peers – acts as the parliamentary watchdog of Britain’s spy agencies, including MI5."
2020-10-05T18:15:12Z,politics,Politics,Tory delegates and Covid counters caught up in the  circle of doom | John Crace,"Credit where credit’s due. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats realised that an online party conference was an accident waiting to happen and did as little as possible to promote them in advance. So they were both almost universally ignored. Which counts as a major PR result. The Conservatives, however, have rather more grandiose ambitions – though with a website that looks like it has been constructed by someone who has just failed their IT GCSE for the second time. Someone like Typhoid Dido Harding. If you’re lucky enough to be able to log on, then you’re more than likely to be misdirected to the wrong area of the conference. After a quick tour of the online exhibitors – most of which were unreachable through the website links – I found myself by accident in a fringe meeting on “levelling up” with Steve Barclay. At least that’s what the session was supposed to be about, but as the live stream buffered for five minutes I have no idea if Steve had any answers. Even worse, I couldn’t extract myself from the session without pressing control-alt-delete to deliberately crash my laptop, which meant that I missed the “fireside chat” with Gavin Williamson. Which was a shame as flogging fireplaces is his only known area of competence. Having logged back in, I did find momentary relief in being immediately directed to Thérèse Coffey in conversation in the main auditorium. The thought did occur to me that the only reason I had managed to access this session was because I was the only person in the entire country who was listening to it. I can’t remember a single word she said. There again, the only reason I was listening to her was because she had been chosen as the warm-up act for Rishi Sunak. But moments before he was due to speak, up came the circle of doom and the website died again. I tried to watch via the Twitter and Facebook streams but these two had also crashed. Once I was able to watch on catch up 30 minutes later, all became clear. The various conference platforms had been trying to do me a favour as the chancellor had literally nothing of any interest to say. His brief, entirely pointless 10-minute speech, felt like it had been cobbled together by a CCHQ random generator of platitudes that Tories had been focus-grouped to doze off to after a few drinks. Rishi began by praising Boris. Top bloke. People shouldn’t believe stories that the prime minister was narcissistic, lazy, entitled and out of his depth: he was really the most caring man in the entire country. Sunak knows he is the runaway favourite to be the next Tory leader and it’s not a good look to put the boot into Boris too soon in the piece. Far better to damn him with obviously unheart-felt flattery and obsequiousness. Then after modestly running through his own achievements, he declared it his intention to balance the books. Given that the chancellor has just spent more than £300bn on coronavirus bailout plans, it sounds as if we’re heading for massive tax rises or a return to austerity. Or maybe he hadn’t expected anyone to be still listening this far in to the speech and thought he could say any old bollocks. “I’m a pragmatist,” he concluded, apparently unaware that the rest of his party had been taken over by lunatic fanatics who would rather bankrupt the country than reach a sensible Brexit deal. Even Sunak looked slightly abashed at that. Where’s that buffering when you need it? With the Tories unable to even run a website for their own conference, it’s hardly surprising that between them Public Health England and NHS test and trace are unable to keep track of the number of coronavirus infections. Over the weekend it was revealed that roughly 16,000 cases went unreported – and more than 50,000 contacts not asked to self-isolate – so it was inevitable that Matt Hancock would have to abandon his comfy “why are you so marvellous?” conference conversation for a live gig in the Commons as he was summoned to make his usual Monday ministerial statement on why things had gone tits up again. Matt was not a happy Door Matt as he did his best to minimise the problem. The problem was just a minor technical issue, he insisted – 16,000 people were a drop in the ocean. Why couldn’t people concentrate instead on Project Orbis, his new brainwave to make sure people got their cancer treatment on time after we left the EU? Or the £3.7bn with which Boris was planning to build 40 new hospitals out of Lego? The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, also sounded more long-suffering than usual. Having to come back to the house week after week to find out why some other part of the world-beating coronavirus response isn’t working has left him equally enervated. Could Door Matt think of anything that had gone as planned, he enquired more or less courteously. And was there anyone in charge who knew what they were doing as it was clear that neither the health secretary, the prime minister or Typhoid Dido had a clue? At this point, the cocktail of valium and beta blockers that Hancock now needs for every appearance at the dispatch box began to kick in and he started rambling incoherently. There wasn’t a real problem because he had known about the Excel problem back in July and no one could expect Serco or any of the other private labs to install a simple system update in less than three months. So it was a legacy issue. And if a few extra people died because of the week’s delay in tracing contacts then it was no big deal. They too would have legacy issues. It’s not just Ashworth who is losing patience with Door Matt. The whole house is. Even Jeremy Hunt. And when the usually ineffectual chair of the health select committee has you in your sights, then you really are screwed. Hunt’s observation that the private labs couldn’t cope was one of the session’s understatements. Labour’s Stella Creasy picked up on the same theme: 50,000 people had been denied access to vital contact information because the system for which the country had been paying £12bn to private companies had not been working since July. Door Matt merely shrugged. It was time to think of the big picture and not just pick on the minor dysfunctional cogs in the wheel. Stella looked stunned and started laughing in disbelief. The health secretary not only considered 50,000 people to be justifiable collateral damage, he was unable to accept that test and trace had lurched from one shambles to another from the start. As with the Tory conference, the computer said no."
2020-10-05T18:04:23Z,politics,Politics,‘There should be fines’: east London shoppers on mask law,"In some of Barking’s busiest shops on Monday, dozens of customers browsed the aisles maskless and unchallenged. Even some security guards – who are being asked by the east London borough’s council to enforce the law requiring masks indoors – had their faces uncovered. Still others had pulled their coverings down to expose their noses and mouths as they browsed at close quarters in bustling supermarkets. Signage encouraging mask-wearing was sparse in many of the largest stores, while security presence in shop doorways was often barely noticeable. Some shoppers told the Guardian they thought mask-wearing was critical to protect the public and supported a council-led crackdown – though they said police should be the enforcers, not shop workers. “Personally, I think it is very important to wear a mask in shops and other places, especially when interaction with the public so that we protect other people,” said Nimisha Unnadkat.
The 54-year-old, who lives in the nearby borough of Havering and travels in for work, added: “A lot of people are not doing it and there should be fines imposed. The government should be doing that, not the police, not the shopkeepers etc. They are not in a position to do so. “You see people on public transport who do not seem to think it is necessary. If the central government is not with it, and the council want to do so to keep us safe, then I think they should be dealing with it because there needs to be some action.” Liam Kay, 71, from Beckton, agreed mask-wearing was essential, singling out the public transport network and shops. He thought it was so important that, while he was exempt from wearing one, he did so anyway. “When I see people walking about and they are not wearing a mask I think it is not fair,” he said. But he added: “I do see a lot of people but I do not say anything. It is very hard on people. They have had enough. They have been locked up in their houses for ages and I cannot blame them.”
He said he didn’t want the government to resort to stricter enforcement measures on face coverings, saying it would be difficult to build support. “But people should be wearing their masks because they are setting an example, not least for children. People should be more responsible.” But Peter Petrovich, 38, from Barking, said he thought it was too late to be worrying about masks. While he did comply with the rules himself, he said the mask failed to provide adequate protection against the virus and, if its widespread use was to make a real difference, it needed to have been promoted back in March. Feeling the material of his mask, as he spoke, he added: “The virus is so small, the mask will not protect us. I think it is to try to see if the people are listening to the government.”"
2020-10-05T18:04:09Z,politics,Politics,Row after London council is warned off enforcing mask rules in shops,"Ministers have been accused of putting the high street above public health after the business department warned council leaders against enforcing mask-wearing in supermarkets. Four retailers – Sainsbury’s, Lidl, Morrisons and B&M homeware stores – were issued with warning notices by Barking and Dagenham council in east London after their staff were seen failing to enforce mask-wearing and social distancing by customers. After the enforcement notices were issued under antisocial behaviour legislation, stores are understood to have complained to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). A senior official at BEIS then phoned the council and said it “did not have powers to enforce these guidelines using the government’s Covid-19 emergency powers” and that “the action had caused a negative reaction from the operators”, according to a letter of complaint from the council to Alok Sharma, the business secretary. The letter claims that the BEIS official, who said she was acting on behalf of Sharma, asked the council “to refrain from taking any further action against Lidl, B&M, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons supermarket operations.” The wearing of masks in shops was made compulsory in England from 24 July, with fines for non-compliance. But supermarkets said they would not be responsible for enforcing the law, despite calls from police representatives for them to eject shoppers who refuse. Research last month showed that mask-wearing in particular was causing social fractures. A poll of 10,000 people found that more than half of mask-wearers in Britain (58%) had severely negative attitudes towards those going maskless. Amid a sharp rise in coronavirus cases across the UK, Boris Johnson said last week that the country had become “blasé” about following restrictions designed to bring the pandemic under control, and a lack of enforcement was partly to blame. Speaking to the BBC, the prime minister said: “Everyone got a bit complacent and a bit blasé about transmission, and the rules on social distancing weren’t perhaps obeyed in the way they could have been or enforced in the way they could have been.” His father, the former MEP Stanley Johnson, has been pictured three times not wearing a mask or with one tucked under his chin in places where face coverings are required – in a London shop, a tube station and a Greek airport. Barking and Dagenham recorded a 65% increase in coronavirus cases last week. On 24-25 September, council enforcement officers issued community protection warning notices under the Anti-social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 to Lidl, Sainsburys, Morrisons stores, and three B&M branches. Seven other establishments in the borough including clubs and bars have been issued with closure notices after council enforcement officers gathered evidence that they were not Covid-compliant. The council said it was using antisocial behaviour legislation against retailers because the emergency Covid legislation did not give it the powers to take such action. The letter to Sharma, from the council leader, Darren Rodwell, said: “I am shocked that you appear to be taking the side of business interests over the health of our residents when they are clearly making no effort to comply with the very guidelines you introduced.” Meanwhile, a Cabinet Office official praised the council’s various anti-Covid initiatives, including the clampdown on the large retailers. An email said they were working with colleagues in the national resilience hub to support communication around enforcement of Covid-19 rules, adding: “I came across a few examples of the great work your council has been doing to crack down on this.” Rodwell said the council had received complaints from residents about large retailers not enforcing rules on face coverings and social distancing vigorously enough. He praised some supermarkets, including Asda and Aldi, for taking enforcement seriously. His letter added: “The approach taken by the council, under the 2014 act, is no different to any other premises in which people within a premises are engaged in criminal or antisocial activity, and the premises fails to reduce the occurrence of the problem, or adopts a ‘soft touch’ approach. “I have heard much said about it not being the role of a store worker to challenge members of the public and I am sympathetic to this. The council wrote similarly to the Asda supermarket in early September, which has resulted in positive steps being taken by Asda both locally and nationally, which we are extremely grateful for.” He said the council would only expect trained and qualified security staff to be responsible for refusing entry to mask-free customers. Rodwell told the Guardian: “It is important to put people before profit. A government official contacted us and asked us to back off from this enforcement. There are complaints from supermarkets that we were being too heavy-handed but I believe we were doing the right thing. “I find it unpalatable that the government talks about using the army and is paying so much money to the private sector when local authorities stand able and willing to assist.” A government spokesperson said: “People must wear a face covering by law in shops and supermarkets in England. They can be fined if they do not. “Shops and supermarkets are required by law to inform customers to wear a face covering, unless they have an exemption, through signs or when they enter the premises. This is enforced by local authorities and businesses risk facing a fine if they fail to do so. If customers refuse, the business can escalate to the police if needed.” A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “Safety is our highest priority. We are following government guidance closely and continue to remind customers to wear face coverings if they are able to. We have regular tannoy announcements, greeters outside our supermarket and posters including those provided by the council.” Lidl, Morrisons and B&M Stores were approached for comment."

The UK has recorded 12,594 new coronavirus cases. This is almost double the daily rate at which new cases were running at last week and, unlike the high figures published on Saturday and Sunday, it is not inflated by the inclusion of the cases that went missing because of the data error. (See 4.26pm.) Manchester now has its weekly new case rate running at more than 500 cases per 100,000 people after the figures were revised to include the data that went missing. (See 5.25pm.) Other towns and cities, particularly in the north of England, have seen their case rate figures jump significantly. These are from the BBC’s Daniel Wainwright.

2020-10-05T15:19:41Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel faces tribunal questioning over alleged bullying,"Priti Patel is facing the possibility of being questioned before a 10-day employment tribunal hearing next September after lawyers for her former permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam pushed forward with a claim for constructive dismissal. The home secretary, her department, and Downing Street are also being asked to disclose all correspondence related to Rutnam’s departure following claims that he was forced out of his job for intervening in her alleged bullying of fellow civil servants. A schedule for an employment tribunal has been sent to the Home Office’s lawyers which names the home secretary as the respondent, the Guardian understands. Both parties have been asked to exchange information on a voluntary basis by January. Witness statements are expected to be exchanged by July and the 10-day hearing is scheduled to take place from 20 September. The development will increase pressure on Patel, who has denied all allegations against her, and on Boris Johnson, who has publicly backed his home secretary. The government will resist any attempts to force Patel or Johnson to appear before the tribunal as witnesses, it is understood.
It is the first time that a secretary of state has been pursued to an employment tribunal by a former permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant in a government department. Patel is still the subject of a seven-month Cabinet Office inquiry, which has yet to be signed off by the prime minister, into her behaviour. Rutnam’s case is expected to focus on his claims that in late 2019 and early 2020, he challenged Patel’s alleged mistreatment of senior civil servants in the Home Office, and that he was then hounded out of his job through anonymous briefings. Reports claimed that a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel. She was also accused of successfully asking for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress. He also made clear that they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours. After a report in the Times highlighted tensions between Rutnam and Patel, sources close to Patel were quoted in several newspapers as saying that Rutnam should resign. An article in the Times said he should be stripped of his pension, another in the Telegraph said he was nicknamed Dr No for negative ideas, while one in the Sun compared him to Eeyore, the pessimistic donkey from Winnie the Pooh. At that time the prime minister’s official spokesman said Johnson had full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, reading a hastily arranged statement outside his home. In the statement, he accused Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department.
He is represented by Gavin Mansfield QC, the head of Littleton Chambers and an employment law specialist, and Clive Howard from the law firm Slater & Gordon. His legal case is being supported by the FDA union. Dave Penman, the union’s general secretary, claimed last week that the delay in publishing the seven-month bullying inquiry’s findings has eroded trust between ministers and senior civil servants. Rutnam is making a claim of “protected disclosure” under whistleblowing laws which means that instead of a ceiling of £85,000 on Rutnam’s claim, there will be no upper limit to any damages he might receive. Patel is expected to be asked to appear as a witness at the hearing by Rutnam’s lawyers. Sir Mark Sedwill, the then cabinet secretary, could also be asked to appear as Rutnam’s then line manager. The question of who will be a witness will be settled by the tribunal shortly before the hearing. The government and Rutnam did not respond to a request for a comment."
2020-10-05T14:28:48Z,politics,Politics,"Margaret Ferrier a victim of trial by media, says former SNP MP","A friend of the disgraced Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier and senior figure in the Scottish National party claimed on Monday that she had put her party first by travelling to Westminster while suffering from Covid. The former SNP MP George Kerevan said her decision to travel back to Glasgow after testing positive was an obvious “lapse of judgment” that put others in danger. But in a reflection of divisions within the party over her treatment he claimed she was a victim of a trial by media fuelled by “virtue signallers” in his own party. He came to her defence shortly after the leader of the party in Westminster, Ian Blackford, piled pressure on the MP to resign her Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat by saying she should do “the honourable thing” before being forced out. Blackford told the Daily Telegraph Ferrier should resign to save her “self-respect and dignity”. She has already lost the party whip and is subject to a police and a House of Commons investigation, but has ignored calls for her resignation from Blackford, the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and others.
One fellow SNP politician said they were “astonished” that she was trying to tough it out when voters were facing self-isolation, economic hardship and the loss of loved ones through Covid. But others within the party said they could not believe how the leadership was “feeding the media”. Ferrier was entitled to due process and knew that she would inevitably “have to face her constituents”, a source said. The MP has referred herself to the Commons standards commissioner but it is not expected to conclude its investigation for some time. The shortest investigation it has ever undertaken took two weeks. It can trigger a process involving suspension from the house for 10 days to allow constituents to decide whether they want a byelection, in what is known as a recall vote. Kerevan and other supporters in the SNP say Ferrier is being “hounded” for something she has already admitted is indefensible, but that she deserves the due process of the police investigation if she has broken the law. One pointed out that an MP accused of rape during the summer has been allowed due process and not suspended from the house while police investigations continue. In what is believed to have been an oblique reference to Ferrier, Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons warned MPs not to raise the incident casually in a covid debate on Monday telling them “that the conduct of another member should not be criticised on the floor of the house other than by a substantive motion”. Writing in the National newspaper in Scotland, Keravan said “the feeding frenzy against Margaret has pained me”.
He added: “I feel deeply for Margaret and find much of the virtue signalling and rush to consign her to political outer darkness both hypocritical and blatantly self-serving. Margaret Ferrier, in my experience, always put the job before her personal convenience.” Another SNP source pointed out that she was ill and had the right to recover before deciding her course of action. “Have you ever known an MP to resign who has been accused of breaking the law? I cannot think of any sitting MP who has not been afforded due process. If this were a Tory I would say exactly the same.” Others in the SNP say they are “astonished” she has not resigned."
2020-10-04T23:01:04Z,politics,Politics,"New jobs coaches will help people back to work, says Rishi Sunak","Thousands of work coaches will be hired under a new government employment programme to help those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic, amid fresh warnings of an unemployment crisis as the furlough scheme ends. The £238m job entry targeted support (Jets) scheme will help jobseekers who have been out of work for at least three months. It will be available to people receiving the “all work related requirements” universal credit payment, or the new style jobseeker’s allowance. The Department for Work and Pensions says Jets will “ramp up support” to help people back to employment, with specialist advice on how to move into growing sectors, as well as CV and interview coaching. It is recruiting an additional 13,500 coaches to help deliver the programme. The move comes as economists forecast a sharp increase in unemployment this winter, with employers such as Rolls-Royce, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, Boots and John Lewis all announcing layoffs since the pandemic began. More than a third of businesses plan to cut jobs before the end of the year, a survey last week found. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who will give a speech to the Conservative party conference on Monday, said: “Our unprecedented support has protected millions of livelihoods and businesses since the start of the pandemic, but I’ve always been clear that we can’t save every job. “I’ve spoken about the damaging effects of being out of work, but through Jets we will provide fresh opportunities to those that have sadly lost their jobs, to ensure that nobody is left without hope.” UK redundancies rose at the fastest rate since 2009 over the summer, with struggling companies laying off more than 150,000 staff in the May-July quarter. Nearly 700,000 workers have dropped from company payrolls since March, according to the latest statistics. Jets is going live on Monday in counties in the north-east, north-west and south of England, and in Wales and south London. It will then be extended to central England, the home counties and the rest of London later in October, and in Scotland in early 2021. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said it could help more than 250,000 recently unemployed people back into work. The government’s furlough scheme ends this month, and is replaced with a less generous wage subsidy programme to support companies which bring back workers on reduced hours. The Labour party warns that nearly 500,000 furloughed workers live in parts of the UK that are under Covid-19 restrictions. Another 480,000 are living in towns or cities on the national watch list, meaning infections are worryingly high. That includes 43,000 people in Birmingham, 19,400 in Durham and 11,500 in Bolton, according to Labour’s analysis. Ending the furlough scheme will create a “jobs cliff edge”, said the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. “The government’s failure to get a functioning track, trace and isolate system working means large swathes of the country, including in the north and the Midlands, are now under additional restrictions and face a jobs cliff edge,” she said. “Labour urged the chancellor to introduce a wage support scheme that incentivised employers to keep more staff on. However, he ignored these calls and now nearly 1m jobs are at risk when the furlough scheme ends in a few weeks’ time.”"
2020-10-04T18:29:44Z,politics,Politics,What are the three proposed tiers of local lockdown for England?,"A leaked document has revealed plans for three tiers of local lockdown measures in England to curb the spread of coronavirus and reduce confusion caused by a patchwork of regional restrictions.

2020-10-04T18:01:52Z,politics,Politics,"Military will help distribute Covid-19 vaccine, says Hancock","The UK’s military will be involved in the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine, Matt Hancock has told the virtual Conservative party conference. The health secretary also said the government was preparing a campaign to challenge the anti-vaccination movement for when a vaccine is rolled out. Asked about his hopes for a vaccine during an “interactive interview” with the anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali, he said it was “the great hope”, agreeing with Boris Johnson, who on Sunday morning told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show that the public could expect some “bumpy months” ahead. “The plans are in train, a combination of the NHS and the armed forces are involved in the logistics of making the [vaccine] rollout happen, because it’s not just about developing and testing the vaccine,” he said. He also revealed the Covid-19 app that launched on 24 September, more than four months later than initially promised, had been downloaded 15m times.
The app for England and Wales, which uses the bluetooth signal in mobile phones to track close and sustained contact between users and warns those who may have been exposed to an infectious person that they should self-isolate, had “gone off the shelf like digital hotcakes”, Hancock said. In a separate interview later, he revealed the government’s plans to tackle the anti-vaccination movement and persuade people to take the vaccine. “Sadly there are a small number of people who make an active case against vaccines based on misinformation,” he said, adding that the government would introduce a “counter narrative … to explain the importance and safety of vaccines” based on previous experience of “tackling misinformation in other fields”. “There’s a huge amount of work going on … to tackle misinformation about the vaccine because after all, if a vaccine is successfully brought, to be able to be used, it will have such a positive impact on on everybody’s life,” he said. He said the priority recipients of a vaccine would be decided by the independent joint committee on vaccination and immunisation, which last week published draft advice prioritising older adults in care homes and care home staff, people aged over 80 and health and social care workers. In his interview with Ali, Hancock said he wanted to see a greater sense of shared responsibility between individuals and the NHS for preventing people falling ill. “I think for too long the NHS has [been] picking up the pieces when things go wrong and instead we need more of a sense of shared responsibility – individual people, everybody, responsible for their own health as well as the NHS taking responsibility to keep people healthy in the first place,” he said. As well as presenting unprecedented challenges, the pandemic had also proved that positive change could happen very quickly, said Hancock. He added that, while people should be able to get a face-to-face appointment with a doctor if they wanted to, video consultations were “more convenient and easier” for many people. About 50% of visits to the GP and 50% of outpatient visits were done by telemedicine, up from less than 10% before the crisis, he said. “It’s good for patients, it’s good for doctors.”"
2020-10-04T15:33:26Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: PM says situation will be 'bumpy' to Christmas; Scotland's Covid hospital cases double in a week – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has admitted the UK public are furious at the continued coronavirus restrictions, but said scientific advice suggested a vaccine or mass testing would be possible by spring. He was speaking in an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr. Full summary and analysis here, at 11.52am. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said that she wants to overhaul what she called the “broken” asylum system - but warned Tories that this will “take time”. (See 4.07pm.) Legislation will not be published until next year, she said in a speech which repeated many of the arguments and proposals made (in more detail) by Theresa May when she was home secretary five years ago. The Covid-19 app that launched on 24 September – more than four months later than initially promised – has been downloaded 15m times, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told the virtual Conservative party conference. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-10-04T12:22:14Z,politics,Politics,Farmers call on UK to commit in law to ban chlorinated chicken,"The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has called on the UK government to make a legal commitment to ban chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef from supermarket shelves. In advance of new agriculture legislation, the NFU president, Minette Batters, said she was not demanding that imported chickens should luxuriate in “10ft-high straw beds” but that the UK’s high standards of animal welfare should be imposed on imports. “We’ve had so much talk about chlorinated chicken. The thing is, if we don’t put a marker in the sand, if government doesn’t put a red line down in the agricultural bill, that allows secondary legislation on any day of the week effectively to change it. You have to put that marker down and say: ‘No, you know, we’re going to stick by our word today,’” she said. In an exchange with the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, at the Conservative party conference, Batters called on the government to support the Curry amendment to the agriculture bill, which returns to the House of Commons on 12 October. Lord Curry’s amendment is designed to give the recently assembled trade and agriculture commission (TAC) a stronger role in scrutinising trade deals. Truss came under repeated fire over the lack of perceived scrutiny in parliament for trade deals from the government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, who called for full parliamentary scrutiny, including evidence and witness accounts to select committees of all post-Brexit trade deals. He has also called on Truss to put a health expert on the TAC before the nation’s bus stops and billboard are “covered in ads for Hershey bars”. “Our diets are already one of the worst in the world, and we do not want to make it any worse,” he said.
Truss rejected the accusation of secrecy and said all signed trade deals would go before an independent trade commission chaired by the SNP’s Angus Brendan MacNeil, who was not a “government patsy”. They would also be subject to an impact assessment process to analyse economic and social consequences, and their report would go before parliament and be debated. Under the so-called Crag process it could be blocked indefinitely if there were an objection. She also said industry players would be consulted in confidence on key elements of trade deals. The tariff offer from the US was about to be shared with “trusted” advisory groups from 11 sectors under non-disclosure agreements."
2020-10-04T10:48:14Z,politics,Politics,Conservatives turn on Boris Johnson over handling of UK Covid crisis,"Boris Johnson’s reputation among Conservative members has plunged to a record low, it has emerged, as the party enters its annual conference facing accusations of a “chumocracy” at the top of government. With Tory MPs restless over the government’s performance, which has seen it lose a huge poll lead over Labour since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister has recorded his first ever negative satisfaction rating among a survey of Tory members on the ConservativeHome website. He recorded the second-lowest score of any cabinet member, with only education secretary Gavin Williamson performing worse. The prime minister will attempt to use the virtual party conference this week to try to relaunch his premiership by looking to the programme he wants to pursue beyond the Covid crisis, which has dominated his time in Downing Street. It comes as his performance has been tested again during a series of regional television interviews, in which he appeared to forget key facts about his hospital spending programme and struggled to explain how residents across the north of England should regard the local Covid 19 restrictions they face. Asked how much hospital investment would come to Leeds during an interview with BBC Yorkshire’s Look North, Johnson scrambled for notes on the floor and asked aides for the figure before apologising for not having it to hand. He also appeared to struggle to explain the rules in different parts of the north west, during another disjointed interview with ITV Granada Reports. Asked whether or not certain activities were allowed, he suggested people did not have to strictly follow local lockdown rules as long as they “show common sense”. Asked if someone in Wirral could go for a walk in the park with someone from another house, Johnson said it could be all right as long as they used social distancing. However, the interviewer pointed out that social mixing between households in the area was against government advice. Johnson added: “Provided people show common sense and they look on the local websites – that is the best way to get this virus down.” Johnson is facing concerns from different wings of his party. While the libertarian wing is increasingly concerned that Covid restrictions remain too severe, figures on the modernising wing are concerned about radical plans to breach international law regarding the European Union, and to confront the BBC – an agenda they attribute to Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Jesse Norman, a Treasury minister, warned that Conservatives should be wary of tearing down institutions. “The difficulty with the revolutionary position is that human beings are remarkably bad at making radical decisions that prove to be wise in the long term,” he told the Bright Blue think tank’s magazine. “Conservatism also means acknowledging that institutions are wiser than individuals. You could look at many institutions and call them relics of a bygone era, or you could see them for what they are, the product of innumerable compromises that contain a great deal of knowledge and wisdom.” Justine Greening, the former education secretary, writes in the Observer today that many voters still regarded the Tories as being “dominated by the voices of privilege and chumocracy, more than those representing the party of effort and reward; that it protects the monied, vested interests that bankroll the party, ahead of the interests of the public; that too often government roles seem handed out based on who knows whom, rather than who knows what”.
However, other senior figures in the party are trying to take a longer-term view. “Looking back at the things we’ve gone through in the last 18 months, some of them feel like 18 years ago,” said one minister. “By the spring, if Covid is looking better, the economy is picking up and the Bond movie is finally out, things could look very different.” Johnson’s team are keen to return to the themes he backed during his early weeks in power, such as the “levelling up” agenda. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, has written to the cabinet to ask for “bold and ambitious bills” ahead of the next Queen’s speech in the spring. The programme is set to include a criminal justice bill, a controversial planning bill to speed up development and house building, an animal welfare bill and a plan to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act – a move that will again give No 10 control over the timing of the next election. A No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister has been clear that we will not be blown off course in our plans to build back better, and that’s just what our next Queen’s speech will do.”"
2020-10-04T10:08:07Z,politics,Politics,Commons Twitter account banned from tweeting vote results,"The House of Commons Twitter account has been banned from tweeting the results of votes after Tory MPs complained it was breaking impartiality rules when one tweet went viral, the Guardian has learned. Set up in 2012, the Commons account has been used to inform the public about procedures and policies of the House, share information about upcoming events and debates, and post the outcome of divisions. One tweet in July was retweeted 17,500 times before being deleted, as a response to pressure from the parliamentary Conservative party which led to a crackdown. During the passage of the trade bill, intended to pave the way for post-Brexit trade deals, the Commons Twitter account shared the outcomes of votes on amendments and new clauses: a 326-263 defeat for a clause relating “to parliamentary approval of trade agreements”, and approval without division for amendments about “sharing information and ministerial functions relating to trade”. The descriptions were taken from the explanatory statement written by the MP who proposed the motion, and the tweet about new clause 17 was no different. That clause, the tweet said, was “intended to protect the NHS and publicly funded health and care services in other parts of the UK from any form of control from outside the UK”, explaining that it had been defeated 340 votes to 251. The defeat allowed Labour to argue that Conservative MPs had voted against protecting the NHS from overseas control. The tweet itself was a key piece of evidence, which is why it gained 5,000 likes and almost 17,500 retweets in less than 24 hours. That drew the attention of Tory MPs, who were bombarded with questions from constituents about why they had voted against such protection. The day after, MPs from the party made a complaint to the clerk of the House, the politically neutral civil servant who oversees the work of the support staff, including the social media team. They argued that the tweet was in breach of the Commons’ requirement for impartiality. By the end of the day, the Commons team had deleted it and posted an apology. “We would like to clarify that the description was taken from the explanatory memorandum provided by the proposer, it was not the House’s summary of the new clause,” the apology read. “This lead to concerns about how our impartiality was perceived and has therefore been deleted.” Since then, the Commons Twitter feed has stopped sharing the results of votes in the House. Engagement with the feed has dropped sharply: a link to education secretary Gavin Williamson’s statement about university students was liked, retweeted and replied to by fewer than 20 people. In a statement, a Commons spokesperson said: “Division results are updated in the dedicated CommonsVotes app as soon as possible after the vote. We are aware that numerous commentators already provide analysis of division results, and believe that our responsibility is to provide the result itself as speedily as possible. “Parliament has also recently invested in a number of new ways of keeping the public updated on parliamentary business and division results, including further development of Parliamentlive.tv and ParliamentNow, and we regularly link to these from our Twitter account to keep followers updated.”"
2020-10-04T07:15:45Z,politics,Politics,Will the bells ring out again at London’s Big Ben foundry?,"It is part of the nation’s heritage and a powerful symbol of parliamentary democracy, signalling the passing of each hour for more than a century and a half. When Big Ben was brought to the Palace of Westminster on a trolley drawn by 16 horses in 1858, cheering crowds gathered on the streets to salute the giant bell’s passage. Now the place it came from, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in the East End of London, where master craftsmen cast some of history’s most notable bells, is the subject of a public inquiry starting next week over plans to turn the historic site into a luxury hotel. Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, “called in” the proposal after Tower Hamlets council approved the site’s redevelopment despite opposition from community groups and members of the public. The foundry’s fourth generation owners, Alan and Kathryn Hughes, sold up in 2017 after running the business for 45 years. A sub-sale meant the site ended up in the hands of developers Raycliff Whitechapel LLP. Under the company’s proposals, the Grade II* listed building at the front of the site will be preserved and a 103-bedroom hotel with rooftop pool will be built at the rear.
The developers’ scheme was backed by Historic England, which said the proposal had “the makings of a successful heritage regeneration scheme, and would provide a sustainable future for this important group of listed buildings”. But an alternative proposal has been put forward by Re-Form Heritage (formerly the UK Historic Building Preservation Trust) and the Factum Foundation to keep the entire site as a viable bell foundry. “We are convinced that with new management and new technology this can continue as a successful business,” said Stephen Clarke, a trustee of Re-Form Heritage. “The intangible heritage asset here is the activity of the foundry rather than the fabric of the building.” Their proposal envisages forming a bridge between traditional craftsmanship and digital technology to “re-energise and rethink bell making” as an artform, said Adam Law of the Factum Foundation. It is discussing potential projects with artists Grayson Perry, Anish Kapoor and Antony Gormley.
A bell foundry has been in existence in Whitechapel since the 16th century, and at its current site since the 1740s. Among the bells cast were the clock bell at St Paul’s cathedral in 1716 and the famous Bow Bells at St-Mary-le-Bow in 1738. To be born within the sound of Bow Bells – which reached considerably further in the days before motor vehicles – is the traditional definition of a Cockney. The foundry also made the bells immortalised in the nursery rhyme: “Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements.” In 1752, the foundry cast the famous Liberty Bell, a symbol of American independence commissioned by the state of Pennsylvania, inscribed with the words “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof”. More than a century later, Big Ben was the largest single bell, at 13.7 tons, made by the foundry. It chimed for the first time on 11 July 1859, continuing apart from occasional breakdowns and repairs until it was silenced for major renovations three years ago. Its famous bongs are due to restart next year. Nigel Taylor, who worked at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry for 40 years until its closure in 2017, and who would be re-employed under the Re-Form/Factum proposal, said: “The techniques used during the period I was employed at the foundry were modifications of ancient techniques.” When the foundry closed, “a vast amount of industrial history was lost”, he added. The inquiry is expected to last two weeks initially. A report will be submitted to the secretary of state, who will decide the outcome."
2020-10-04T07:00:45Z,politics,Politics,‘We have a mountain to climb’: Keir Starmer on winning the next election,"When Keir Starmer recently made his first leader’s speech to the Labour conference, he did not once mention his predecessor by name. There were no warm words about Jeremy Corbyn, no kind of tribute to the man who led Labour for more than four years. He was a non-person in Starmer’s speech. This was not an accident. “I named three Labour leaders. Three that won. That’s why I named them,” he responds briskly. Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair are the only Labour leaders to have secured parliamentary majorities. “I was trying to get across a really important message to the party, the movement and the country. And that is that the Labour party needs to be a party of government. We can spell out our vision, we can have fantastic policies. But unless we win an election, we are not going to do anything to change lives.” In case there are people who still haven’t got the point, he rams it home. “If we lose the next general election, that would be five in a row, and if they [the Tories] get a five-year term that would be the Labour party out of power for a longer period than [any] since the second world war. This is profound stuff.” As Starmer reminded the virtual conference, Labour has only had three winning leaders in the past 75 years. Why does he think his party has such a terrible record of electoral failure? “The key to winning an election is to be able, if you like, to glimpse the future. You’ve got to promise a better future. That’s what happened in ’45, in the 60s and in ’97. And you’ve got to be credible. And trusted. People have got to look at you and say you and your team are a government-in-waiting, you can run the country.” Thanks to the devastating defeat last December, Labour will fight the next election from its lowest parliamentary base since 1935. It will take a sensationally large swing to wipe out the Tory majority and replace it with a Labour one. When we suggest that this is a mammoth challenge, Starmer does not demur. “We have a mountain to climb,” he acknowledges freely. In trying to plan a long and steep ascent, he conceives of his leadership in “phases”. Starmer is a methodical man. Breaking the challenge into stages may also make it easier to contemplate. Furthermore, it enables him to resist demands that he start articulating policies by saying that Labour has to tackle the mountain one step at a time.
“The first phase, the first six months, was about recognising the scale of the defeat and the scale of the task. And being really honest about that. That’s why I said some of the blunt stuff in my [conference] speech. And recognising that you’ve got to change. You’ve got to engage and listen and build trust. Trust is the most important thing. Because people had lost trust in Labour as a force for good and force for change.” He thinks that “after the first six months, people feel we’ve taken an important step on that journey and that we’re now climbing the mountain.” So now, he says: “We are moving to a new phase.” This will involve answering the question: “What’s our positive vision for the country? And I mean vision; I don’t mean policy. Four years from an election, we’re not setting out policy. Vision. The vision of the country we want Britain to be. That’s the next six months.” He will stress family as “a fundamental value”. And also patriotism, which will have some on the left wincing. “The reason we go out knocking on doors is because we believe in the country. We’ve been a bit shy of that in recent years. We’ve not said it. A movement that wants this to be the best country it can possibly be. It is a very patriotic leftwing tradition.” While he has the support of the great majority of Labour MPs, significant elements of the left are highly suspicious. Some already talk of betrayal. During his campaign for the leadership, he sought support among the left by issuing “10 pledges”, signing up to much of the Corbynite prospectus. Starmer is now putting a lot of distance between himself and those pledges, using the coronavirus crisis as his alibi. “The slate has been wiped pretty clean for everyone,” he contends, arguing that the pandemic means that both Labour and the Tories “are going to have to fundamentally rethink what they want to offer the electorate in 2024”. That may well be right. It is also a highly convenient excuse for getting out of previous commitments to keep faith with Corbynism.
When he became leader, the epidemic was at its first peak. Many commentators suggested the Labour leader would struggle to capture the nation’s attention. As it turns out, he has harvested a political dividend by relentlessly prosecuting the government’s many mistakes. Our most recent Opinium poll gave him highly positive personal ratings. After yet another week of ministerial blundering and confused announcements, Starmer is ramping up his attack on the government’s handling of the crisis. “I think they’ve lost control of the virus,” he declares bluntly. “One of the reasons so many areas are now under restrictions is because the government doesn’t properly know where the virus really is. The failure of test, trace and isolate is absolutely fundamental to this. The virus is now out of control.” This is a very grave charge to level at the government – and one that Boris Johnson will probably brand alarmist – but Starmer thinks he is the one in tune with the feelings of most Britons. “The mood of the country is they’re angry at the incompetence of the government. They are really anxious about a second wave. The confidence has gone out of the public. And they’re really frustrated with the mixed messages. You’ve now got swathes of the north of England on effective lockdown. And they feel that nobody is listening to them. That nobody is speaking for them. What people want, more than anything, is hope and light at the end of the tunnel.” He unveils multiple demands of the government. First, offer hope that the tunnel does have an end by producing “a road map to vaccination”. He explains: “When a vaccine arrives, it’s got to be done to scale. You’ve got to have a plan for how you roll it out. If they don’t start on that, you can see this is going to be the next problem.” Another thing that has to be done – “what we need desperately” – is fixing test, track and isolate. Third, “we need targeted routine testing” for the NHS, care homes, students and schools. Also on his long list of things that need to happen is much more local decision-making, support for businesses affected by regional quasi-lockdowns and the “rapid review of local restrictions”. The Tories will doubtless say this is another example of the Labour leader “carping from the sidelines”, a phrase that they have started to use against him, presumably because they find it resonates with some of their focus groups. Johnson likes to jibe that Starmer is “Captain Hindsight”. He counters: “Everything we are criticising, we flagged up in advance. There’s no end of stuff we’ve put out about the danger that is around the corner. The prime minister is governing in hindsight.
“He charges forward, he has a car crash, looks in the rear-view mirror and says: ‘What’s that all about?’ That is government by hindsight.” The makers of the revived Spitting Image, the TV satire, have turned Starmer into one of their puppets. After looking at a picture of the latex version of himself, he remarks: “It could have been worse.” A loyal aide says: “I think it makes him look like JFK.” He’s much more recognised in the streets since he became leader. “A lot more. Which has its ups and downs,” he laughs. “It is a good thing. Because, you know, Boris Johnson – the one good thing he’s got going for him is he’s so well-recognised.” The same cannot be said of the Labour frontbench. The shadow cabinet is shadowy to most of the country. We suggest that few voters have any idea who most of them are, never mind what they have to say. Why aren’t they making their voices heard? Did he make bad choices? “No,” he protests. “I picked very good people. It’s a very, very strong shadow cabinet. But we do need the whole team out. I accept that. You will see more of the team out. We need people to see a government-in-waiting which means more than one person. There will be much more of that.” In the six months since he became leader, he has made a defining issue of competence. This has worked very well for him, not least because Johnson is so exposed to the charge that he is a chaotic PM leading a low-calibre cabinet. Starmer has employed his experience as a prosecutor at prime minister’s questions, but says he doesn’t really approach it like a day in court. “I’m actually asking the questions I think the public want asked. So I haven’t gone for trick questions or curve balls or things that nobody is going to know the answer to. The prime minister, the first few weeks, tried to answer questions with detail and got hopelessly lost. So now, he doesn’t. He’s just got his stock attacks.” The consensus at Westminster, and this includes Conservative MPs, is that Starmer has regularly got the better of Johnson. But there’s an anxiety among Labour MPs that the Tories could change the terms of combat by switching leaders before the next election. The most talked-about scenario is that Johnson is replaced by Rishi Sunak, the one member of the cabinet to have impressed the public. Recent Labour propaganda has started to target the chancellor, a sign that the Labour leadership regards him as a threat. Starmer affects not to care that he might face a fresher Tory leader at the next election. “Whether the Tories change their leader or not is obviously down to them. If I’m to get the Labour party in a position to win the next election, I need to focus on what Labour intends to do. As I was always taught as a lawyer, if you’re going to win a case, you need to know your own argument first.” He again stresses the awesome challenges facing his party: “This is going to take four years. And we’re going to have to be at this every day, every week, every month for the whole of the four years….There is no way the Labour party could be turned around in six months. And there’s no pretending otherwise. This is going to take the four-year period that we have got. Every bit of it.” It will be a marathon up that mountain."
2020-10-04T06:30:44Z,politics,Politics,Labour councillor tells of his ‘darkest time’ in suspension row,"A Labour council leader who was accused of sexual harassment and suspended before last year’s general election has revealed how he contemplated suicide during the ordeal. Jas Athwal, leader of Redbridge council in north-east London, was reinstated last month after rebutting the accusation against him. However, he said he had been forced to wait almost a year for his case to be heard. During that time, he was denied the chance to compete for a safe parliamentary seat and spent more than £150,000 fighting to clear his name. Athwal said he was the victim of a “politically motivated” process that saw him suspended just hours before the MP candidate selection for Ilford South, despite having responded in full to the allegation against him almost two months earlier. It took a further 11 months to have his case heard by the party’s top disciplinary committee. He said his lowest ebb came in the run-up to the election. “In that two-week period, I thought of [suicide] often,” he said. “It was the darkest time. I’ve got four lovely children. I’ve got a lovely wife. I’ve got an amazing life.. And I’ve got so much to live for. But you almost feel you’ve dragged everybody down into the mud and that, basically, you need to finish it all off and walk away. “They drove me, a successful human being who’s got so much to live for and so many things I need to do, to the point where I was thinking, ‘What have I done to deserve this’?”His dramatic suspension last October became a flashpoint in the infighting that has dogged Labour. Athwal, seen as close to figures critical of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, was the main opponent to Sam Tarry, who ran Corbyn’s 2016 Labour party leadership campaign. Athwal said it was a “bolt from the blue” when he was informed of the allegation in mid-August. He replied within a week with an alibi, independent witnesses, photographic evidence and 15 character witnesses. “We felt confident, we felt happy,” he said. “As far as I was concerned, that was the end of the matter.” He didn’t hear anything from the party until 4 October, the evening before the hustings to select Labour’s Ilford South candidate. “I remember speaking to a colleague and saying: ‘It’s over. They’ve basically blocked me from entering the room tomorrow.’ But the real tragedy was the personal turmoil it would cause me. “A father of four children, my name plastered across national media. You spend your entire life telling them how to be decent human beings and suddenly I’m the one who’s let the side down. It took Labour 346 days to hear me and clear me.” He explained how he begged the police to investigate the claim against him, while he also had to inform council safeguarding officials. No allegation was ever made to the police. Athwal even contacted Corbyn and John McDonnell, then shadow chancellor, for their help in securing a hearing. He criticised the way his case was handled by Jennie Formby, then the party general secretary. Formby did not comment, but allies said she had been undergoing cancer treatment at the time. “Having threatened the Labour party with court action in January 2020, it took another nine months to actually get a hearing,” Athwal said. “There needs to be no factionalism in the disputes process, no political interference, no political manipulation. It needs to be free, it needs to be fair, it needs to be just. That’s what I really want. No one should ever have to go through what I’ve had to go through.” Allies of Tarry said the saga was also frustrating for him. They claimed he had been well ahead in the contest for the seat and after Athwal’s suspension supported delaying selection. When Athwal announced he had been reinstated last month, Tarry said claims of a political stitch-up were “farcical”, warning that such complaints risked undermining confidence in Labour’s complaints procedure. The party was contacted about Athwal’s claims, but did not comment. A source familiar with the proceedings said there was “nothing factional” about Athwal’s case, adding that others from across the party had been suspended at the same time. They added that advice from independent barristers was involved and that care should be taken to ensure others are not put off from making the party aware of similar allegations. • In the UK and Irish Republic contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. • In the US the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. • In Australia the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. • Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org"
2020-10-03T18:37:25Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson has ‘lost control’ of Covid-19 pandemic,"Boris Johnson has “lost control” of the fight against Covid-19 and has no clear strategy for defeating the virus, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, says today in his most savage attack yet on the government’s handling of the pandemic. As the number of confirmed cases rose alarmingly yesterday, Starmer accused the prime minister of “serial incompetence”, saying the British people have been let down and left angry and confused by policies that change almost every week. A further 12,872 people tested positive in the previous 24 hours, the government said last night, 80% more than the previous highest figure recorded. The government’s Covid-19 dashboard had showed that cases over the previous week seemed to have stopped climbing, but it admitted yesterday that a “technical issue” had led to cases being under-reported over the previous eight days. Another 49 people have died since testing positive. Speaking to the Observer, Starmer demands that Johnson produce a new “roadmap” for dealing with the crisis within days to reassure an ever more worried British people, which must set out clearly what the approach will be until a vaccine is rolled out. “I think they’ve lost control of the virus,” Starmer says. “And I don’t want to see death rates go up. Nobody does.And the government doesn’t. I’m not suggesting that for a minute. But this is serial incompetence. And the test, trace and isolate system was abandoned in early March if you recall because they said they didn’t have the capacity. It took them months to get back to even trying to set up a system. And they haven’t got an effective working system.” He blames splits at the top of government and says that local councils and health officials should have been involved far more in combating outbreaks. “There isn’t a strategy. There’s a vacuum there. And that’s because there’s division in the cabinet as to which strategy they should be following. “I’m reflecting, I think, what people in those communities feel. This deep sense of despondence, anxiety. And actually, what they want is hope.” Starmer says people are so confused by U-turns and lack of leadership that they ask him what the government’s strategy is. “The prime minister is governing in hindsight. So he charges forward, not recognising the problem, has a car crash, looks in the rear mirror and says: ‘What’s all that about?’”
His comments mark a new low in attempts to build any form of cross-party consensus on the pandemic, and follow criticism from some on the left that Starmer has let Johnson off too lightly. They come after a week in which the prime minister had to apologise for not understanding restrictions he had just announced across parts of the north of England. He again appeared uncertain of the rules in a series of stumbling television interviews with regional news programmes on Friday evening. Starmer, speaking ahead of the Conservative party’s virtual conference, which opened on Saturday, demanded that the government pursue a five-point plan to fight Covid-19 that would involve: • following the German government by publishing criteria it uses to inform people when local restrictions are introduced and lifted • improving public-health messaging by expanding the NHS Covid-19 app so people can type in their postcode and get information about the restrictions in their area • fixing the test and trace system by investing in NHS and university labs to expand testing, and putting local public-health teams in charge of contact-tracing in their areas • ensuring routine regular testing for high-risk workplaces and high-transmission areas with results within 24 hours to improve infection control, including for NHS staff and carers • outlining a programme to ensure the manufacturing and distribution of any vaccine that is approved
Asked if he believes there is a plan being worked on for mass vaccination, he says: “No. Well, they need to have one. Almost everything they’ve done so far, they’ve been completely slow and incompetent.” On his strategy for making Labour electable after four successive general election defeats, Starmer says that the first phase of his leadership, after taking over from Jeremy Corbyn in April, was about recognising the scale of the task Labour faces by building trust and demonstrating that it is now under decisive, different leadership. Although he says the task of winning back trust is far from complete and that Labour still has a “mountain to climb”, he makes clear heis now about to embark on “phase two” of his leadership – spelling out a broad vision of how he wants the country to change, and a set of core values that will determine Labour’s direction. Shifting away from Corbyn, he says security, family and patriotism will be at the centre of that vision and key to making Britain “the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old”. He says he will stand by the 10 pledges he made during his leadership campaign – many of which rested on ideas promoted by Corbyn. But, signalling the need for flexibility, he points out that the pandemic has created new challenges, which will inevitably influence Labour policies at the next general election. Asked why he didn’t mention Corbyn by name in his recent conference speech, he is unapologetic, making clear the move was deliberate. “I named three Labour leaders. Three who won. That’s why I named them. I didn’t name anybody else.” He downplays complaints from some in the party that he has kept his shadow cabinet team on too tight a leash, and insists that the public will hear more from them from now on."
2020-10-03T15:46:47Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab says he feared Boris Johnson might die from Covid,"Dominic Raab has said he was worried that Boris Johnson would die after the prime minister was taken into intensive care with coronavirus in April. The foreign secretary, who stood in for Johnson when he became unwell, told the Conservative party conference on Saturday that he was often asked how he felt during that time, and admitted he was “really worried that we might lose him”. He said coronavirus had affected every community and nearly taken the life of Johnson, whom he called a “friend as well as a leader”. “I worried for Carrie [Symonds, Johnson’s partner] pregnant with baby Wilf,” he said. “But I always had faith that with the outstanding NHS care he received and his fighting spirit, he’d pull through.”
Raab said Covid-19 had shown what was achievable when society comes together, and the mission of the Conservative government was to build back the economy stronger and greener. ”As we reinforce all four nations of our precious union, we will only realise our full potential with a truly global vision for Britain,” he said. Raab also spoke about Brexit, telling the conference that the UK would not be “held over a barrel by Brussels”. He said: “Yes we want a free trade deal with the EU, but any deal must be fair. The days of being held over a barrel by Brussels are long gone. Under the Conservatives, there is no question. Our government will control our fisheries, our parliament will pass our laws and our courts will judge them.” He said he wanted to “level up opportunities for every child … reinforce the bonds of our four great nations,” adding: “Let’s re-establish our rightful place in today’s world as a truly global Britain.” The conference also heard from the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, who said the delivery of free ports, HS2 and the prime minister’s lifetime skills training guarantee would help create opportunities across the country. Speaking in conversation with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, Gove also discussed the possibility of a trade deal with the EU. “I suspect there will be one or two ups and downs along the way, but I am optimistic that we will get a deal,” he said. “But if we don’t, we have been making extensive preparations to be ready for anything.” The party announced it would open a new campaign headquarters in Leeds in an attempt to deliver for the former “red wall” areas that helped vote Johnson into power at the last election. Amanda Milling, a co-chair of the party, opened the online conference on Saturday with the announcement that staff would be moved to Leeds to focus attention on the region."
2020-10-03T15:12:14Z,politics,Politics,Johnson and Von der Leyen extend Brexit talks by a month,"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have approved a further month of Brexit negotiations after agreeing that enough progress has been made to justify a last push to reach a deal on trade and security. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will travel to London this week for talks with his British counterpart, David Frost, and the two sides will then hold follow-up talks in Brussels the week after. The fresh rounds were agreed after a phone call on Saturday afternoon between the British prime minister and European commission president. EU sources said the conversation was “not a game-changer” but not “unhelpful”, with both sides showing resolve to find “landing zones” on the most difficult areas. Before the new rounds of negotiation, Barnier will visit the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Monday. Merkel had suggested on Friday that the EU would show fresh flexibility. In a joint statement following their call, Johnson and Von der Leyen said they had identified reasons for hope that common ground on the most contentious issues could be found. They called on their teams to intensify negotiations in the coming weeks. “They agreed on the importance of finding an agreement, if at all possible, as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future,” the statement said. “They endorsed the assessment of both chief negotiators that progress had been made in recent weeks but that significant gaps remained, notably but not only in the areas of fisheries, the level playing field and governance. They instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps.” Downing Street’s hopes of moving into a so-called “tunnel” negotiation – an intensive negotiation away from the scrutiny of the media and domestic politicians – have not been satisfied. “It instructs me and [Michel Barnier] to work intensively in order to try to bridge the gaps between us. That work begins as soon as we can next week,” Frost tweeted of the joint statement. In a sign that negotiations have moved into the political realm, with decisions required by both sides at the top ranks on their respective levels of flexibility, Von der Leyen and Johnson said they would now talk on “a regular basis on this issue”. Their last meeting was in June, when Johnson said it was time to put a “tiger in the tank” of the negotiations, insisting that a deal was possible by the end of the summer. He later moved his deadline to mid-October, when the 27 EU heads of state and government are due to hold a Brexit summit. Downing Street made no mention of a deadline this time. During the call, it is understood Johnson emphasised that he would prefer the kind of arrangement the EU agreed with Canada, and he repeated his willingness to leave the transition period without a deal. It is understood that while it is open to talks later in October, the government has stressed behind the scenes the importance of having clarity by the summit on 15 October on whether a deal is possible, given the need to prepare for a no-deal exit. Barnier told members of the European parliament on Friday that he believed the last two weeks of October would prove to be the “crunch period”, with the hope that a deal might be ready for ratification at the start of November. The two sides are stuck on the issues of access to British waters for European fishing fleets and the level playing field provisions being pushed by Brussels to ensure that neither side can undercut standards or unfairly subsidise businesses through state aid. Before last week’s talks, five new draft negotiating documents were submitted by the government, including legal texts on fisheries, the level playing field, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, civil nuclear cooperation and social security coordination. Britain had offered a three-year transition period for European fishing fleets, allowing them to prepare for the post-Brexit changes, as part of an 11th-hour deal sweetener. The catches of EU fleets would be “phased down” between 2021 and 2024 to offer time for the European industry to adapt to the changes, but the French government has so far refused to countenance the major changes to catches being proposed by London. On state aid, EU sources said the UK had offered to lay out a series of principles on controlling domestic subsidies. But the paper failed to offer appropriate “governance” proposals that would allow Brussels to hold the UK to its pledges, they added. On Friday, Frost said there had been progress on state aid but that the gap between the two sides on fisheries remained wide and that without a move by Brussels a deal would not be possible. It is understood that message was again relayed by Johnson to Von der Leyen during their conference call on Saturday."
2020-10-03T13:58:22Z,politics,Politics,Tories' virtual party conference suffers access glitch,"Activists and observers were temporarily unable to log into the virtual Tory party conference on Saturday. The problem occurred while the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, took part in a so-called “fireside chat”. It was unclear how many people were able to tune in. People and organisations who had paid for virtual stalls in the exhibition hall reportedly received messages from the Conservatives on Saturday afternoon saying: “Dear exhibitor, we are currently having some technical issues therefore you may not experience the full functionality of the stand or the platform at the moment. We are working extremely hard on getting that back up and running as soon as possible. “If you continue to experience technical issues please contact technical help otherwise I will keep you updated as we progress. We appreciate your patience with this.” The glitch was fixed after about 30 minutes The Tories created a 3D virtual conference with a computer-generated auditorium, foyer and fringe meeting rooms, while politicians from other parties at their conferences simply spoke directly to camera. Last year a flaw in the Conservatives’ official phone app for their conference made the private data of senior party members – including cabinet ministers – accessible to anyone who logged in as that conference attendee. At the start of this weekend’s conference, Gove said the delivery of free ports, HS2 and the prime minister’s lifetime skills training guarantee would help create opportunities across the country. Speaking in conversation with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, Gove also discussed the possibility of a trade deal with the EU. “I suspect there will be one or two ups and downs along the way, but I am optimistic that we will get a deal,” he said. “But if we don’t, we have been making extensive preparations to be ready for anything.”"
2020-10-03T09:20:47Z,politics,Politics,Conservatives to open HQ in Leeds,"The Conservative party is to open a new campaign headquarters in Leeds in an attempt to deliver for the former “red wall” areas that helped vote Boris Johnson into power at the last election. Amanda Milling, the co-chair of the party, was due to open the online Tory party conference on Saturday with the announcement that staff would be moved to Leeds to focus attention on the region. “We are determined to show our commitment to the blue wall seats,” Milling was expected to say. “That’s why I am thrilled to announce that CCHQ [Conservative Campaign HQ] will be opening a headquarters in Leeds. “This new headquarters will provide the party with a base at the heart of the blue wall because we’re in it for the long haul. We’re determined to make the blue wall part of the fabric of our party and our country.” A host of seats across the north of England, Midlands and parts of Wales voted in Conservative candidates – some of them for the first time in their history – at the 2019 general election, giving Johnson a landslide victory. “The best way we can deliver for people there is to be there,” Milling was expected to say. The party’s current base is in Matthew Parker Street, close to Westminster in London. It aims to open the headquarters in Leeds next year. “Leeds is a key part of our plan to build back better for the people of this country and building a campaign presence there reinforces our commitment to that task,” Milling said. Boris Johnson has said he wants to create a “generation buy”, where young people are helped to purchase homes with mortgages requiring low deposits. The prime minister will give his conference speech on Tuesday, and in an interview with the Daily Telegraph he signalled his intent to refocus efforts on his manifesto pledge to “level up” across the UK. The Tory leader told the paper he believed a large number of people felt excluded from home ownership. He said his government would “fix” the issue by helping people get on to the property ladder with mortgages requiring as little as a 5% deposit. “I think a huge, huge number of people feel totally excluded from capitalism, from the idea of home ownership, which is so vital for our society,” he told the Telegraph. “We’re going to fix that – ‘generation buy’ is what we’re going for.” He said low-deposit mortgages could be “absolutely revolutionary” for young people. The Telegraph reported that Johnson had asked ministers to work on plans encouraging long-term, fixed-rate mortgages with 5% deposits. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, was due to give his speech to the virtual conference on Saturday afternoon, with other cabinet ministers taking part in interviews and panel events throughout the four-day event."
2020-10-03T07:48:52Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to set fishing ultimatum in crunch EU summit,"Boris Johnson will demand that the increasingly isolated French president, Emmanuel Macron, caves in to UK demands on fishing as the price for a trade and security deal at a key meeting with the European commission president on Saturday. The prime minister will speak to Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday afternoon in a video-conference call to “take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps”. Johnson said he was “pretty optimistic” that a Brexit deal could be reached. He told the Daily Telegraph that the prospects of securing a deal by the end of the year to avoid an abrupt separation were “very good if everybody just exercises some common sense and looks at the deal that is there to be done”. Johnson will feel strengthened by comments from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday when she described the fisheries deal struck by Britain with Norway this week as a “constructive indicator”. British officials argue that Norway, a non-EU state that conducts annual negotiations with the bloc on fishing quotas, should be the model for a post-Brexit deal on shared stocks. “I don’t think that’s a bad message at all for us, I think it is rather one that shows that one can find ways to come to an agreement,” Merkel said of the agreement between London and Oslo. Von der Leyen said on Friday that the most contentious issues, including fisheries and the control of domestic subsidies, remained “completely open”. The EU now expects a deal to be struck only in late October or early November. In a statement, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, suggested there had been movement on the issue of state aid. He made his strongest comments on access to British waters for European fishing fleet, an issue where the EU has been internally split in recent weeks. Frost said: “On the level playing field, including subsidy policy, we continue to seek an agreement that ensures our ability to set our own laws in the UK without constraints that go beyond those appropriate to a free trade agreement. There has been some limited progress here but the EU need to move further before an understanding can be reached. “On fisheries, the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU, risks being impossible to bridge. These issues are fundamental to our future status as an independent country.” Macron has infuriated other EU capitals by insisting that Brussels takes a tough negotiating position on fisheries in favour of the status quo under which France is a major beneficiary. A number of EU representatives in Brussels have privately counselled that a deal with the UK should not be jeopardised over fishing rights given its small economic value, prompting the French ambassador to describe such comments as “unacceptable” in one meeting. Paris has insisted on retention of the status quo, under which fishing catches in the 1970s form the basis of catches today. The UK remains fixed on replacing the common fisheries policy with a system of “zonal attachment” that would offer a significant increase in catches for British fishing fleets. Currently, Britain’s economic zone is part of common EU waters. The UK receives a fixed share based on how much its fishermen caught during a reference period between 1973 and 1978. Under the new system proposed by the UK, the two sides would agree on what percentage of shared stocks are attached to each of their European economic zones each year. Catch quotas would be organised in line with that percentage. A failure to agree annually on catches could lead to EU fleets being locked out of British waters. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has repeatedly admitted that both sides should back down from “maximalist positions” on access to British waters, acknowledged the need for an increased haul for British fishermen. Barnier said a final deal would require “a stable, sustainable and long-term agreement on fisheries, enabling the UK to further develop its fishing opportunities, while ensuring the sustainable use of resources and protecting the activities of European fishermen and women.” On Wednesday the Guardian revealed that Britain had offered a three-year transition period for European fishing fleets to allow them to prepare for the post-Brexit changes as part of an 11th-hour deal sweetener. The catches of EU fishermen would be “phased down” between 2021 and 2024 to offer time for European coastal communities to adapt to the changes. Speaking to journalists at the end of an EU summit in Brussels, Von der Leyen said there remained “a lot of work to do”, with 100 days left before the UK exits the single market and customs union, but she added: “Where there is a will there is a way.”"
2020-10-03T06:00:15Z,politics,Politics,Shadow chancellor calls on ministers to fulfil pledge on money laundering,"The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, is calling for the government to introduce a long-promised register of foreign owners of UK properties, to prevent criminals using homes as “dodgy bank accounts”. Reports of suspected money laundering have more than doubled since David Cameron used a speech in Singapore in 2015 to pledge that there would be “no place for dirty money in Britain”. The then prime minister promised a register of overseas companies owning UK properties, to make the market more transparent and prevent money from corruption being parked in lavish houses in central London.
But the proposal is still awaiting implementation. A draft registration of overseas entities bill was published in 2018, but has not yet been introduced to parliament. Dodds will use a speech to the Labour Housing Group on Saturday to highlight the party’s determination over the issue, and insist efforts to target money laundering should not be set aside because of the pandemic. “We are at a fork in the road,” she is to say. “The Conservatives could choose to focus their energies so that people in this country have affordable, decent homes to live in. They could finally set up a register of overseas entities to flush out the criminals using our homes as dodgy bank accounts. In doing so, they could secure a quicker, fairer and more sustainable economic recovery from the crisis. “Or they could choose to leave things as they are. Too few houses available to be homes- with prices driven up by those who use property to hide illicit wealth. I urge the Conservatives to finally make the right call.” The group campaigns for more affordable housing. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a 2% stamp duty surcharge on foreign property owners that will come into effect in April – but it is unclear when the register of foreign owners will be implemented. Official figures show that reports of suspected money-laundering activities to the National Crime Agency have more than doubled since Cameron made his Singapore speech. The NCA received 14,465 suspicious activity reports (SARs) relating to possible money laundering in 2015. In the year to March 2019 that had more than doubled to 34,151. The ease with which foreign investors can launder money through the UK property market was highlighted in the report from parliament’s intelligence and security committee’s report on Russia this year that warned of a “London laundromat”. “Successive governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London ‘laundromat’, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures,” the report claimed. “This has led to a growth industry of ‘enablers’ including lawyers, accountants, and estate agents who are – wittingly or unwittingly – de facto agents of the Russian state.” At the time of the December 2019 Queen’s speech, which set out Boris Johnson’s legislative programme, the government promised to “continue to progress legislation to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the UK property market”. The campaign group Transparency International said at the time that the legislation would “strengthen our defences against illicit financial flows, as the UK seeks to attract overseas investment”, and called for it to be “tabled at the earliest possible opportunity”. Transparency International research identified 421 UK properties collectively worth more than £5bn that were bought with suspicious wealth. The group then checked the land titles for these properties to identify 56 law firms involved in facilitating 132 of these transactions. In most cases they were the registered address of secretive companies used to hold the property."
2020-10-02T16:41:04Z,politics,Politics,Police investigate Margaret Ferrier as MP defies calls to step down,"Margaret Ferrier, the MP who broke Covid rules, clung to her position throughout Friday despite vociferous calls to quit from the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and other politicians. Downing Street was alone in not calling for the resignation of the Scottish MP, who spoke in the Commons while awaiting the result of a coronavirus test and then travelled by train from London to Scotland after testing positive. Having been suspended from the SNP on Thursday evening, she found herself in an increasingly isolated position by Friday. Sturgeon on Friday urged the member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West to step down, saying she had failed to offer her a “cogent explanation” for what she described as “a monumental, almost incomprehensible, error of judgment”. Labour also called for Ferrier to “do the right thing” and step down. Ferrier has reported her actions to police and the parliamentary standards commissioner. If she is convicted of a criminal offence in relation to the public health breaches, or sanctioned by the Commons standards committee, she could face a recall petition which, if signed by 10% of her constituents, would trigger a byelection. On Friday night the Metropolitan police said it had launched an investigation. In a statement, the force said: “An investigation is under way into reported breaches of the Health Protection Regulations 2020.” SNP sources said party colleagues were feeling “misled and betrayed” after Sturgeon confirmed that the MP initially told Westminster colleagues that she was returning home because a family member was ill. But, despite the flagrant breaches of coronavirus regulations in Scotland and England, Downing Street declined to call for Ferrier’s resignation, in contrast to the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, who has called for the SNP to expel her. “The prime minister has been clear that everybody needs to follow the rules in order to allow us to reduce the spread of the virus and protect lives,” Boris Johnson’s deputy spokesman said. “We have been clear people must self-isolate where they have coronavirus symptoms, if they test positive, or if they are contacted by test and trace.” Asked whether this meant Johnson thought Ferrier should resign, he said: “That’s a matter for her and her party.” The UK housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, likewise refused to call for Ferrier to resign, saying: “It is a matter for her to decide what she wants to do. It wouldn’t be right for me to comment on the police’s investigation.” Jenrick himself faced questions in April after the Guardian revealed he had travelled 40 miles to his parents’ home in Shropshire during lockdown after urging the public to stay at home. In an interview with the BBC, he was asked whether political figures flouting coronavirus guidance – such as Ferrier, Dominic Cummings and, more recently, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – made it harder to enforce public health messages because it gave the impression that the “Westminster club” was above the law. Johnson’s father, Stanley, has also apologised recently for breaching of coronavirus restrictions. At a daily briefing dominated by questions about Ferrier, Sturgeon hit back at “self-righteous criticism of the SNP” by people who “completely lost their tongue when a certain special adviser in London broke the rules”. Asked whether Ferrier’s actions had bolstered the sense that there is one rule for politicians and another for everybody else, Sturgeon said this was not the case. The Scottish first minister said: “I insist on the consequences when a politician breaks the rules being as severe as when it is a member of the public … “The most important relationship I have right now is with the Scottish public and I can’t ask you to make all of these sacrifices if I am going to stand here trying to explain away what Margaret Ferrier did.” Sturgeon also gave a detailed timeline of how news of Ferrier’s rule breaches emerged. “My understanding is that the SNP at Westminster knew on Wednesday that she had tested positive, but believed that she had taken a test once she had arrived back in Scotland,” the SNP leader said. “I understand that she had informed colleagues on Monday evening that she was travelling back to Scotland because a family member might have been unwell. “It was not until yesterday – and this information came through the Commons test-and-trace mechanism – that colleagues realised she had taken the test before travelling to London and then travelled back having been told that she was positive.” Sturgeon said she first heard about the situation on Thursday afternoon and was told that the Commons first wanted to put out a statement confirming that an MP had Covid. “I made clear if that was to happen, Margaret should immediately issue a statement confirming it was her and what the circumstances were.” Sturgeon added: “I think the SNP has acted quickly, appropriately and actually we have not tried to protect a colleague here, we have tried to do the right thing.”"
2020-10-02T16:35:15Z,politics,Politics,From Cummings to Ferrier: politicians who flouted Covid guidance,"Margaret Ferrier’s Covid-19 weekend breached so many regulations, it is hard to find one the SNP MP abided by. She joins myriad world leaders and other political figures in a growing coronavirus league of infamy. Brazen world leaders South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, posed for a selfie with two women who approached him in the street, thus breaking social distancing measures. Laughing, he joked to the women: “Come, before we get arrested.” He wasn’t arrested but he was videoed, sparking public outrage. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, apologised after posing for officially photographs with staff in a restaurant, when his own advice to others was to dine out only with close family members. The Czech Republic president, Miloš Zeman, was investigated after being photographed with others at a dining table, at a time when gatherings of more than two people from different households were banned. While all solemnly wore masks in the picture, they were also eating lunch. With no scientific basis whatsoever, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, advocated citizens drink vodka and enjoy saunas to “poison the virus”. He also notoriously dismissed Covid as “mass psychosis”. When he caught it, he recovered “on his feet”, he boasted, without showing any symptoms. Caught-out UK MPs The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, travelled between London and his Herefordshire home during lockdown in April, and then visited his Shropshire-based isolating parents, too. He insisted he was delivering food and medicine to them. The Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock tweeted a photo of a visit to his dad, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, for his 78th birthday, providing ample proof of lockdown travel, although the family were socially distancing in the snap. It earned a public scolding from South Wales police. Danny Kruger, the MP for Devizes, issued an apology after a fellow train passenger photographed him maskless on the Hungerford to Paddington service last month. The prime minister’s father Stanley Johnson has displayed a somewhat relaxed attitude towards his son’s Covid-19 proclamations. Immediately after the government advised against all but essential travel, he flew to his Greek villa to make it “Covid-proof”.
This week he was busted again, this time photographed without a face covering as he went to pick up a newspaper in west London. He escaped a fine as police said it was a first offence. Johnson, 79, later apologised, saying he was “maybe not 100% up to date with the virus restrictions”. Classic Dom For sheer obfuscation, and for services to tourism, the No 10 henchman Dominic Cummings tops the league. He drove 260 miles from London to Durham with his wife, who had suspected Covid symptoms, before developing symptoms himself, and then “tested his eyesight” by driving to the picturesque town of Barnard Castle. The scandal spawned many memes, an eye test chart, a specially named beer - and earned the grateful thanks of the local tourist office."
2020-10-02T16:19:33Z,politics,Politics,Is there still time for a Brexit trade deal?,"This week the last scheduled talks were held between EU and UK negotiators on a Brexit trade and security deal. Only 90 days remain until the end of the transition period, when Britain will leave the EU’s economic system, deal or no deal. What happens now? The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will speak to Boris Johnson on Saturday afternoon as both sides seek common ground on the way forward, a conversation that would not be happening if a deal were impossible. But that does not mean a deal is inevitable. Far from it. After updating EU leaders on Friday, von der Leyen said there had been “progress on many, many different fields” but the most difficult questions were “still completely open”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, cast doubt on whether the gap could be closed, saying the UK was “fully committed to working hard to find solutions, if they are there to be found”. If these differences are not resolved by an EU summit on 15-16 October, the window for an agreement will rapidly close. What are the talks stuck on? The biggest problem, as expected from the start, is the “level playing field” – rules to ensure fair competition between British and EU companies. Brussels says its unprecedented offer of a zero-tariff trade deal, with no quantity limits on UK imports to the bloc, means abiding by EU standards on environment, worker and consumer rights and – most contentious of all – state support for companies. Agreement on the 100 categories of fish swimming in EU-UK waters remains tenuous. While no one expects a deal to be stymied by fishing, the two sides remain far apart. EU member states, such as France, the Netherlands and Belgium, that stand to see economic pain inflicted on their fishing fleets will have to judge that the final compromise is acceptable. Frost warned that the gap on fisheries remained “very large” and risked “being impossible to bridge”. The final, nagging problem is a dispute settlement system to underpin the entire post-Brexit agreement. After the British government’s announcement that it was ready to violate the Brexit withdrawal treaty, EU officials have said a solid legal process to resolve future disputes was more important than ever. The UK is resisting the EU’s main demands on all these issues, despite signs Brussels is willing to compromise on state aid and fish. It remains unclear whether the two sides can find a middle way. What does EU legal action mean? As talks grind on, the European commission has begun legal action over the internal market bill, which includes clauses that override the withdrawal agreement the prime minister signed last year. The government has admitted the bill breaks international law but argues the UK needs a “safety net” to protect its internal market. For now, legal action and Brexit talks are on separate tracks. The EU hopes the prospect of a zero-tariff trade deal will allay lingering British concerns about the Irish protocol, leading the government to drop the offending provisions. But the UK has been put on notice that it cannot get a trade deal if its “loaded gun” remains on the table. “Let there be no mistake, there is no deal with any of these threats pending,” one EU official said. Can a deal still be done in time? For now the task is political rather than technical. Both sides think a deal is in grasp if the other side climbs down. For the EU, the big question mark is whether Johnson wants a deal or will follow the lead of his close advisers Dominic Cummings and Frost, who are perceived in Brussels to be more comfortable with no deal. “My feeling is that he [Johnson] is not a real ideologue; it’s not impossible [to get a deal],” said one senior EU diplomat. But the task will soon become technical. While there are nearly three months before the transition period expires, the EU says the ultimate deadline is late October, although this could stretch into the first half of November. In the final six weeks of the year the 1,000-plus-page treaty – yet to be agreed – has to be finessed by lawyers, translated into all 24 EU languages, inspected by 27 EU governments (and some of their legislatures), then ratified by the UK and European parliaments. What are the chances of a deal? As finely balanced as the original Brexit vote itself: around 50/50. Big political choices are yet to be made – and the chances of the two sides arguing themselves out of time cannot be ruled out."

2020-10-02T14:29:26Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel bullying inquiry delay 'eroding trust' within Whitehall,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, is under pressure on multiple fronts following a claim that Boris Johnson’s failure to conclude a seven-month bullying inquiry into her conduct is damaging relations across Whitehall. The allegation was sent to the prime minister by the FDA union as Patel’s allies said they suspected other ministers may be behind attempts to discredit Home Office plans for asylum seekers by leaking details to the media. Dave Penman, the union’s general secretary, told Johnson that the delay in publishing the inquiry’s findings was eroding trust between ministers and senior civil servants. “I would urge you to recognise the long-term damage that is being done to the relationship between ministers and civil servants by these delays and address these issues as a matter of urgency,” Penman wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian. The Cabinet Office inquiry was launched on 2 March by Michael Gove, who told parliament: “It is vital that this investigation is concluded as quickly as possible in the interests of everyone involved.” Patel is alleged to have mistreated staff and clashed with senior officials in three departments, including in her role as home secretary. She has denied all the claims.
Several reports have claimed that the inquiry, conducted under the ministerial code, has been completed and is waiting for the prime minister’s signature. Penman wrote that senior civil servants were concerned that ministerial inquiries, which provide no transparency or timeframe for conclusion, may not be free from political interference. “Seven months on, it will be hard to reach any conclusion other than that justice has already been denied and that the continued delay to the process is driven solely by political considerations,” he wrote. Trust between government departments was eroded this week after several leaks were made over Home Office plans for asylum seekers arriving in the UK. Sources in the department said they were concerned that officials from rival ministries were behind revelations that officials had considered detaining people in centres in locations such as Ascension Island and Papua New Guinea. There are concerns that “blue sky” ideas, some of which originate with the prime minister’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are being leaked to damage both the Home Office and Patel. Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said some of the briefings may have come from potential rivals in any future leadership challenge. “Some people are worried because they see Priti as a future leader of the Conservative party, and they know that these policies are incredibly popular in the party so they want to ridicule them,” he said. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest the government has for weeks been working on “detailed plans” that include cost estimates of building asylum detention camps on the south Atlantic islands of Ascension and St Helena, as well as Moldova, Morocco and Papua New Guinea. Disused ferries or abandoned oil rigs have also been considered. One source said: ‘These stories have not been coming from the Home Office. One has to wonder who is leaking them and why.” Patel’s allies said the creation of remote asylum processing centres was not something being planned in the short term, and that it remained more likely that the Home Office would instead reconsider opening up disused prisons and detention centres, such as Morton Hall in Lincolnshire. The home secretary will give details of her migration policy in a speech on Sunday to the Conservative party conference. Asked to respond to the FDA’s letter, a UK government spokesperson said: “The process is ongoing. The prime minister will make any decision on the matter public once the process has concluded.”"
2020-10-02T14:09:02Z,politics,Politics,'Carry on coronavirus': shine has come off Johnson as Tory conference begins,"When Boris Johnson barrelled into the scrum of Conservative party conference in Birmingham two years ago, he received a welcome more suited to a rockstar than a backbencher. Some breathless delegates had waited four hours to be part of the 1,500-strong audience for his speech at a fringe event. They cheered their hero uproariously, as he condemned Theresa May’s Brexit deal as an “outrage” that would trap the UK “in the tractor beam of Brussels”. This year, there will be no live audience at the conference; and the hype, which surrounded Johnson when he was the “prince across the water”, seems a distant memory. A poll of grassroots members conducted by the ConHome website on the eve of the conference found just 28% thought Johnson was dealing with the coronavirus pandemic well; 63% said he was dealing with it badly. As the government lurches from one U-turn to another, antagonising a growing number of Tory MPs, those sympathetic to Johnson blame his powerful advisers, including Dominic Cummings, for curtailing the boosterish “Boris” they knew and loved. “People feel that Boris is not the Boris he was. Something has happened to him,” said one erstwhile supporter. Steve Baker, the ringleader of this week’s 80-strong backbench rebellion over coronavirus restrictions, likened Johnson to Tolkein’s King Théoden, “under the spell” of his advisers. “When Theoden awakes, and I mean Boris, everything will come right,” Baker said. At a recent meeting with the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, to feed back the mood of the restive parliamentary party to the prime minister, members were taken aback when Johnson arrived with a “praetorian guard” of seven aides. “It was insane. One of the advisers walks up and gives him a paper to read out. It was suffocating. He’s out of the hospital, but the special advisers are keeping him in intensive care.” For veteran Tory MPs always sceptical about Johnson’s suitability for the job of prime minister, there is no surprise at the fumbled communications and the sense he is not on top of policy detail. When asked whether the shine has come off Johnson’s premiership, one former cabinet minister replied tartly: “If you drop something which is entirely ornamental into a corrosive acid bath, it tends to lose its appeal.” Out in the country, Tory members’ scepticism about Johnson comes despite the fact that most will not have been at the sharp end of the latest coronavirus restrictions, which have created a complex patchwork of curbs imposed across much of north-east and north-west England. Yet the bungles and mistakes still rankle. One Tory MP in a constituency in southern England said his local members were often small business-owners or professionals, who were bewildered at what they saw as a clownish lack of professionalism in Downing Street. “It’s like ‘carry on coronavirus’, with Boris as Sid James and Matt Hancock as Kenneth Williams,” he said. For the red wall MPs and their local associations, Johnson remains the leader who swept them to victory last December, in seats they hardly dared hope they could win. Many remain inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt … for the moment, at least. Aidan Ruff, a party member of 31 years, is president of Northumberland Conservatives association, which covers Hexham, Wansbeck, Berwick, and Blyth Valley. He said Tory members in the area had been broadly understanding. “I think most people think he’s making the best of a bad job. That’s the impression I get. The only grumble I’ve heard is people sort of saying, ‘Can we not get more testing done?’ Because that’s obviously the key. “The secondary one is probably messaging … how lockdown rules apply. It’s kind of really simple, just keep yourselves away from people if you’re not well. It doesn’t really need to be a lot more complicated than that.” Asked about Johnson’s poor polling among party members, Ruff said: “This is not Boris’s natural field of play, so I think he was always going to have difficulty with this … Fighting a pandemic, it’s a very technical thing, it’s not his forte.” He added: “The pressure he must be under at the minute, how he can keep a smile on his face, I have no idea. Most people would be running round in circles flapping their arms screaming.” Julian Arnold, the chairman of the Conservative association in Blackburn, which has also endured localised restrictions, was also sympathetic to Johnson. “I wouldn’t have his job for all the tea in China,” said Arnold. “We made him our leader, the country elected him as leader but there are idiosyncrasies with Boris, you know what I mean? I do get from members, ‘Well, that’s Boris, isn’t it?’” Most MPs representing red wall seats appear equally inclined to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt – but some report that their constituents are chafing against the latest coronavirus restrictions. “A lot of that good will is still there,” said one MP elected in 2019. But they also highlighted concerns among Conservative colleagues, especially about the 10pm curfew for hospitality businesses, which they described as a “kick in the guts to our local service sector”. “This measure, particularly, is causing us real concerns locally. As one fellow Tory MP in a red wall seat said to me, ‘We’ve gone from eat out to help out, to drink up and piss off,” said the MP. “It is a real, real problem now. It doesn’t feel like it’s being applied clearly and the lack of scientific evidence for it is also a major concern.” But Sajjad Karim, who served as a Tory MEP for the north-west for 15 years until 2019, predicted that worries about jobs and the economy could eventually prompt the notoriously ruthless Conservative party to turn on the prime minister. Asked about Tory support in red wall seats, Karim said: “Well, I think those MPs are going to be increasingly worried next year because many of them have been elected only for the first time, personally. And many of those seats have been won after many, many, many years, if not for the first time ever and their majorities are not great.” If the prime minister appears to be a drag on their electoral prospects, he added, “They will move to remove Boris Johnson to try to protect their own position.” Approval ratings can go up, as well as down, and much will depend on the economic fallout from the pandemic – and from Brexit. A flurry of upbeat conference announcements are planned in an attempt to return to the optimistic mood of last December’s election landslide, and the “levelling up” agenda that was meant to define Johnson’s premiership. If a vaccine emerges to allow something like normal life to return, and a Brexit deal is reached with the EU to limit the immediate fallout from the end of the transition period in January, even Johnson’s critics believe he could restore much of his lost popularity with the public. But it is hard to imagine him ever being quite the conference pin-up he was two years ago."
2020-10-02T14:01:14Z,politics,Politics,Von der Leyen  says parts of Brexit talks 'completely open' ahead of showdown,"Ursula von der Leyen has described the most difficult parts of the Brexit negotiation as remaining “completely open” but backed an intensification of talks ahead of a crunch video-conference call with Boris Johnson. After the latest and last scheduled round of negotiations in Brussels on a trade and security deal, the European commission president said there remained “a lot of work to do”, with 100 days left before the UK exits the single market and customs union. But the former German defence minister told journalists at the end of an EU summit: “Where there is a will there is a way”. Her comments came as a spokesman for the prime minister said Johnson would speak to the commission president on Saturday afternoon to “take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps”. After their last meeting in June, Johnson had declared it time to put a “tiger in the tank” of the negotiations. The prime minister had insisted it was even possible to strike a deal before the summer was out. Three months have since passed.
Von der Leyen said the two sides were still stuck on the issues of access to British waters for European fleets and the so-called level playing field provisions being pushed by Brussels to ensure neither economies can undercut standards or unfairly subsidise businesses through state aid. In a sign of the significant differences that remain, she side-stepped the question of whether the talks could go into a so-called “tunnel” negotiation, where the two sides work on creative solutions outside the scrutiny of the media and domestic politics, but pointed to the economic ravage caused by the coronavirus pandemic as reason to find agreement. Von der Leyen and the Irish taosieach, Micheál Martin, briefed the heads of state and government on the latest developments during the summit of leaders where discussions were otherwise focused on foreign affairs. Speaking later, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she was unable to report on a “breakthrough” between the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, but remained optimistic as long as the talks continued. Merkel described the UK’s internal market bill, which would unilaterally overturn parts of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, as “a very bitter moment”. In London, Mick Mulvaney, US special envoy for Northern Ireland, said he was sending the same message to Downing Street as the US Democrats in warning that a US-UK free trade deal could be blocked if the Northern Ireland Good Friday agreement was undermined by Brexit. But Merkel decoupled the row over the withdrawal agreement from the trade and security talks with the UK. In comments that will be welcomed in Downing Street, she said that an agreement on fisheries signed this week between the UK and Norway was “at least an indicator for being on a constructive path”. British officials argue that Norway, a non EU member state that conducts annual negotiations with the bloc on fishing quotas, should be the model for a post-Brexit deal on shared stocks. Merkel also said she recognised that the UK wanted to be independent of EU standards and state aid rules and that other means would be required to ensure a level playing field. “And that’s something that we need to respect that we’re going to respect and we have to find appropriate answers to this”, she said.
The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said a deal with the UK was a “geopolitical necessity”. “I’m not more nor less optimistic that I was before this European council [summit]”, he said. “I’ve always been cautiously optimistic.” The two sides will continue in talks over the next two weeks with an EU summit on 15 October looming as a key moment. Johnson had suggested last month the UK could walk away from the talks to concentrate on no-deal preparations should there be no agreement by mid-October. Brussels had also hoped to have a deal in place by the time of the summit. The first or second week of November is now being seen as the real deadline for agreement given the need to find time time for ratification by the European parliament and in Westminster. Barnier is due to meet Merkel on Monday in Berlin. Ahead of this week’s talks, five new draft negotiating documents were submitted by the government, including legal texts on fisheries, the “level playing field”, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, civil nuclear cooperation and social security coordination. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that Britain had offered a three-year transition period for European fishing fleets to allow them to prepare for the post-Brexit changes as part of an 11th-hour deal sweetener. The catches of EU fishermen would be “phased down” between 2021 and 2024 to offer time for European coastal communities to adapt to the changes but the French government is refusing to countenance the major changes to catches being proposed by London. On state aid, EU sources said the UK had offered to lay out a series of “principles” on controlling domestic subsidies. But the paper failed to offer appropriate “governance” proposals that would allow Brussels to keep the UK to its pledges, EU sources said."
2020-10-02T13:59:00Z,politics,Politics,"Covid-19 has legitimised once-radical ideas in UK, say Green leaders","The peak of the coronavirus lockdown showed how the UK can become a better country, with wages subsidised, rough sleeping almost eliminated and proper recognition of health and care staff, the co-leaders of the Green party have told their annual conference. Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, delivering the speech in parallel, as the party has done since its first co-leadership four years ago, said the government action to cope with Covid-19 had demonstrated the viability of seemingly radical ideas. “In the middle of all the horror of the pandemic, we glimpsed that a different world might be possible,” Bartley said. “Communities coming together in solidarity and compassion to care and support one another; our most valuable workers recognised as the key workers that they are, running the vital services on which we all rely; intervention to support people’s incomes; rough sleepers off our streets. In the middle of all the tragedy, all the heartache and the hardship, we had a glimpse of something new. “Where you have a right to work from home. Where everyone has a home. Where renters have the right to fair rents and cannot be evicted. Imagine if our response to an emergency like coronavirus was to plan and build that better world from the things we learned.”
The pair, who lead the Greens in England and Wales, made their speech from a cinema in London, streamed to members as part of the online conference. A repeated refrain was that the coronavirus emergency had shown that once-mocked ideas advocated by the Greens were being adopted by others. At their conference last week, the Liberal Democrats adopted the idea of a universal basic income, which guarantees a fixed sum to all, regardless of circumstances. This was, Bartley said, “an idea whose time has come”, adding: “We can eliminate poverty. Right now.” Berry noted how the Greens had “dissented in a big way” over austerity from 2010 onwards, “and we were proved right”. She also recalled how one newspaper derided the Greens’ proposals to invest £100bn a year to transform the UK economy to a more sustainable model, printing 11 zeros across the headline. “We planned last year to invest this much because, in the face of inequality, injustice and the climate emergency, the right answer was to think big and invest – to transform the way we live and work, for the better,” she said. “And guess what? The government has already committed over three times that amount to grappling with coronavirus over just six months. Because in the face of such an emergency, you do whatever it takes.” Citing the example of grassroots activists such as the school climate strikers, the pair said it was vital for people to push for such changes. Berry said: “Because we – and you – know that better is possible.”"
2020-10-02T12:45:26Z,politics,Politics,Councils given five minutes' notice of local lockdown confirmation,"Council leaders in England were given five minutes’ notice of local lockdown rules being confirmed in their areas, according to emails seen by the Guardian. Amid growing calls for local authorities to have more control over restrictions, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is urging ministers to put councils “in the driver’s seat”. Hartlepool and Middlesbrough councils were only informed of the confirmed detail of the proposed restrictions when they received a draft press release from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at 10.25am on Thursday, five minutes before the measures were announced by Matt Hancock, leaked emails suggest. In Merseyside, where new rules were also announced on Thursday, it is understood that council bosses were briefed on the measures 30 minutes before Hancock’s statement. One senior source said they were surprised and concerned that the rules had been “watered down” from what had been discussed with a minister only 12 hours earlier. The restrictions are a significant extension to nationwide measures and make it illegal for households in the areas to mix in any indoor setting, including pubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas. The legislation will apply to nearly 5 million people across Merseyside, Warrington and most of north-east England from Saturday. The DHSC said discussions had taken place with local leaders over a number of days. Starmer called for change after a week of “massive frustration”, he said, from local authorities. “The message to the government is: involve local leaders, whether it’s council leaders or mayors, much more intensely, and much earlier. Because what’s going on is sometimes consultation, sometimes not.” Andy Preston, the Middlesbrough mayor, said there had been a “monstrous and frightening lack of communication” from the government, which had shown “disregard for local expertise, local knowledge and local need.” Earlier this week Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, accused ministers of creating “chaos and confusion” by making significant announcements affecting millions of people without properly consulting local leaders. Local leaders say it is vital that they are closely involved in decisions, not least because they are often the first port of call for residents trying to understand new guidance. Emails show that a senior DHSC official wrote to Hartlepool and Middlesbrough councils on Wednesday evening to say Hancock wanted them to provide “written confirmation” that the leaders “have been engaged and understand the measures being proposed”. Hartlepool officials pushed back, saying it was not clear what measures were being proposed and they would not agree to restrictions “seemingly being proposed for us” that would make illegal any household mixing in pubs, bars and restaurants. It is understood that the council leaders were then left in the dark until they were sent a draft press release by a DHSC official at the same time that Hancock was announcing the new rules in the Commons on Thursday. Hartlepool officials demanded that the announcement be withdrawn pending further discussion. However, by that time the measures had been announced on live television. Requests for an urgent conference call with the health secretary were rebuffed as Hancock was still on his feet in the Commons. The leaders then expressed their anger in a call with Helen Whately, a junior health minister. The announcement also prompted frustration in Merseyside. The six local council leaders and Steve Rotheram, the mayor of Liverpool city region, had been in contact with DHSC ministers, officials and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, all week but were left in the dark about the detail of the measures until just before they were announced.
In contrast to Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, the Merseyside leaders were anxious for stricter measures than those proposed by the government. Infection rates in the region have surged since the beginning of September, with Liverpool and Knowsley recording the highest infection rates in England, at five times the national average. Merseyside officials have asked DHSC to urgently provide the scientific evidence behind the measures and to significantly increase financial support for the area. A DHSC spokesman said: “It is wrong to claim councils were only given short notice as in fact discussions and engagement had been taking place for several days. We understand how much of an imposition these measures are but they are based on the latest scientific evidence and are in place to suppress the virus, protect all of us while doing everything possible to support the economy.”"
2020-10-02T12:31:44Z,politics,Politics,Margaret Ferrier: Covid rules the MP broke carry potential fines,"The former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier is under pressure to resign from her Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat after she reportedly broke a series of coronavirus regulations. These are the dates of the potential breaches and the penalties. Saturday 26 September Ferrier took a coronavirus test after experiencing symptoms. A person experiencing Covid symptoms, however mild, in Scotland must self-isolate for at least 10 days and book a test. But instead she travelled to London the next day. Sunday 27 September Ferrier travelled to London by train. Transport Scotland guidance is that you should stay at home if you or anyone in your household is experiencing coronavirus symptoms or is self-isolating. Monday 28 September Ferrier was in London when she received her positive test, and it is a legal requirement in England to inform your employer if you are told to self-isolate. The SNP says that Ferrier told the party about her positive test only on Wednesday. Tuesday 29 September Ferrier returned to Scotland, again by train. Again, the guidance from the Department of Transport is that you should not use public transport if you are experiencing coronavirus symptoms. It is a criminal offence to leave self-isolation in England without a reasonable excuse – anyone who does not isolate after a positive result can be fined up to £10,000 – but this law only came into force on Monday, so it is unclear whether it applies retrospectively, to those who took a test before then, as Ferrier did."
2020-10-02T10:40:25Z,politics,Politics,Digested week: Johnson's adult learning drive takes me back to the 90s,"Monday David Nicholls is one of those authors that critics sometimes seem to underrate. Possibly because his novels always spend a long time on the bestseller lists. He doesn’t just have a sharp eye for story, his characters also have real depth and his books are a delicate balance between warmth and edge. No one ever gets too easy a ride. Us, which Nicholls has adapted into a Sunday night TV series – we’ve already binge watched all four episodes on iPlayer – is no exception. I can’t be the only bloke who saw the first five minutes and went into a cold sweat, wondering whether my wife was planning to tell me that our marriage was over because she now found me just a bit too dull and predictable. Before the coronavirus, my wife and I were both out at work during the week and had more of a social life at weekends, so I like to imagine that I may have appeared rather more interesting than I really am. Since March though, my wife and I have both been working from home and I can’t help feeling she must have noticed how boring I am because I do pretty much the same things every day. She did make a point of asking me during the second episode what big trip – other than a visit to Minneapolis to see our daughter – I would like to make before I died. My mind initially went blank, before hastily coming up with a ceramics tour of Japan. I think that was a good enough answer, so I may have earned myself a temporary reprieve. The other thing that has struck me about watching Us is how, even though it was filmed only last year, it seems like a different world with people taking travel and touch as normal. I wonder how soon it will be before we take them both for granted again when the pandemic is over. Tuesday Back in the 1990s and the early years of the 2000s I worked on the Guardian as a writer for the regular Tuesday education supplement, which – pre-internet – had about 17 pages of features and interviews along with dozens of pages of advertisements for jobs in the education sector. We were a great team and would regularly cover all aspects of education from schools to universities and further education colleges. Inevitably, over the years, the same stories would come round time and time again, one of which would be some minister deciding that the government needed to do more for those who left school with few academic qualifications and to promote parity of esteem between universities and vocational training. At one point the education department took it so seriously that it renamed itself the Department for Education and Skills, and I have lost count of the number of articles I wrote that involved going to an adult training college to watch a minister try his hand at bricklaying or plumbing before making a speech about giving the country the skills it needed to compete with other countries. That would generally be the last we heard about a levelling-up agenda until the next time. It was the uncontentious go-to policy for any government short of ideas. So when Boris Johnson went down to Exeter College today to lay a few bricks, make precisely the same speech and to reannounce the same money that had already been earmarked for the training budget, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu. Given that he couldn’t even remember his own rules for the coronavirus restrictions, I’d be astonished if his promises on adult learning lasted longer than the time it took him to get back to London. There again, if he does genuinely make even a small difference to vocational training, he will be the first minister to have done so in over 30 years.
Wednesday Shortly after the end of the game between Liverpool and Arsenal on Monday night, the former Manchester United player-turned-pundit, Roy Keane got into an argument with Liverpool’s manager, Jurgen Klopp. It all seemed a bit academic as Liverpool had won 3-1 in relative comfort, but Keane was upset that Klopp’s side didn’t play more cautiously to hold on to its lead rather than continue to press for more goals. Writing as a Spurs fan, whose team has only won two league cups in the past 30 years, I may not be the best person to judge who is right but I’d still take Klopp’s style over Keane’s any time. In all the years my team has won next to nothing, I’ve enjoyed the Harry Redknapp and the Mauricio Pochettino years the best. These were sides that continued to press throughout the 90 minutes and even when it all went horribly wrong, I could still forgive them for attempting to play with panache. When we beat Southampton 5-2 the other week, I couldn’t help thinking that our current manager, José Mourinho, would rather we had seen the game out 2-0. When we were 1-0 up against Newcastle at the weekend deep into injury time, I had this feeling we were going to concede. Even if it was to an absurd penalty call. Still, at least this time I didn’t make the mistake of watching it. We were out to lunch and though I had brought my iPad with me, I didn’t switch it on. In these stressful Covid times, I’ve got to do everything possible to nurse my mental health. Starting with Spurs. Still, as we’ve just beaten Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out – I’ve lost count of the number I’ve seen us lose – I can feel myself unexpectedly warming to Mourinho. I am that fickle. Thursday I’d always fondly imagined Tom Stoppard’s life to be impossibly glamorous. Long lunches and stimulating conversation with famous people interspersed with a few hours work knocking out some bons mots for yet another critically successful play. However, Hermione Lee’s new biography reveals a rather more three-dimensional portrait. Because in between writing such plays as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Arcadia and Leopoldstadt, Stoppard has made a very nice living – up to $100,000 a week – working anonymously on such films as Beethoven (the mutt not the composer), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and the Bourne Ultimatum. He even wrote the immortal line in 102 Dalmatians, “You may have won the battle but I’m about to win the wardrobe.” Lee writes that Stoppard took on these screen-writing gigs purely for the cash: apparently having three wives and several long-term affairs is ruinously expensive. After all, who doesn’t need a Provençale bolt-hole to meet with a lover? But it wasn’t so much the money that got to me – though I must confess to a certain amount of envy and would like it on record that my daily rate is considerably less than Tom’s – it was the energy. Just how has Stoppard managed to cram so much into his life? My day begins with one ear open for a minister saying something stupid on the radio and continues in pretty much the same vein: looking for some piece of political nonsense or hypocrisy to turn into an 800-word sketch. And by the time I’ve done that, I’m pretty much knackered and haven’t the brain power to work on side projects. Which is something of an issue at the moment, as I am under contract to write two books. I keep telling myself I will have more headspace when the pandemic is over. I just hope I’m right. Friday Woke up this morning to find out that both Donald Trump and Melania have tested positive for the coronavirus. After an initial WTF reaction, my next thought was how many of his supporters will think this is fake news or a plot to derail the US election. That’s how weird the news cycle has become. Normally at this time of year I am off to Birmingham, Bournemouth, Brighton, Liverpool or Manchester for the annual party conferences, but for obvious reasons they have all been cancelled and put online where most people – reporters included – have mostly ignored them. This weekend was meant to be the start of the Tory party conference and even though there will be nobody attending and Boris Johnson will presumably be delivering his speech in a near-empty room, I have still had to be security cleared to get access to the event. I can only assume the Conservative party knows something about my cyber hacking skills that I don’t. It’s hard to believe that Johnson’s speech will outdo the one in which Theresa May was presented with her P45, lost her voice and had the set collapse around her for drama, but harder still to know what he can say to the Tory faithful that will cheer them up. There may be a few who think that sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island, building a wave machine in the channel to repel small boats is what they voted for or putting Chris Grayling in charge of some decommissioned ferries is the answer to the country’s immigration problems, but most will have just thought that Dominic Cummings has been organising psychedelic brainstorming away days. Nor will Boris have anything positive to say about the coronavirus: as a pilot for Operation Moonshot – the government’s plan to do 10m saliva tests a day – all Salford residents were expected to have been tested by now, but the Manchester Evening News reports that the trial has not even reached 250 people a day. Maybe he’s got better news on Brexit and the economy. On second thoughts ... Digested week: Where to start?"
2020-10-02T09:40:25Z,politics,Politics,MP Margaret Ferrier faces calls to resign for flouting Covid rules,"Margaret Ferrier, the former Scottish National party MP who made a 400-mile train trip knowing she had tested positive for coronavirus, is facing increasing pressure to resign as anger mounts at her “utterly indefensible” actions. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and first minister of Scotland, said she had spoken to Ferrier on Friday morning “and made clear my view that she should step down as an MP”. Sturgeon tweeted: “I did so with a heavy heart – she is a friend and colleague – but her actions were dangerous and indefensible. I have no power to force an MP to resign but I hope she will do the right thing.” Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, told BBC Radio Scotland that Ferrier’s position “isn’t tenable given the circumstances that we are in and she has to accept her own responsibilities”. Pressed on whether she should resign immediately, Blackford said: “I can’t force that on her. She is no longer an SNP MP.” Blackford withdrew the party whip from Ferrier on Thursday evening. The SNP is facing questions about when it knew that the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West – who travelled to the Commons from Scotland after taking a test and spoke in the chamber while awaiting the result – had broken the law. The Scottish Conservatives are calling for the SNP to expel Ferrier from the party.
The UK housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, refused to call for Ferrier to resign, saying: “It is a matter for her to decide what she wants to do. It wouldn’t be right for me to comment on the police’s investigation.” Jenrick himself faced questions in April after the Guardian revealed that he had travelled 40 miles to his parents’ home in Shropshire after urging the public to stay at home during lockdown. Jenrick was asked whether political figures flouting coronavirus guidance – such as Ferrier, Dominic Cummings and, more recently, Jeremy Corbyn and Stanley Johnson – made it harder to enforce public health messages because it gave the impression that people in the “Westminster club” were above the law. He said: “Nobody is above the law, and she has accepted she broke the law on multiple occasions … I don’t think it’s wise for politicians to pass comment on individual cases.” Ferrier was one of many MPs to call for Cummings to resign after the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed that the prime minister’s adviser had travelled to Durham after his wife became ill with suspected coronavirus and the day before he also fell sick. Blackford told the Good Morning Scotland programme that the first he knew of Ferrier’s actions was on Thursday morning, hours before she released her apology statement shortly after 6pm. He said he asked the SNP’s chief whip, Patrick Grady, to put questions to Ferrier to establish a timeline. “It was only on Thursday afternoon that I was fully aware of everything that had happened. On the basis of that, I had a conversation with Margaret and we moved to suspend the whip.” He added: “The facts of the matter are that she had a test on Saturday, she travelled down [to Westminster] on Monday and was given the results of the test on Monday evening and took the decision to travel home. At no point did she tell us that these things had taken place.” Blackford said Ferrier’s constituents were right to feel angry. “She has been a hard-working MP, a diligent MP. This is gut-wrenching but it’s an enormous error of judgment that she’s made and she has to do the right thing for her constituents.” Ferrier, who has referred herself to the parliamentary standards commissioners and police, faces fury from SNP colleagues, with her neighbouring MP David Linden also calling for her resignation. Police Scotland suggested Ferrier could face an investigation and a possible fine. A spokesman said: “We are aware of the circumstances and are liaising with our colleagues in the Metropolitan police.” There was widespread criticism of Ferrier from opposition parties, with Douglas Ross MP, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, calling her her to go “with immediate effect” and the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, saying “her reckless actions have rendered her unfit for public office”.
Also speaking on Good Morning Scotland, the Scottish Conservative MP John Lamont said the SNP had the option to expel Ferrier from the party. Lamont said: “There’s now serious questions not just for Ms Ferrier but for the SNP, when they knew about the course of action she was proposing to take and that she did take. For example, she applied for her proxy on Monday evening, we understand. Did she tell colleagues within the SNP why she needed the proxy, did she explain she’d had a test, that she was displaying signs of Covid and what action did they take? There’s very serious questions for the SNP about what they knew when.”"
2020-10-02T05:00:14Z,politics,Politics,Home Office moved Covid-affected asylum seekers against orders,"The Home Office moved dozens of asylum seekers involved in a Covid outbreak more than 120 miles despite an enforcement order saying they should remain in self-isolation for 14 days, the Guardian has learned. Home Office contractors have been accused of being “beyond reckless” in their handling of the initial outbreak. Among those who were moved despite the instruction to self-isolate, at least nine people were found to have Covid following testing, although the Home Office had initially said none had tested positive. The initial outbreak was among asylum seekers in Home Office accommodation in Birmingham. Public health officials deemed it too overcrowded to be Covid-secure after at least 26 people tested positive. Enforcement action was taken ordering everyone in the accommodation to self-isolate for 14 days, but the Home Office moved 40 people to the west London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. In a letter of complaint sent to the home secretary, Priti Patel, and seen by the Guardian, six councils in the Midlands accused Home Office contractors of being “beyond reckless” in their handling of the Birmingham outbreak. While a separate letter, from the Hammersmith and Fulham council, accused the Home Office of moving Covid from one part of the country to another. The government is urging everyone who has the virus, or has been in contact with someone who has tested positive, to self-isolate. Those who don’t are at risk of fines. The letter from the Midlands councils complains about the way the Home Office and its contractor Serco handled the outbreak at the Birmingham accommodation. Signed by Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, and co-signed by the Birmingham Edgbaston MP, Preet Gill, and the leaders of Solihull, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Sandwell and Walsall councils, the letter states that “adequate measures were not put in place to prevent an outbreak” in the accommodation in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Built to accommodate 270 asylum seekers and 30 staff, the accommodation consists of shared rooms for two people and shared bathrooms for five people. The dining facilities can seat 100 people. The letter, dated 28 August, states: “It is beyond reckless that in the current circumstances a provider operating under the terms of a government-commissioned contract failed to take adequate steps to prevent an outbreak and is continuing to fail to take even the most basic steps to protect the health of vulnerable people that they are paid to support.” It says Birmingham city council has taken enforcement action against Serco, requiring all residents to be moved into single-room accommodation and for all residents to be treated as Covid-infected and therefore required to self-isolate for 14 days. It says the enforcement action must be complied with within 48 hours. Yet Hammersmith and Fulham council confirmed that 40 people from the Birmingham accommodation who were ordered to self-isolate for 14 days arrived in London on 31 August. The letter from the London council complains about the fact that the 40 asylum seekers were moved to a hotel in its borough with the Home Office incorrectly telling the council that none of them had Covid. After conducting its own tests, the council found that nine of the group had coronavirus. The letter to Patel states: “If, as I assume it is, the Home Office is doing this on a grander scale across the country, it risks significantly contributing to the spread of Covid-19, undoing the efforts of responsible citizens and other government departments, the NHS and local authorities around Great Britain. This is not the kind of joined-up government that will enable the UK to tackle the pandemic successfully.” Steve Cowan, the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council, condemned the Home Office’s actions. “It is shocking that the Home Office is knowingly and incompetently moving people around the country in a way that risks allowing the virus to spread at a time when people who have Covid or are at risk of having Covid are being urged to stay at home and self-isolate.” A spokesperson for Birmingham city council said: “The important thing to stress is that Birmingham is a city that has consistently welcomed people fleeing persecution and we are proud that this continues to be a city of sanctuary. But in opening our arms to asylum seekers, we must ensure that they are coming to a place of safety.” Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “It’s shocking that since the start of the pandemic, people seeking asylum have been left exposed to Covid due to poor accommodation in which they have found it hard to isolate, distance, or access adequate information. It is particularly concerning because many people in the asylum system are from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the virus. “As cases rise quickly again, the government must make sure that some of the most vulnerable people in our communities are properly housed, able to stay safe, and follow the rules.” At a hearing of the public accounts select committee on Thursday, officials said 122 asylum seekers in hotels had tested positive for Covid. In response to questions from MPs about why asylum seekers had been moved from one part of the country to another without local authorities being informed about their arrival, the second permanent secretary at the Home Office, Shona Dunn, said the department was dealing with a fast-moving situation and that it had done its “utmost to engage with local authorities”. Jenni Halliday, Serco’s contract director for asylum seeker accommodation and support, said the company refuted the “inaccurate accusations and assertions” made in the letter. “In the face of the extraordinary challenges of a fast-moving situation involving some very distressed and frightened people, the Serco team acted with great professionalism and care for the asylum seekers in our accommodation, and their safety and wellbeing was always the highest priority,” Halliday said. “If we had immediately reduced the number of people this would have involved moving a large number of people, in direct contravention of the national guidance and instructions from Public Health England [PHE] and the Home Office, and Serco was not prepared to do that. “However, we did what we were advised to do: move the minimum number of people to allow self-isolation for those that remained at [the Birmingham accommodation], and to a level agreed with PHE.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “During these unprecedented times, we have worked tirelessly with local authorities and other partners to provide asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute, with suitable accommodation – as we are required to do by law. “The health and wellbeing of asylum seekers has and always will be the priority, and we will continue to provide support to those that need it. The Home Office is following national guidance in relation to testing, as set by Public Health England."
2020-10-01T23:01:06Z,politics,Politics,"Legalise e-scooters in UK as alternative to short car trips, MPs say","MPs have called on the government to legalise e-scooters in the UK and advertise them to car drivers as a greener alternative for short journeys. The cross-party Commons transport select committee said the scooters, which are only legal to use in limited regional trials, should be allowed on British roads. They also called for robust enforcement to stop people using them on pavements, which they said was dangerous and antisocial, and an impediment to pedestrians and people with disabilities. E-scooters are permitted in most European countries but are illegal on public roads in the UK despite their widespread sale and use. Government-backed trials, limited to shared public rental schemes, started in the summer in Middlesbrough, followed by other pilots in the West Midlands, Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire. The committee recommended that privately owned e-scooters should also be permitted, and called on the Department for Transport to encourage their use as an alternative to short car journeys. It cautioned, however, that it would be counterproductive if people switched from more active and healthy forms of travel such as cycling and walking. The Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: “The UK remains the last major European economy where e-scooters are still banned to use anywhere except on private land and their use on UK roads is currently illegal. “E-scooters have the potential to become an exciting and ingenious way to navigate our streets and get from place to place. If this gets people out of the car, reducing congestion and exercising in the open air, then even better.” The UK trials, operated by a range of companies vying for a share of the growing sector, do not suggest such a move would be straightforward. The rollout across Teesside was slowed after widespread complaints about e-scooters being ridden in shopping centres and along a dual carriageway. Coventry’s scheme was halted after only five days last month over misuse of the vehicles. It was announced on Wednesday that Liverpool would be the next city to run a pilot scheme.
The committee said the requirement for a driving licence, which is a requirement for people to take part in the trials, should be dropped, and that local authorities should be allowed to determine maximum speeds. Models in the UK trials are capable of a maximum speed of 15.5mph. The AA backed the call for e-scooters to be legalised but said there should be a national speed limit. It said the safest option would be for the vehicles to use cycle paths and for users to be trained before going on public highways. The dangers of e-scooters were highlighted again last week when a second rider’s death in the UK was reported at a coroner’s inquiry. Barrie Howes, 57, died after a crash in Chatham, Kent, when using an e-scooter on a steep hill in July."

(See 5.39pm.) More than 2 million people in Merseyside, Warrington and Teesside will be banned by law from mixing with other households indoors in the latest extension of lockdown restrictions, as Middlesbroughâ€™s mayor took the extraordinary step of saying he was prepared to defy the government. Turkey and Poland are being removed from Englandâ€™s travel corridor list, as people who breach Covid-19 quarantine restrictions face tougher fines of up to Â£10,000. The SNP MP Margaret Ferrier says she has reported herself to the police for breaking self-isolation rules. On Monday she travelled by train to London to attend parliament while awaiting the results of a Covid test, which she ordered because she had mild symptoms. She subsequently learnt she was positive on Monday night. But then she returned home by train on Tuesday.

2020-10-01T15:14:55Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: EU launches legal action against UK for breaching withdrawal agreement,"The EU has launched legal action against the UK after Boris Johnson failed to respond to Brussels’ demand that he drop legislation that would overwrite the withdrawal agreement and break international law. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, announced that the UK had been put on formal notice over the internal market bill tabled by the prime minister last month. Meanwhile, EU officials downplayed hopes that ongoing trade and security talks were closing in on solutions to the most contentious issues. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, arriving at a summit in Brussels, suggested the negotiations could drag deep into October or beyond, saying it would be “nice” to get a “general outline and the details of a deal ready” before the end of the month. Brussels had given Johnson until the end of September to drop the contentious clauses in the internal market bill, through which the prime minister is seeking to allow ministers to unilaterally change a protocol relating to Northern Ireland contained in the Brexit divorce deal signed last year. In a statement on Thursday morning, Von der Leyen said the deadline had lapsed and the UK had failed to live up to its obligations to act in good faith. The former German defence minister said the UK had a month to respond to the commission’s letter of notice, which marks the beginning of a formal infringement process. “We had invited our British friends to remove the problematic parts of their draft internal market bill by the end of September,” she said. “This draft bill is, by its very nature, a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the withdrawal agreement. Moreover, if adopted as is, it will be in full contradiction to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.” She added: ”The problematic provisions have not been removed. Therefore this morning the commission has decided to send a letter of formal notice to the UK government. This is the first step in an infringement procedure.” The internal market bill would give ministers legal powers to override two elements of the Northern Ireland protocol, which Johnson agreed to last October to avoid the return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. UK ministers would decide whether to notify the commission of any government subsidy decisions that could affect goods trade in Northern Ireland and whether to waive the need for export summary declarations when sending goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. The details of the protocol are being thrashed out in implementation talks chaired by the UK’s Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič in a joint committee. “We’re committed to working through the joint committee to find a solution that is satisfactory to both sides,” Johnson’s spokesman said. But the UK government has said it needs the legislation as a safety net should the EU act unreasonably. Brussels has likened Downing Street’s ploy to negotiating with a “gun on the table”. The commission’s letter is the start of a lengthy process that could end up in the European court of justice. The EU court in Luxembourg could impose huge daily fines for continued breaches. The UK agreed to be bound by decisions of the court on cases that began before the end of the transition period on 31 December, and for four years after that point. A government spokesperson said: “We will respond to the letter in due course. We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to the Northern Ireland protocol. We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market, ensure ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.” The infringement procedure is a common tool used by the commission against member states. Last year there were 800 open cases. Germany had 47 pending cases and France 34. Each procedure takes an average of 35 months to complete. Rutte described the infringement proceeding as “administrative” rather than political, in an attempt to defuse tension. The EU had initially suggested the internal market bill was an impediment to the ongoing trade and security negotiations but has in recent weeks decoupled the issues. This week Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, admitted that many of the EU’s concerns would “fade away” if the joint committee was able to do its work and a wider trade deal was secured. The Irish government’s spokesman on European affairs, Neale Richmond, said on Thursday that the legal action was regrettable but “absolutely the right decision”."
2020-10-01T14:42:40Z,politics,Politics,Boris's Brexit and Covid incompetence spreads to infect asylum policy | John Crace,"For obvious reasons it has been coronavirus and Brexit that have been dominating the news agenda in recent months. But No 10 has been getting concerned that the public might be under the impression that it is just the Department of Health and Social Care and the Brexit negotiating wing of the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster that are incompetent. So to promote the idea that he is running a government of all the talentless, Boris Johnson is now keen to make clear that the Home Office and the Foreign Office are capable of being equally clueless. This week we learned that the Home Office had come up with proposals to set up an asylum seeker detention centre on Ascension Island. Worried that people might think sending people by boat to the south Atlantic was actually a sensible idea, the government hastily leaked a whole load of other even more stupid ideas that were being considered. First there was the possibility of detention centres in Morocco, Moldova and Papua New Guinea, despite the fact that none of the three countries had expressed any enthusiasm for the idea. Morocco had already turned down the offer years ago when it had been mooted by the EU; Moldova – in case no one had noticed – is a war zone; and Papua New Guinea, as well as having no direct flights to the UK, has already been burned by Australia after it built its own detention centre on Manus Island. In a parallel world, the EU and Micronesia could be plotting to use the UK as a dumping ground for all their coronavirus victims. After all, we are a world hub for the disease. If this wasn’t enough, the Home Office then leaked the coup de grace of filling up abandoned ferries and oil rigs with asylum seekers and building a wave machine that would push boats back to France. That or drown everyone on them. They weren’t bothered which. Either would do. It was just bad luck then that Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, had a date with the public accounts committee to explain his department’s plans for processing asylum applications. The committee chair, Meg Hillier, cut to the chase. Was he aware that no planes had landed on Ascension Island since 2017 and that the runway on St Helena, another south Atlantic island in the frame, was unusable? “The civil service is here to give independent advice,” said Rycroft, stalling for time. It would be entirely wrong for him to comment on private discussions that had been leaked to the media. All that had happened was that ministers and civil servants had been indulging in some blue-sky thinking in which all options had been up for discussion. What other sorts of things had been discussed, Hillier asked. Rycroft thought that now probably wasn’t the time to mention the reintroduction of child labour, the international space station or the appointment of Chris Grayling as the new asylum seekers tsar. And he was too loyal to make the point that the whole brainstorming exercise had just been a bit of fun – no one had intended an away day on magic mushrooms to be taken as policy – with civil servants competing with one another to think of the sort of ideas that Dominic Cummings or Tony Abbott might come up with, and it had never occurred to anyone that No 10 might actually take any of this bollocks remotely seriously. Though that was the impression he was determined to give. “We looked at all sorts of things,” was going to be as far as he would go. And was every idea compatible with the European convention on human rights? Of course. Even though most of it obviously wasn’t. Rycroft made a mental note to give a promotion to whoever had leaked all this stuff. If Boris was deranged enough to go through with any of this, it was vital that his department should be seen to have as little to do with it as possible. Back in the Commons, Matt Hancock had managed to avoid an urgent question on the 10pm curfew in pubs by translating it into a ministerial statement on further lockdowns in Liverpool. Even so, he didn’t seem at all happy to be dragged back to the chamber for his third appearance within a week. Like Boris, he has reached the point where he can no longer tolerate any criticism. So when the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, reminded the house that the main problem with the government’s strategy was the failure of its test-and-trace system, and that the 10pm curfew had created as many problems as it had solved by kicking everyone out pissed on to public transport at the same time, Matt had a small hissy fit. The curfew was fine, test and trace was fine and it was fine for Deloitte to sell back information to the public sector. OK? There wasn’t too much sympathy for Hancock from either side of the house. Many Tory MPs are getting it in the neck from hospitality companies in their constituencies. Philip Davies was fed up with the nanny state and thought people should be allowed to choose to get coronavirus or not, and the ever more self-parodic Desmond Swayne reckoned pubs should be allowed to determine their own opening hours. Presumably, if people regularly drink themselves to unconsciousness and are left where they are then there’s little chance of them transmitting the virus. The questions rapidly got tougher. Did Hancock think people had stopped obeying the rules after Dominic Cummings did what he liked? Absolutely not. “I will not have this,” he snapped, when asked a perfectly reasonable question about a wrong answer he had given two weeks back. “I just won’t have it.” But he will. Because Hancock does not have the self-worth to admit his government’s mistakes. Once a Door Matt, always a Door Matt."
2020-10-01T10:47:48Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: Ireland needs to press for reunification vote, says Sinn Féin","Ireland cannot trust an “erratic” and “dangerous” Boris Johnson on Brexit and needs to start pressuring Downing Street for a referendum on Irish unification, according to Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Féin. Johnson has forfeited credibility by unpicking the withdrawal agreement and cannot be believed when he says he wants a trade deal, said McDonald. “He’s the prime minister and perfidious Albion just got perfidiouser, if there’s such a word.” If Britain did not “honour a bargain fairly struck” it would face a backlash from Ireland’s allies in the EU and US, where congressional leaders could sink Downing Street’s hopes of a US trade deal, said McDonald. “If there is damage in Ireland, if there’s a hardening of the border – well, then all bets are off.” The Sinn Féin leader spoke to the Guardian after an opinion poll showed her opposition party to be the most popular in Ireland, with support at 32%. Recent blunders by the Fianna Fáil-led coalition government have put a question mark over its longevity and bolstered McDonald’s image as a taoiseach-in-waiting. A government led by Sinn Féin would jolt British–Irish relations. A mouthpiece for the IRA during the Troubles, it has become a mainstream, leftwing party that appeals to voters in the south of Ireland on bread-and-butter issues, especially health and housing. However, McDonald, 51, stressed its enduring determination to unite Ireland. “In my lifetime? Absolutely. All of the signposts, all of the markers, point in the direction of reunification,” she said. By next year, the centenary of Northern Ireland’s creation, Catholics are expected to outnumber Protestants for the first time, a seismic demographic shift that comes just as Brexit has prompted some unionists to question the region’s position in the UK. “The electoral majority for unionism is now gone, politics on this island has changed in ways that are profound,” said McDonald, a Trinity College graduate from Dublin who succeeded Gerry Adams as party leader in 2018. However, Northern Ireland voters are not flocking to the republican banner. In the December general election Sinn Féin’s overall vote in the north fell by 6.7 percentage points. The fastest-growing bloc is the so-called non-aligned – voters who shun traditional orange/green labels. Opinion polls suggest they tilt towards the status quo: staying in the UK. Anthony McIntyre, a former Belfast IRA member and commentator, said: “No provisional IRA volunteer who fought the provo war will see a united Ireland.” The NHS and other benefits of the UK would swing the result, he predicted. “People who are only nominally nationalist will vote for the union. That’s where the veto lies.” McDonald said the promise of a new, progressive, inclusive Ireland, with an NHS-style health service, would win over enough voters. Under the Good Friday agreement, the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary must call a referendum when it appears likely that most people would vote in favour of a united Ireland. However, McDonald said ministers refused to spell out the exact conditions that would trigger a vote. “I wouldn’t like anybody in the British system to imagine that they hold a trump card that says ‘we will forever avoid or defer a referendum in Ireland’. They don’t have that right.” She said a united Ireland must offer unionists “the kinds of protections and assurances that they need” – for instance, a possible continued role for the Stormont assembly. She ruled out moving the capital from Dublin. Asked whether the IRA violence during the Troubles was justified, McDonald said: “I think it was inevitable.” Partition and discrimination created a “toxic” context that “framed” attitudes and choices, she said. Pressed again on whether violence was justified, she said she was a child for much of the campaign. “I am certainly not going to be the person accountable for things that happened in 1973. I think that’s an extraordinary thing to ask of me.” She said there would never be an agreed narrative on the Troubles. “I think it’s foolish to pursue it … you’re not going to bridge that difference.” History could not be undone, she said. “The past is the past. I can’t rewrite it.” She rejected allegations that the IRA army council still existed and influenced party policy. “The IRA is gone, the conflict is over,” she said. There was a hint of misogyny in the claims that shadowy men directed her, said McDonald. “It seems there are some people who find it hard to grasp that a woman from Dublin could be the leader of Sinn Féin, but I am.” A severe Covid-19 infection in April – McDonald was floored and got pleurisy before recovering – led to a little bright spot in British–Irish relations. “Prince Charles sent me a letter,” she said, “which I thought was really nice.”"
2020-10-01T08:03:52Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn and Stanley Johnson apologise for Covid breaches,"The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson’s father, Stanley, have apologised for separate breaches of coronavirus restrictions. Corbyn was pictured with his wife, Laura Alvarez, at a dinner party for nine people, breaching the rule that only six people can meet indoors or outdoors. The penalty for the breach is a £200 fine.
He told the Sun, which published the photo: “I recently had dinner at a friend’s house where the number of guests eventually exceeded five. I understand that remaining at the dinner was a breach of the rule of six. I apologise for my mistake.”
Separately, Stanley Johnson expressed regret for breaching the rules on face masks after he was pictured in the Daily Mirror browsing in a newsagent without a face covering. Fines were increased to £200 last week for a first-time offence for failing to wear a face covering in the designated places. Johnson said he may not be “100% up to speed” with the rules having just returned from three weeks abroad, though wearing a face covering in shops has been compulsory since 24 July.
“I’m extremely sorry for the slip-up and I would urge absolutely everybody to do everything they can to make sure they do follow the rules about masks and social distancing,” he said. “The fact this was my first day back in the UK after three weeks abroad is, I am sure, no excuse for not knowing the rules.” Johnson has previously made headlines after travelling to his home in Greece in July, in a breach of Foreign Office guidance at the time to avoid non-essential travel. On Wednesday Boris Johnson reiterated the need for the public to follow restrictions at a sombre press conference where he confronted critics of his coronavirus strategy, insisting there was “only one way of doing this”.
At a Downing Street press conference alongside the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, the prime minister said: “I know that some people will think we should give up, and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that that would potentially entail. “I have to say I profoundly disagree. I don’t think it’s what the British people want. They don’t want to throw in the sponge. There is only one way of doing this, and that is by showing the collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of others.” Vallance said of the second wave of the virus: “We don’t have this under control at the moment.” The latest official data showed 7,108 new cases across the UK, and 71 deaths for the second day in a row. The cases figure was slightly down on the 7,143 reported on Tuesday. Whitty said hospital and intensive care admission rates were “definitely heading the wrong way”, and pointed out that they were moving from younger age groups into the older population."
2020-09-30T21:30:51Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: pupils should learn more black British history,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is to call for schoolchildren to be taught more about Britain’s black history, to help them reach “a full understanding of the struggle for equality”. As he marks the start of Black History Month by visiting the Museum of London with the shadow equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, Starmer will join calls for the curriculum to be made more diverse. “This month we celebrate the huge achievements of Black Britons and the Black community. But Black British history should be taught all year round, as part of a truly diverse school curriculum that includes and inspires all young people and aids a full understanding of the struggle for equality,” he said, in pre-released remarks. “While some schools are already doing this, the government should ensure all students benefit from a diverse curriculum.”
Research by the education charity Teach First found that pupils could complete their GCSEs and leave secondary school without having studied a single literary work by a non-white author. The debate over whether the curriculum sufficiently reflects the role of BAME Britons and the diverse nature of society has been raging for many years. The Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, published in 1999, asked that “consideration be given to amendment of the national curriculum aimed at valuing cultural diversity and preventing racism, in order better to reflect the needs of a diverse society”.
More than 20 years on, the Windrush “lessons learned” review suggested, “the Windrush scandal was in part able to happen because of the public’s and officials’ poor understanding of Britain’s colonial history, the history of inward and outward migration, and the history of black Britons”. De Cordova said: “The Black Lives Matter movement shone a light on racism in the UK and around the world. One way for the government to act would be to ensure that young people learn about Black British history, colonialism and understand Britain’s role in the transatlantic slave trade. Black history is British history.” Starmer called on Boris Johnson to do more to tackle racial inequalities at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions. He highlighted in particular the fact that black mothers are five times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts. He called the statistic “truly shocking” and urged the prime minister to launch an inquiry. Johnson replied: “This government has launched an urgent investigation into inequalities across the whole of society, and we will certainly address them in a thoroughgoing way, and I am amazed that he seems ignorant of that fact.” The prime minister was referring to the recent launch of his commission on race and ethnic disparities. Starmer’s spokesman later described that response as “disappointing and dismissive”, adding: “We do hope he will take this issue seriously.” Starmer has faced calls from some on the left of his party to take a more vocal stance on BAME issues since the death of George Floyd at the hands of US police gave fresh impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement. He was photographed with his deputy, Angela Rayner, taking a knee in solidarity with campaigners but made clear he didn’t agree with some of the actions taken in the campaign’s name – including toppling the statue of slaveowner Edward Colston in Bristol. He said at the time: “Stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.” But he insisted: “It shouldn’t have been done in that way, completely wrong to pull a statue down like that. That statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.” He also expressed regret for referring to Black Lives Matter as a “moment”, which critics had said meant he thought it was a passing phase instead of a sustained movement. Labour has been treading carefully on “culture war” issues, which Downing Street hopes will help Johnson to draw a dividing line with Starmer’s party and help the Tories hold on to “red wall” seats.

2020-09-30T19:21:03Z,politics,Politics,"Battered, bloodshot Boris is no longer the star of his own show | John Crace","Like most narcissists, Boris Johnson is unable to conceive of other people having an independent existence. Rather, they are mere satellites orbiting his ego. Mere objects whose only function is to do his bidding. And to be fair, it’s a world view that has served him well enough up to now as he’s cruised his way, with a flamboyant mixture of broken promises, outright lies and back-stabbing, to his life’s goal of becoming prime minister. Family, friends and colleagues that have been trampled upon along the way are just collateral damage. But there are growing signs that many people are increasingly deciding that enough is enough. Tory backbenchers have got fed up with being left out in the cold from the government’s coronavirus legislation and the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, made no attempt to disguise his anger on Wednesday at the way parliament had been sidelined. But the person who most gets under Boris’s skin is Keir Starmer. Because more than six months in, he has yet to get the better of the Labour leader. It must be driving Johnson mad. Prime minister’s questions was always meant to be the Boris Show. The half-hour in the week when the country laughed at his jokes and enjoyed his put-downs. Except it hasn’t worked out like that at all. Partly because the Labour leader is visibly better prepared, but mostly because he refuses to be cast in Johnson’s image. Keir is very much his own man: he keeps his questions short and direct and calls out Boris’s bluster for the bullshit it is. Today, Johnson was wrongfooted from the start when Starmer wondered why Luton was the only town to have gone into extra lockdown restrictions and come out of them. Boris’s reply that Luton had “pulled together” won’t have gone down well with the 25% of the country who live in the other 47 regions that are still living under extra strict measures, as it rather implied they must have been taking the piss. For the rest of the session Starmer walked rings round Johnson. He picked him up for not even knowing what restrictions he had put in place where. The best that Boris could come up with was that it was up to everyone in each area to find out the rules for themselves. Then Starmer tackled the prime minister on his definition of “viable businesses” and the level of support he was prepared to provide. “Putting an arm around the whole country” didn’t quite square with an angry email Starmer had received from a wedding planner in the chancellor’s Richmond constituency. By the end, Boris was merely an infant “mewling and puking in his nurse’s arms” yet to advance beyond Jaques’s first stage of man. Unable to come up with any clever – or even not so clever – replies, he merely yapped out his distress that anyone should dare to question him on anything and to accuse the Labour leader of sniping from the sides. Keir lazily opened an eye and observed that he had supported the restrictions throughout, it was just the latest detail and strategy he was after. None was forthcoming. Misery was engraved on Johnson’s face. Not so much at the humiliation, but by its nature. It had all been so casual. Starmer now barely has to get out of second gear to win PMQs at a canter. It felt very much as if the only reason the prime minister held a Downing Street coronavirus press briefing later in the afternoon was to remind himself as much as the rest of the country that he was in charge, because it turned out that he didn’t really have anything to say that we didn’t already know. The number of cases was rising significantly but at present he had no plans to impose any further measures in any area of the country. The press conference all felt a bit hit and hope. There was a word of encouragement for students that he would personally make sure they would all go home for Christmas, regardless of whether they wanted to or not. But there was no indication how we might get through the coming months or how to prevent Santa catching the virus. “We will fight and beat the disease,” Boris said, as if every other country had just given up on the idea. “We will not throw in the sponge.” Though, in truth, it rather looked as if Boris had done precisely that. He looked dreadful, his eyes puffy and bloodshot and his complexion pasty, as he repeated the measures he was taking that were clearly not really working that well. He sounded like a man waiting on a miracle.
There again, Johnson was flanked by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. In the early days of the No 10 briefings the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser proved themselves to be rather more amenable to the prime minister’s more optimistic interpretation of events, but both men have clearly got fed up with having their reputations burned. Like so many who get too close to Boris, they feel the need to separate for their own sanity. Repeatedly bitten, eventually shy. So Whitty and Vallance were there to provide constant downbeat reminders that the numbers were going in the wrong direction. There was no magic bullet. Yes, the outbreaks were more localised at present, but there were no guarantees that situation would not change. The nature of epidemics was that they could get out of control very quickly. And no, they didn’t regret having given a pessimistic forecast the week before. This time it would be the grown-ups who would be in control. They’d ensure Boris took the necessary measures even if they had to twist his arm."

2020-09-30T17:20:52Z,politics,Politics,MSPs appeal to courts to break deadlock over Alex Salmond inquiry,"MSPs investigating a botched Scottish government inquiry into misconduct claims against Alex Salmond have appealed to the courts to help break an impasse that threatens to derail their investigation. Their appeal to the court of session came as increasing tensions over the investigation boiled over in the Scottish parliament on Wednesday when Oliver Mundell, a Conservative MSP, accused Nicola Sturgeon of lying to parliament. In an exchange intended to highlight the Scottish government’s refusal to hand over key legal papers to Holyrood, Mundell claimed that the first minister lied to MSPs last year when she repeatedly pledged every document would be released to the inquiry. Mundell refused requests from Ken Macintosh, the presiding officer, to retract the word “liar” and apologise, and was ordered to leave the chamber.
The confrontation follows an escalating dispute involving: the specially convened committee, chaired by the former Scottish National party minister Linda Fabiani; the Scottish government; Salmond and his lawyers; and Sturgeon’s husband, Peter Murrell, the SNP’s chief executive. The committee is investigating the government’s handling of an internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct by two female officials against Salmond. The inquiry was found to be unlawful in January 2019 after Salmond took the government to court. Salmond was subsequently prosecuted on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, after Police Scotland launched an investigation triggered by the government’s botched inquiry. Salmond was acquitted of every one in March 2020. The former first minister accuses Sturgeon’s aides and senior but unnamed SNP officials of conspiring against him, in a dispute that threatens to cast a shadow over next May’s Holyrood election. The government and Salmond have refused to release some legal papers, citing confidentiality or court orders, and have been slower to release others that they pledged to provide. Murrell has been accused by the committee of offering minimal help to their investigation. His role in the alleged conspiracy against Salmond came into sharp focus this month after two WhatsApp messages were leaked to one of Salmond’s allies, the SNP MP Kenny MacAskill. The messages suggested Murrell was eager for the police investigating the claims against Salmond to come under pressure, and for Salmond to face investigations from different police forces. The committee had been planning to call Sturgeon, her chief of staff Liz Lloyd, Salmond and Murrell to give evidence on oath over the next few weeks. On Tuesday it said it had been forced to temporarily postpone those sessions because too few documents had been disclosed as promised. Fabiani wrote on Wednesday asking the court to release all the documents used in Salmond’s civil action, citing the claims by the government and Salmond they were happy for them to be disclosed. One MSP on the committee said the investigation was in danger of becoming a farce."
2020-09-30T16:53:52Z,politics,Politics,Britain offers EU fishing concession as part of Brexit sweetener,"Britain has offered a three-year transition period for European fishing fleets to allow them to prepare for the post-Brexit changes as part of an 11th-hour deal sweetener. The catches of EU fishermen would be “phased down” between 2021 and 2024 to offer time for European coastal communities to adapt to the changes. The lengthy transition period is contained in a new negotiating paper tabled before the current round of negotiations in Brussels between the teams led by the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. The idea of a phase-down period for Europe’s fishing fleets had been floated previously but details had not been provided until recent days, with the UK government now seemingly determined to break the Brexit logjam. “We have a long way to go but if the other problematic issues can be sorted, it doesn’t look like fisheries will stand in the way of an agreement,” said one senior EU diplomat. This week’s trade and security talks are due to end on Friday, at which point EU leaders gathering at a summit in Brussels will be debriefed on the latest developments by the European council president, Charles Michel. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is also expected to address the 27 heads of state and government on Dublin’s views on the state of play in light. “But the Brexit summit is on 15 October”, said one EU diplomat. “We don’t have a breakthrough yet.”
The offer of a transition period comes as the UK signed its first independent fishing deal for 40 years. The deal with Norway involves annual negotiations on share of catch, something the EU has rejected in Brexit trade talks. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said during a visit to Washington on Tuesday night that he believed there was a good chance of a trade deal. “The obstacles are not insurmountable,” he said. “We should be able to get this deal done.” However, UK fisheries leaders warned the government not to sell them out. Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “What we wouldn’t agree to is surrendering fishing rights in order to have a trade deal. “There is no expectation within the UK fishing industry that the UK will back down on fisheries. If anything, the commitments that have been made to the industry are stronger now than when the negotiations started. We’ve been given clear and unequivocal commitments.” The UK remains fixed on replacing the common fisheries policy with a system of “zonal attachment” that would offer a significant increase in catches for British fishing fleets. Currently, Britain’s economic zone is part of common EU waters. The UK receives a fixed share based on how much its fishermen caught during a reference period between 1973 and 1978. Under the new system proposed by the UK, the two sides would agree on what percentage of shared stocks are attached to each of their European economic zones each year. Catch quotas would be organised in line with that percentage.
A failure to agree annually on catches could lead to EU fleets being locked out of British waters. France is particularly concerned by the impact on its fishing communities and has taken a “maximalist” position that the status quo should be protected. One senior EU diplomat from a coastal member state said: “Is this a phasing-out of the withdrawal of British fishermen from the EU? Or of the access of British fishery products to the EU?” “It is perfect, clear. We are not for a gradual withdrawal of quotas. We are for permanent quotas.” “Phasing out is not an option if the UK wants access to the European market in general, which is based on an absence of tariffs and quotas.” While the policy would deliver the extra catches to British fishermen promised as a Brexit bonus, it is understood the government is also making new commitments on maintaining EU sustainability standards and cooperation on the collection of data. The offer was part of five new draft negotiating documents submitted by the government, including legal texts on fisheries, the “level playing field”, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, civil nuclear cooperation and social security coordination. A UK government spokesman said: “We aren’t commenting during the talks. We set out our position at the beginning of these negotiations and have always been clear that we will deliver the benefits that fishing communities have been asking for.” An EU official said: “We can confirm that we received additional documents from the UK. We are studying them.” According to Brussels sources, the UK’s new paper on state aid, still the most contentious of the outstanding issues, offers to lay out a series of “principles” on controlling domestic subsidies. The EU said the paper offered hope that the UK would build on provisions in the recently signed UK-Japan deal. The trade deal with Tokyo prevents either side from indefinitely guaranteeing the debts of struggling companies or providing open-ended bailouts without approved restructuring plans. But the paper failed to offer appropriate “governance” proposals that would allow Brussels to keep the UK to its pledges, EU sources said."
2020-09-30T14:50:01Z,politics,Politics,Westminster's links to Britain's slave trade revealed in art survey,"More than 200 works of art that adorn the plinths and corridors of Westminster have links to the transatlantic slave trade, a review conducted in light of the Black Lives Matter movement has discovered. Inquiries conducted on behalf of the Speaker’s advisory committee on works of art also found five satirical prints that reflect racist attitudes from the 19th century. The discoveries are part of a push by senior staff and parliamentarians, first disclosed by the Guardian, to re-evaluate how to present the UK’s involvement in exploitation while commissioning new artworks that portray black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and female MPs. In initial findings, 232 items in the parliamentary art collection were found to have links to the transatlantic slave trade. Of those, 189 pieces depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade and 40 depict 14 people who were abolitionists. Prime ministers whose families profited from slavery included Sir Robert Peel, the founder of the modern police force, and William Gladstone, who was similarly dependent on financial support from his family. His father, John Gladstone, was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies. Both Peel and Gladstone are portrayed dozens of times in paintings and statues in Westminster. Many “absentee” plantation owners and merchants involved in the slave trade rose to high office in the UK and fought against abolition. William Beckford, the owner of a 22,000-acre estate in Jamaica, was twice lord mayor of London and, in the mid- to late 1700s, was one of 50 MPs in parliament who represented the slave plantations. An oil painting of Beckford hangs in a members-only room in Westminster. William Alexander Mackinnon, the Conservative MP for Dunwich, features in an oil painting from the collection, of a debate from 1860. His family was given compensation following the abolition of slavery for profits lost on Mackinnon’s estate in Antigua. Satirical prints that reflect racist attitudes, according to the committee, include The Ghost of Christophe Ex-King of Hayti, appearing to the Un-Holy Alliance!!, by the artist John Fairburn. The 1822 print depicts the king of Haiti handing pistols to George IV and other European leaders. On the island of “Hayti” [Santo Domingo] kneels a black slave in a loin-cloth, raising both arms, who says: “Tank God de d—n Tyrant be dead and poor slave be at liberty.” The review follows an intense debate over statues portraying former colonial leaders following the removal of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol by Black Lives Matter activists. The highly decorative lobbies of the Palace of Westminster, which are open to the public, are dominated by 18th- and 19th-century depictions of powerful politicians, many of whom had close connections to the slave trade. Those links were exposed several years ago by University College London. Researchers showed that 469 MPs had profited from and been compensated for their links to the trade in human beings, and dozens of those feature in the artwork around parliament. While there has been an increase in the number of paintings and photographs portraying BAME politicians, including the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott and the late Labour MP Bernie Grant, many of these hang in Portcullis House, the modern building across the road from the Palace of Westminster. Of 300 statues on the parliamentary estate, only two are of black, Asian and minority ethnic people: a bust of Learie Constantine, the first black peer and a West Indies cricketer, which is on loan from another collection, and a recently commissioned bust of the 18th-century writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, who was enslaved in his early life. Hywel Williams, the Plaid Cymru chair of the committee, which is made up of 11 MPs, said they were driven by a desire for a better understanding of the contents of the parliamentary art collection when it came to people with links to slavery. “We will undertake a full review of the collection. We will look for ways to explain the lives of the people depicted in our artworks – including controversial aspects – honestly and more fully. “The interpretation of our artworks is reviewed constantly, but this is the first time we are systematically reviewing the entire collection looking at issues around slavery and representation. We will look at ways to better explain and contextualise works in the collection through our website and in the material we give to visitors to parliament. And we will look for ways to better shine a light on the people in parliament who worked hard to abolish slavery,” he said. Melissa Hamnett, the curator and head of heritage collections in parliament, said in June that parliament was exploring new ways of telling stories to the public, including an expansion of the use of audio, mobile technology and QR codes. She said visitors might be able to use smartphones to take them on a trail that would explain former MPs’ links to Britain’s exploitative past. “We are constrained by how much additional context we can display alongside the art works because of the space and because this is a working building,” she added."
2020-09-30T12:43:42Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of abandoning people with 'viable' jobs,"Keir Starmer has accused the government of abandoning people with “viable” jobs by refusing proper support during continued lockdown restrictions, as the response to coronavirus again dominated prime minister’s questions. The Labour leader read out a letter from the owner of a wedding events business based in the Yorkshire constituency of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, saying the government had “closed their ears” to the plight of the industry. “But for these extraordinary restrictions, these are viable jobs,” Starmer said, accusing Boris Johnson of being “tin-eared” about the plight of those set to lose their jobs as the furlough scheme winds down.
“These businesses are doing the right thing. Why has the government decided that these jobs aren’t worth saving?” In response, Johnson said the country had to work together and comply with regulations to restrict the spread of Covid-19, which would in turn help businesses reopen. He said: “We’re putting our arms around the whole of the UK economy. We will do everything we can to save every job.” Elsewhere in a session devoted entirely to coronavirus, bar one Starmer question on racial disparities over health, the Labour leader mocked Johnson for his inability, while answering media questions on Tuesday, to correctly name local lockdowns in force in the north-east of England. “Having sat opposite the prime minister at PMQs every week, that didn’t come as a surprise to me,” Starmer said, also citing comments to the Guardian by David Greenhalgh, the Conservative leader of Bolton council, who said unfair and over-complex rules were causing resentment. Following the pattern of recent PMQs, Johnson opted to largely not engage with the substance of such questions, instead accusing Starmer of changing his mind over backing the rules and “sniping from the sidelines”. Starmer rejected this: “The idea that anybody who asks the prime minister a question, at prime minister’s questions, is undermining the government effort, is wearing a bit thin. We have openly supported the restrictions, but it’s perfectly reasonable to ask why they are not working.” In another section of the exchanges, Johnson indicated that the key to local lockdowns succeeding was people in the relevant area complying with the rules. After Starmer asked why, with dozens of areas in England given stricter restrictions, only Luton had subsequently had them eased, Johnson replied: “The reason, I think, for the success of Luton, is that local people pulled together to depress the virus, to follow the guidance. And that is the way forward for the entire country.”"
2020-09-30T08:24:54Z,politics,Politics,UK carmakers face higher tariffs as EU rejects component plea,"British car manufacturers could face higher export tariffs with or without a Brexit deal after the EU rejected an argument that components from Japan used on UK assembly lines should be considered British. The car industry has maintained that parts for cars, vans and trucks that have been sourced in non-EU countries should be deemed British under the rules of origin system that will apply to all exports from 1 January when the transition period is over. But according to a letter by the UK Brexit negotiator, David Frost, this idea, known as “cumulation” has been formally rejected in trade talks. “The commission has made clear that it will not agree third-country cumulation in any circumstances, which we regret, but obviously cannot insist upon. “I am sorry to say that so far they [EU negotiators] have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us,” Lord Frost said in a letter seen by the BBC. Rules of origin go to the heart of the question as to whether the British car industry is manufacturing or assembly. Typically, to qualify as British after Brexit, products must have about 60% local parts or ingredients by value. Even if a deal is struck between the EU and the UK allowing zero tariffs on exports from Britain, vehicles that do not have enough British components will typically attract a tariff of about 10%, making them less competitive than EU-sourced cars and lorries. The British industry, which includes Jaguar Landrover, Ford, Vauxhall and Nissan, relies heavily on an EU supply chain but also on parts sourced in Japan and Turkey. Frost has reportedly told the industry that the EU has also rejected the UK’s request for electric cars, batteries and bicycles to be treated leniently under the rules of origin system if the majority of components come from elsewhere. The letter says: “I am sorry to say that so far they [EU negotiators] have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us.” While the letter is a blow to the British car industry, which two weeks ago warned of “catastrophic” £100bn losses if a trade deal is not struck, it has been alert to the issues since the referendum in 2016. The industry was one of the most vocal campaigners for a soft Brexit aligning Britain to EU rules and had some success with Theresa May’s version of the withdrawal agreement. Two years ago it disclosed that the average content of cars built in the UK that was British was about 44%, which would automatically mean it would fall foul of the rules of origin system. Over the past two years, the auto industry has consistently warned of the deep cost of no deal on the sector, which employs 14.6 million people across the EU and UK directly and indirectly in factories, component supplies, engineering, design and marketing and sales. They hope this latest warning from the combined forces of leaders in the EU and the UK will help both sides see past their political differences and strike a trade deal."
2020-09-30T07:53:35Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: internal market bill passed by Commons despite Tory concerns,"A controversial government Brexit bill that breaches international law has safely passed its final House of Commons hurdle, despite continued serious doubts among a number of Conservative MPs about the plan. The internal market bill, which primarily sets out technical post-Brexit details involving the devolved nations, also gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite elements of the withdrawal agreement with the EU. It passed its third reading on Tuesday night by 340 votes to 256 and will now go to the House of Lords. The provisions in the bill have prompted significant disquiet, particularly after the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons earlier this month that they did break international law “in a very specific and limited way”. The subsequent furore saw two Tory MPs vote against the bill at its initial Commons vote earlier this month, with 30 more abstaining, although some of these did not vote because they were absent. No Conservative MPs voted against the bill on Tuesday night, though more than 20 did not vote, with the majority assumed to be abstentions, Theresa May among them. The former prime minister was in Westminster on Tuesday, and as a vocal opponent of the bill seemed likely to be a deliberate abstention. Other Tory MPs who did not vote include the former attorneys general Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright. Boris Johnson argued the law-breaking measures were needed to counteract the possibility of the EU responding to a lack of a permanent trade deal in December by effectively blocking goods from entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, an idea critics have said is highly unlikely. The rebellion coalesced around an amendment led by the Conservative backbencher Bob Neill, which decreed that the government could only use the powers to change the Brexit departure deal with prior approval of MPs. Amid continued Tory unrest that saw the resignation of Lord Keen, the UK government’s law officer for Scotland, the government agreed an amendment broadly similar to Neill’s plan. This did not satisfy every malcontent, with May using a Commons speech last week to condemn the idea of ditching elements of the withdrawal agreement, which has the status of a treaty and is thus protected under international law, as “reckless” and “irresponsible”. Speaking for Labour on Tuesday, the shadow business minister Lucy Powell said the government was being reckless and “using Northern Ireland as a pawn in a wider negotiating strategy”. She added: “The government are playing a dangerous game, and it’s the people and businesses of Northern Ireland who risk paying the price.” Speaking before the vote, Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister who abstained in the last vote, said he and some colleagues would support the bill out of necessity. “Many people will be far from content, but they recognise the politics of where we sit,” he said. “We’re just running out of time. If a number of planets were to align, we would find ourselves in a worse place where the absence of this legislation could cause more problems on top of no deal. “No deal would be damaging on so many fronts, but for us not to have the basis for an internal market in place, which 80% or 90% of this bill focuses on – you’ve got to have it in place by 1 January.” The bill will now move to the Lords, where Johnson faces potentially stiffer opposition, not least from Michael Howard, the former Tory leader who has also condemned the law-breaking plan. However, the timetable for the Lords has yet to be set out, prompting more speculation that the contentious elements might be aimed more as a negotiating stick for the EU rather than an urgent legal necessity. Lord Neuberger, former president of the supreme court, has condemned the bill as a “flagrant breach” of the UK’s international law obligations that would “muzzle” British courts. Speaking at an online seminar organised by the International Bar Association on Tuesday evening, Neuberger said there would be moral and practical ramifications. He asked how the government, which is passing some “pretty draconian” laws through Covid-19 health regulations, could expect people to obey them if it is “seen to be breaking its obligations on the international law stage”. At the same meeting, Prof Philippe Sands QC warned that the government’s threat to break international law would “undermine the UK’s negotiating position” in any future treaties with other countries and destroy our reputation for being trustworthy. Former MP Dominic Grieve QC, previously a Conservative attorney general, said the bill was unprecedented, drives a “coach and horses” through the UK’s international obligations and would do us “massive reputational damage”."
2020-09-29T23:15:35Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel looked at idea of sending asylum seekers to South Atlantic,"A Whitehall brainstorming session prompted by Priti Patel led to the idea being floated of sending asylum seekers to a volcanic island in the South Atlantic, the Guardian understands. The Financial Times reported that the home secretary had asked officials to look into the idea of processing asylum seekers on Ascension Island, an isolated volcanic British territory, and on St Helena, which is part of the same island group but 800 miles away. However, according to Home Office sources, the proposal only arose after Patel sought advice on how other countries deal with asylum applications. Australia, for example, keeps them on overseas islands while it processes claims. The source said Patel asked the Foreign Office for ideas, and among those raised were “implausible ones” such as the use of Ascension or St Helena. Patel is expected to address the issue of Channel crossings by migrants in a speech to the Conservative party conference on Sunday, and has repeatedly vowed to stop those arriving in the country by boat. She has called on the Royal Navy to help tackle the growing number of small boats and appointed a former Royal Marine, Dan O’Mahoney, to the role of “clandestine Channel threat commander”. In August she said the number of crossings was “appalling and unacceptably high”, adding: “I am working to make this route unviable.” The UK is dealing with record levels of arrivals across the Channel, and – according to PA Media analysis – nearly 7,000 people have landed in the UK by small boats this year. New plans drawn up by the Home Office show that people could be housed in a detention centre criticised for inhumane conditions, and Conservative MPs in Kent have raised concerns about the housing of migrants in nearby hotels and army barracks. Ascension Island, which has a population of less than 1,000, is home to a Royal Air Force station and was used extensively as a staging point by the British military during the Falklands conflict in 1982. St Helena is also one of the most isolated islands in the world, lying 1,210 miles off the west coast of Africa. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. A Home Office source said: “The UK has a long and proud history of offering refuge to those who need protection. Tens of thousands of people have rebuilt their lives in the UK and we will continue to provide safe and legal routes in the future. “As ministers have said, we are developing plans to reform policies and laws around illegal migration and asylum to ensure we are able to provide protection to those who need it, while preventing abuse of the system and the criminality associated with it.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: “This ludicrous idea is inhumane, completely impractical and wildly expensive. So it seems entirely plausible this Tory government came up with it.”"
2020-09-29T20:55:18Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: controversial internal market bill passes final Commons hurdle â€” as it happened,"Thatâ€™s it for tonight, after another tumultuous evening in the House of Commons. To recap, MPs voted 340 to 256, majority 84, in favour of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill at its third reading, despite warnings that the legislation threatens the Union and the countryâ€™s global reputation. Ministers have defended powers contained in the bill, which gives them the opportunity to override the Brexit divorce deal. The Bill will undergo further scrutiny in the Lords at a later date. The government was forced to compromise earlier in the billâ€™s passage in the face of a Tory backbench rebellion, which resulted in changes to give MPs a vote before ministers can use the powers which would breach the Withdrawal Agreement brokered with Brussels last year. Tonight, however, no Conservative MPs rebelled to oppose the bill, according to the division list. Those who did not record a vote included former prime minister Theresa May who voiced concerns about the bill. Read our full story here:"
2020-09-29T18:57:59Z,politics,Politics,"Whitehall 'infantilised' by reliance on consultants, minister claims","Whitehall has been “infantilised” by an “unacceptable” reliance on expensive management consultants, a government minister has claimed in a leaked letter. Lord Agnew, the Cabinet Office and Treasury minister, wrote to senior civil servants two weeks ago demanding they rein in spiralling costs paid to private firms and stop “depriving our brightest [public servants] of opportunities to work on some of the most challenging, fulfilling and crunchy issues”. A close ally of the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and a supporter of Brexit, Agnew also admits that spending on consultants has risen in part because the UK is leaving the EU.
Official data shows that, after the 2016 Brexit vote, government spending on consultancy firms increased rapidly to approximately £1bn, and to more than £1.5bn in 2017-18. The letter has emerged amid concerns over the cost of hiring experts from the private sector to assist civil servants dealing with the challenges of coronavirus and Brexit. At the same time, Gove and Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, are seeking to push through changes in the civil service after recruiting allies to key roles in the Cabinet Office. Agnew’s letter cites a failure to develop the right skills among civil servants. “Four years after voting to leave the European Union it is unacceptable that the civil service still has not developed the capability to deliver this through our own civil servants,” he wrote.
“We are too reliant on consultants. Aside from providing poor value for money, this infantilises the civil service by depriving our brightest people of opportunities to work on some of the most challenging, fulfilling and crunchy issues. “For example, we seem to be ineffectual at harnessing our fast-streamers [new civil servants] to do work that is then outsourced to consultants using similar people at a vastly inflated cost. This is unacceptable.” Saying he was “concerned about whether departments are using consultancy services in the most cost-effective, efficient and appropriate manner,” Agnew added that the government would review the current controls and limits on spending, “to provide ministers with confidence that departments are bearing down on unnecessary spend and instead look to build internal capability”. Management consultants are typically brought in where it is thought specialist advice or expertise is needed, but there have been longstanding concerns over the extent of their use in the public sector.
Many senior civil servants or ministers work for consultancy firms at some stage in their career, so there are often strong personal links or relationships between staff on both sides. A National Audit Office (NAO) report in 2016 suggested consultants typically cost government departments twice as much as an equivalent permanent staff member. Cabinet Office data reported by the NAO last year showed a significant drop in spending on consultants after the introduction of new controls in 2010, from almost £2bn in 2009-10 to £400m-£700m in each of the following six years. However, it rose after the Brexit vote and exceeded £1.5bn in 2017-18. Data for subsequent years has yet to be published. The NAO report said six firms had been commissioned for the bulk of the Brexit work: Deloitte, PA Consulting, PricewaterhouseCoopers, EY, Bain & Company, and Boston Consulting Group. Analysis by the data firm Tussell in 2019 found the Cabinet Office, Department for International Trade and the Home Office were the biggest spenders on Brexit-related work. In his letter, sent on 15 September to departmental finance directors and chief operating officers, Agnew also highlighted major problems with the government’s data on consultancy spending as a result of disparities in the figures on various HR and finance systems. He wrote: “In spite of recent efforts to improve and align definitions, the data issues have not been resolved.” Responding to Agnew’s letter, the head of the FDA union for senior civil servants said there was little point scolding Whitehall for carrying out the wishes of previous governments during the unprecedented challenges of Brexit and coronavirus. Dave Penman said his members had witnessed a four-year period of dysfunctional political leadership under three prime ministers, each with different agendas. “Consultant spending is one of many tools that will have been used to respond to the demands from ministers and can only be looked at in the context of the environment faced at that time,” he said. “Ministers need to understand the challenges that have been placed on the civil service if they seriously want to make rational reform, rather than lecturing departments for taking the measures that were necessary to deliver a previous government’s priorities.” Agnew, who was appointed as a minister working across the Cabinet Office and Treasury in February after holding roles in the education and justice departments, is one of a number of Gove allies brought in to propel change and cut costs. Lord Maude, who was in charge of the Cabinet Office under David Cameron’s premiership, is reviewing the department’s performance and relationship with the rest of Whitehall. Maude’s adviser Lady Finn, Gove’s former adviser Henry de Zoete and the former Labour MP and Brexiter Gisela Stuart became non-executive board members in May. Tamzen Isacsson, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association, said: “Far from providing poor value for money, tens of thousands of clients across the UK use the UK’s consultancy sector to deliver technology capabilities, greater efficiency, cost reduction and high quality results in record time.” A UK government spokesperson said: “Since 2010, the government has taken considerable steps to reduce unnecessary spending and protect taxpayers’ money. Ministers are concerned that government is too reliant on consultants and have written to departments to make clear that services should only be procured when external expertise is essential and represents value for money. We want to harness the wide range of skills within the civil service.” • This article was amended on 20 October 2020 to include a response from the Management Consultancies Association."
2020-09-29T18:36:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's bluster comes unstuck over lockdown rules,"It was a simple question about lockdown rules that required a clear and a straightforward answer. But one minister didn’t have one – and the prime minister thought he did, when he didn’t. This is how it all played out.
The minister who didn’t know … On Tuesday morning, the skills minister, Gillian Keegan, was unable to answer the question of whether households in north-east England would be able to meet in a pub or restaurant garden under tightened restrictions coming into force on Wednesday. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I’m sorry I can’t clarify that. I don’t know the answer to that question but I’m sure they can find out the answer to that question. The prime minister who got it wrong … Boris Johnson added to the confusion a few hours later by fumbling an explanation of the rules when taking questions from the media after a speech in Exeter. When asked whether people in the north-east would be able to meet other households outside in a pub garden, Johnson garbled his response: Outside the areas such as the north-east where extra measures have been brought in, it’s six inside, six outside. In the north-east and other areas where extra tight measures have been brought in you should follow the advice of local authorities; but as I understand it, it’s six in a home or six in hospitality but, as I understand it, not six outside. … the apology that followed … An hour later, and in an unusually apologetic tone for the prime minister, he tweeted: Apologies, I misspoke today. In the North East, new rules mean you cannot meet people from different households in social settings indoors, including in pubs, restaurants and your home. You should also avoid socialising with other households outside. … and the backlash … But the damage was already done, especially for those directly affected by the rules. Nick Forbes, Labour leader of Newcastle city council, said: You can’t just bluster your way through situations like this – making it up as you go has massive consequences, confuses people and undermines the very public health goals both local and central government are trying to achieve."
2020-09-29T17:19:52Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Brussels rebuffs new UK proposals on state subsidies,"Boris Johnson has been rebuffed by Brussels after making an eleventh hour attempt to break the Brexit logjam with new proposals on limiting state subsidies to ailing British companies. As the latest week of negotiations began, EU sources welcomed the UK’s effort to make a compromise with a submission of a new round of “negotiating papers”, but warned that a large gap remained between the two sides. According to Brussels sources, the UK’s paper on state aid, the most contentious of the outstanding issues, offered to lay out a series of “principles” on controlling domestic subsidies. The EU said the paper offered hope that the UK would build on provisions in the recently signed UK-Japan deal. The trade deal with Tokyo prevents either side from indefinitely guaranteeing the debts of struggling companies or providing open-ended bailouts without approved restructuring plans.
But the paper failed to offer appropriate “governance” proposals that would allow Brussels to keep the UK to its pledges, EU sources said. The EU wanted to ensure that any commitments were seen through and that in the event of a breach, parts of the trade deal could be immediately suspended. EU diplomats also said any agreement on such a method of regulating state aid would need to be taken “at the highest level”, as it would represent a significant divergence from Brussels’ proposal. The EU has pushed for the UK to accept the bloc’s state aid rules, which do not allow unfair subsidies to be granted. The UK’s position would instead offer recourse in the event of trade being distorted. “The UK-Japan deal is obviously now the basis but it isn’t yet enough and we need to have bite,” said one diplomatic source. A second source added that the proposal was as yet “more of the same” but that it was hoped that the week’s negotiation would flesh it out. “That is what matters,” the source said. The UK has submitted five new draft negotiating documents containing legal texts on fisheries, the “level playing field”, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, civil nuclear cooperation and social security coordination. An EU official said: “We can confirm that we received additional documents from the UK. We are studying them.”
EU officials have poured cold water on suggestions that Brexit talks are on the brink of a breakthrough that could lead to intensified “tunnel” negotiations in the coming weeks. As British and EU negotiators met on Tuesday to resume discussions on a trade and security deal, Brussels sources cautioned against the idea the two sides were about to enter the tunnel – a period of intensified talks when negotiators meet round the clock under a media blackout. Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, thinks it is too soon to judge if the UK and EU are going to reach an agreement that would merit intensified “tunnel” talks, also known as the “submarine” in Brussels argot. “We only go into the tunnel if there is going to be light at the end of it,” an EU official said. “People are getting carried away with the positive mood music before we even sit down to negotiate.” This week is the last scheduled round of Brexit talks, which are due to conclude on Friday with a meeting between Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost. Most time will be dedicated to three big stumbling blocks: fair competition rules for the UK to have zero-tariff access to the EU market, fishing rights, and the dispute settlement system that underpins the entire agreement. France has been put under pressure by some member states to compromise on the “maximalist” position that the status quo on fishing quotas must continue after Brexit. An EU diplomat said Barnier was ready to start working on a legal text, but only if he was convinced Johnson was willing to move on those points. “Everything depends on the UK approach and their willingness to signal an opening,” the source said. A summit of EU leaders is being staged in Brussels on Thursday and Friday but the European council president, Charles Michel, said in an invitation letter to the 27 heads of state and government that Brexit would only be lightly touched upon. “We will provide a brief update on negotiations with the United Kingdom,” Michel wrote."
2020-09-29T17:18:38Z,politics,Politics,Boris's speech was designed as a quick win. Then he opened his mouth | John Crace,"It’s been a tricky few months for Boris Johnson. Just about every time he has been allowed out in public – be it for prime minister’s questions, his appearance before the liaison committee or his TV address to the nation – he has somehow managed to come off looking out of touch or second best. I need a quick win, he told his advisers. A speech that will make me look good and no one can pick holes in. Dominic Cummings thought for a while and scratched his head. Now he came to think of it, there was almost nothing that wasn’t going badly. Brexit and the coronavirus were obvious taboo subjects, which didn’t really leave much else. I suppose, Dom said eventually, that you could give the classic speech about valuing vocational training as much as a university education. It’s the one that every prime minister trots out at some point during their time in office, so you might as well get it over and done with. After all it cost nothing, as he would only be reallocating money that had already been earmarked for training purposes. So having checked that Exeter College wasn’t actually in lockdown, Boris found himself down in Devon talking about how useless previous governments had been in providing training for school leavers without A-levels and for those over the age of 23 looking to retrain. He was going to get a hell of a shock on the train home when someone tells him that the Conservatives have been in power for the last 10 years. Johnson waffled on about the post-Covid economy – his eyes glistening with euphoric recall as he remembered his own spreadsheet one-to-one boot camp – and how he was going to give everyone a lifetime skills guarantee. Other countries had sneakily taken advantage of the fact we had never really bothered with skills training – a typical Johnny Foreigner dirty trick – and it was time for us to close the gap on them. Assuming we eventually got round to doing something about it. Which we probably wouldn’t. This was just an off-the-peg speech for Boris’s Big Adventure. No one was expected to take it seriously. Things began to nosedive rather, when Boris took some questions from the media. He was only promising more money to level up the skills agenda in seven months time and many sectors, including his own government, could benefit from a great deal of basic skills courses long before that. Come April, there might not be much of a country left to level up. And that was the last we heard about the skills agenda because everyone else was understandably far more interested in the latest lockdown guidance. Earlier that morning, skills minister Gillian Keegan had been unable to clarify the rules on outside gatherings in the north-east: could he please give a definitive answer? A look of panic crossed Johnson’s face. Just who was this Gillian Keegan and what on earth had she said? “Um,’” he began waffling. There was a “rule of six” and some people could meet outdoors but not indoors, other people could meet indoors and not outdoors and some people could meet neither indoors nor outdoors. He hoped that cleared things up. When asked about his own health, he declared himself to be “as fit as a butcher’s dog”. A comparison that reduced many butchers’ dogs to tears. A short while later in the Commons, Gavin Williamson also appeared to be on the verge of tears as he belatedly gave a statement on students in lockdown on their return to university. No one could possibly have predicted that thousands of students going back to university in September might affect the transmission rate of the virus, he sobbed. Just like no one could have predicted the A-Level and GCSE fiasco. All along his department had done everything that could have been expected of one that was run by someone as useless as him and, no, he wasn’t the slightest bit miffed that it hadn’t been him that had got to make the vocational training speech down in Exeter. Private Pike was sorry that so many students’ first experience of university was to be banged up in a hall of residence with no one they knew, having forked out £9k for a course that was now being conducted online, but there couldn’t be one rule for students and another for the rest of the population. Which was odd because most of us were fairly sure there were separate rules for Cummings and Robert Jenrick. Still, he had solved the Christmas problem. If students were to self-isolate for two weeks before they were due to go home, then they should be able to spend Xmas with their families. This rather confused the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, and many other opposition MPs. What if not everyone self-isolated and there was a case of Covid-19 in the halls in the two weeks before everyone went home? Would every student be then given a special exemption to self-isolate at home? And would their families then have to self-isolate? And what if there was a general lockdown in the university town or city anyway? Various Tory MPs tried to cheer Gav up by saying that a little bit of self-isolation and lockdown would be the making of most students who had been mollycoddled far too long. But Williamson was beyond help and could only shrug. Even when he’s trying to sound like he knows what he’s doing, he oozes pathos. On days like this, he looks like a walking resignation letter."
2020-09-29T15:16:29Z,politics,Politics,A game of two halves: MPs heal in-house football team dispute,"While the nation battles the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, some parliamentarians have been preoccupied with a crisis of their own – who runs the MPs’ football team. And, though it might be known as the beautiful game, things have turned ugly. A row has been brewing for months, with long-serving senior Labour MPs taking the drastic action of calling on their colleagues to boycott involvement in running the group in protest at the behaviour of its new Tory chair. However, a deal has now been brokered for a Tory-Labour power-sharing agreement so harmony can be restored to the dressing room. It comes after a hotly contested claim emerged that the Conservative MP Karl McCartney effectively mounted a takeover of the all-party parliamentary football club earlier this year when he became chair with the backing of Tory colleagues. In an attempt to kick McCartney into touch, the Labour MPs Clive Betts (a former chair of the group), Ian Murray and Justin Madders emailed Labour colleagues on Monday saying: “Karl McCartney proposed himself chair and brought a number of Conservative colleagues to support him without any discussion with Labour colleagues.” They added: “We have been trying to seek compromise with Karl to continue to ensure the collegiate and consensual way we have always operated but he has refused. Ian Murray and Clive Betts have had a Zoom conversation with Karl today and he is unwilling to run the group in the all-party cooperative spirit it has always operated. We would ask that no Labour members agree to be an officer until joint agreement is reached.” However, after the row emerged on Tuesday – first reported by Politico London Playbook – a deal was reached to resolve the disagreement, with Madders due to be appointed co-chair of the group. “In the end, it was a hard-fought 90 minutes but football has been the winner,” Madders joked to the Guardian. After reaching the compromise, Madders and McCartney released a joint statement on Tuesday saying: “We have an OGM later today when it is expected that Justin Madders will be joining the group as co-chairman (with Karl McCartney) and his election will provide cross-party management of the group. “It is expected at the same time that a number of other Labour members will be joining as vice-chairmen, as well as other members of both Houses. The UKPFC APPG has always been open to all members, and is inclusive, and can now move forward and concentrate on what it was meant to do: playing more football, as well as raising the profile of the many good causes and charities the team support.” McCartney denied claims of a takeover, telling the Guardian: “The minutes of the 2020 AGM show I did not propose myself to be chairman at all; in fact I was nominated and seconded by a number of parliamentary colleagues who were present at the meeting in person, and Clive Betts (who was in the chair in person in the room) did not put himself forward, nor was he proposed by anyone present. “I have organised the group, and continued to act both before and since the AGM, in a professional and grown-up manner that is transparent and inclusive to parliamentarians, players and outside interested parties such as the FA and EPL, and will continue to do so.” Detailing claims of the initial fallout, the ex-chair Betts, who has been involved with the side for nearly three decades, said: “It just got very silly. He [McCartney] walked into the AGM way back in February and just said: ‘I want to be chair.’ He brought a number of Conservative colleagues with him and he said: ‘These are all vice-chairs,’ and that was sort of it. “The secret is in the name – all-party groups – and they only work on an all-party basis because you’ve got to have officers from certainly the government and the main opposition party to enable it to function.”"
2020-09-29T14:40:44Z,politics,Politics,Williamson sets out plan to allow students in England home for Christmas,"Some students in England would need to self-isolate and their classes be shifted online in order to return home for Christmas, the education secretary has announced. In a statement to the Commons on students’ return to universities, which has so far resulted in Covid-19 outbreaks at more than 50 UK campuses, Gavin Williamson said his department would be issuing guidance on allowing students to return home over the Christmas break. “We are going to work with universities to make sure that all students are supported to return home safely and spend Christmas with their loved ones, if they choose to do so,” he said. “Where there are specific circumstances that warrant it, there may be a requirement for some students to self-isolate at the end of term. And we will be working with the sector to ensure this will be possible, including ending in-person learning early, if that is deemed to be necessary.” Asked by Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, to clarify, Williamson said: “All youngsters who want to be able return home will be able to do so, but what we will look at is … where there are specific cases.” He said that in “specific local circumstances we would look at shifting to online learning, solely in order to be able to ensure that all students are able to return and have the benefit of being able to be with their families for Christmas. But we envisage that to be a very small number of universities.”
Williamson also announced he would be looking to dock vice-chancellors’ bonuses because of what he called the “crisis”. Laura Trott, the Conservative MP for Sevenoaks, asked Williamson to consider stopping university leaders receiving bonuses this year unless fees were lowered for students having to take online courses. He replied that the question was “incredibly important”, and said “excessive vice-chancellor pay” remained a problem and he would ask the higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students, to intervene. “I’ll be asking for the Office for Students to look at this and give very strong and clear steers on this matter, to ensure that there aren’t bonuses going out as a result of this crisis,” he said. Williamson rejected claims by Labour MPs that the government had failed to prepare for the return of about a million students to campuses in England, and instead praised universities for their preparations. He said it was “inevitable” that students would contract coronavirus, and that his department had been working with the Department of Health to enable “sufficient and appropriate” provision of testing. Labour’s Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said students were anxious and angry at the lack of support and testing, and had been “let down by the government, just as it let down many of these same students with its handling of exam results”. Green asked what support the government was providing to students who lack digital access for online classes, and Williamson replied that “she had missed the announcement of the fact that we had made £100m available for universities to be able to use to ensure youngsters have digital access”. Asked to explain Williamson’s claim, the DfE pointed to a scheme that funded schools and local authorities in providing digital access and devices for disadvantaged school pupils and children in care. Fifty universities in the UK have reported confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection among students and staff within the past week, including 55 cases at the University of Edinburgh and 22 cases at Swansea. Sheffield University became the first in the country to publish daily Covid-19 statistics, and reported 36 cases among students and three among staff by Tuesday. In most cases the universities reported cases in single figures. Several universities, including UCL, Oxford and Cambridge, have yet to commence teaching. The Office for Students said it could intervene over vice-chancellors’ bonuses if they were “completely out of kilter”, using its powers related to governance and management. “The OfS does not set senior pay at universities, but universities – and individual vice-chancellors – need to be able to justify the pay and bonuses they receive. This is particularly true during the pandemic, where students’ experience of university may be very different to what they expected,” a spokesperson said."
2020-09-29T13:52:12Z,politics,Politics,Is Boris Johnson really 'fit as a butcher's dog'?,"He faces angry Conservative backbenchers, a resurgent opposition and struggled on Tuesday to clarify his own government’s lockdown rules, yet Boris Johnson’s fortunes on another front would seem to be still hanging in the balance: the battle of the bulge. On the basis of figures cited by the prime minister during a question and answer session after a speech in Exeter, he had a BMI (body mass index) of 34.9 earlier this year when he was treated in hospital for Covid-19. Had he used the NHS BMI calculator to arrive at that figure, it would have told him that he should start by losing 5.4kg (12lbs) by cutting his calorie intake to a recommended level of 2,178-2,800 kcal. Despite struggling with other questions at the end of his speech on adult learning, Johnson was in bullish mood when asked on Tuesday what advice he would give to others about recovering from Covid-19 and if he could reassure some of his worried MPs that he had fully recovered. “I am fitter than a butcher’s dog thanks basically to losing weight,” replied the prime minister, after saying that the phenomenon of “long Covid” clearly existed. “I hesitate to give anybody any advice but losing weight is a very good thing to do when you reach 17st 6lbs (110.7kg), as I did at the height of about 5ft 10in (177.8cm). It’s probably a good idea to lose weight and so that’s what I’ve done. I feel much, much better.” The figure of 34.9 was arrived at on the basis of providing details such as Johnson’s gender, ethnic group and age at the time when he fell ill with coronavirus (55). Launching a drive in July by the government to reduce obesity levels in the UK, Johnson said he “too fat” when he was admitted to a London intensive care unit. A regime that involved starting the day by going for a run with Dilyn, the dog he keeps with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, had helped him to lose “at least a stone”. But Johnson would still be classed by the NHS calculator as overweight even if he had lost a further two stone and was active for between 60 and 150 minutes a week. A butcher’s dog perhaps, but one with a BMI of 28.9 and in need of continued walkies."
2020-09-29T05:01:08Z,politics,Politics,"Covid costs could wipe out Sunak's spending plans, says IFS","A prolonged battle against Covid-19 would swallow up a large chunk of the government’s planned increase in public spending and force the chancellor into an unenviable choice between fresh austerity, higher taxes or more borrowing, a leading thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that even if only a quarter of the extra £70bn allocated by Rishi Sunak to fight the pandemic had to be repeated in future years, the Treasury would either have to find more money than set aside in this year’s budget or announce cuts. The thinktank said tackling the virus, the lack of public appetite for another period of austerity and longer-term demographic pressures pointed to government spending as a share of overall economic output rising from its current level of 40% of GDP to possibly 45% by the middle of the 2020s. Sunak has scrapped plans for an autumn budget due to the short-term problems facing the economy but has said he plans to go ahead with a multi-year spending review before the end of the year. The chancellor may well eventually decide to announce plans solely for 2021-22 given the uncertainty, a course of action recommended by the IFS. The Treasury said: “The spending review will proceed this autumn, as planned. The chancellor has already confirmed that departmental spending will increase above inflation – both for day-to-day spending and longer-term investment.” Ben Zaranko, an IFS research economist said: “The immense economic uncertainty associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, and the looming end of the Brexit transition period, make this an extraordinarily difficult time for the chancellor to be formulating public spending plans. “Covid-19 has blown previous spending plans out of the water, with more than £70bn allocated to departments this year for day-to-day spending as part of the response to the virus. If some of these spending programmes – such as the running costs of NHS test and trace – are to be unfortunate facts of life for years to come, they could swallow up huge amounts of money, and leave some public services facing another round of budget cuts for their core services. “Avoiding that scenario would require the chancellor to find billions of extra funding, paid for at some point through higher taxes.”
The IFS said the 2019 spending review and the 2020 budget had announced increases that would have reversed two-thirds of the deep cuts in per-person spending by 2023-24. But it added the Covid-19 crisis had rendered these plans obsolete, with the health budget alone topped up by £35bn – a 25% increase. The thinktank said if 25% of the spending triggered by Covid-19 needed to be permanent, the result would be to eat up almost half the planned £40bn increase in departments’ non-Covid budgets between 2020−21 and 2023−24. Given the government’s commitments on the NHS, schools, the police and its “levelling up” agenda, that would almost certainly require another bout of austerity for some public services. “To meet those costs while keeping non-Covid spending growing at the rate planned in March would require the chancellor to find an additional £20bn by 2023−24, relative to his pre-pandemic plans,” Zaranko said.
Sunak has insisted that there will be no return to austerity but said last week that it was not sustainable to carry on spending at the current rate. The Treasury is not anticipating the Covid-19 crisis continuing until 2023-4 and the chancellor believes he can combine increases in spending with efforts to reduce the budget deficit. The IFS predicted Sunak’s spending decisions were likely to result in public spending settling at a higher share of national income than after 10 years of Labour government in 2007–08."
2020-09-28T19:26:53Z,politics,Politics,There may be a Covid crisis but Westminster still finds time to waste | John Crace,"You might have thought the Commons would have wanted to debate the growing number of university students who appear to have been banged up in self-isolation within hours of arriving at their halls of residence. To many of us it looks as if the students have effectively been taken hostage so the universities can trouser their tuition and accommodation fees. Nor does the government seem to have a clue what to do about the situation. Only in the morning, junior health minister Helen Whately – an MP who makes Inspector Clouseau look like Sherlock Holmes – had indicated that students could well still be locked up over Christmas; hours later Boris Johnson appeared to have unilaterally granted a festive amnesty. Neither appeared to have a clue about the epidemiology. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had decided he was a bit busy – make that unprepared – to make a ministerial statement and wondered whether it could possibly wait until Tuesday, by which time his department might have some implausible defence ready. And the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, had declined to force Private Pike to answer an urgent question on the matter, so instead the Commons chose to have a rather pointless general debate on the coronavirus, on which there was no vote and almost nothing was added to the sum of human knowledge. Hard to imagine, I know, but in the middle of the greatest health crisis for a century, parliament can still find opportunities to waste time. So it was left to Matt Hancock to do the honours of making his customary Monday afternoon appearance and lead off the non-debate with the controversial observation that Covid was a bit of a problem. Sure enough, within minutes Door Matt found himself taking interventions from those Tory MPs who are planning to vote against the government’s reluctance to submit itself to parliamentary scrutiny in Wednesday’s rather more meaningful debate. First Edward Leigh, quickly followed by Mark Harper, Steve Baker and Chris Grayling all interrupted to point out that the government was imposing draconian restrictions on the entire population without allowing men of their brilliance an opportunity to stop them. The health secretary did his best to reassure them he had only the best interests of the country at heart. Matt had given MPs at least eight days to digest the main bullet points of the latest measures that had been leaked to the media, and if the 12 pages of fine legal detail had only been published hours before the restrictions became law, then it was just one of those things. The thing was, Door Matt insisted, there were times when the government just had to move faster than parliament. The irony of him saying this on a day when everyone in Westminster was more or less wasting their time was lost on him. As was the fact that generally speaking not even the cabinet can agree the right balance between halting the spread of the virus and keeping the economy going. It may not be able to organise a piss up in a brewery but it can organise one on the bus home at 10pm. “The health of one of us begets the health of us all,” Matt said, trying to sound important. “I ask myself every day how to protect everyone and preserve liberties.” In which case the rest of us should have been asking ourselves every day why he hasn’t resigned. Because just about every decision he has made has failed either to protect lives or preserve liberties. We locked down far too late, we have one of the highest mortality rates in the country, our test-and-trace system – largely outsourced to private companies with no healthcare experience – is a global joke, and the “world beating” app that Door Matt was boasting more than 12 million people had downloaded is riddled with glitches and can’t process NHS tests. As if to annoy every Tory libertarian in the run up to Wednesday, he ended by announcing tighter lockdown restrictions in north-east England. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, understandably barely went through the motions of replying to this non-event, though he did manage to annoy some of the Tory freedom fighters by suggesting they wanted to let the virus rip through the country. No pointless debate, though, is complete without a pointless speech from Desmond Swayne, an MP whose self-love is only matched by his self-delusion. He began by saying he believed the happy-go-lucky Boris for whom he had voted had been captured by Dr Strangeglove (sic). He then implied the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser should be tried for treason under the Project Fear Act. Scientists were completely pointless; apart from the three who happened to agree with him that basically the UK should go back to normal living and if you died, you died. There could be no greater cause than dying of the coronavirus so that people like him could do what they liked. “Sweden,” squeaked John Redwood, apparently unaware of the geographical and demographic differences between the UK and Scandinavia. But by then Door Matt had long since left. It turns out that the health secretary does have some vestigial trace of self-respect after all and feels there are limits to his own sense of futility. If not the country’s."
2020-09-28T17:32:51Z,politics,Politics,Lockdown tightened in north-east England as Covid-19 infections rise,"Nearly 2 million people in north-east England face being fined up to £6,400 if they mix with other households indoors in a significant extension of the government’s lockdown powers. For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, it will be illegal for people in parts of the UK to meet people they do not live with in pubs, bars or restaurants. The measure comes into force on Wednesday in Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Previously, people in these areas were only advised not to meet others indoors. Breaches of the new regulation, which is yet to be laid down in law, will result in a £200 fine for a first offence, doubling each time up to a maximum of £6,400. The health secretary said the infection rate in the affected areas had risen above 100 cases per 100,000 people, double England’s average, and that it had “continued to rise sharply” despite a 10pm hospitality curfew and other measures introduced 10 days ago.
Matt Hancock said he had taken the measures while working closely with local councils. However, the announcement was immediately criticised by Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, who suggested they had been blindsided by the timing and detail of the move. “While we have been in discussions with the government on potential further restrictions, the secretary of state has once again stood up and announced changes without telling us he was about to do so,” said Forbes. “We want to work constructively with the government but the way these measures are being communicated in headlines and without detail does nothing for public confidence. We have demanded clarity on the new restrictions, testing and support for those businesses most affected.” The Department for Health and Social Care said a funding package would be in place to support the areas affected and that details would be announced in due course. It said people in support bubbles could continue to meet in any setting and that parents would still be able to form “childcare bubbles” with another household to share caring responsibilities “as long as they are consistent”.
It came as other large parts of England prepared for further restrictions within days as the number of cases and hospital admissions continued to rise. Extra measures for Liverpool, including a possible shutdown of bars, restaurants and pubs, are expected to be announced this week after its cases doubled in six days. The city’s seven-day infection rate was 242 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 24 September – almost five times the average in England. In Bolton, which previously had the highest rate, the infection rate is 212 per 100,000 people. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, said new infections in the city were doubling every six days and had reached 1,254 cases in the past week, up from 50 a week in August and 14 a week in July. About 8,000 schoolchildren in the city – more than one in 10 – and at least 350 teachers and staff were self-isolating, he added. One source suggested the measures could go further than closing the hospitality industry and were expected before Wednesday. “Whatever shock therapy they think Liverpool needs, it may not stop at bars and restaurants. I would be looking at the next 24 hours rather than later,” said one senior figure. Matt Ashton, Liverpool’s director of public health, said the city was in a “very difficult position”. The rise in cases had led to “sharp increases” in Covid hospital admissions, and “increases in deaths are likely to follow”, he said. The increase in cases spans all age groups, including over-65s. Steve Rotheram, the metro mayor of the Liverpool city region, said he supported more restrictions but called on the government to provide financial support to businesses forced to close. Meanwhile, in a rare joint letter, the leaders of Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool councils called for an urgent review of the government’s coronavirus restrictions, which they labelled “contradictory and confusing” . Council leaders and chief executives of the three major cities suggested that the measures were ineffective in tackling the rise in cases in their areas, while risking the “complete decimation” of the hospitality industry. They said the 10pm curfew on nightlife and advice against households mixing in pubs and restaurants would leave an impact that would be “huge, disproportionate and not what we believe the government intended when designing the measures”. At present, it is against the law for people to meet others they do not live with in their home or garden in their areas, while it is advisory guidance that people should not meet others in bars, pubs and restaurants. The three council chiefs said: “By not permitting the mixing of households in the sanitised and socially distanced conditions of licensed premises or coffee shops complying with the rule of six, it is genuinely creating a position which is the worst of both worlds in that the minority of people who flout the advisory guidance will continue to do so and the majority of responsible individuals will simply stay at home, with the unintended consequence of cities falling into a state of decline.” In the letter to Hancock and the business secretary, Alok Sharma, they wrote: “The stark reality is that these businesses are facing the prospect of a complete decimation in trade, not just in the short term but as we look ahead to the sector’s traditional lifeblood of the Christmas period and almost certainly continuing into spring/summer of next year which we know with certainty will result in mass market failure, huge levels of redundancies and depleted and boarded up high streets.”"

2020-09-28T17:03:05Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: UK risks being flooded with cheaply produced food, EU warns","The UK will be flooded with cheaply produced food should it lower its regulatory standards after Brexit, Brussels has warned, echoing a new animal and child welfare campaign backed by the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. On the eve of a crunch round of negotiations in Brussels over the UK’s future trade and security relationship with the EU, the European council president, Charles Michel, said Boris Johnson’s government faced a major choice with just three months left of the transition period in which the UK remains in the single market.
In a speech in which he spoke of the UK facing the EU’s “quiet strength” over the four years of talks, Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, claimed that “the British face a dilemma” over whether to move away from European standards. “What model of society do they want?” Michel asked. “Do they prefer to maintain high quality standards – health, food, environmental – or, on the contrary, do they want lower standards, [to] subject their farmers and their competitors to unfair and unjust competition from other regions of the world? It is the answer to this question that will determine the level of access to our internal market.” On Sunday, a group of celebrities, including Oliver, the lifestyle coach Joe Wicks, BBC Countryfile presenter Anita Rani and chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, with the backing of the RSPB and RSPCA, launched a campaign demanding assurances that “lower-standard” meat, such as US-produced chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef, will not be sold in British shops or served in restaurants and workplaces once the UK has left the EU. The alliance claimed the coronavirus pandemic had “raised the stakes” because “now, more than ever, we need to make sure everyone has access to affordable, good quality and sustainable food to help people be healthier, happier and more resilient”. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his team will renew negotiations with the EU side led by Michel Barnier on Tuesday, with the issue of a so-called “level playing field” in food, environmental and work standards for both European and British businesses high on the agenda. The EU is seeking assurances not only of “non-regression” from current standards but for there to be a mechanism for both sides to raise them in tandem in the future. British negotiators have rejected any clauses that tie the hands of the government. The most contentious issue in this strand of the negotiation is the issue of how the UK will control domestic subsidies in the future. In recent days, there have been reports of renewed optimism in Downing Street that a solution on both these issues, and that of EU access to British fishing waters, can be found in time to avoid a no-deal exit from the transition period. But government sources on Monday described such reports as “on the enthusiastic side”. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive, there remains much to be done. The fundamentals of our position have not changed from the start of this process. “We continue to be asked to accept provisions which do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.” Johnson has previously said that an EU leaders summit on 15 October is his deadline for a deal, after which the UK would focus on no-deal preparations. The spokesman appeared to backtrack from that position on Monday, describing it merely as a “timetable we need to work to”. Brussels believes the real deadline for a deal to be struck to allow time for ratification is the end of October or first week of November. Meanwhile, on Monday the EU appeared to soften its own deadline for when the UK government must withdraw the contentious clauses in the internal market bill which would lead to a breach of international law. Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission’s vice-president, had previously said the UK needed to dump the problematic clauses by this Wednesday but, following a morning meeting with Michael Gove, his co-chair of the EU-UK joint committee on implementation of the withdrawal agreement, he appeared to concede that the EU was willing to bide its time. “We are going to proceed with the negotiations,” he said. “We are going to use every single minute.” While Šefčovič did not spell out what would happen to trade and security talks if the UK did not back down, EU sources were more frank. “There is no way that as long as this threat is pending that we agree to that finalised [trade and security] deal.”"
2020-09-28T16:48:38Z,politics,Politics,"Abolish district councils to help shore up 'red wall', suggests top Tory","Abolishing district councils could help bolster Conservative MPs in former Labour strongholds by reducing local opposition, a leading Tory has suggested to the prime minister in a leaked letter. Boris Johnson has been urged to scrap the midsized local government bodies in part to help Conservatives in the so-called “red wall” seats that were gained in the December 2019 general election from Labour in its former northern strongholds. The call comes from David Williams, the leader of Hertfordshire county council, who heads the Conservative group at the County Councils Network. It reveals a party political dimension to plans to simplify local government by removing district and borough councils, leaving only very local parish and town councils and larger unitary authorities like county councils. Williams is among local government leaders frustrated at government delays to reforms. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, Williams told Johnson not to “ignore the political implications [of reform] for both Conservative councillors and MPs ... and in particular our new red wall MPs”. Williams said: “It is no surprise to me that many of those celebrating reports of delays are Labour and Liberal Democrat district councillors who regard the prospect of strong county based unitaries as threats to their strongholds.” Seats such as Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire and Burnley in Lancashire, gained by the Conservatives last year, overlap with Labour-controlled district councils, providing the party with a base from which to fight back, Conservative activists fear. Williams said: “Conservative representation at the county level remains strong but even in solidly Conservative counties like Surrey, only just over a third of local councillors within district and borough councils are Conservatives.” Prof Tony Travers, from the LSE Department of Government, said there was “no question” that abolishing opposition local councillors would help some MPs retain power, but he pointed out that sacrificing district councils would also mean losing thousands of Conservative local politicians in the south of England, many of whom form the backbone of campaigning operations at national elections. Conservatives are in a stronger position on county councils, where they control two-thirds of seats, than they are on district councils where they have 48% of seats. Williams urged the PM to ignore resistance to the abolition of district councils from district councillors themselves, saying they are “interested in self-preservation”. “It is no surprise that so much of the vitriol aimed at Robert Jenrick [the housing secretary] for driving a unitary agenda has come from those sources obsessed with self-protection above good governance and a chance to transform our society for the better.”"
2020-09-28T12:19:54Z,politics,Politics,"Parliament's bars will not serve alcohol after 10pm, Commons confirms","Alcohol will not be served after 10pm in parliament in an apparent U-turn, after it emerged that Commons bars would be exempt from strict early closing rules imposed across the country. Facilities serving alcohol on the parliamentary estate would not have to abide by the earlier closing time because they fell under the description of “a workplace canteen”, the Times reported on Monday. But after the development was immediately condemned by some MPs, the Commons was forced clarify that alcohol would not be served after 10pm. Exemptions to the rules introduced last Thursday state that “workplace canteens may remain open where there is no practical alternative for staff at that workplace to obtain food”. Bar staff and customers in the Palace of Westminster reportedly would not have had to follow new stricter rules on face coverings introduced for other licensed premises, and visitors to parliamentary bars would not be asked to supply their details on entry for test and trace. Within hours, the apparent move was criticised by MPs. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, tweeted: “Not good, so many in the hospitality sector on the verge of collapse or struggling to cope, they will be rightly very angry to read this. We should get our own house in order before demanding others follow regulations, people are fed up with this nonsense.” Wes Streeting, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, wrote: “This is ridiculous and makes parliament look ridiculous. This has got to change immediately. We can’t have one rule for parliament and one rule for everyone else.” The Labour MP Sarah Owen called the apparent move “absolutely ridiculous”, tweeting: “I know the Govt have got used to setting one rule for some and another for everyone else but this is another level.” However, in a change effective immediately, a House of Commons spokesman said on Monday: “Alcohol will not be sold after 10pm anywhere on the parliamentary estate.” Commons catering facilities will remain open later to serve food when the Commons is sitting, with all measures kept under review. Johnson announced new restrictions in England last week including the 10pm closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants, with hospitality venues only allowed to offer table service. Masks were also made mandatory for retail and hospitality staff.
The Pugin Room, Strangers’ Dining Room, the Adjournment and the Members’ Smoking Room are reportedly among parliament bars that reopened before the summer recess. Parliament’s website boasts that Strangers’ is “a magnificently decorated event venue”, saying: “Combined with the intricate wood carvings, the elaborate red flock wallpaper – designed and favoured by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) – provides an elegant setting for your event.” Earlier, a spokesperson for the Commons had reportedly said: “As catering outlets providing a workplace service for over 3,100 people working on the estate, the current regulations on hospitality venues do not apply to Commons facilities.”"
2020-09-28T11:08:21Z,politics,Politics,Scottish ministers accused of 'panicky' response to Covid outbreaks on campuses,"Opposition leaders in Scotland have accused ministers of a “shambolic” response after they loosened tough coronavirus controls imposed on students last week. Scottish ministers issued fresh guidance to universities and students on Sunday evening to clarify and soften emergency rules that had appeared to ban students from going home after a surge in Covid-19 cases on campuses. Thousands of students who were told they had to remain in isolation have now been told they can now return home in certain circumstances, after a backlash from student leaders, lawyers and some academics. However, the clarification failed to placate opposition parties at Holyrood.
Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, called for an urgent statement in the Scottish parliament from John Swinney, the Scottish education secretary, and said there was a clear need for routine Covid-19 testing of students. “Issuing new guidance on a late Sunday evening is no way to communicate clearly and effectively,” Rennie said. “It is yet another panicky response from a government that should have been ready for this. I warned the first minister for weeks that this was coming as it was the biggest movement of people since the lockdown.” Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, criticised the government’s failure to update parliament on changes to the rules to allow proper scrutiny and its initial failure to issue clear and timely guidance. “The SNP have slept in and caused a first-class shambles,” he said. “They were slow to prepare and they’ve been slow to react. Just like the blended learning and exam fiascos, they’ve sat back when they should have stepped up.” The new rules uphold last week’s request for all students to stay in their university accommodation and again warn that it is a criminal offence to breach the regulations against meeting more than other household. That had appeared to ban the thousands of students told to self-isolate after local outbreak, or who had a positive test for Covid-19, from returning home. But the update now makes clear students can return home for short periods for a family emergency or wellbeing reasons, including mental ill health. Those count as a “reasonable excuse” under Scottish law, the government said. It said students self-isolating could return home temporarily as long as they avoided public transport and remained in isolation at home. They could also choose to go home permanently, under the same conditions. The concession led to fresh demands on Monday from opposition parties and the National Union of Students for students to get full rebates on all accommodation fees and rental contracts, and the blanket use of online tuition. The University and College Union, the main union for university staff, wrote to the prime minister on Monday urging him to intervene to ensure all universities move online and that students who wish to are allowed to return to their homes safely. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, has said that given the growing prevalence of Covid-19 across the country and outbreaks on university campuses, online teaching should become the norm in the higher education sector. “We are only a week or two into the new academic year and we already have Covid-19 outbreaks at institutions in Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee, and these are unlikely to be the last examples,” Grady said. “My union is not prepared to take chances with the health of students, our members and the communities they serve. It is clear that remote learning should be the default for campus life while we are in this precarious position with the virus.”
There was widespread confusion over the rules last week as the Scottish government and universities reacted to numerous Covid-19 outbreaks in student accommodation and repeated cases of students breaching bans on multiple households meeting up. The largest outbreak led to more than 172 students at Glasgow University becoming infected, in a cluster centred on Murano Street student halls. Over the weekend police were called to Edinburgh University’s Pollock Halls student accommodation to close down illegal gatherings.
After Universities Scotland, the sector’s umbrella body, warned that breaches “would not be tolerated” and universities said students faced sanctions including possible expulsion for rule breaches, Bruce Adamson, Scotland’s children’s commissioner, said the policies could breach students’ human rights. Richard Lochhead, the Scottish minister for further and higher education, said on Monday morning he was aware that some students were going back to their family homes. He said many were struggling with the restrictions. “It is challenging at the moment, especially if they are self-isolating, but they are enjoying the opportunity of making new connections, of at least meeting their tutors, albeit a lot of their learning is online,” he said on BBC Radio Scotland. “So I don’t expect a mass exodus from Scotland’s campuses, but the opportunity is there for those that are struggling.”"
2020-09-28T09:12:34Z,politics,Politics,Andy Burnham calls for urgent review of 10pm coronavirus curfew,"The Greater Manchester mayor has called for an urgent review of the 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants in England, warning that it is doing more harm than good and has created an “incentive” for people to gather in homes and streets. Andy Burnham suggested a 9pm curfew on the sale of alcohol in shops and supermarkets should be put in place alongside the current restriction, to prevent a rush to buy supplies for gatherings after pubs close. “My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, adding that over the weekend he “received reports that the supermarkets were absolutely packed out to the rafters”.
He said: “What we’re told is the main place where the virus is spread is in gatherings in the home. I think the government needs to give some urgent consideration to this because if it is doing more harm than good and actually also damaging businesses that have spent a lot of money getting themselves ready to reopen, then I think they shouldn’t just plough on with it.” The Liverpool mayor, Joe Anderson, said at the weekend that the curfew – which came into force in England and Wales on Thursday – was “making things more dangerous”, after large crowds gathered in the city when venues turned revellers out on Saturday night. Responding to Burnham’s suggestion of further restrictions to prevent gatherings, the junior health minister Helen Whately said the government was keeping “an open mind”, and she did not rule out speculation that strict new measures may come into force in northern England and London in response to rising virus rates.
“There’s quite a lot of coverage in the papers about will there be further restrictions. I mean clearly we don’t want to do that, but I wouldn’t rule it out because you do need to get the Covid rates under control,” she told the Today programme. She said it was “clearly early days” in terms of seeing how the curfew would affect coronavirus transmission rates. “For anyone coming out of a pub or restaurant at 10 o’clock and thinking what to do next and tempted by the idea of going on and partying, I’d say think of the consequences of your actions,” Whately said. The scientific advice behind the decision to impose a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants remains unclear. Last week a member of the government’s Sage advisory group, Prof John Edmunds, told Today that the measure was “fairly trivial” and would have a “very small impact on the epidemic”, while his fellow Sage member Prof Graham Medley said he had not heard it discussed at meetings prior to the announcement on Tuesday. However, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said on Sunday that the government had taken heed of scientific advice, including from the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. “The risk here is as people have more to drink later on in the evening, the amount of social distancing reduces. People get friendlier with each other and there’s a greater risk of spread,” he said on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show. Weekly data from Public Health England showed just 22 out of 772 new cases in the week up to 20 September were caused by the hospitality industry. But Whately said the government’s aim was to “break the chains of transmission”. She told Sky News that the government had been looking closely at contact-tracing activities in areas with large outbreaks. “One of the things you can see is some of the contacts have been in hospitality,” said Whately.
Burnham also urged the government to simplify and clarify Covid-19 restrictions, which differ in regions where local lockdowns are in force, in order to increase levels of compliance. “There is currently a dissonance between the national and the local requirements,” he said. “For instance, the rule of six does not apply in the same way in areas of local restrictions, where we’re required not to meet in the home and advised not to meet in public venues, and that is understandably causing confusion amongst the public.”"
2020-09-28T05:00:04Z,politics,Politics,"Confidence in UK's global role plunges after Brexit, poll finds","Belief that Britain is a force for good in the world has plunged in the last 18 months, a national poll has found, with under half of the UK now convinced of the country’s positive impact. As negotiations on the UK’s future relationship enter a key week in Brussels and with the country set to leave the EU’s single market and customs union at the end of the year, a poll by Ipsos Mori suggests there is a lack of confidence in Britain’s global role. Just under half of Britons (49%) believe that Britain is a force for good in the world, down 10 points from April 2019. While 41% of Britons say the UK should punch above its weight in world affairs, the proportion who believe Britain should stop pretending it is an important power is up five points from last year to 38%. The public are still more likely to say that Britain should increase its influence around the world than reduce it – by 36% to 16%. The polling was commissioned by the EU-UK forum, a new organisation established in Brussels in an attempt to promote a close relationship between Britain and the bloc in the coming years. The negotiations over a trade and security deal are due to resume in Brussels on Tuesday, with UK officials talking up the prospects of agreement. EU sources are more cautious, warning that the compromises necessary are yet to be made. Relations have been made more difficult following Boris Johnson’s decision to legislate to allow the UK to unilaterally rewrite the terms of the withdrawal agreement in what ministers have admitted is a breach of international law. Such was the outrage over the government’s move that the Democrat contender for US president, Joe Biden, warned that he would block a UK-US trade deal if the British government put at risk the Good Friday agreement by breaking with the arrangements agreed on Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement. Despite the row over the internal market bill, in which the threat to breach the agreement was made, optimism has grown in recent days that a deal on a future relationship can be struck.
A summit of EU leaders on 15 October is being seen by both sides as a crunch point by which time it will be clear whether common ground can be found on the outstanding issues. The two sides have struggled to find a mutually acceptable solution to the level of access that European fleets will have to British fishing waters or how to maintain a “level playing field” for businesses in which neither side can unfairly lower production standards or prop up ailing companies through state aid subsidies. But there is a growing belief in Westminster that the prime minister is not willing to face a no-deal exit from the transition period at a time when the country is struggling to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Ipsos Mori poll, Europe remains Britain’s most important relationship in the world for four in 10 of the public, with double the number of people choosing the EU over either the Commonwealth or the US. Four in five think maintaining a close relationship with the EU is important despite Brexit, although only 39% of people now think that is likely, down 13 points since April 2019. Two in five (40%) believe the top priority for Britain’s relationship with the EU is striking a trade agreement, with one in five saying it is to prevent and detect crime and terrorism, coordinate responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, or deal with global migration.
Paul Adamson, chairman of the EU-UK forum, said: “The polling shows that the vast majority of people think it is important for the UK to keep a close relationship with the EU despite Brexit, and only a minority wants to see the UK stepping back from the global stage. “Since Brexit is a process – not a final destination – the EU-UK Forum is being launched to facilitate and nurture constructive and informed dialogue between the UK and the EU.” Ipsos Mori interviewed a sample of 1,068 British adults aged 16-75 between 10 and 14 September."
2020-09-27T23:01:01Z,politics,Politics,Business leaders urge UK government to avoid no-deal Brexit,"Business leaders have heaped pressure on the government to agree a last-minute Brexit trade deal after a survey showed that more than three-quarters backed an agreement with Brussels. The CBI warned ministers that only 4% of company bosses from a survey of 648 said they supported a no deal Brexit, while 77% said they wanted a deal. Businesses reported that the pace of decline in parts of industry had eased, but half of respondents said the impact of dealing with Covid-19 had negatively affected preparations for Brexit. The study showed that private sector activity fell in the quarter to September, but at a slower pace, adding to concerns from the British Chambers of Commerce and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, that the recovery has stalled across much of the economy. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: “Next week Brexit talks enter the 11th hour. Now must be the time for political leadership and the spirit of compromise to shine through on both sides. A deal can and must be made. “Businesses face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges – rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus, and preparing for significant changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU. “A good deal will provide the strongest possible foundation as countries build back from the pandemic. It would keep UK firms competitive by minimising red tape and extra costs, freeing much needed time and resources to overcome the difficult times ahead.” The fall in private sector activity is expected to continue over the next three months, though at a slower pace, said the CBI."
2020-09-27T20:19:48Z,politics,Politics,Lib Dems vote to push for renewed EU membership in long term,"The Liberal Democrats have voted to push for renewed UK membership of the European Union, but only as “a longer-term objective”, as the party used its annual conference to begin a post-Brexit process of rebranding. The party, which won just 11 seats at December’s election on a platform that included a pledge to rescind Brexit without a public vote if its then leader Jo Swinson became prime minister, has been seeking a way to reconcile its pro-European stance with the reality of departure. A frontbench motion on Europe at the party’s online-only annual conference this weekend focused mainly on efforts to fight against a no-deal Brexit, and secure the rights of EU citizens in the UK. It also condemned the internal markets bill proposed by Boris Johnson’s government, which includes a pledge to breach international law in redrawing the Brexit departure deal, as something which “trashes the UK’s reputation, sets a dangerous precedent and almost certainly precludes any chance of a free trade agreement with either the EU or the USA”.
The motion, as initially tabled, said only that the party would “keep all options open for the UK’s future relationship with the EU, including membership at an appropriate future date”. However, a number of members, including some MPs, believed this was too watered down a commitment, and it was amended before it was voted through. The agreed version says the party will “support a longer-term objective of UK membership of the EU at an appropriate future date to be determined by political circumstances, subject to public assent, market and trade conditions and acceptable negotiated terms”. Another possible amendment, which was rejected, gave a stronger commitment to “campaign to rejoin the EU after the post-Brexit transition period ends”. Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem MP who speaks on Brexit issues, said the party would “never turn our back on our pro-European values, because we are so much better off standing together than we could ever be alone”. She said: “With our country already facing the biggest economic and health crisis in generations, it is unthinkable that the UK would crash out of the transition period without a deal. “Boris Johnson must start putting the nation first, rather than sacrificing everything and anything in his ideological pursuit of Brexit. This is about stopping the disaster of food shortages, medicine shortages, and more.”"
2020-09-27T19:42:02Z,politics,Politics,Laurence Fox launching political party to 'reclaim' British values,"The actor Laurence Fox has announced he is launching a political party to “reclaim” British values from politicians, who he says have “lost touch with the people”. In a statement on Twitter, the 42-year-old member of an acting dynasty that includes his father, James, and his cousin Emilia, said the party would aim to provide a “new political movement which promises to make our future a shared endeavour, not a divisive one”. In a separate tweet, he claimed he had received more than £5m in donations to start the party, provisionally named Reclaim, although he did not provide evidence. The Daily Telegraph reported that the party had received significant backing from former Tory donors, and aims to stand dozens of candidates in the next general election. The actor, who has been a vocal critic of the BBC, said he wants to reform publicly funded institutions, from media to education, so they are “free from political bias”, according to objectives seen by the Telegraph. The Telegraph reports that the party – whose name is subject to approval by the Electoral Commission – is recruiting staff and aims to launch next month. A Westminster source, quoted in the Telegraph, described it as “Ukip for culture”. The former star of the detective drama Lewis has become better known this year for making controversial comments about racism and inequality than for his acting. Appearing on Question Time in January, Fox insisted the media coverage of the Duchess of Sussex was not rooted in racism, labelling the allegations about Meghan’s treatment “boring”. He then said it was “racist” for an audience member to call him “a white, privileged male”. The row landed him on the front page of the Daily Mail. Later that month, Fox said it was “odd” to show a Sikh soldier in the first world war film 1917. Following widespread criticism including from historians underlining the contribution of about 130,000 Sikhs in the British army during the war, Fox apologised for expressing himself in what he described as a “clumsy” manner. In January, the actor attacked black and working class actors for criticising the industry once they have “five million quid in the bank”."
2020-09-27T14:34:48Z,politics,Politics,Sunak's winter plan is the shadow chancellor's chance to fight back | Larry Elliott,"The job of shadow chancellor is one of the toughest in politics. Your opponent can call on the full weight of the Treasury and can actually do stuff. It is always a struggle to be heard. In theory, life should have been a bit easier for the current incumbent, Anneliese Dodds, because she took over from John McDonnell just as the economy was falling into the Covid-19 abyss. It normally helps not to be in charge when the country is going through a monster recession. But it has still not been easy for Dodds. Over and above the normal difficulties associated with being shadow chancellor, she has faced three additional problems: a Labour party shellshocked from defeat last December; a government that has responded to the crisis with policies Labour would have followed had it been in power; and a chancellor who has gone out of his way to be consensual. So would Labour have introduced a furlough scheme? Clearly, yes. Did it have a problem with state control of the train operating companies? No, it didn’t. Would Dodds have followed Rishi Sunak’s example and invited Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, to Downing Street for talks about what the government ought to be doing? It goes without saying that she would. Even so, there has been a passivity about Labour’s stance. The kindest interpretation is that Dodds has adopted the rope-a-dope technique used by the boxer Muhammad Ali in his Rumble in the Jungle fight with George Foreman in 1974. But the point about rope-a-dope was that Ali didn’t simply lie back and let Foreman pummel him; he could punch hard too and knew when to come off the ropes. For Dodds, that moment has now arrived. Sunak’s winter economy plan, announced last week, was a triumph of style over substance. He might have had an uncomfortable-looking O’Grady with him on the doorstep of 11 Downing Street for a photo opportunity, but the reality is that the Treasury will scale back support for the economy over the next few months. Gordon Brown, the last Labour shadow chancellor to make it to the Treasury, thinks only a much bigger package can save Britain from mass unemployment. This is a big opportunity for Dodds, and the shadow chancellor knows it. She has written to Sunak pointing out the weaknesses and inconsistencies of a plan that she says harks back to the worst days of Thatcherism. The centrepiece of last week’s announcement was the job support scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme on 1 November. The idea of the JSS is to top up the wages of employees only able to work part-time, to almost four-fifths of their normal pay, but instead of having to pay 20% of the cost – as will be the case in the last month of the furlough – employers will have to pay up to 55%. In her letter, Dodds suggests this provides an incentive for employers to keep on a small number of workers full-time and get rid of the rest, because employing one full-time worker costs less than employing two part-time workers. Asked about this at a press conference last week, Sunak said the JSS together with the £1,000 job-retention bonus payable for each worker brought back from furlough and kept on the payroll until 31 January would be enough to persuade companies not to part with workers. This might be true of highly skilled and difficult-to-replace workers, but unlikely to be the case for those most at risk in the coming months, who tend to work in low-wage, low-productivity sectors. As the Oxford University economist Michael Devereux rightly notes, the JSS is a “huge new tax on employers” that is likely if anything to create more, rather than less, unemployment. Sunak’s new approach is that the Treasury is there to help, but only in cases where employees can work at least a third of their normal hours. Jobs where this is possible are deemed viable, and those where it is not are unviable. This has distinct echoes of Joseph Schumpeter and his idea of creative destruction: essentially the notion that for capitalism to regenerate itself, old struggling sectors have to go under in order to make way for dynamic, new companies.
Dodds makes two perfectly reasonable points in response. First, if the chancellor thinks the economy is going through deep structural change, where is the government support for retraining so that workers acquire the skills they need for the jobs of the future? Second, there is not the remotest possibility, given continued restrictions, that many of those who work in the performing arts will be able to work a third of their normal hours. Is the government seriously saying that these are unviable jobs? If not, where is the support for the creative industries? Her letter goes on to ask what assessment the Treasury has made of the impact on the self-employed of the scaling-back of state financial support, what was being done to help those who had fallen between the cracks in the government’s scheme, and why Britain’s plans for a green recovery were less ambitious than those of Germany and France.
Although couched in the politest of ways, the letter from Dodds could prove canny. If things go badly wrong for the economy over the coming months, which looks a stone-cold certainty, Sunak will have a choice. Either he will have to come back with a fresh package of support along the lines Labour is proposing or, much less likely, he will say the cupboard is now bare and there is nothing more he can do. Whichever choice he makes, Dodds will then be able to say: I told you so."
2020-09-27T14:09:21Z,politics,Politics,Tory councillors in revolt over plans to accelerate housebuilding,"A growing rebellion among Conservative councillors is threatening government plans to accelerate housebuilding in England with six out of 10 believing reforms will make planning less democratic. A survey across Tory heartlands has revealed party representatives are baulking at ministers’ plans to sharply increase housing targets in electoral strongholds like Hampshire and Surrey and are rejecting attempts to cut planning committees out of routine decision-making. Conservative leaders in councils are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to the plans which they fear could result in countryside being concreted over for housing and core voters deserting them in disgust. Martin Tett, the Conservative leader of Buckinghamshire council told the Guardian demands for an extra 1,000 homes to be built a year in his country were “undesirable and undeliverable” while John Halsall, leader of Wokingham council said the proposals were “a huge political danger”. An internal presentation from Winchester council seen by the Guardian warns the proposals are “clearly designed to reduce [the] number and type of decisions taken locally”. The concern is reflected in a poll this month by Savanta Comres of Conservative councillors, weighted towards those who sit on planning committees, which found 61% believe proposed reforms announced in August would make planning less democratic. It was carried out on behalf of BECG, a planning communications firm, and showed that 70% of Tory councillors want to increase the size of the greenbelt, which appears to run contrary to government proposals that otherwise unprotected farm and open land could be zoned for construction. Andrew Howard, the firm’s managing director, said: “If the government is going to deliver on its commitment to fundamentally reform the planning system, it is going to have to put in some serious spade work, to win round those Conservative councillors who provide the bedrock of their member of parliament’s constituency association and who clearly value their role in controlling development.” The survey also found that two thirds of all councillors, including Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents, believe the majority of consultation with the public should happen on a proposal-by-proposal basis rather than when broad local plans are devised, as the planning white paper published last month proposes. The planning reforms were unveiled in August by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, and immediately drew sharp criticism. Under the proposals, planning applications based on pre-approved “design codes” would get an automatic green light – eliminating a whole stage of local oversight within designated zones. Land across England would be divided into three categories – for growth, renewal or protection – under what Jenrick, described as “once in a generation” changes to sweep away an outdated planning system and boost building. But the proposals were immediately condemned by The Town and Country Planning Association as disruptive and rushed, and described as creating the “the next generation of slum housing” by the president of RIBA, Alan Jones.
The government’s parallel proposal to use an algorithm to set new housing targets for local areas in order to meet a national annual housebuilding target of 333,000 new homes has caused widespread concern. Analysis by Lichfields, a planning consultancy, of the proposed method has shown that sharp increases are expected in many Tory heartlands. In Chichester, West Sussex the annual target would rise from 425 to 1,120, in Reigate, Surrey it would rise from 460 to 1,091 while in Tonbridge in Kent it would rise from 425 to 1,440. “If they stick with the algorithm they are using at the moment there will be more building on greenfield and less on brownfield in northern cities and that’s a real concern,” said Cllr David Renard, Conservative leader of Swindon council and planning spokesman for the Local Government Association planning spokesman. “What local government would like to see is numbers based on local needs rather than some algorithm imposing numbers from above. We are hopeful the government will reshape their proposals. The planning system can be improved and we don’t think this is the right way to do it.” The algorithm has proposed cuts to housing targets in many northern areas such as Lancaster, Preston and Blackburn with Darwen. Halsall’s area in Wokingham, Berkshire, has been told its current target of 600 new homes per year will rise to 1,635 which he said was “very unpopular”. “We are a rural and semi-rural area and our population has doubled in the last 20 years so everyone is suffering from congestion, development noise, medical services being rationed which [voters] attribute to the volume of development,” he said. “It’s nuts in planning terms and it’s nuts in political terms.” A spokesperson for the ministry of housing, communities and local government described the opposition as “misguided”, saying community involvement and control is at the centre of its overhaul of an “outdated planning system”. “While local housing need proposals provide a guide for councils they will still need to consider local circumstances to decide how many homes should be delivered in their areas,” they said. “We’re consulting on the proposals and will reflect on the feedback we receive so we can deliver the homes we need, where we need them.” On Wednesday parliament is set to vote on a Labour motion against a planning rule change to allow owners of blocks of flats to extend without seeking full planning permission."
2020-09-27T07:45:38Z,politics,Politics,Covidâ€™s second coming: how did Britain get back in this mess?,"It is the kind of scene that is now a distant memory in the UK. Some 6,000 miles away, Taipei’s Pawnshop club is crammed every Friday and Saturday evening with sweaty crowds dancing under wreaths of smoke, and jostling each other at the bar for drinks. Here, the only reminders of coronavirus are on the door, where punters have their temperatures checked and scan a QR code to enter their contact details.
Taiwan’s strict coronavirus controls means only citizens, long-term residents and travellers with business visas are allowed in, and anyone coming from abroad must spend two weeks in a quarantine hotel. Once that time is up, they emerge into a normality unimaginable in much of the rest of the world. As of 24 September, only 507 Covid-19 cases and seven deaths have been reported in the country; there hasn’t been a single domestic transmission since 8 April. So far at least, there has been no sign of a second wave, not even a ripple. Clubbers heading to Pawnshop rub shoulders with fitness devotees going for a workout at a 24-hour gym. Down the road at the Tonghua night market, groups of friends and families sit elbow to elbow, sharing plates of fried tofu, barbecued meats and spring onion pancakes. There are some reminders of the pandemic woven into daily life. Masks are required on public transport, and temperatures are taken on entry to most buildings. But early and effective action by Taiwanese authorities means that people can largely relax. They are watching the tragedies unfolding in so many other places with horror and incomprehension. “It’s painful for me to hear these stories from the UK and the US,” says Popcorn, a drag queen whose eclectic act at the Cafe Dalida bar involves the type of audience interaction that would be impossible even in performance venues attempting to reopen in the UK. “Knowing what’s possible, and seeing what’s actually happening… it’s sad.” Back in April – when Taiwan had its last case, and China, where the virus almost certainly originated, was also getting the disease under control – Boris Johnson believed that what those countries had achieved was possible in Britain too. The corner was being turned. Soon after his own brush with Covid-19 in early spring, the prime minister was full of optimism and combative talk. On 27 April he told the nation it would not be long: “If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger – which I can tell you from personal experience, it is – then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor... the moment we can press home our advantage.” On 1 June, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, also believed the virus was in retreat. “The data show we are winning the battle against coronavirus. Today we are therefore able to make some cautious changes to the lockdown rules, carefully and safely,” he said. Last Tuesday, however, the UK went backwards, tightening restrictions again. Suddenly cases were doubling every seven days, increasing at rates not seen since March. Scientists had warned in the summer that easing off too soon and too fast in response to pressure from Covid-doubting Tory MPs and businesses could allow the virus to return, and it has done just that – with a vengeance. The public was bemused at this latest U-turn, as was much of the normally Tory-supporting media. The Daily Mail, which appears to be selling shares in Johnson as fast as Covid-19 infections are rising again, was scathing in an editorial. It was furious not only that new lockdowns loomed but that Johnson’s government was failing to take the people, or even MPs, with it. “Depressingly, this authoritarian nightmare is likely to drag on for another six months,” it said.
It also articulated the key debate which now splits the Conservative party, the cabinet and the country – and over which No 10 appears completely undecided itself. “Does the PM really want Britain to oscillate interminably in and out of lockdown to try to avoid even a single casualty? Or do we accept the contagion in our midst, protect the vulnerable and get on with the business of living?” The mix of anger and confusion was unsurprising. It was, after all, less than three weeks since Johnson had been enthusiastically urging people to return to work; three weeks since schools had reopened because ministers had insisted they were safe. And the hugely popular and successful “eat out to help out” scheme had ended as recently as 1 September, having brought the hospitality sector back to life and coaxed people out of their homes to spend again. Government advice had chopped and changed often in the previous six months, but this was the sharpest readjustment of all. “I think we are going down the Swanee,” said a despairing Labour MP last week as he pondered the multiple disasters of Covid-19, the switches in government policy towards it, and the Brexit internal market bill which Johnson had brought to the Commons to allow him to break international law. “We are supposed to be a great country but we are an embarrassment,” said the shadow minister. “We can’t deal with this bloody virus and our government trashes the law. And I just despair.” MPs knew they would face the wrath of constituents when they returned home this weekend. Pubs and restaurants, which had only just got used to serving under Covid safety requirements – measures that had cost them dearly to introduce – would have to close at 10pm and begin turfing out drinkers well before. “It is tragic for them,” said a senior Tory. “They have hung on so far. I really fear this will be their death knell.” Johnson also announced new £10,000 fines for people who refused to self-isolate. Advice on working from home was again turned on its head and people who could were told that they should. Businesses that were not Covid-safe would be closed. There was talk – which is gaining ground among panicked Conservative MPs – of using the army to help enforce rules and control the swelling second wave.
The restrictions would remain for six months, the PM said, through Christmas and beyond. Far from being wrestled to the ground, the virus was alive and kicking. Any optimism had drained away. In the Commons last Wednesday, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer – conscious that the country was back in full crisis mode and needed some wartime togetherness – backed the strict new rules but laid the blame for the second wave at the door of the government, citing its continued failure to set up an efficient, locally responsive test and trace system. “When is the prime minister going to act?” Starmer asked as MPs from all parties demanded to know why the UK, whose health service is still admired across the world, was so helpless in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Lessons from abroad Covid-19 is in many ways still a mystery enemy. Neither governments nor scientists fully understand how it spreads – authorities in the US are still debating the role of airborne transmission – and why the death toll in badly affected areas varies so widely. In the Brazilian city of Manaus this spring, the death toll was so high that bodies piled up in the streets and were stacked three-deep in mass graves, in scenes that could have been lifted from a medieval plague diary. In war-torn Afghanistan, with a battered health system and most people unable to afford social distancing, millions of people are thought to have contracted the disease. In the capital, Kabul, nearly half of children have been infected, the government estimates. But while Afghanistan’s gravediggers, coffin-makers and others who serve the bereaved have reported an increase in burials, the country has not been overwhelmed by death as Manaus was. There have also been countries, from India to South Africa, which have seen infections soar after they came out of lockdown but mortality rates rise much more slowly. South Africa now has approaching 700,000 confirmed infections, but under 17,000 deaths – nearly 60% more total cases than the UK but less than half the number of deaths. Some fatalities may go uncounted in places with weak record-keeping, but it is hard to cover up catastrophe on the scale that hit Manaus. Scientists are still arguing over the reasons some countries seem to have been spared heavy death tolls even as the infection spreads. A relatively young population may be less vulnerable than in fast-ageing western disease hotspots. People living in overcrowded conditions may have stronger immune systems, fortified by fighting off many past infections. But if it is hard to predict how Covid epidemics will develop, it is much easier to see what keeps the disease at bay. The few countries that have managed to effectively eliminate coronavirus range from authoritarian China to liberal democracies such as Taiwan and New Zealand. The clue to their success is not in their style of government but in several key steps they have taken to control the virus. All have sealed their borders, slowing new arrivals to a trickle, and brought in strict quarantine – two weeks in sealed-off hotels – for the few who are allowed in. They also have rapid testing and effective tracing systems that are activated on the few occasions that community spread of the virus is identified. And there is also a second group of countries that have used similar tactics to keep the epidemic under relative control, even if the disease cannot be stamped out. Deaths are in the hundreds, or still kept to double figures. They range from Uruguay to Vietnam and Senegal. Even Italy, one of the first places outside China where health systems were overrun by the disease, now seems to be managing far better than other western countries. Cases are rising, but only slowly: people are still enjoying restaurants, bars and beach trips; children are back at school.
The exact policies adopted by these second group of governments have differed, but they share many common factors. Those that do not enforce quarantine for arrivals in the country require negative coronavirus tests shortly before travel. Test and trace functions effectively in all of them, so that when a new outbreak emerges, it can be halted as soon as possible. In many – though not all – mask wearing in public places has become not just routine, but expected. In contrast – although the British government has partially accepted that without proper testing, isolation of the sick and protective equipment for healthcare staff in the early stages, the virus spreads with devastating ease – UK authorities did not prepare failsafe systems to provide these essentials. The scale of the problem is reflected in the UK’s record in staving off Covid-19 and preventing deaths, as shown by data that is both disastrous and highly incriminating. To date, Covid-19 death rates for the UK have reached 616 per million people. This figure is only slightly below the rates experienced in nations acknowledged to have had the worst responses to the pandemic, such as the US and Brazil, where Covid death rates were, respectively, 626 and 657 per million according to Johns Hopkins University on Saturday. By contrast, Sweden – where shops, restaurants, schools and bars remained open and which has taken the lightest of touches in dealing with the pandemic – still has a death rate below the UK’s: 581 per million. On the other hand, Germany – which reacted rapidly and forcibly to the arrival of Covid-19 – has kept its death rate to 114 per million. Back in the UK And now the figures show the virus biting back in the UK and spreading at alarming rates, putting huge new pressure on the NHS. As of Friday, hospital admissions in England were at their highest level in more than three months as infections continued to rise. As of 9am on Saturday there had been a further 6,042 lab-confirmed cases UK-wide, after Friday’s highest single-day figure. The government confirmed that new lockdown restrictions would be introduced in Wigan, Stockport, Blackpool and Leeds from midday on Saturday adding to those in place in large parts of the country. Residents in these areas were told they would no longer be allowed to mix with people outside their household or “bubble” in private. And thousands of students are in effective lockdown, just days after starting their courses in the face of union warnings that colleges were unprepared to deal with the likely spread of Covid. Hundreds of students in Manchester were told to self-isolate on Friday after 127 of them tested positive for Covid-19, as cases spread to more than 20 universities across the UK. And hundreds of thousands of students in Scotland have been banned from socialising and going to bars. An outbreak of more than 100 confirmed cases at the University of Glasgow led to at least 600 students being told to self-isolate on Wednesday night. So why – in so far as we can find answers – are we back in such a mess? Many scientists believe that, having got numbers down in the summer, we failed to finish the job off and reduce them to a low enough level before easing restrictions. We moved too fast, too early. And when the restrictions were removed, there is a consensus emerging that the easing was done unsystematically, instead of individual restrictions being lifted one by one at different times. The result was that the impact of single, specific withdrawals could not be assessed. “We didn’t keep on the pressure to maintain a reduction in [the R rate] over the summer and people have gone back to normal behaviours too quickly,” said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London. “We are now paying the price.” Joshua Moon, of Sussex University’s science policy research unit, pointed to “the narrow cadre of experts” who have given advice on Covid to the UK government as a problem. “The composition of Sage [the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] consisted of virologists, modellers and behaviourists, rather than experts in public or global health, primary care, emergency medicine, or nursing,” he said. In particular there was a lack of support – financial, practical and psychological – for those being asked to isolate, Moon said. “If you live alone, across the country far from family or friends, how can you gain access to food or medicine? What is needed is increased direct support for those isolating.”
The Dominic Cummings affair also had a clear impact, said psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes of King’s College London about the antics of the prime minister’s chief adviser, leading the public to lose faith in government and authority. “He wasn’t admonished and he wasn’t sorry. That really broke the community’s trust in any government messaging.” That messaging has become increasingly confused, Wykes believes. “You can’t go to a football match but you can go grouse shooting. That just accentuates the class divide and says we are not all in this together.” On the ground, however, health experts, NHS workers, people working for local councils all know it is the failure to get a proper, locally responsive, test-and-trace system operating that has been the key problem since the spring and summer. Prof Christina Pagel, professor of clinical operational research at University College London, explains the importance of such a programme: “If you have infected people, and lots of non-infected people, you’re trying to stop the infected people mixing. We know that quite a lot of transmission is by people who either never have symptoms, or in the two days before they get symptoms. So you have to find those people and stop them mixing. And the only way to do that is by contact tracing.” But during the summer, England’s contact tracing system was not able to pinpoint those asymptomatic carriers. NHS Test and Trace failed to reach its target of 80% of close contacts of people who tested positive and in some areas tracers only reached half the contacts provided. The testing programme did at least reveal Covid hotspots, Pagel said, which allowed local health teams to act. Yet demand for tests spiked four weeks ago, despite steady increases to capacity, creating a backlog of tests, and many people were unable to be tested at all. “When testing has fallen over to the point that you actually can’t be sure where the hotspots are, because there are places you cannot get a test, then all you have left is to try and stop the whole population mixing,” Pagel added. “It’s a really blunt instrument, but that’s where we are.” So the absence of adequate test-and-tracing equals new lockdowns. NHS trusts are also concerned. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “We’ve been really dismayed by the political response to the challenges and breakdown in implementation of test and trace.” Instead of chasing a target of 500,000 tests for political reasons, it would be more helpful for ministers to acknowledge the issues around capacity, she said.
“To get the NHS back up and running and restoring the whole range of services, we need a way of keeping staff safe and keeping patients safe, and one of those factors is test and trace. We are teetering on the edge of a second wave and it’s very likely that we will fall in. “Restoring services is absolutely fundamental, because we’re coming into winter. Winter often leads to staff shortages because of illness anyway – it’s absolutely critical that teachers and healthcare and care staff are prioritised.” As winter approaches, most scientists are now becoming increasingly worried that the colder weather will force people to spend more time indoors and so trigger rises in Covid infections, while flu and other seasonal illnesses could have further grim impacts. The UK will then have to rely on its much-criticised test-and-trace service as its main disease defence. At the same time, MPs, including many Tories, are increasingly angry that their government is introducing new restrictions without consulting them and allowing them to vote on them in parliament first. This week, on Wednesday, Johnson faces a huge Tory revolt that may force him to ask his MPs for their backing before imposing new rules unilaterally. “He should realise that unless MPs are bound in to his decisions they will not feel they have to support them and promote them to the public,” said a senior member of the influential Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. “That has been a big problem.” The public is losing faith in the government’s ability to manage the crisis, and in Johnson, as the Observer’s Opinium poll, which gives Labour a three-point lead, shows. On a practical level, one suggestion to improve efficiency has been put forward by Prof Rowland Kao of Edinburgh University. “Bulk testing – where more than one sample is tested at the same time then retested separately if a positive result is obtained – has been implemented in many other countries,” he told the Observer. That would give capacity a vital boost, he added. A looming crisis The NHS is now facing a winter crisis like no other. It has been trying to catch up on thousands of cases of cancer, heart disease and other illnesses left untreated during lockdown. And researchers are now becoming aware that Covid’s long-term impact on patients will add further strains on the health service. “It is now thought that 10% to 20% may suffer from ‘Long-Covid’ – a wide range of disabling and life-changing chronic symptoms that affect the young, the old, those that had mild symptoms as well as those with severe symptoms,” said the immunologist Prof Daniel Altmann of Imperial College London. “We need to get to grips with this. It may have unforeseen consequences for quality of life, employment, NHS provision for years to come.” In addition, the threat to the nation’s mental status is now a key concern, added Wykes. “The continuing uncertainty has increased the mental health problems in those who already had problems and it has produced new cases. We need more mental health research and more research on how to gain and maintain community trust.” On the other hand, scientists have learned a great deal about the Covid-19 virus over the past six months and that knowledge should help us over the next six, said Prof Sarah Harper, founding director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. “From surveys we now have good information on the public-health reaction of the British population,” she said. “People have taken on board health information, so long as it is clear and well communicated. Public health information should now be tailored towards individuals, and those who will need specific shielding should be informed directly from their healthcare practice. On the other hand, a blanket shutdown of care homes will lead to unnecessary suffering for older residents. They need better support.” A short-term future of lockdowns and restrictions looks inevitable, added Jeffrey Barrett of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “We’re all exhausted, but there are no other options for the next few months. However, at some point, maybe early next year, we will come out of this wave, and then I think we will reach a turning point. Most importantly, we may have vaccines that are proven to be effective.” On Tuesday, Johnson ended his televised address by saying: “The fight against Covid is by no means over … There are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.” It sounded a familiar refrain. But, strikingly, it was delivered by the man in charge of running the country, setting himself the task of “defeating” Covid-19 with less conviction, and confidence, than before."
2020-09-27T07:15:38Z,politics,Politics,Firms plead for Brexit deal as coronavirus leaves industry reeling,"Almost half of British companies have warned that their Brexit preparations have been hit by the pandemic, as business leaders demanded a last-minute compromise to reach a trade deal and avert chaos at the border. As a crucial week of talks begins, more than three-quarters of businesses (77%) said they wanted a deal to be agreed, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. Only 4% of businesses said they preferred a no-deal outcome. Support for a deal rises to 86% among distribution companies and 83% of manufacturers. Mixed messages have been coming from Downing Street and Brussels over the likelihood of a deal. No 10 had been talking up the possibility of an agreement after months in which no progress has been made – with the chances of a no-deal Brexit significantly increasing. However, Brussels remains concerned that Boris Johnson is showing no willingness to compromise over sticking points such as fisheries and state aid rules. The government’s refusal to withdraw the internal market bill, which threatens to “disapply” parts of the Northern Ireland protocol already agreed by the two sides, continues to pose a major obstacle. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told ministers from the remaining EU countries that there was “a more open atmosphere at the negotiating table” but that “substantial differences of opinion remain”. Businesses are already struggling. The CBI’s latest growth indicator found that private sector activity fell in the three months to September, but at a slower pace than last month: at -23%, compared with -39%. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director-general, pleaded: “Now must be the time for political leadership and the spirit of compromise to shine through on both sides. A deal can and must be made. “Businesses face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges: rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus and preparing for significant changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU. “A good deal will provide the strongest possible foundation as countries build back from the pandemic. It would keep UK firms competitive by minimising red tape and extra costs, freeing much-needed time and resources to overcome the difficult times ahead.” Business concerns have been rising again after warnings about tailbacks at Dover if no deal is reached when the Brexit transition period ends on 1 January. Last week, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said lorries will require a permit to enter Kent in an attempt to stop logjams. He also admitted that in a “reasonable worst-case scenario” only 50% to 70% of large businesses would be ready for new post-Brexit border controls. Meanwhile, there has been continuing fallout from the internal market bill. Ministers have admitted that it breaches international law in a “specific and limited way”. The EU could start infringement proceedings as soon as this week. Hundreds of lawyers have written to their MPs complaining about the move. The Law Society said that 20% of the 5,000 people who have taken part in its Defend the Rule of Law letter-writing campaign were its own members. A Law Society spokesperson said: “We launched a campaign action encouraging people to write directly to their MP about the rule of law and the internal market bill. In just one week, just under 5,000 people contacted their MP through our tool alone, making this one of the largest actions the Law Society has seen.”"
2020-09-27T05:15:35Z,politics,Politics,How Sunak wooed the press and sparked intrigue over No 10 challenge,"The wave of flattering front-page headlines that followed the chancellor of the exchequer’s statement outlining his autumn strategy to tackle the tottering economy screamed out from news stands across the country. What was not known was that the often gushing coverage came after a Treasury mission to win the hearts and minds of national newspaper editors and political columnists at a crucial moment for the Conservative party. Over several socially distanced, strategic breakfast meetings last week Sunak wooed opinion-forming journalists on the right and centre-right of British politics in a smooth operation interpreted by some in the party as a clear challenge to No 10. “There is a great level of despair, not just about the handling of Covid, but also about Brexit, from many of those in the party I am still in touch with,” said Anna Soubry, the former Conservative MP for Broxtowe, who left last year to form the now-defunct Change UK. “And while many of the previously loyal members on the backbenches are understandably fearful about standing up to Johnson in public, it is quite something to see rightwing newspapers so prepared to criticise the prime minister in a time of national emergency.”
Boris Johnson also called in the nation’s press for meetings last week in the run-up to and then in the wake of his grim announcement of the dark winter months to come. But Sunak’s upbeat call for a braver approach seems to have been more persuasive. After the chancellor’s statement on Thursday the Daily Mail proclaimed his “new battle cry” had upstaged the prime minister, whose “cautious, health-focused” briefing on Tuesday had merely alarmed the public. Sunak’s key argument, that the long-term threat to the economy now means the country must learn to live “without fear”, bore a striking resemblance to the words of the newspaper’s own leader the previous day. The Telegraph also splashed its support for the chancellor’s fresh emphasis on finding an affordable path through the pandemic crisis. Even his bleaker predictions of a “more permanent adjustment” to the economy were given a positive gloss. This was an honest, though harsh, “reality check”, readers were told.
At a time when Rupert Murdoch is preparing to launch a television news channel, Sunak’s campaign to gain friends in Fleet Street has been opportune. Rare offers of interview time with the chancellor have cemented the idea that he is the approachable face of an embattled government. “There has been a real attempt to present the sensible face of government, away from all the jokey optimism of Boris’s public statements,” said one executive on a centre-right popular newspaper. While this carefully balanced PR offensive does not add up to treachery, it has done Sunak’s public profile no harm. But the media war has not been the only campaign front for the chancellor. An email sent out from Sunak to Tory party members on Friday called for a positive attitude with the rallying words: “Our lives can no longer be put on hold”. Although a Treasury newsletter does go out each week to membership, the rhetorical tone last week struck a new, personal note. “We were still being told something we did not want to hear, I suppose, but it did feel as if it was a more straightforward argument,” one constituency activist said this weekend. Last week the influential party website Conservative Home also hailed Sunak as “the leading champion of opening up” the economy. This followed the site’s August “cabinet satisfaction ratings” poll, which placed the chancellor at the top, while Johnson, who headed it last December, languished in eighth place. If last week was the opening salvo in a succession race then it comes at a tricky time for Sunak, as many businesses bemoan the end of the national furlough scheme. In response the chancellor’s team cleared his diary quickly as his statement to the nation was brought forward. Sunak, a relative newcomer in parliamentary circles, had to establish relationships with editors from both the Murdoch newspapers and the Mail group before the economic weather worsens. His team is keen to set up direct communications routes, but argues that there is no contradiction with the prime minister’s message. Johnson has set out the journey ahead; Sunak is simply setting the course. His new instruction to walk forward “without fear” through the valley of Covid-19 was always going to be an easier sell to the public than a winter of privations. But the crowd-pleasing packaging of his changes to the summer’s financial lifebuoy is now thought to be worrying cabinet members close to Johnson, as well as those who would align behind Michael Gove in a leadership bid. Soubry sees irony in the fact that Sunak is benefiting from the efforts she believes Gove has made to position himself as the next leader. “Gove is on serious manoeuvres, and someone is giving lots of briefings. There is some nasty stuff being said about Boris and about Carrie. The great problem for Johnson is that many MPs feel they have no access to him or his team. All the Tories I speak to don’t talk about Gove, they talk about Sunak. But the problem is, he’s only been around for five minutes really.”"
2020-09-26T20:00:24Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces revolt over forcing through Covid measures,"Boris Johnson is facing a massive parliamentary revolt over the way he is imposing Covid-19 restrictions on the British people without first consulting MPs – amid new signs that confidence in his leadership is collapsing in the Conservative party and across the country. An extraordinary cross-party backlash against Johnson’s “rule by diktat” from Downing Street was taking shape on Saturday – ahead of a key vote on Wednesday – as a new poll by Opinium for the Observer showed Labour has overtaken the Tories for the first time since Keir Starmer became leader in April. The survey, which will sow more doubts among Conservative MPs about Johnson and his teams in No 10 and the cabinet, puts Labour on 42%, three points ahead – a rise of three points in a fortnight – with Johnson’s party dropping to 39% (down three). Starmer has also pulled well ahead when voters are asked who would make the best prime minister, with 36% choosing the Labour leader (up four points), and 32% preferring Johnson. At the end of March, after the full lockdown was imposed, the Conservatives were powering ahead on 54%, 26 points clear of Labour.
But Johnson is now under intense pressure to beat yet another retreat, this time over how coronavirus rules are agreed and imposed, when, on Wednesday, ministers seek a six-month extension to special powers that allow them to act unilaterally over Covid-19. In a sign of Tory unrest over both the extent of restrictions to counter a second wave of Covid-19 and the way parliament is being bypassed, the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, is winning wider support for an amendment calling for MPs to be allowed to debate and vote upon any new measures before they are implemented. Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats indicated they were seriously considering joining dozens of Tory rebels to back the Brady amendment and rein in Johnson and No 10. For opposition parties to unite behind an amendment put down by a leading Tory backbencher would be highly unusual. But the revolt reflects mounting anger at the way Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, ignore parliament – a feeling that has festered since parliament was prorogued in order to get Johnson’s Brexit deal through the Commons last year. If all the opposition parties support Brady, he would need 43 Tories to defeat the government. At the last count he had 46 on board. It is believed Downing Street, which has ordered Tory whips to take soundings among MPs this weekend, is ready, initially, to order a partial climbdown by agreeing to bring forward a debate on the already introduced “rule of six” from early next month to this week.
But Brady made clear on Saturday evening that this would not be enough and that he will continue to demand debates and votes in parliament in advance of all emergency measures, such as those announced last week which included ordering pubs and restaurants to close at 10pm. Brady told the Observer: “It is essential that the House of Commons should have the opportunity to debate and vote on emergency measures before they come into force.” Another senior Tory, the former cabinet minister Damian Green, who is backing Brady, added: “The principle of parliament having a say on important decisions that affect the lives of everyone in the country is a hugely important one that we should hold to very tightly.” The extent to which faith in Johnson is ebbing away is matched by growing admiration for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, increasingly seen on the Tory backbenchers as more of a unifying figure for the post-Brexit era, and a potential successor to Johnson. Sunak, who on Thursday announced measures aimed at saving jobs as a second Covid-19 wave gathers force, has been conducting charm offensives among backbenchers and newspaper editors in recent weeks. He will address the 1922 committee again next month, sources said. Meanwhile it has emerged that senior Tory MPs on the powerful liaison committee have drawn up a draft letter to Johnson asking that he considers using the army more extensively in the fight against coronavirus – as concerns grow about shortages in testing capacity and manpower.
Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said: “It is paramount that what our armed forces bring to the table is better appreciated during these times of enduring crisis. The Ministry of Defence is the only department trained in strategic planning, crisis management and command and communications. These are the precise skills the government needs to tackle this pandemic. There is frustration both in parliament and the MoD that they are largely confined to barracks.” The Opinium poll also found that Starmer has improved perceptions of the Labour party since becoming leader. Now 40% of voters, up from 36% in July, think the party is ready to form the next government, while 42%, down from 47%, think it is not."
2020-09-26T19:00:23Z,politics,Politics,Labour takes poll lead as parties see major switch in fortunes,"Labour has recorded its first poll lead since Boris Johnson became prime minister, marking an extraordinary change in fortunes for the two main parties. Keir Starmer’s party now has a three-point lead over the Conservatives, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. In a result that will stir more unrest among Tory MPs over the performance of the prime minister, the poll put Labour on 42% support, with the Conservatives on 39%. It is the first Labour lead since early July 2019 – the end of Theresa May’s doomed premiership, when the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party were polling strongly. Labour then recorded a two-point lead.
This represents a rapid reversal. The Conservatives recorded a 26-point lead only six months ago, in the early stages of the Covid-19 lockdown. Approval of government handling of coronavirus then stood at two-thirds (65%) of the public. The latest poll shows only 30% now approve. Starmer now leads Johnson by four points on who would make the best prime minister. More than half of voters (55%) believe he is ready to be prime minister, and 40% believe Labour is ready to form the next government. The underlying polling results suggest that government failings have contributed to Labour’s lead. Starmer’s approval ratings are very similar to those recorded in an Opinium poll a fortnight ago, but Johnson’s approval ratings have dropped since then from -6% to -12%, his lowest since the pandemic began. Half of voters (50%) disapprove of how the government has handled the crisis, and 57% disapprove of how it has handled testing. The public backs the new tough policies announced last week, although 60% think more measures will be needed to stop a second wave. The Lib Dem party has seen no bounce from the announcement of new leader Ed Davey – it is on 5%, down one point from a fortnight ago. Adam Drummond, associate director of Opinium, said: “The Labour Party has finally caught up with its leader in polling. While this is the first time since Boris Johnson became prime minister that Labour has been ahead of the Conservatives on vote share, Keir Starmer has had better approval ratings (both raw and net) than the prime minister for some time and the two leaders have tended to draw on the question of who would be the better prime minister. Now the Labour leader has pulled ahead on that measure as well. “While there is strong public support for the new Covid restrictions announced by the government earlier this week, they have not yet resulted in the sort of boost to the government’s approval rating that the initial lockdown measures brought in March, suggesting that the ‘rally around the flag’ effect was a one-off.” He said the result gave “some credence to those who argue that perceptions of the party leaders are a leading indicator, and that where approval ratings go, vote share follows”. He added: “While Labour spent most of the 2010-15 parliament with a lead over the Conservatives, Ed Miliband generally trailed David Cameron on approval ratings and preferred prime minister. This suggests that Labour’s vote share under Starmer is a little more solid – and is why the other really interesting set of numbers to watch over the next few months will be [chancellor] Rishi Sunak’s.” • The chart in this article was amended on 3 October 2020 to correct the results shown for Greens and Plaid Cymru in the 9 September poll; there was no change in support between then and the 23 September poll."
2020-09-26T18:25:28Z,politics,Politics,"Sunak’s jobs plan ‘harks back to worst of Thatcher’, says Dodds","The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has treated people in low-paid work in the north and Midlands in a way reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher by failing to devise a replacement for the furlough scheme that will save their jobs, his Labour opposite number has said.
In an interview with the Observer, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the new job support scheme (JSS) announced by Sunak would fail to provide employers with sufficient incentives to keep workers on, and leave them facing invidious decisions over who to lay off. The failure to act, and the absence of new measures on training and retraining the UK workforce, risked a period of high unemployment not seen since the 1980s. Dodds said: “The new job support scheme should have incentivised employers to keep more staff on, instead of making it cheaper to pay one person off than bring back two part-time. That risks putting all the pressure on the employer to decide who stays and who goes. “It’s a sink-or-swim mentality that harks back to the worst years of Thatcher. And just like in the 1980s, it’s people on the lowest incomes in the north and the Midlands who will pay the highest price.” She revealed Labour had developed new modelling showing that Sunak’s plan to support companies that keep workers on part-time would, in fact, mean it is far more expensive for employers to retain two employees working half their normal hours, than it is to keep one working full-time. After Sunak won high praise from large sections of the pro-Conservative media for his latest announcement, Labour is keen to highlight what it sees as the devastating effects on employment that ineffective measures will have in so-called red wall seats – those that went Tory from Labour at December’s election. In his statement to the Commons on Thursday, Sunak refused to speculate on how high unemployment might go, but said the JSS – which economists estimate will cost around £5bn, in addition to the near-£40bn spent on the furlough scheme so far – would help keep totals down. Under the plan, an employee will be able to take home a minimum 77% of their full-time wage, even if they only worked one-third of their normal hours, with the Treasury and their employer making up the difference. The Treasury will pay a maximum of 22% of usual wages. The more hours worked, the lower the proportion of wages paid by the government. But critics say the scheme will do nothing to persuade many companies facing financial hardship to hang on to lower-skilled workers. The effectiveness of the scheme was also called into question by the Resolution Foundation. Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said: “The chancellor has rightly sought to combat the coming rise in unemployment with a new scheme to encourage part-time work. But design flaws mean that incentives for firms to use the scheme are weak, particularly in the low-paying, high-turnover sectors like hospitality that are at the centre of the unemployment crisis we face. With small changes the chancellor’s scheme could make a real difference to keeping unemployment down by encouraging firms to cut hours rather than jobs.” Dodds said Labour was calling for a job recovery scheme that would let businesses in key sectors allow staff to work reduced hours, backed by generous subsidies to pay for a proportion of wages for the rest of the week. It would reward firms that brought back more workers part-time, rather than the government scheme Labour says encourages companies to retain some staff full-time and let others go. John Longworth, chairman of the Independent Business Network, said: “Once again the government has demonstrated its lack of understanding both of our economy and the businesses who drive it. The new job scheme is the equivalent of a pay rise for idleness. Much like the furlough scheme, the government is paying people not to work rather than providing incentives for them to work. “For those eligible workers, the new scheme will see the taxpayer stump up 22% of a worker’s salary, while the employer will pay 55%. This is the equivalent of a 22% pay rise for those staff. It’s baffling.”"
2020-09-26T13:15:16Z,politics,Politics,"We lost the Brexit fight – now we must listen to voters, Ed Davey urges Lib Dems","Ed Davey, the new Lib Dem leader, has warned his party that it was “diverted and distracted” by Brexit and must now refocus on voters’ more urgent concerns, as he faces mounting internal demands to formally back rejoining the European Union. Davey said that three poor election results in the last five years demonstrated the party needed to listen to voters again, warning that the Lib Dems had “forgotten that we serve the community, we serve the people”. In an interview with the Observer during the Lib Dem virtual conference, he said the debate around EU membership was over “for the next few years”, adding that it was not the issue being raised by voters he had met during a “listening tour” he began after winning the leadership. Davey lamented the course of the party since its huge loss of support in the wake of joining the coalition government with the Conservatives from 2010-15. He called for a return of the kind of party led by Paddy Ashdown or Charles Kennedy, which would listen to voters’ concerns and “then give a liberal response”. “I think somehow, whether it was the coalition years or recovering from the coalition or because we got – not sidetracked – but we got distracted by the Brexit battle, we’ve forgotten that we serve the community, we serve people. And we have to start with them and their problems, and not start with our particular interests. “We fought the good fight. I was marching on the streets. I was there in the lobbies. I gave it everything. But it’s tragic, we lost that fight.” Asked what he would tell ardently pro-EU members concerned about Brexit, he said: “I’d say that I’m a pro-European. And I’d say that we’re a pro-European party. That isn’t changing. And by the way, the other thing we can’t change is parliamentary arithmetic. “And so what is the challenge now? The challenge is to show that the progressives in British politics are on people’s side. “We are in a bit of a bind. We’ve had three very poor election results, very disappointing, in five years. I’ve got to rebuild the Liberal Democrats. And I’m not going to be diverted and distracted like we were on Brexit. I’m going to focus on rebuilding the Liberal Democrats.”
However, his stance is already being challenged by members. About 700 are said to have signed up to a conference motion to back rejoining the EU “preferably within 10 years”. A similar motion calling on the party to back EU membership in principle will be voted on at the virtual gathering. Davey, who has set out to make the Lib Dems the voice of Britain’s carers, accused the government of damaging the rights of disabled people with its coronavirus laws. He revealed his MPs would vote against the renewal of the coronavirus legislation this week unless the rights of the disabled were protected. The Coronavirus Act relieves councils of some of their legal obligations to provide care should they feel the need to do so in order to cope with the pandemic. “There’s some evidence showing that the pandemic has been hitting disabled people disproportionately,” said Davey, who has a disabled son and cared for his mother as a teenager. “This is a time when they need more care, not less. I can’t stand by, the Liberal Democrats will not stand by, to see disabled people lose their rights, lose the care they need, when they need it the most.” Asked how he now wanted voters to regard the Lib Dems, Davey repeated his leadership election priorities of “a greener economy and a fairer society in a more caring country”. However, the party had to “take some time” in trying to work out what voters are saying. “We’ve got to be humble enough to realise that we weren’t getting our message over.” Davey said the departure of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader would help the Lib Dem revival in seats where it was competing against the Tories. He said the fear of a Corbyn government had hindered the party at the last election. “Corbyn was not helpful to us in our key marginals with the Tories. And the only way we’re going to get Johnson out of No 10 is if Liberal Democrats win more Tory seats, and I’m determined we win many more seats off the Tories.”"
2020-09-26T09:09:10Z,politics,Politics,UK risks losing contract for new climate research centre because of Brexit,"The UK is at risk of losing the contract for the expansion of a flagship European weather research centre based in Reading because of Brexit. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has been based in Berkshire for the last 45 years but its future EU-funded activities are now the subject of an international battle. At stake is a planned new facility with up to 250 jobs, and nine countries – including France, Germany, Spain, Ireland and Italy – are vying for the business. “As a consequence of Brexit, a competition to relocate all ECMWF EU-funded activities from Reading in the UK to an EU member state is taking place during 2020,” an official briefing note from one member state said. ECMWF, which is also a key body for climate-change research, is backed by 34 countries, 22 of them EU member states. In addition to weather forecasting, it operates a number of EU-funded programmes, including two services from the EU’s Copernicus satellite Earth-observation programme, monitoring the atmosphere and the climate crisis. The Copernicus satellites map everything from plankton densities to colonies of penguins in Antarctica to the disintegration of the Spalte glacier in Greenland. Ireland confirmed this week it was bidding to host the new facility, while a Dutch bid to host it in Utrecht has been dropped for financial reasons, a local politician revealed. The battle for the Brexit spoils has echoes of the post-referendum contests over the future of the European Medicines Agency, which moved from Canary Wharf in London along with 900 jobs, and the European Banking Authority, which has moved to Paris because of Brexit. While the UK is keen to see the new facility, which will house up to 250 staff, established alongside the HQ in Berkshire, it is not clear if it will be eligible to bid. One source thought this could depend on whether the UK seals a deal to continue involvement in key EU environment and climate research programmes such as Copernicus after Brexit. The deadline for submissions for the weather centre contract is 1 October, by which time trade talks are not expected to be completed. Reading won the bidding for the weather centre in 1975 because of its proximity to the Met Office (which moved from Bracknell to Exeter in 2003) and the University of Reading. A spokeswoman for the centre said: “This new facility, which unlike the data centre in Bologna, Italy, is mainly about offices rather than hosting our new supercomputers, needs to be in a location compatible with all key European Union’s funding policies relevant for ECMWF. “The UK has expressed an interest in hosting this new facility and is in any case continuing to host our headquarters in Reading,” she said. Bids to host the new offices are expected from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain. ECMWF is considered one of the world leaders in weather research using global datasets of the recent history of the atmosphere, land surface and oceans. It recently showed how the levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air in several European cities had increased as lockdowns were eased."
2020-09-26T06:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: EU citizens in UK could be shut out of vital services,"Thousands of EU nationals could face problems accessing essential services because the government is refusing to issue physical proof of their right to live in the UK. The settlement scheme grants EU citizens the right to remain in the UK after Brexit. Unlike other foreign nationals, they are not provided with a biometric residency permit proving their status. Instead they have to access the Home Office’s online database each time they need to produce evidence of eligibility. The process, which requires applicants to have a smartphone and reliable internet access, is part of a government plan to phase out paper permits and make the entire immigration service digital. But it means those with settled status and service providers have to negotiate a sequence of logins, emails and share codes to confirm their eligibility. And critics claim the challenges of the online system could prevent them accessing jobs, housing and medical treatment. “A lot can go wrong – technology outages, people unable to navigate the digital system and service providers unwilling to engage with it,” says Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the support group the3million, which is campaigning for a paper backup document while the digital system beds in. “We don’t want a two-tier society developing in the UK: British and non-EU citizens who can prove their right to work and access healthcare anytime, anywhere, simply by showing a physical card or passport – and EU citizens who cannot.” Problems are already emerging for people who have attempted to use the new system. Elisabeth Dodds had the offer of a £50,000 home improvement loan rescinded when her bank insisted on proof of her status. “I submitted both a copy of my letter from the Home Office confirming that I had been granted settled status, as well as the share code for checking my status online,” she said. “Royal Bank of Scotland [RBS] refused to accept this information. On advice from a loan adviser, I printed out the Home Office documents, including screenshots from the Home Office website showing I have indefinite leave, and brought it into a bank branch. “This was also rejected. I was variously told they had never heard of settled status and were powerless to change what form of proof they could accept.”
A survey published this month by the3million found that only 14% of companies questioned were clear on the new rules for employing EU citizens after free movement ends in December, while one in five would more readily accept a biometric permit as evidence of status over a digital check. Strict penalties on employers, landlords and banks that fail to verify the immigration status of applicants mean that those unfamiliar with the requirements may err on the side of caution and reject EU nationals. Research by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants shows that only three in 150 landlords would be prepared to perform digital checks on prospective tenants. An EU passport remains valid proof of status until July 2021, but there are concerns about what will happen after that. Dodds, who is American but qualifies for settled status as the spouse of a Swedish national, later secured a loan from another lender that did not require status verification, but fears for the future when EU passports are no longer valid proof. RBS apologised after being contacted by the Guardian. “We would like to reassure customers, and prospective customers, that this was an isolated incident. We should not have rejected this application,” a spokesperson said. Paula Uusnäkki, an EU national, was one of the first to apply for settled status when the scheme was launched in 2018. She received an email confirming her application had been approved, but when she attempted to view her status in June the system had no record of her. “Fortunately, I discovered this before needing to officially prove my status to a landlord or employer,” she said.
Some have found their access to the online service compromised after updating their passport details or address on the Home Office system. Gina Fierlafijn, who is Flemish, never received the promised email confirming that her new passport number had been successfully logged. Her status has been updated but she still has to log in using her expired passport number to access it. “Fortunately I kept a note of it so I do have it for the future,’ she says. ‘This online system seems totally inadequate and I am sure will fail many of us.” Victor Piris has been locked out of his online status after updating his address last month. The Spanish national received the email confirmation that the new details had been logged, but since then a message has informed him that his details don’t match Home Office records when he tries to log in. “This means if I have to prove my rights, I’m unable to do so. What would happen to me if this happens again when the transition period ends?” The government is refusing to change its stance and issue backup permits, despite its own assessment concluding that a digital only service could disadvantage many users. The Home Office said its policy was part of a move to digitalise the entire immigration service. “Physical documents expire, become invalid, or can be lost, stolen or tampered with,” a spokesperson said. “A digital status is more secure and ensures that EU citizens who are granted status in the UK can constantly access and securely share proof of their status. We see no reason why any institution should not accept a migrant’s online information as evidence of immigration status and will be launching an extensive package of communications to ensure individuals, employers, landlords and other third parties are fully aware of the move to digital.” Settled status: how it works
When the Brexit transition process comes to an end on 31 December, people from the EU, EEA or Switzerland who live in the UK will need to apply for settled status to retain their rights to work, use the NHS and claim benefits. The scheme is open and will remain so until 30 June, but anyone applying must be living in the UK by the end of this year. If you have lived in Britain for a continuous five-year period, subject to a few exceptions, you can qualify for settled status. Otherwise, you will get pre-settled status and apply to change this once you have built up five years’ residency. The application is free. Once granted you will be able to work and have access to the NHS and claim pensions and other state benefits if you are eligible. The government’s website is clear that the letter you get emailed to confirm your settled or pre-settled status cannot be used as proof of it. Instead, you can get a share code that you will need to give people, along with your date of birth, so they can go online and see your status. Citizens Advice’s guidance is that until 1 January you should still be able to use your passport or ID card to prove your right to work, rent or access the NHS. “If an employer or landlord asks you to prove your settled status before 1 January 2021, this could be discrimination,” its website advises. After that, local councils, landlords and employers should be able to use the digital process to check your status. Hilary Osborne"
2020-09-26T05:00:06Z,politics,Politics,'Don’t bake in a tent': Boris Johnson's painful week as a punchline,"“We are now approaching phase 46,” waffled Matt Lucas in his best impression of an Etonian drawl, sporting a messy blond wig and a No 10-style podium. “If you must bake in a tent, bake in a tent – but, please, don’t bake in a tent!” This year’s The Great British Bake Off – a comforting haven of buttercream and marzipan in a tumultuous year – opened on Tuesday with a pointed parody of Boris Johnson’s indecision and mixed messaging. Johnson has always used humour as a political tool, to disarm critics and charm the crowd. But the skit cast him less as the joker, more as a joke. The idea that the prime minister is not up to the job appears to have gone mainstream.
This was another week that saw Johnson beset by challenges on all sides. Less than a year after delivering them a thumping majority, he is facing several simultaneous rebellions from his increasingly despairing MPs. The most significant is over the coronavirus. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the voices of scientific authority throughout the crisis, gave a doom-laden briefing on Monday, warning of 200 deaths a day by November if the virus runs unchecked. While Johnson strove for a Churchillian note in his broadcast to the nation the next day, the measures he announced were relatively modest – a 10pm closing time and more widespread mask-wearing – reflecting deep concerns in cabinet about the economic impact of restrictions. As the package of curbs was drawn up Tory whips consulted MPs about which measures they would be likely to support, with some privately saying their message was “this far and no further”. The message from Sage scientists who went public with their concerns on Wednesday, by contrast, was that the government’s actions were too little, too late. Six months on from the clarity of the “stay at home” message, it appeared hard to sustain the idea that policy is being led by the science. The scale of discontent in the Tory party is extraordinary for a government with a thumping majority, so early in its term, and in the teeth of a national crisis. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, has won the support of 46 MPs, most of them Tory colleagues, for his amendment aimed at forcing the government to consult parliament more regularly on its handling of coronavirus. Like many of the parliamentary battles that punctuated Theresa May’s ill-fated premiership, the details are arcane, and the practical impact likely to be minimal – but the symbolic effect is significant. The rebels stretch across the Conservative party, from Damian Green on its One Nation wing to Steve Baker the Brexit-backing “Spartan”, and they are numerous enough to inflict defeat on their own government. All are signalling their concern about the immense powers that have accrued to Downing Street during the pandemic – and the way that Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings have used them. Meanwhile, not all Conservative rebels appear to have been placated by the government’s concessions on the controversial internal market bill, whose critics included May and which is back in the House of Commons next Tuesday. Yet others are incensed at what they see as the anti-democratic nature of the government’s sweeping planning reforms. Johnson’s “friends” briefed the Times last week that he was not enjoying the job of prime minister, beset by money worries without the prop of his £275,000 columnist’s salary and struggling to afford a nanny for baby Wilfred. He was nowhere to be seen in the House of Commons on Thursday as Rishi Sunak announced his winter economic plan – as carefully branded as everything the media-savvy chancellor does. Sunak ended on a rousing note, saying the public could not continue to “live in fear” and “lives can no longer be put on hold”. It was a message that played well among the libertarians on the Tory benches, and seemed to put the ambitious chancellor at odds with cabinet colleagues such as the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Sunak topped the latest poll of cabinet members’ popularity among Conservative members, carried out by grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome. Johnson is now languishing in 17th. Unable to rely on some of the MPs he might have regarded as friends, Johnson is also facing newly aggressive attacks from his traditional political enemies too. In the week of his party conference, Sir Keir Starmer went for him in a manner not seen before. He has moved over the past six months from staunch support for the government’s handling of the pandemic to increasingly pointed criticism of its failings, in particular the shortcomings of test and trace. His online conference speech, broadcast from Doncaster before racing down to London to respond to Johnson’s latest Covid update, was heavy on patriotism and values – and put Johnson on notice that Labour would treat another national lockdown as “a sign of government failure, not an act of God”. Deborah Mattinson of political consultancy BritainThinks, whose book Beyond the Red Wall charts the struggle Labour faces to win back many of the seats it lost to the Tories last December, said Starmer had done a good job with his speech but would ultimately have to flesh out its themes with policy. “He’s got time on his side, but he’s going to have to use that time,” she said. “He talked about patriotism, he talked a bit about himself; but there’s only a certain amount of time you can talk about values, before it just sounds like talk.” Starmer’s determination to stamp his mark on his party – and draw a line under the indiscipline of the Jeremy Corbyn years – was underlined on Wednesday night when he sacked three leftwing junior frontbenchers for voting against a bill on which they had been told to abstain.
Corbyn himself was among the rebels on the overseas operations bill, which the government claims defends services personnel from vexatious prosecutions. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell praised the three sacked Labour rebels, saying they had struck a blow for human rights. The row underlined continuing tensions with the well-organised Corbynite wing of the party, likely to be exacerbated by the imminent publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. In normal times, Starmer might seem to be facing a sea of troubles. But compared to Johnson? With Covid ripping through the country once again, the prime minister will have to decide in the coming days how much it is willing to compromise to secure a Brexit deal before time runs out. Even with a deal, the UK faces the risk of significant economic disruption, in the midst of a deep recession and a public health crisis. And for a prime minister who has become a laughing stock, it looks a very long road to the next general election in 2024."

2020-09-25T16:44:27Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Brussels punctures optimism that deal is in sight,"Brussels has sought to puncture an outbreak of optimism over an imminent Brexit deal, amid fears Boris Johnson has not secured the backing of key advisers and his party for the compromises needed in the final stretch of negotiations. With the UK government yet to offer a way forward on the most contentious issues, and trust in Downing Street at a low ebb, senior EU officials treated with scepticism reports that the UK could see a way to secure a deal. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told ministers from the 27 member states this week that there was “a more open atmosphere at the negotiating table”, according to diplomatic sources in Brussels. But he had also emphasised that “substantial differences of opinion remain, particularly on a level playing field” – the issue of state aid to businesses. While Downing Street is keen to move into intensive “tunnel” negotiations to allow both sides to be creative before emerging at the leaders’ summit on 15 October with a solution to the most intransigent problems, Brussels is not convinced the prime minister yet has the support of his colleagues to commit to what might emerge. “We cannot trust this prime minister’s word, so the EU member states are not yet willing to go blind into a tunnel negotiation and see what happens,” said one source. “It will take more than David Frost [the UK’s chief negotiator] telling us Johnson wants a deal.” When the next round of negotiations opens next week, the EU is hoping Frost will present a compromise proposal on the key issue of control of state aid to businesses. “There is better mood music but no substance yet from London to justify it,” one diplomatic source said.
The UK has insisted it will not go beyond the World Trade Organisation provisions on state aid, which would allow either side to take counter measures where trade had been unfairly distorted – a position that the EU does not believe offers sufficient assurances of fair competition. Barnier had told the EU affairs ministers this week that “recent developments compel us to be more vigilant on enforcement and dispute resolution” in the trade and security deal, according to a senior diplomat. The European council president, Charles Michel, tweeted on Friday: “From now on, we will better enforce the level playing field, in a market open to those who respect its standards. Whether they leave our union or want to move closer to it.” EU leaders will meet at the end of next week to discuss foreign policy issues and to be briefed by Barnier. But sources downplayed any suggestion that the heads of state and government would make a decisive intervention. EU officials were on Friday unsure how to read an article by the political editor of the Spectator, James Forsyth, which said Downing Street could see “a deal is coming into view” and extolling the benefits for Johnson’s premiership. A UK government official rejected the hope of an imminent breakthrough saying “there remains a lot of work to do and either outcome is still possible” warning the EU had to be “realistic” in the coming days. The official said the “differences on fisheries and the level playing field remain significant … if the gaps in these areas are to be bridged, the EU’s more constructive attitude will need to be translated into more realistic policy positions in the days to come.” “Is this them preparing the way for a deal, or to blame the EU for a lack of flexibility,” asked one EU official. “There hasn’t been any major progress in the last informal talks. Maybe there will be a breakthrough but there isn’t anything there yet.” EU officials have suggested that a deal on the further difficult issue of access by European fishing fleets to UK waters would, however, follow if agreement on state aid could be found before the leaders’ summit on 15 October.
One of the key indicators of the progress of the talks will be the future timetabling of the internal market bill and the promised finance bill, which has yet to be tabled. The government intends to publish plans for the progress of the internal market bill, which threatens to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, through parliament at the end of next week. If progress of the bill is slowed down it will be seen as a temporary “removal of the gun from the table”, given the EU has threatened legal action if it has not been stood down by the end of next week, one insider suggested. It is understood that “good progress” was being made regarding checks in the Irish Sea before the internal market bill blew talks off course. If a meeting between the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and his EU counterpart on Monday is successful, it could be used by the UK as a chance to claim “victory” over the EU and row back on the offensive elements of the internal market bill. But the UK is keeping a further card in reserve in the form of the finance bill, which a source said “could look worse than the internal market bill” in terms of the withdrawal agreement’s Northern Ireland protocol, and potentially destabilise the trade and security negotiations. “Whether or not that is published soon will feed into the escalation or the de-escalation, of talks,” said the source."
2020-09-25T16:09:40Z,politics,Politics,"Up to 6m poor families could be £1,000 worse off under Sunak's plan","Rishi Sunak’s failure to announce an extension to more generous help to those on low incomes threatens to leave six million poor households £1,000 a year worse off from next April, a leading thinktank has said. The Resolution Foundation – which specialises in policies to help those on average incomes and below – said it was a “significant mistake” for the chancellor to end the £20 a week boost to tax credits and universal credit. The thinktank said that in some parts of the UK, one in three households would experience losses of £1,000 a year unless Sunak had a rethink and continued with the financial help introduced at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In its analysis of the Treasury’s winter jobs package, the thinktank said design flaws in the new job support scheme meant unemployment was set to rise over the coming months, leaving more people dependent on the benefits system. It said employers had little incentive to top up the wages of those working part time because it was cheaper to employ one full-time worker than two workers on short time. A “major squeeze” on living standards concentrated in those parts of the country with a high proportion of low-income households was likely, it added. The planned withdrawal of the £20-a-week boost to tax credits and universal credit would result in the average income of the bottom half of the population falling by £600, an average calculated by including pensioners and others who would be unaffected by the change. In Scotland, the south of England and the East Midlands, around one in four non-pensioner households were set to lose over £1,000, rising to one in three in Northern Ireland, Wales, the West Midlands, and the North of England.
“With the chancellor’s emergency support reducing, but far from stemming, a major rise in unemployment over the coming months, households now face a squeeze on living standards that they have largely been shielded from so far in this crisis,” the thinktank said. “Those flowing onto universal credit will not only see much large hits to their incomes, but the chancellor yesterday missed the opportunity to avoid a further shock by extending the temporary boost to universal credit beyond March.” It added that the £20 a week boost reflected the fact that out-of-work support was inadequate when Britain entered the crisis and – without the boost – would be inadequate in future. Ending the top-up would mean cutting an estimated £8bn from disposable incomes in 2021-22, hitting those groups and places that needed government help to support spending and the economic recovery in 2021-22.
Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation’s chief executive, said: “With Britain facing a dangerous jobs cliff-edge next month as the job retention scheme winds down, the chancellor has rightly stepped in to announce fresh emergency support to help firms and workers through a tough period of rising infections and rising unemployment. “But while the chancellor has rightly aimed to create a European-style short-hours working scheme, design flaws mean that the new job support scheme will not live up to its promise to significantly reduce the rise in unemployment. Those mistakes could be addressed by scrapping the poorly targeted £7.5bn job retention bonus, and using those funds to ensure the new support scheme gives firms the right incentives to cut hours rather than jobs. “While households have to date been protected from the worst of the economic hit from the pandemic, that is about to change. The coming rise in unemployment will mean a major living standards squeeze for families this winter.”"
2020-09-25T13:58:03Z,politics,Politics,"Diane Abbott: 'Jeremy Corbyn did his best to be nice to people, and they weren't nice back'","Diane Abbott was elected MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington in 1987. We are sitting outside a cafe in her constituency, reminiscing about her fondest memory in politics, which arrived 10 years later: the 1997 general election and the sheer exhilaration of getting the tube, victorious, to Labour’s landslide celebration party in the Royal Festival Hall, strangers shouting congratulations. “What happened afterwards was another story,” she notes with comic grimness. She never even tried to be New Labour and disagreed with Tony Blair on basically every tenet, from privatisation through civil liberties to foreign policy. You would not have called the 66-year-old a radical pinko growing up, though. Her new authorised biography, by Robin Bunce and Samara Linton, tells how she was raised in Harrow in the 50s and 60s, her mother a nurse, her father a sheet-metal worker. They had emigrated in their teens from the same town in Jamaica. She was engaged and analytical, but not a firebrand; certainly, when she was at Cambridge in the early 70s, the vibe overall was anarchic, but she was much more interested in mending the system than smashing it, as her first career move – going to work for the Home Office – attested. But while she did not join the Labour party to be a thorn in its side, she did not find it especially welcoming. She recalls how, when she won her seat in 1987, after displacing the sitting Labour MP, Ernie Roberts, a party officer “turned and looked at me in a very unhappy way and said: ‘Poor old Ernie.’” A few weeks later, a regional officer said, “not in a completely unpleasant way: ‘We had no idea you would win. If we’d known, we would have done something.’” So began her journey in Labour, with broad support in her community and among members of her constituency party, but a lot of hostility from key members outside it. At the start, she notes: “The national party didn’t think it was anything to be proud of, to have elected a black woman.” It was, however, the first time any British party had; she is now the longest-serving black MP in parliament. As Blair’s euphoric victory unfurled, it was into a programme she rarely agreed with. Her rebellion hit its apex when she voted against the war in Iraq, which almost everyone now thinks was a bad idea. At the time, though, it was career death to say so. She could see that she was never going to be in the inner circle, let alone in cabinet. So, in 2003, she started sharing a sofa with the former Tory defence secretary Michael Portillo on BBC One’s current affairs show This Week. It became essential viewing, with the two politicians talking about their parties, and politics generally, with disarming frankness. There was a lot of familiarity and affection between them; they had known each other as teenagers, when they were part of the same am-dram group in Harrow. Had Abbott been more of a centrist, it would have had that nauseating green-room chumminess – Westminster politicians more interested in each other than any cause. Because she was so solidly on the left of the party and she and Portillo were irreverent and maverick in their own ways, it had quite a different vibe, a kind of political Beavis and Butt-Head. Anyway, this was quite a long time ago, but it contains clues to the way Labour – and Abbott – operated in those days. It was always put about that, with this gig, she threw away her political career in favour of a media one. She scoffs at this idea: “The leadership tried to cover itself by saying: ‘Oh, she gave up on the idea of going on the frontbench.’ No. There was never any possibility of me going on the frontbench.” Years later, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, she was not just frontbench material, but the shadow home secretary. Elements of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), unhappy with the party’s change of direction, were particularly hostile to Abbott. Her biography reports: “If the leaked report on antisemitism in the Labour party is to be believed, this faction-fighting targeted Abbott.” Certainly, that is how it came across to the bystander – whenever anyone described a fiery PLP meeting, Abbott was always involved. (In 2015, for example, the MP Jess Phillips claimed to have told Abbott to “fuck off” during a row about women in the shadow cabinet, although Abbott later denied that they had clashed.) Given that almost half of all abusive tweets sent to British politicians in the run-up to the 2017 election were directed at Abbott, the question has to be asked: did the racism and misogyny that motivate the trolls permeate even her own party at various times over the past three decades? She says airily: “It was certainly motivated by prejudice.” Then, laughing, she adds: “In the old days, a lot of members of the PLP were quite outraged that I was on television once a week and they weren’t. It caused a certain amount of bitterness.” Abbott has a pattern, particularly noticeable when you read the biography, of fighting racism as a cause, but either laughing it off when it relates to her personally, or only recognising it much later. That was her reaction to the teacher at Harrow county school for girls who could not believe she had not plagiarised her work; the faceless, endemic prejudice at Cambridge; the completely monocultural Home Office she joined in 1976; the senior Labour MP who, when Abbott became an MP and was making small talk about Christmas, asked if they “practised Christianity” in Jamaica. Prejudice is deadly serious when it relates to others, but, speaking for herself, she would cross the street before she would describe it with anything other than an amused resignation. “I refuse to make white people’s racism my problem. Because you can’t. Because it would destroy you, as a person.”
That is quite a highwire act, given that her life before, within and extramural to parliament has been built around fighting racism: professionally, as a race relations officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties; and as an activist, joining the Scrap Sus (a forerunner to stop and search) campaign and establishing the Black Sections group, “which was the Black Lives Matter of its day. It focused on constitutional issues, having more black MPs and so on. But that’s because, in the 80s, the left tended to fight its battles on constitutional issues.” So you have to defer to her sheer length of experience when she says she does not think racism in public life has surged lately. “There’s a greater volume of racist comment now, but, when I was a brand new MP, if you wanted to send me racist abuse, you had to write it down, probably in green ink, and put it in the letterbox,” she says. “Now you can press a button, anonymously. That’s created a bulk of racist commentary, but racism has always been an issue.” She thinks Black Lives Matter is an inflection point, that people are talking about race in all kinds of quarters – publishing, journalism, business – where they were not before. But she also says, simply: “I think Brexit has poisoned the well.” Ah, Brexit; perhaps more than any other frontbench figure, Abbott epitomised the party’s conundrum. Originally, she was a Bennite – opposed to the EU on grounds of a deficit of democracy and an ascendant corporatism. “We voted against Maastricht [the 1992 treaty that strengthened EU institutions and seeded the establishment of the euro]; we voted against everything that furthered EU integration.” Nevertheless, she recognised the leave project as a rightwing, xenophobic pitch – or, as she put it: “I started to be concerned about the little Englander aspect of the anti-EU campaigning. To be fair to Tony Benn, he was never a little Englander.” Plus, she listened to her constituents – they leaned strongly remain – and campaigned for Labour In during the referendum. I suppose what I am looking for – now that all is lost, we are out of the EU, the Corbyn project is over and the Conservatives have emerged with the spoils – is frankness. What has she got to lose? Did she try to push Corbyn to take a remain position, given that it was her position? Does she think the party could have succeeded in winning the 2019 election, had it done that? To what does she attribute the deflation of faith in and enthusiasm for Labour between 2017 and 2019? She will give away a bit, but not much: “I said, in meetings of the shadow cabinet on this, you people cannot divide Jeremy from his base and his base is pro-remain.” So, perhaps in a roundabout way, she was arguing privately for Labour to take an explicitly remain position, given that was where its members were. But she emphatically will not chalk up the 2019 election result to the position – “strategic ambiguity” is the kindest term for it – it took instead. Rather, she blames a media that she says constantly pilloried Corbyn: “It was just relentless. I’ve never seen anything like it.” She then adds, in a sideswipe at Change UK: “Then they did this SDP thing – and just like the SDP they were never going to be an alternative party of government; they just helped the Tories to win.” (For the younger reader, in 1981, some big beasts of Labour split to form the Social Democratic party, in protest at Labour’s leftwards direction.) Even before the last election, these arguments were in play – had Corbyn erred, or just been victimised into oblivion? – but so much has happened since then, and I am not even talking about the global pandemic. Two books have been released this month telling the “inside story” – Left Out, by Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire, and Owen Jones’s This Land – which paint a picture of an ever-decreasing circle around the leader, an atmosphere so bunkered that even a soldier as loyal as Abbott could not get on with the inner team and she and Corbyn’s head henchperson, Karie Murphy, were vowing revenge upon one another. Abbott has no wish to set this record straight, saying only: “There are some accounts of events which are clearly refracted through people’s wish to go down well in history.” I can see the merit of that point, but I think, too, that she would go down better in history if she would reveal even a fraction of her inside story, a glimpse of her reflections. Instead, she draws a straight line between the so-called “chicken coup” in 2016, when Owen Smith challenged for the leadership, and any problem the project may have had subsequently; brooks no real difference between 2017 and 2019; and acknowledges no flaw beyond the fact that the leader was a “fundamentally nice person”. “He did his best to be nice to people, to put his arms around them, and they weren’t nice back. And poor Jeremy was really shocked. Because he had never had power before, so there was never any reason for people not to be nice to him. Dismissive, maybe, but not not nice.”
At this point, we are both sort of laughing, because the language is so … well, playground. She makes another run at the point: “People can criticise Jeremy now, but he held together a coalition – Bennites, people who were greens, people who were trades unionists, all those new people that came in under his leadership – he held it all together.” Oh come on, I say: what Momentum member was not also green? What Bennite was not pro-trade unions? He held together a coalition of people who agreed with him – and he only held that together until the referendum. “It’s very easy to look at it from a purely Westminster bubble,” she says. God, but she is loyal. Even of Keir Starmer, whom she is pretty salty about (“He had this great video at the beginning of the campaign which, if you didn’t know anything about him, would make you think he was at the heart of every left movement since the miners’ strike”), she settles on the line: “He won the leadership fair and square and you’ve got to respect the mandate.” The biography goes into some incredible detail (her sixth-form essays get quite a close reading) and yet huge things happen in her personal life – her parents divorcing, her own divorce and all the scrutiny there was over the decisions she made as a single mother, such as sending her son to a fee-paying school – that are skated over in a couple of lines. “It’s a political biography,” she says, brusquely. “It wasn’t that kind of book.” Which is fair enough, but, when it comes to carving your image in the cliff face of your party, it is convention to give some part of yourself away, some politically irrelevant but personally meaningful detail. The pessimist’s reading is that, having had such a rough ride – never mind the abuse on social media; I think the regular media was far more unfair to Abbott than it ever was to Corbyn – she has taken a decision not to disclose anything. The optimist’s reading is that she does not want to be an éminence grise, sacrificing her attitude for the sake of nostalgic affection. She won’t go softly into that good night. She is going to carry on raging like the pain-in-the-arse backbencher she never left behind.

2020-09-25T11:40:08Z,politics,Politics,UK considering outright ban on fur sales after Brexit,"Fur sales could be banned after Brexit under plans being considered by the Department for Environment, it has emerged. The UK was the first country in Europe to ban fur farming in 2000, but sales of some furs are still legal in this country and across the EU. The move to an outright ban is reportedly being spearheaded by the Tory peer Zac Goldsmith, minster at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and also a close friend of Boris Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who last year described anyone who wanted to buy fur as “really sick”. Once the UK leaves the single market, it will have the power to unilaterally ban fur sales, something it is now considering. A spokeswoman for Defra said: “We have some of the highest welfare standards in the world, and that is both a source of pride and a clear reflection of UK attitudes towards animals. “Fur farming has rightly been banned in this country for nearly 20 years. Once our future relationship with the EU has been established there will be an opportunity for the government to consider further steps it could take in relation to fur sales.” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has been campaigning against fur sales for decades, says hundreds of fashion designers and brands – including Coach, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren and Versace – have already stopped using fur. Peta helped changed the face of activism using nudity and gore to get its message across. Many of its adverts were banned but its slogan “I’d rather go naked than wear fur”, used in campaigns featuring celebrities including the model Naomi Campbell, the actor Eva Mendes and the musician Pink, had such resonance it survived for more than three decades before being retired this year. According to reports, Goldsmith met the anti-fur organisation Humane Society International in May to explore the issues around the fur trade. Government sources said that during the Brexit transition period, which ends on 31 December, “it is not possible to introduce restrictions relating to the fur trade as this would restrict free movement within the EU single market”. But once Brexit happens, “there will be an opportunity for the government to consider further steps it could take in relation to fur sales”. Goldsmith argued that Brexit meant “whatever barriers may have prevented us from raising standards on imports at the point of entry” would have gone. The British Fur Alliance is gearing up to fight any move to ban sales, arguing that natural fur is an antidote to the environmentally damaging cheap fashion and if ethically sourced should not be prohibited. “Natural fur is inextricably linked to the environment: it is a sustainable material which represents heritage, quality and individuality. Environmental stewardship is one of the foundations of the contemporary fur trade and fur is part of the solution to the ‘fast’ fashion problem,” it said."
2020-09-25T11:00:45Z,politics,Politics,Liberal Democrat conference: the issues on the table,"The Liberal Democrat conference begins on Friday – and like all such events this coronavirus-struck year, it is an online-only affair. There is plenty to discuss for a party currently bumping along at below 10% in the polls, and on to their third leader in little more than a year. These are some issues which are likely to be on the minds of members.
Europe It was just a year ago that Jo Swinson pledged to unilaterally rescind Brexit if she became PM – a decision that helped contribute to what an internal party report later called “a high-speed car crash” election campaign. This year, a front bench resolution bemoans the government approach to Brexit, but rather than explicitly calling for resumed European Union membership, says only that the party will “keep all options open”. This is not sufficiently pro-EU for some, so expect vigorous debate and amendments seeking to toughen up the wording. One dissenter in the party said: “If we don’t talk about resuming EU membership, it could be lost altogether as an issue.” Healing wounds While Ed Davey beat Layla Moran quite convincingly to become the party’s permanent leader in August (he had undertaken the job on an interim basis since Jo Swinson lost her parliamentary seat in December), the battle was sometimes fractious, with one Lib Dem source calling it “nasty”. The differences between the pair were not insignificant, with Moran seeking to shift the party more to the left, shaking off associations with the 2010-15 coalition with the Conservatives in which Davey was energy secretary. Davey’s allies in turn said Moran’s approach would lose the Lib Dems votes from former Conservatives. But as another senior member said: “We’re Lib Dems. We always fall out badly over things like this, but then make it up again quickly.” Getting noticed The conference is not only virtual, it is being held amid the competing news cacophonies of coronavirus and Brexit, something which, as Labour found this week, means it is hard to make an impression on the news bulletins.
This is particularly acute for the Lib Dems, who are trying to effectively relaunch their party, and with a leader who is simultaneously new to the job but has also been an MP for 23 years. The hope is for Davey to be able to introduce himself to the nation, using his personal story as a long-time carer (to his mother when he was a child, and now to a disabled son) to present the party as standing up for carers. But insiders accept it will be tough to break through. One said: “In fairness, probably the best we can hope for is 30 seconds of Ed on the six o’clock news.” Finances With their last-ditch bid to stop Brexit, and following a string of high-profile MP defections, the Lib Dems were awash with cash ahead of December’s election – in the second half of 2019 they brought in nearly £17m in donations, more than Labour. But a calamitous result which saw predictions this time last year of 100-plus seats turn out to be just 11, many donors have fled, and the party must prepare for Scottish, Welsh, London and English local elections next May. Some insiders say the lack of cash has left volunteers to take up the slack, with inevitable errors in areas such as vetting, after one potential London mayoral candidate was dropped over antisemitic comments. One party figure said the outcome of the bet-the-mortgage approach to December’s election had caused lasting problems: “When you bring in big names like Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, spend loads of money, and you still can’t get them elected, it’s quite an ask to go back to donors and say, ‘Come on, we need you again.’”"
2020-09-25T10:02:19Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings' data law shake-up a danger to trade, says EU","A radical “pro-tech” plan championed by Dominic Cummings to rewrite Britain’s data protection laws is endangering future cooperation with the EU worth billions to the British economy, Brussels has warned. The government’s newly published national data strategy, promising a “transformation” long sought by Boris Johnson’s chief adviser and the former Vote Leave director, has sparked concern at a sensitive time with the continued flow of data between the UK and EU member states in question. The European commission is currently examining whether the UK’s data laws will be in line with the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR) and law enforcement directive after 1 January 2021, allowing the movement of data vital to the law enforcement agencies but also the banking, health, entertainment, insurance and tech sectors. Downing Street hopes that positive “adequacy” decisions can be made by Brussels before the end of the year when the transition period ends. The government estimates that EU exports to the UK of data-enabled services were worth approximately £31bn in 2017 while UK exports of data-enabled services to the EU were worth around £80bn in 2017. But EU sources said the government’s consultation paper published on the same day as the controversial internal market bill had exacerbated existing concerns over the UK’s approach at the end of the transition period. Amid the uncertainty, on Friday British officials were due to explain the intentions behind the government’s stated pledge in its strategy paper to remove “legal barriers (real and perceived)” to data use, encourage international sharing and deliver a “radical transformation of how the government understands and unlocks the value of its own data”. EU officials said the two key issues standing in the way of a positive decision were the use of data by the UK intelligence services and the potential “onward flow” to countries such as the US. “While the UK applies EU data protection rules during the transition period, certain aspects of its system may change in the future or be implemented in a manner that differs from the approach of the EU such as rules on international transfers,” an EU official said. “These aspects therefore raise questions that need to be addressed.” The official added that there was particular concern over the future rules “governing access to data by UK national security authorities” in the light of a recent ruling by the European court of justice. In July, the Luxembourg court made the transfer of personal data to the US from the EU almost legally impossible due to the intrusive nature of surveillance programmes undertaken by the US intelligence agencies and the lack of redress for EU citizens. Brussels is expected to seek assurances that the UK will recognise the implications of the ruling on its own treatment of European citizens’ personal information. Legal challenges to an adequacy decision would be expected in Brussels should the British government fail to offer failsafe safeguards, EU sources said. Ross McKenzie, a partner at the Addleshaw Goddard law firm, said the government was “walking a tightrope” by indicating the desire to make a major move away from the EU’s “gold standard” GDPR while also seeking to illustrate that it was in line with its regulatory intentions. He said: “It is a surprise to me that the government has been so bold in the strategy paper. The European commission will be thinking: ‘What on earth do you want to change?’ But the UK cannot be a world-beating data economy unless we have ‘adequacy’.” Two years ago, Cummings, who championed vast data collection by the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum campaign, described the EU’s GDPR as “horrific”.
“One of the many advantages of Brexit is we will soon be able to bin such idiotic laws,” Cummings wrote. “We will be able to navigate between America’s poor protection of privacy and the EU’s hostility to technology and entrepreneurs.” “Those comments haven’t gone unnoticed,” said one diplomatic source. Without a GDPR adequacy decision, businesses will be forced to organise individual agreements, known as standard contractual clauses. Industry insiders say the extra costs will be crippling for many small and medium-sized enterprises. A government spokesman said: “We are a global leader, committed to high data protection standards. Protecting the privacy of individuals will continue to be a UK priority. The EU’s adequacy assessment ascertains whether UK data protection standards are ‘essentially equivalent’ to the EU’s.”"
2020-09-25T09:20:57Z,politics,Politics,Plaid Cymru sets out possible roadmap for Welsh independence,"A â€œlandmarkâ€� report setting out a possible roadmap towards independence in Wales has been launched by the nationalist party Plaid Cymru. The report argues that only independence can bring a fundamental improvement to the Welsh economy, claiming the country struggles not because it is too small or poor but because it is â€œtrappedâ€� within an economy shaped in the interests of the City of London. It says the views of Welsh people should be tested in an â€œinitial exploratory referendumâ€�, setting out constitutional options, followed by a second binary referendum that could lead to independence. Plaid Cymru has been buoyed by polls suggesting that support in Wales for independence is on the up. The Labour-led Welsh governmentâ€™s handling of the Covid crisis is also believed to have boosted the idea that Wales could go it alone and might be better off if ties were cut with the UK government.
The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, who commissioned the report, said: â€œSomething is happening in Wales. Support for independence is at the highest it has ever been. Our nation is on the march and people are waking up to the idea that independence is possible.â€� The commission was chaired by another senior Plaid figure, the former MP Elfyn Llwyd, who argued that devolution meant Wales was on a â€œjourney to independenceâ€�. He said: â€œThere are lessons to be learned from Ireland, formerly one of the most peripheral and poorest parts of the UK. It is now a confident, self-assured independent nation, one of the richest parts of these isles, with a seat at the United Nations.â€� Though Wales voted in favour of Brexit, the commission claims that the â€œlong-term destinyâ€� of an independent Wales should be as a full member of the EU. It makes it clear that the â€œcold turkeyâ€� of a break with the UK would be difficult financially. But it argues that nations with small populations such as Ireland, New Zealand and Denmark can prosper. The report says: â€œAs the Covid-19 crisis has shown, in terms of managing the spread of the virus these countries have done better than such scientific powerhouses as Britain and the United States. â€œIn this crisis, strong and consistent political leadership, and good on-the-ground public health systems, have been as important in managing the outbreak as world-leading epidemiologists, virologists, medical researchers, statisticians, and disease modellers. In other areas, too, small nations can be nimble, and can try different approaches.â€� The report may turn out to be academic. Before Plaid Cymru can push ahead with moves towards independence, it must win power in Wales. The latest Welsh barometer poll suggested the party is on course for 15 seats at next yearâ€™s Senedd election behind Labour (25 seats) and the Tories (19). The Welsh Liberal Democrats described the report as â€œa mix of fanatical politics and pie in the sky economicsâ€�."
2020-09-24T19:26:32Z,politics,Politics,'Who knows what's around the corner?' Bolton and Crawley react to Sunak's plans,"Bolton: ‘It feels like we’ve been forgotten about’ When Rishi Sunak announced his winter jobs programme on Thursday, he will have had ”red wall” constituencies such as Bolton North East in mind. One of the most marginal seats in the UK, after the Conservatives ousted Labour by just 378 votes in December, Covid has hit this part of Greater Manchester hard, with the town currently subject to stricter lockdown measures than anywhere else in the country. Unemployment here increased by 70% between March and August, with 10% of the working age population – 6,040 people – now out of work. That number is expected to rocket after Boris Johnson warned it could be six months before life returned to anything resembling normality.
For 20 years, as a small business owner in the Tonge area, Gail Hounslea prided herself on never making staff jobs redundant and never taking on debt. Covid changed all that. During lockdown her company, which sells industrial ladders to everyone from WH Smith to DHL, took on a £50,000 government “bounce back” loan. And last week, with sales still no more than 70% of normal, she made the “heartbreaking” decision to let go of two of her 14 employees. If Sunak had announced the job support scheme sooner, maybe those jobs could have been saved, she mused on Thursday. “But it’s hard to say, isn’t it? Quite a lot of what he announced comes as a relief – it will be good to not have to pay back the loan so soon and being able to suspend VAT payments is helpful, too. But ultimately that relief could be short-lived: who knows what is around the corner?” She also worried where the money was coming from: “I worry for future generations having to pay this off.” Down the road, at her German pretzel bakery, Angelika Searle insisted people fretted too much about the short-term cost of such measures. “Why doesn’t anyone say that if you don’t help people to keep their jobs, the state will have to pay their benefits, potentially for a long time?” she asked.
Having moved to Bolton 14 years ago from her native Bavaria, she keeps a close eye on her Mutterland, comparing and contrasting the approach of Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson. The latter, she insisted, was “a showman” who could not be trusted to lead: “I wouldn’t trust him to look after my dog.” Searle herself has had a good crisis. She did a roaring trade selling flour in the early days of lockdown, and takings have tripled. But she worried about others less fortunate and thought Sunak was wise to take inspiration from Germany’s Kurzarbeit system, which subsidies workers’ wages during the hard times: “Self-worth in this country is so linked in with your job and how much you get paid. If that falls away, you have huge problems with mental health.”
Andrew Graham has been another Covid winner. As a self-employed kitchen and bathroom fitter, he has just one slot left before Christmas. A former Labour voter, he said Johnson had done a great job: “If Corbyn had got in we would have fallen off the face of the earth. There would have been a big black hole and it would have swallowed us all up if he had been in power.” At Sew Sure, an alterations and dry cleaning company, Gillian and James Fitness were scraping by. With takings rarely more than £1,000 a week and £350 wages and £140 rent to pay, margins are tight. But they refuse to put up their prices – Gillian never charges more than £9 to shorten a pair of jeans – and insisted they would only take Sunak’s money if they needed to. “We certainly won’t claim anything we don’t need,” said James. “I think the government has already been very generous. The opposition has a duty to complain about it, but we have nothing to compare it to. Well done Boris.”
Others felt altogether more gloomy, such as Paul Roberts, better known locally as DJ Demon, who hasn’t earned a penny since March and is scraping by on universal credit. For the past two years, his steady gig has been a residency at the Swan pub in Bolton town centre, which, like all pubs in town, is currently not allowed to open at all because of the local lockdown. With weddings cancelled or guest lists curtailed so severely that there is no hope of filling a dancefloor, Roberts is getting increasingly pessimistic. “I just can’t see my business coming back at all,” he said. “It feels like we have been forgotten about.” Crawley: ’You can feel that things are really bad here’ As a part-time librarian, Zoe Hopkins had been one of the lowest paid among her tight-knit group of seven friends, but now she is among the better-off, as five of them have had their roles made redundant or furloughed since the pandemic struck in March. Although she is still working, Hopkins, 45, faces the cold reality of unemployment and furlough more than most. “It is the library that people turn to when they have nowhere else to go and don’t know what to do,” Hopkins said on her lunch break from work at the library in Crawley, West Sussex, which according to the latest government statistics is the local authority area with the third-highest proportion (37%) of people on the coronavirus job retention scheme – widely referred to as furlough.
“You can feel that things are really bad here [in Crawley],” she said. “People come in to apply for universal credit because they don’t have computers at home, or just to ask for advice, because everything the government says is so complicated and it keeps changing.” Crawley is suffering more than other places due to its reliance on Gatwick airport, three miles to the north. “Some of my friends are cabin crew and pilots, and they have all been made redundant or placed on furlough,” she said. “And it’s not just the people that directly work in travel. Loads of jobs here are dependent on the airport. There’s all the hotels, and cleaners and service industries. You can just feel that the fallout is only just starting and it’s going to get so much worse.” Hopkins said she was unimpressed with the government’s new “viable” job support scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme at the end of October. The government will pay 22% of workers’ wages if they work at least one-third of their regular hours. Their employers should pay 55% of their wages. “I absolutely think the government should be doing more to help,” she said.
However, James Taylor, an air conditioning engineer, said Sunak’s new scheme was “sensible” as it would end “zombie jobs”. “Everyone knows a lot of people on furlough are probably never going back to their jobs, and companies are just keeping them on because the government are paying a lot of the wages,” he said. “Under this [new scheme], it sounds like it will only be the jobs that have a real chance of continuing that will be paid for.” Taylor, who was furloughed at the beginning of the first lockdown, said: “You can’t have people sitting at home not knowing forever.” Pavel Sztachelski, a tattooist at Studio 13 in the town centre, said his parlour had only just been able to reopen and that there was far less work than before lockdown, as his clients had lost their jobs or returned to their home countries. “So many jobs here were reliant on Gatwick, and the airport is basically dead now,” he said. “People in Crawley work as cabin crew, or cleaning and engineering, and now there are no jobs in Crawley. Many people came here from abroad to work, but now they have gone home for good.”
Tachelski, 39, said that if there was a second full lockdown, his tattoo parlour would go bust and “join the high street of boarded-up shops”. “We just can’t afford it, we will go bankrupt.” It was a similar story at Naz Barber’s on The Broadway. “It’s dead, the shop is dead, Crawley is dead,” Nazime Bendjabar, the owner and head barber said while giving a customer an extreme fade. “We’ve gone from four or five barbers to just two.” Glynis Moss, a bra fitter at Debenhams, is back at work after three months on furlough but said she was lucky, as many of her colleagues were still on furlough or had had their jobs made redundant. “I’m only back because I’m one of the people who work on Sundays,” she said.
Moss said she wished Sunak had begun the new job support scheme earlier, as she thinks it would have prevented some redundancies if companies knew it were coming. “Companies knew that the furlough scheme was going to end, so they made people redundant, but actually we need people on part-time hours for weekends and Christmas,” she said. Moss said her household didn’t rely on her salary before the crisis, but she was now one of two in work compared with four beforehand. “My husband’s work has dried up, and my son-in-law has been made redundant [from a job at Gatwick],” she said. “Now it’s just me and my daughter, who is working from home.” She worried that the department store would close down before she reached retirement. “This used to be one of the most profitable stores; we did well from people from the airport, especially in luggage,” Moss said. “We did have one of those clickers counting people in and out of the store [so numbers would remain within social distancing guidelines], but we gave up as there were never anywhere near enough people.”"
2020-09-24T18:29:10Z,politics,Politics,Sunak warned winter economy plan not enough to stop wave of job losses,"Rishi Sunak’s winter economy plan will not be enough to stop a wave of redundancies unless hard-hit industries such as hospitality and the arts receive further support, the government has been warned. After cancelling the budget, Sunak announced a series of measures on Thursday, including a new wage subsidy scheme, to support jobs. They received cautious applause from several major trade bodies and business lobby groups. But the UK chancellor also faced accusations of abandoning millions of freelancers and whole sectors of the economy such as nightclubs, live music venues and theatres, that cannot access wage subsidies because they are not allowed to reopen. Sunak’s plans included a long-awaited replacement for the furlough scheme that will see the government and employers share the cost of paying wages. July’s VAT cut for hospitality – from 20% to 5% – will be extended to the end of March, while struggling businesses will get longer to pay back government loans. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the UK’s leading business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), praised Sunak for “bold steps” that she said would preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs through the winter. She insisted that 2021 could be a year of “growth and renewal” as a result. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the plan was a “shot in the arm” for businesses. But the measures were not met with universal optimism. The Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders who will be making hiring and firing decisions over the coming months, said it was “not yet clear how much the job support scheme will help hard-pressed firms hold onto staff”. The IPPR thinktank said the time taken to come up with the plan had already cost thousands of jobs and the measures did not go far enough.
IPPR’s executive director, Carys Roberts, said the plan “does not support businesses enough to prevent layoffs, and will be cold comfort to firms that are fundamentally viable but can’t operate at all due to local or sector restrictions.” Hospitality has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and multiple trade bodies had warned earlier this week that a quarter of the UK’s 100,000 pubs, bars and restaurants could close, with the loss of 675,000 jobs, unless they were given sector-specific support. The sector includes thousands of businesses, including small city-centre pubs and nightclubs, that are unable to reopen or are not permitted to do so, and are therefore unable to make use of wage subsidies. Speaking after Sunak’s announcement, which included an extension of the VAT cut on food, UK Hospitality’s chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said the chancellor needed to provide more support for a sector that was “not out of the woods”. “Things were looking grim for our sector yesterday and we were desperately hoping for some good news,” she said. “The chancellor has given us some reason to be positive again, but we urge him to engage with the trade on specific measures to keep people in work. “We need government to go further in hospitality, recognising the greater restrictions imposed upon us, and pick up the full cost of unworked hours,” she said. “This would be a relatively low cost for huge reward for our workforce. Full support to sustain people in their jobs during what could be a pretty bleak winter for hospitality would be a great step forward.” Sunak was also accused of letting freelancers slip through the cracks, particularly those working in creative industries such as theatre, where venues remain closed and are therefore also unable to tap into government wage subsidies. “The job support scheme may help some employers, but it will not help to save theatres that are still not able to open due to government restrictions and are already making thousands of workers redundant,” said Philippa Childs, head of creative industries union Bectu. “The army of freelancers and self-employed who make up the backbone of the UK creative industries face being excluded from support once again as the chancellor continues to turn a deaf ear to their hardship,” she said. “Without more support the UK creative sector will not get through the winter, we desperately need a targeted plan to save jobs and ensure that one of the most productive parts of our economy can survive the winter.” Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the culture select committee, said workers in the industry had been left facing a “grim future”. Three million people who were left out of the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) will also not benefit from the new measures, according to law firm Blick Rothenberg. “For a Conservative government which is meant to support entrepreneurship, it appears illogical to continue ignoring such a large number of workers,” said director Robert Salter. SIBA, the trade body for independent breweries, said its members had not had access to business grants and warned that the continued exclusion of alcohol from the VAT cut would further hurt them and the “wet-led” alcohol-focused pubs they sell to."
2020-09-24T17:27:36Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: record 6,634 new cases reported; chancellor announces job support scheme – as it happened","The UK has recorded 6,634 new coronavirus cases - its highest daily total since the pandemic began. Public Health England has said this increase should be â€œa stark warning for us allâ€�, but it does not mean that the spread of coronavirus in the community is anything close to what it was at the peak in early spring because far more testing is taking place now, and so far more positive cases are being picked up. But the pace of rise â€“ todayâ€™s total is almost 500 higher than yesterdayâ€™s â€“ will be seen as justification for the tighter restrictions announced around the UK this week. (See 5.31pm, 5.34pm and 5.51pm.) The government will cover almost a quarter of pay for workers in â€œviableâ€� jobs for the next six months, Rishi Sunak said as he outlined plans that will take over from the furlough scheme when it finishes at the end of October. Lockdown sceptics in the Conservative party have heralded comments by the chancellor saying that Britons must learn to live â€œwithout fearâ€� and highlighting the importance of human contact and social interaction. The UK has a comparatively high test capacity but is failing to use it efficiently in tackling Covid-19, researchers say, raising concerns including a lack of follow-up and adequate financial support of those isolating. NHS Test and Trace is still failing to meet key targets, its latest performance data shows. (See 2.55pm and 5.04pm.) More than 40 MPs have now signed an amendment to a motion being debated next week saying MPs should in future get a chance to vote on Covid restrictions. Since March almost all the regulations used to enforce the lockdown, or impose other coronavirus-related rules, have been imposed via secondary legislation, with MPs having no chance to block them before they take effect. This is from the Tory MP Steve Baker.
Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronvirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-09-24T17:15:13Z,politics,Politics,Semi-viable leader offers up furlough-lite. Debt collectors may apply,"For an hour or so it felt like there was an adult running the country. Or as close as we’re likely to get to one in the Conservative government during the coronavirus pandemic. It might still all be an illusion, of course. When Boris Johnson gives a Commons statement, he invariably sounds as if he is winging it: the measures he announced on Tuesday seemed relatively trivial when compared to Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance’s briefing the day before. Only this morning we had the “not nice but dim” Suella Braverman calling Labour’s Ellie Reeves “emotional” for supporting the rule of law. It’s so last year for an attorney general to uphold the law. Now it’s entirely possible that much of Rishi Sunak’s new bailout package was also knocked up at the last minute. After all, he abandoned his planned autumn budget at short notice and he was cutting it fine to announce his new policies before the furlough scheme ends at the end of next month. But the chancellor has the important gift of sounding serious and credible. And if it all turns to shit, at least it will have been nice while it lasted. Not that Sunak’s statement to the Commons didn’t have a few echoes of Boris-like mindless optimism at the start, when he observed that we were in a far better position now than we had been back in March. The neutrals might reckon that we have done our best to waste whatever advantages we might have had in the spring by reacting far too late to the crisis, by emptying hospitals into care homes, failing to provide PPE and putting in place an entirely inadequate test-and-trace system. All of which had put the UK near the head of the mortality ratings. You might also point to the chancellor’s “eat out to help out” scheme in August as having contributed to the new restrictions that have had to be put in place. But Sunak has credit in the bank – if not in the Bank of England – for having put in place the imaginative furlough scheme that was more generous than many expected, so most MPs on all sides of the house are prepared to cut him some slack and give him a fair hearing. So having got through the opening “reasons to be cheerful”, the chancellor cut to the chase. The furlough scheme had run its course – aka it was far too expensive to continue longer than the few months the government had anticipated – so to prevent millions of people from falling into a financial black hole he was now going to introduce the job support scheme. Or furlough-lite, as one of its unspoken agendas was to save the exchequer billions. Workers in viable jobs would be paid in full for working a third of their hours, with the government and employers splitting a further chunk of their salary. The worker would have to take the 23% hit to their earnings. In essence, it was much the same as the scheme Germany had introduced, only the Germans were running it for two years. Rishi was hoping we would be back to normal in six months: even he can’t help still believing in Boris, even though he knows it’s almost certainly bollocks. After rushing through various other schemes – some more help for the self-employed, deferred “pay as you go” interest payments for businesses that were already broke, and extended VAT relief for hospitality companies that were effectively dormant – and closing with a hymn to living rather than existing, Rishi sat down with a look of triumph on his face. He had pulled a rabbit out of the hat yet again. He was the man who would be seen to have tried to restart a near stagnant economy and the best thing about it was that no one would yet have any clue if it was going to work. So he could survive virtually unchallenged. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, did point out that she had called for similar measures on 40 previous occasions, but Sunak just casually dismissed her for never having had a Plan A. Which was some cheek coming from a man who was inventing economic policy on the fly. But by and large, he got away with it because both Labour and Tory MPs were just grateful that he was at least doing something that sounded as if it was vaguely plausible and right now no one is capable of thinking more than six months ahead anyway. Sunak did get a slightly harder ride from journalists at the Downing Street press conference. He couldn’t totally explain what was and was not a viable job – some jobs that are not viable now may be so again in a year’s time – nor was he prepared to commit himself to retraining budgets. Other than saying it would be nice if more people started new businesses. Presumably as debt collectors. More worryingly, the chancellor proved himself to be in need of remedial maths when it was pointed out that it could work out cheaper for an employer to take on one worker full-time than two workers part-time. Nor would he commit himself to how many unemployed people he expected there to be by Christmas, how much his policies would cost or what he would do if there was another national lockdown or the crisis lasted well beyond next March. Those were all problems for another day. All that really mattered was that he had survived the day with his reputation for competence more or less intact. Which is about as good as it gets for a cabinet minister right now."
2020-09-24T16:42:18Z,politics,Politics,Suella Braverman calls fellow female MP 'emotional' during Brexit bill row,"The attorney general, Suella Braverman, has come under fire for calling a fellow female MP “emotional” after she questioned her support for the government’s bid to break international law. The term, often considered a misogynistic trope in an exchange, drew sharp criticism from the shadow justice secretary and several in the legal profession. Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, had challenged the government’s bid to “disapply” some of the Brexit withdrawal agreement through the internal market bill currently being debated in parliament.
Reeves put it to Braverman that she knew “full well the role of government law officers” was to “uphold the rule of law, without fear or favour” and suggested she had betrayed this duty by advising the government the bill would not be a breach of the ministerial code. Braverman hit back immediately, telling Reeves: “I prefer to take a less emotional approach than the honourable lady.” She then questioned Reeves’ patriotism, saying opposing the internal market bill “does a grave disservice to [the UK’s] interests”, and declared herself to be “extremely proud to support” the bill. Her putdown to Reeves sent social media into a spin.
It had echoes of 2011 when the former prime minister David Cameron sparked fury when he told Labour MP Angela Eagle to “calm down dear”. Braverman’s response to Reeves was branded “pathetic” by the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, who said it served to “further undermine the office of the attorney general”.
Braverman insisted parliament has a constitutional right to breach the Brexit deal, an international legally binding treaty. “Consideration of, and voting for this bill does not constitute a breach of the law,” she said. “Parliamentary supremacy means that it is entirely constitutional and proper for parliament to enact legislation” to breach the treaty. Lord Charlie Falconer, the shadow attorney general, pointed to the seeming conflict of Braverman’s position to support the UK yet condone the right to break laws.
Braverman, one of the leading proponents of Brexit, was one of three senior legal officers whose advice was sought for the internal market bill, which became the subject of an explosive row between the EU and the UK when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted it would breach international law in a “limited” way."
2020-09-24T15:50:20Z,politics,Politics,Tory lockdown sceptics praise Sunak for saying UK must live 'without fear',"Lockdown sceptics in the Conservative party have hailed comments by the chancellor saying that Britons must learn to live “without fear” and highlighting the importance of human contact and social interaction. In his closing remarks to parliament, Rishi Sunak appeared to launch a defence of the decision to reopen swathes of the economy over the summer and encourage people back into restaurants with the eat out to help out discount scheme. “Lives can no longer be put on hold,” the chancellor said, as he stressed that the move to allow pubs, shops and leisure facilities to reopen was about more than just the economy. “We did these things because life means more than simply existing. We find meaning and hope through our friends and family, through our work, through our community,” he said. Sunak intimated that he did not believe the UK public were to blame for a resurgence of the virus because they had taken up the opportunity. “People were not wrong for wanting that meaning, for striving towards normality, and nor was the government wrong to want this for them,” he said.
Sunak said there was no “risk-free solution” and that everyone “must learn to live with it and live without fear”. A number of Conservative MPs are planning to use debates next week and a vote on the renewal of the Coronavirus Act to make clear they will not tolerate further curbs on freedoms unless there is a more dramatic rise in hospitalisations – which stood at nearly 1,500 UK-wide on Thursday – and deaths, which rose to 37. One senior Tory MP who is sceptical of further restrictions said they found the words reassuring. “It’s not any secret that he is sympathetic to our approach,” the MP said. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister who has been a key critic of the government’s lockdown strategy, said Sunak’s intervention was welcome. “Rishi is increasingly distinguishing himself as a chancellor of both principle and pragmatism who we can rely on to promote our shared prosperity,” he said. The former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith also said he was encouraged by Sunak’s emphasis. “The truth is that there are a lot of risks in our lives and the chancellor is right that we need to learn to live with Covid, manage it, get through it and not kill the economy,” he said. “We have to get back to work, this can’t go on forever. And we have had this tightening up [of restrictions] but it has not been a major one – which it could have been according to the scientists. Even driving a car is a risk, but we manage that risk on the basis that we need to get things done.”
The former Tory leader said the chancellor had been right to pursue schemes such as eat out to help out that were aimed at renewing public confidence. “The only people who criticised the drive to get people back out are those who didn’t understand the concept of what he was doing,” he said. “It only doesn’t make sense if Covid is your entire and sole focus. Other things do have to go on.” Lucy Allen, another Tory MP who has been critical of Covid restrictions said: “There was a clear subtext: despite unprecedented uncertainty the chancellor wants us to get on with our lives and live as normally as possible. “After being exposed to rhetoric and numbers designed to terrify us into complying with prescriptive, sometimes arbitrary rules, it was a refreshingly, measured stance from someone who is not blinded by the science.” Scientists have said the scheme may have contributed to a spike in cases. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford University told the Commons science and technology select committee this month that cases had risen in the first week of September, right after the end of the scheme. “You go back to 30 August, you had about 1,000 detected cases and that then went up to 2,600,” he said. “It’s interesting to note that was right around the bank holiday, and the Monday we had Rishi’s eat out [to help out]. That was a huge success but that actually led, potentially, to some sense of increase in cases.” Speaking later at a press conference, where he was asked about the impact of the scheme on the spread of the virus, Sunak said the UK was following similar paths to other countries in Europe. “It is simplistic to look at any one thing,” he said. “There are going to be lots of factors at play as to why the virus is acting in a way that it is.”"
2020-09-24T13:47:24Z,politics,Politics,Hard winter ahead as Sunak tries to stop job losses hitting postwar record,"Britain is in for a long, hard winter. That came across loud and clear from Rishi Sunak as he announced new steps designed to prevent unemployment from breaking postwar records over the coming months. Much of what the chancellor had to say was familiar. This is an unprecedented crisis. Curbs on economic activity are needed to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. If the state is hurting businesses through lockdown and other restrictions then it has a duty to help. Since life will not return to normal before next spring at the earliest, Sunak has been forced to extend the financial support provided by the government, albeit on less generous terms than has been the case up until now. The aim of the job support scheme, the extension of the VAT holiday for the hospitality and tourism sectors and the help for businesses with their cashflow was simple: to get the economy through to next spring without a tsunami of job losses. The snap judgment from experts was that the winter package would temper the increase in joblessness but little more than that.
Sunak has said repeatedly throughout the pandemic that he is not going to be able to save every job and many of those who have been on furlough since March are going to have their jobs made redundant in the coming months. The chancellor said it was time to move on from a blanket support to a more targeted approach in which the government tried to save viable jobs. There are two issues here. The first is that many jobs that are currently furloughed would be viable under normal economic conditions. Theatres in London’s West End are closed because the government has said it is not safe for them to open, not because they are unviable.
The second issue is that employers have to make a much bigger contribution to the job support scheme than they did to the furlough scheme – and many of them are likely to decide that they can’t afford to keep workers on. In October, the final month of furlough, businesses will be paying 20% of an employee’s salary and Sunak 60%. From November, the company pays a minimum of 55% and the Treasury a maximum of 22%.
Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, also makes the point that under the furlough scheme, employees are being paid for not working at all, while under the new scheme they will have to work at least one-third of their normal hours. Gregory expects unemployment, currently 4.1%, to rise to 7% by the middle of next year. That is probably as good an outcome as Sunak could hope for. He said at a press conference following his speech that he had provided incentive for firms to keep people on the payroll, but thinktanks noted there is also an incentive for struggling firms to reduce a worker’s hours or make them redundant. Sunak declined to make a forecast for how high unemployment will go. Yet, the tone of his speech – with its talk of living without fear – suggests he knows full well how damaging the tougher restrictions imposed this week could be for the economy and that he will push back hard in cabinet against any further tightening. The Treasury has committed about £200bn to dealing with the fallout from Covid-19 and is getting nervous about the cost. But reining in spending depends on progress in fighting the pandemic and Sunak said he would offer more support if it proved necessary. Judged by the experience of the past six months, it will be."
2020-09-24T12:04:19Z,politics,Politics,"UK failing to use its high Covid test capacity efficiently, study shows","The UK has a comparatively high test capacity but is failing to use it efficiently in tackling Covid-19, researchers say, raising concerns including a lack of follow-up and adequate financial support of those isolating. The UK’s test and trace system has been heavily criticised in recent weeks, with some people advised to travel hundreds of miles for a test and turnaround times plummeting. Now researchers have compared it with systems in five other countries – Germany, Ireland, South Africa, Spain and South Korea – finding that while the UK has the highest proven test capacity, its system has serious flaws. “It is no use having, as we have, a very high relative number of tests if that doesn’t lead to people being isolated and supported so that we break chains of infection,” said Prof Michael Hopkins of the University of Sussex business school, a co-author of the work.
The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, compared the test and trace systems of the six countries with the five principles of an optimal programme, as set out by the UK’s Independent Sage committee, such as the need for quick and accessible testing and isolation of infectious individuals. The team also looked at recommendations from the World Health Organization. While a lack of data meant the performance of the systems could not be compared, the team was able to look at the gaps in the approaches. The results, based on programmes up to the end of August, showed all the countries’ systems had problems, for example the South Korean approach raised privacy concerns, while Spain lacked contact tracers. Despite the UK having the highest proven testing capacity of the six countries, the team found flaws in its test and trace system, including access to tests and individuals taking their own swabs. The researchers said people wanting a test should be triaged by GPs and, if a test were required, it should be carried out by a healthcare professional to avoid poor sample collection. “Any other scarce resource in the NHS, you have primary care as gatekeepers,” said Hopkins. The team also expressed worries about where the tests were processed. “Notably in the UK, the commissioning of new, private, large-scale testing in the Lighthouse laboratories has bypassed accreditation and raises quality concerns,” the researchers said.
They flagged concerns over the low effectiveness of the UK’s contact-tracing system, saying it lacked measures for those self-isolating, with not enough checks on adherence and their health and wellbeing. What is more, while full guidance about self-isolation was available, it was only online and not in all required languages. The team added that the financial support available to those isolating might not be enough. “You mustn’t have a choice between paying the bills and going to work and infecting people,” said Hopkins. Prof Chris Bonell, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said there was an urgent need to improve the reach of testing provision and tracing in the UK. “We also need to provide much more generous financial support to those being asked to isolate. This will encourage those testing positive to report all their contacts. It will also enable those asked to isolate to do so,” he said. “Unless we make these changes we are clearly heading for major trouble.” However, he had reservations about the proposal that GPs should triage people, saying test access needed to be as quick and easy as possible. “Given the current undercapacity, there needs to be some prioritisation,” he said. “However, expecting GPs to manage this alongside their other works seems a poor way to manage this.”"
2020-09-24T11:39:46Z,politics,Politics,Covid scheme: UK government to cover 22% of worker pay for six months,"The government will cover almost a quarter of pay for workers in “viable” jobs for the next six months, the chancellor said as he outlined plans that will take over from the furlough scheme when it finishes at the end of October. Unveiling a support package designed to help fend off mass unemployment in the wake of the new restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus, Rishi Sunak said he knew curbs on everyday freedoms were challenging and that the time had come for the public to live with some element of risk. “It is on all of us, we must learn to live with it and live without fear,” he said.
Sunak’s move mimics the German Kurzarbeit scheme that provides a government contribution to the wages of employees facing short-time working in companies where business is slow. British workers will need to work at least a third of their normal hours to qualify for the chancellor’s new Job Support Scheme. Their employer will pay normal wages for those hours. Of the remaining two-thirds of each worker’s usual pay, the employer will pay 33% and the government will pay 33%, meaning that the worker will receive 77% of their usual monthly wage in total. The government will be paying 22%, capped at a maximum £697.72 a month. The employer will pay 55%. Addressing the resurgence of the virus that had made the measures necessary, Sunak said the public should not be blamed for “striving towards normality” by seeing their friends and loved ones in recent months, a covert defence of his eat out to help out scheme. “People were not wrong for wanting that … and nor was the government wrong to want this for them,” he said. “I said in the summer that we must endure and live with the uncertainty of the moment. This means learning our new limits as we go.” Sunak warned MPs it was “not sustainable or affordable to continue to provide the level of support that we did at the beginning of this crisis” and said that would continue to be the case. “It can’t be that we borrow at this level forever; we must get our borrowing back under control and get our debt falling again.”
The JSS will apply to small and medium-sized enterprises and employers will need to pick up one third of the cost to maintain workers’ pay. Larger employers will only be covered if their turnover has gone down during the Covid-19 pandemic. All employers will be allowed to apply, even if they did not use the furlough scheme. He said the self-employed grant support scheme would also be extended to protect those who are unable to find work over the next few months. “These are policies we have never tried before,” Sunak said, to protect millions of jobs and businesses. A “pay as you grow” loan scheme will allow businesses to repay government-guaranteed loans over 10 years, effectively halving the total payments over the life of a loan. A VAT holiday for the particularly hard-hit hospitality and leisure industries due to end in November will be extended to next year. Boris Johnson’s absence from the Commons for the statement raised some eyebrows in Westminster but the prime minister told broadcasters on a trip to meet police recruits there was no difference of opinion over the proposed measures. “Of course I fully support the package of measures that we’ve jointly drawn up,” he said, calling them “creative and imaginative proposals from the chancellor”. Before the announcement, significant numbers of Tory MPs had put pressure on the Treasury for more support, particularly for hospitality, culture and aviation.
The plan received a muted welcome from business and industry lobby groups. Make UK, the lobby group for the manufacturing sector, said the part-time working scheme offered only limited support for the aerospace and car industries, where many firms had suffered a collapse in orders and large numbers of workers continued to be at home full time. The Institute of Directors said a wider range of measures was needed to protect businesses from going bust and encourage them to make investments necessary for their survival. Jonathan Geldart, the institute’s director general, said Sunak would be forced to return to the dispatch box over the coming weeks to fill in the gaps in his plans. “With revenues still limited by the virus, directors looking to adapt their organisations will come up against cash crunches in waves,” he said."
2020-09-24T11:04:53Z,politics,Politics,Key points from Rishi Sunak's winter economy plan â€“ at a glance,"Sunak’s opening remarks Sunak said the UK was in a fundamentally different position to where it was in March when coronavirus first spread. The chancellor said millions of people had moved off furlough and back to work as the economy reopened, but the resurgence of the virus and measures needed in response posed a threat to a fragile economic recovery. He said the economy was “now likely to undergo a more permanent economic adjustment”. Peter Walker, political correspondent: Sunak is not a devotee of Boris Johnson’s brand of perennial boosterism, but he began with a slightly upbeat note, stressing that the UK is in a better position than in March. But he did underline the need for more intervention. This is the balance he faces: accept things are still serious, but don’t overly spook everyone. Furlough scheme replacement Sunak announced a new “jobs support scheme” to subsidise the wages of people in work to replace the furlough scheme when it ends at the end of October. Businesses will have the option of keeping employees in a job on shorter hours, rather than making them redundant. Workers must work a third of their usual hours, paid by their employer as normal. For the time they are not working, the government will pay a third of their usual pay, and the employer will pay a third of their usual pay. Including the pay for the hours they are working, the Treasury says this means workers will get 77% of their usual pay. The scheme will be targeted at businesses that need it most – all small and medium-sized firms – but only for big companies if turnover has fallen by a third. The scheme will run for six months starting in November. Firms can claim both the jobs support scheme and the jobs retention bonus. A grant for self-employed workers will be extended on similar terms. PW: This sounds very much like the German-style jobs support scheme that many people, including some Conservative MPs, have been seeking from Sunak. It gives extra protection for jobs while allowing the furlough programme to wind down, as had been pledged. Business loans Sunak announced “pay as you grow” to help companies repay state-backed business loans. Loans can be extended from six to 10 years, almost halving repayments. Interest-only payments can be made, and firms in “real trouble” can suspend their payouts. All of the government’s state-backed loan schemes will be extended until the end of 2020, and the government is starting work on a new guarantee loan programme to begin in January. The chancellor will allow businesses to spread their VAT bills over 11 separate payments. PW: It’s perhaps of marginal interest to the businesses affected, but it’s worth noting how good Team Sunak are at coming up with catchy names for his initiatives. We had “eat out to help out”. Now we have “ pay as you grow”. It is all good for the chancellor’s personal brand. Hospitality sector Sunak said on current plans VAT would increase from 5% to 20% on 13 January. The cut had been made at the chancellor’s summer economic update. The chancellor said he was cancelling a planned increase in VAT, keeping a lower rate of VAT for hospitality and leisure firms until 31 March 2021. PW: By the standards of a chancellor, Sunak was almost poetic in his closing remarks, stressing the fact that “life means more than simply existing”, and defending recent moves to open the economy. Life would be tricky, he said, and people would need to learn to live with the virus. These are much the same sentiments as expressed several times by Boris Johnson, but many of the Tory MPs watching will note that the chancellor is sometimes much better at expressing them than his prime minister. Expect this section to get replayed on the evening news."
2020-09-24T08:38:28Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak to unveil new Covid economic support measures,"Rishi Sunak is to announce an extension of business loan schemes and a package of employment support to replace the government’s furlough scheme, which is due to end next month. The chancellor will lay out new measures in a statement to parliament on Thursday, a day after he scrapped plans for an autumn budget in order to focus on the immediate economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Thursday morning the economic support to replace the furlough scheme had been set in train since the summer. Asked why the chancellor had waited until almost October to announce the measures, Hancock said: “We’ve said throughout that sadly we’re not able to protect every job and every business. “But I think in terms of the timing of this, we’ve been working on the winter plan for the economy and options in case cases started to go up again since the summer and with the prime minister having set out the next steps in terms of the health side on Tuesday, now the chancellor is coming to the House today – two days later – to set out the economic package for the winter plan that goes with that.” Scrapping the planned autumn budget on Wednesday, Sunak said he would announce the details of a “winter economy plan” that would “continue protecting jobs” as Britain entered a new phase of the pandemic. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that one option being weighed by Sunak to replace the furlough scheme is a package of wage subsidies for employees put on short-time work of the sort already operating in Germany. Sunak, however, will say that his plans are custom-made to suit the UK’s current needs rather than a straight lift from another country. It comes as pressure increases on the chancellor to act after Boris Johnson announced new restrictions on business and social life earlier this week. “No one wanted to be in this situation but we need to respond to it,” a Treasury source said. “The chancellor has shown he has been creative in the past and we hope that people will trust us to continue in that vein. Giving people reassurance and businesses the help they need to get through this is uppermost in his mind.”
Against a backdrop of rising job losses and a worsening growth outlook, business groups, Labour and trade unions said Sunak urgently needed to step back from ending the furlough, or at least replace the jobs programme with a successor scheme. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the country needed a plan B for the economy and that he had offered to help Johnson come up with one, adding: “It makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses.” A significant number of senior Tory MPs have also lobbied the chancellor for extra business support, including the chair of the culture select committee, Julian Knight, and the former sports minister Tracey Crouch."
2020-09-23T23:01:02Z,politics,Politics,"Covid means UK needs EU deal to avoid calamity, says Lord O'Donnell","The combination of a no-deal Brexit and a second wave of Covid-19 represents such a serious threat to the UK that a trade deal with Brussels is needed to avoid a “calamitous outcome”, according to the former head of the civil service. In a withering attack on the government’s handling of the pandemic over the past six months, Gus O’Donnell – who headed the civil service under three prime ministers – will say on Thursday that the UK faces a perfect storm and that a trade agreement with the EU is “absolutely imperative” to head off serious disruption. Lord O’Donnell will use the annual Institute for Fiscal Studies lecture to accuse the government of a range of failures – including weaknesses of strategy and leadership and a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. Britain’s Covid-19 record has been poor in comparison to its peers whether measured by the number of excess deaths, levels of wellbeing or the hit to economic activity, O’Donnell will say. He will accuse the government of having an obsession with soundbites at the expense of substance and a confused communications strategy that has left the public frustrated and baffled. O’Donnell will pose the question of why Britain, with its highly regarded health and intelligence institutions, has been so incapable of combatting the Covid-19 pandemic. “In 2019, we were ranked second in the world for pandemic preparedness by the Global Health Security Index. A litany of new rules and a steady stream of leaks reflects a government struggling to emerge from firefighting mode,” he will say. “Without a clear strategy, strong leadership and the use of good evidence from a range of human sciences, there is a risk that our efforts to emerge from this pandemic will be protracted and extremely costly.” Speaking just two days after Boris Johnson announced new restrictions for people living in England, O’Donnell will say government strategy is failing repeatedly because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been dominated by medical scientists whom the government instinctively defers to. “However, the key to controlling the virus is changing people’s behaviours. The government’s incorporation of expertise from behavioural and other human sciences has been woeful. The weak ‘stay alert’ campaign is an example of this. When the government says it ‘follows the science’, this really means that it follows the medical sciences, which has given it a one-sided perspective and led to some questionable policy decisions.” The criticisms levelled by O’Donnell – who served Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron as cabinet secretary – will provide fresh ammunition for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, who has repeatedly accused Johnson of incompetence in recent weeks. O’Donnell will say that it is hard to see the abolition of Public Health England in the middle of the pandemic as anything other than a political attempt to deflect blame. “Such moves can seriously deplete morale within institutions that are key to the pandemic response. More generally, the UK has one of the strongest scientific communities in the world and yet it is as though our institutions have simply not been built for handling this crisis. “We need to look seriously at how to reform our institutions so that we are much more capable of responding to challenges like Covid. The government should be setting up a national Covid council modelled on the National Security Council, which would allow senior ministers and officials to consider (rather than just defer to) the opinions received from Sage.”"
2020-09-23T21:59:31Z,politics,Politics,Three Labour MPs lose roles after voting against overseas operations bill,"Labour has sacked three junior shadow ministers who joined with Jeremy Corbyn and 14 other Socialist Campaign group MPs in breaking the party’s whip by voting against the second reading of a controversial armed forces bill. Sources close to the party’s leadership said that the three MPs were warned in advance that they could not remain in their posts as parliamentary private secretaries if they voted against the bill. Nadia Whittome, Beth Winter and Olivia Blake defied the whip, which called on Labour MPs to abstain on the overseas operations bill. The legislation aims to introduce a presumption against prosecution for British soldiers serving abroad. The group of rebels led by former party leader Corbyn also included John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Rebecca Long-Bailey. The proposed presumption against prosecution applies to offences such as war crimes and torture and critics say it breaches international humanitarian law, although the government says it is designed to end vexatious litigation against the armed forces. “I thought the bill was a matter of conscience,” Whittome told ITV’s Robert Peston But she added that it was “reasonable” for colleagues to decide to abstain and try to amend the legislation during the later stages of its passage through parliament. She said the bill was “anti-veteran, anti-human rights, and would effectively decriminalise torture – and that’s why I voted against it”. Earlier, Corbyn had said: “I have grave concerns that, as it stands, the overseas operation bill the House of Commons is discussing today defies and undermines international law.” The move against the three MPs is an indication of the firm discipline Keir Starmer intends to exert over his party — and underlines the continued tensions between leftwingers and the new leadership. Party sources indicated they were not unhappy that Corbyn had broke with his successor Starmer over the bill, arguing that it created a dividing line between the past and present leaders. During the debate on the bill, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, angrily accused Labour of having taken Britain into “illegal wars” when the party was last in power in a heated Commons exchange during the second reading debate. A clearly irate Wallace intervened as John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, was arguing that the bill risked breaching the Geneva conventions that outlaw torture and war crimes because it proposes a presumption against prosecution after five years for British soldiers serving overseas. “Much of the mess we are having to come and clean up today is because of your illegal wars, your events in the past,” Wallace said, accusing Healey of making “wild allegations” about the intentions of the bill. A surprised Healey said: “That is not worthy of the office of the secretary of state for defence. We are dealing with matters of torture, war crimes, [Ministry of Defence] negligence, compensation for injured troops and compensation for the families who have lost their loved ones overseas.” The last time a minister had suggested a war was illegal at the dispatch box was Nick Clegg describing the Iraq war in 2010, a statement that he was forced to clarify amid concern it could expose the government to legal action. The then deputy prime minister said that he was speaking in a personal capacity, while international lawyers warned a statement by a government minister in such a formal setting could weaken the UK’s position in the courts. Allies of Wallace said he had no intention of retracting or clarifying his remarks, which unlike Clegg’s were not linked to any specific conflict. Britain fought wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and most controversially in Iraq when Labour was last in government, and was broadly involved in the so-called “war on terror” alongside the US. The bill passed at second reading by 332 to 77, with the Scottish National party and Liberal Democrats joining the 18 Labour rebels in voting against."
2020-09-23T19:00:47Z,politics,Politics,"Public not to blame for second wave of Covid-19, says Keir Starmer","The public are not to blame for a resurgence of coronavirus and have been let down by the government, Keir Starmer has said in a televised address following the prime minister’s broadcast on Tuesday night. The Labour leader’s remarks pointing the finger at government incompetence come in stark contrast to Boris Johnson’s address, where he appeared to suggest that “freedom-loving” Britons would be to blame if more draconian restrictions were applied. “The British people have done everything asked of them. But I’m afraid the government has not,” Starmer said. He said the pandemic had continued despite “the sacrifices and heroism of the British people” and, while Labour supported the new restrictions, they were the consequence of mismanagement of the virus. “We’re a great country. We shouldn’t have one of the highest death rates in the world, or one of the worst recessions,” he said. “It’s a national scandal that we still don’t have a testing system that works. Or a plan to protect our care homes. It shouldn’t be like this.”
Ahead of the chancellor’s announcement of a new support package on Thursday, Starmer said there needed to be a “plan B for the economy” and urgent clarity was needed on protecting businesses and jobs. Starmer said he would work with the prime minister if asked, saying “my door is always open”. He said the country must summon the resolve for the months ahead. “I know there is real frustration and anger at the mistakes that the government has made in the last few months,” he said. “But we will get through this. The darkness will lift. A better future is possible for our country.” In an interview with the BBC before the address, Starmer said the party would have a policy offer for the May 2021 local and Scottish elections. He said the party would oppose any imminent referendum on Scottish independence but refused to rule out ever supporting a new poll. “We will be going into that election in May making it very clear that another divisive referendum on independence in Scotland is not what is needed,” he said. “We don’t know what will happen after that … I am not doing a hypothetical of what will happen after that.”Labour also broadcast a film on Wednesday night of Starmer, 58, outside his semi-detached childhood home in Surrey, aimed at underlining the party leader’s ordinary roots. The party leader is pictured in the garden of his parents’ former home in the Surrey town of Oxted. He speaks about being the first in his family to go to university and how the NHS cared for his disabled mother."
2020-09-23T17:05:43Z,politics,Politics,"6,178 new Covid cases recorded - close to record from early May – as it happened","Scientific advisers to the government have warned that pub curfews and other new measures in England will fail to stop the exponential spread of Covid-19, as sources confirmed that ministers have departed from their â€œfollow the scienceâ€� mantra. Rishi Sunak has scrapped this autumnâ€™s budget before the announcement of a revamped support package to protect jobs and the economy through a looming winter Covid-19 crisis. The UK has recorded 6,178 new coronavirus cases, which is close to the highest ever daily total, recorded in early May. (See 4.22pm.) A pledge to hit 500,000 coronavirus tests a day in the UK by the end of next month could be missed as vital chemicals and analysing machines needed to hit the target are â€œa few weeksâ€� behind schedule, the body representing their manufacturers has said. Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of â€œpretending there isnâ€™t a problemâ€� with the test-and-trace system, as he claimed the prime minister had lost control of the coronavirus crisis. HSBC and Goldman Sachs have postponed plans to bring staff back to the office in England after the governmentâ€™s U-turn on its back-to-work drive. A de-facto Brexit border is to be introduced for lorry drivers entering Kent to travel on to the EU, Michael Gove has confirmed. Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed that, if the SNP win a majority in the Holyrood elections next year, he would accept that they have a mandate for another independence referendum. He said this in January, before he was Labour leader, but recently he has refused to commit himself on this point in interviews, just stressing his opposition to a second referendum. But Skyâ€™s political editor Beth Rigby eventually got an answer from him after persisting in an interview. Starmer has been anxious to avoid addressing this point now because many in the Scottish Labour party think the party should oppose a second referendum on principle, regardless of what happens in the election next year.
The economic cost of a no-deal Brexit could be two or three times as bad as the impact of Covid, a report has concluded. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continue on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-09-23T16:22:55Z,politics,Politics,Starmer treats Johnson as a toddler but he has regressed to being a baby | John Crace,"The comparison was not flattering. On Tuesday night Boris Johnson gave us his third-rate Winston Churchill impression on TV; now Keir Starmer has given his reply. And it wasn’t just Labour supporters wishing Starmer was running the country: there are plenty of Tory MPs who must secretly harbour similar feelings. Boris looks and sounds like an entitled impostor. Keir looks and sounds like the real deal. Someone prepared to put the country first but not afraid to showcase the shortcomings of a Tory government that has lurched from cock-up to crisis throughout the pandemic. This was serious, sharp-focused Keir, pointing out the abject failure of test and trace and the lack of a plan B for the economy. The coronavirus may have been unavoidable but there had been nothing inevitable about its consequences: 55,000 dead and counting.
Earlier we had seen a rather more soft-focused, gentle Keir. Cue piano music played in a minor chord. Ordinary members of the public and NHS workers relating the hardships they have faced over the past few months. Keir standing next to a war memorial, declaring his love and pride in the UK. How he was the first person from his family to go to university and went on to become the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. But how there were still too many injustices holding people back and how Labour under his leadership was determined to put things right and win back the support of the country. It ended with Keir standing outside the ordinary home in Oxted, Surrey, where he had grown up. All that was missing for the full-on tear-jerker were the distressed donkeys that his parents had once looked after. But that was just a minor quibble, for as Starmer’s first party political broadcast it could hardly have been bettered. The message was clear. He wasn’t Jeremy Corbyn. And he certainly wasn’t Boris Johnson. There again, that last bit didn’t come as too much of a surprise as it’s not entirely clear if even Johnson knows who Johnson is these days, given that his performances are becoming increasingly erratic and confused. Never more so than at prime minister’s questions, where Starmer continues to make the mistake of overestimating Johnson’s real emotional age. He used to treat Boris as a 10-year-old, only for Johnson to act like a toddler. Now Keir has lowered his sights and treats him as a toddler, Boris has regressed further into a pre-verbal baby. At this rate of decline it won’t be long before we have a prime minister who has yet to be born. Starmer’s new line of attack at PMQs is to keep things as simple as possible for Johnson. So he started by pointing out that three months ago the prime minister had said the test-and-trace system could be a real game-changer for the country. Yesterday he had said the opposite: that test and trace had very little or nothing to do with the spread of transmission of the disease. Both statements couldn’t be correct, so which one was he standing by today? Whereupon Boris gave a reply that can’t even have made any sense to him. Or if it did, then he’s further gone than anyone imagined. Because what he said was that the virus was transmitted from human to human so test and trace was merely both a total sideshow and vitally important in informing the indecisive action he had taken the day before. At least that’s what I think he said. I’ve played back his answer several times now and I’m still none the wiser. I’ve got more sense from listening to a Pingu cartoon. To be fair so had Starmer, who merely repeated the question and got a similar incoherent response. So the Labour leader tried a new tack, based on the assumption that the whole world – with the possible exception of Boris – believed that test and trace was crucial to containing the virus. So last week the prime minister had admitted there was a problem with it. Dido Harding had said it was due to a lack of capacity, the health secretary had said the problem was over demand. Which was it? Now things took an even more surreal turn with Boris declaring any attack on Typhoid Dido to be both unjustified and unseemly. It was almost medieval in tone and probably the first time on record that Johnson has ever sought to defend a woman’s honour. And also totally bizarre, as what is really unseemly is that an unelected Tory peer with a track record of mismanagement and failure should have been given the job as head of test and trace without even an interview. He didn’t even bother to try to defend his health secretary. Then again, Matt Hancock is now everybody’s Door Matt. The longer PMQs went on the more staccato Boris’s sentences became. He would be delivering 500,000 tests a day by the end of October – a figure not even he and Typhoid Dido believe – even though he had just said that test and trace was a complete waste of time. He yet again blamed the opposition for daring to oppose, rather than delivering praise for his achievements.
Boris also managed to accuse Starmer of not backing the NHS – the Labour leader’s wife works for it – while again happily outsourcing the test-and-trace operations to Serco and other private companies. He failed to grasp why the demand for tests should have increased when schools went back. He was unable to give any details on what financial help the government might be planning to make to businesses affected by the latest restrictions. Most tellingly of all, though, he made no reference whatsoever to the new contact-tracing app the government was supposed to be bringing in later this week. Presumably he already knows it doesn’t work. Much like the last one. By the end, it wasn’t just the Labour leader who was looking bemused. It was MPs from both sides. The knowledge that this hadn’t even been Boris at his worst only added to the pathos. Never has a prime minister with an 80-seat majority looked so alone. A man out of touch with his country, his party and most of all himself. A man who wasted weeks picking an unnecessary fight with the EU over the internal market bill when his attention should have been fully focused on the coronavirus. Still, at least it would be Michael Gove who would have to explain about the 7,000-long lorry queues later in the afternoon. Right now, it was all he could do to take pleasure in the small victories."
2020-09-23T16:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer film shows him outside childhood family home,"Labour will broadcast a film of Keir Starmer outside his semi-detached childhood home in Surrey, aimed at underlining the party leader’s ordinary roots before a major address to the nation later on Wednesday night. Starmer is pictured in the garden of his parents’ former home in Oxted in the party political broadcast that will air on television a few hours before he makes the address in response to Boris Johnson’s message on Tuesday. He will mention being the first in his family to go to university and how the NHS cared for his disabled mother. The broadcast will also underline the party’s focus on leadership values and patriotism, which was emphasised in the virtual conference speech delivered by Starmer on Tuesday, an effort to put clear water between both him and Johnson and him and his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. The broadcast highlights Starmer speaking to veterans at the Cenotaph and talking about NHS support for his mother. Standing at his childhood home, he will say: “Together we can make Britain the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in.”
Filming took place over the summer across the UK, including Edinburgh, Stevenage, Birmingham, Chesterfield and north Wales, as Starmer toured the country. Narrating the film, Starmer says: “I love this country. I’m proud of this country, of all it has achieved and all it will go on to achieve. “This country has given me so much. An NHS that cared for my mother for much of her life. The chance to be the first in my family to go to university, to go on into the law and to lead our Crown Prosecution Service for five years.” The Labour leader’s address on the BBC, expected around 8pm, will express support for the new restrictions aimed at containing the virus. However, it will also underline that any second full lockdown should not been seen as inevitable but rather as a strategic failure by the government."
2020-09-23T12:22:06Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of losing control of Covid crisis,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “pretending there isn’t a problem” with the test-and-trace system, as he claimed the prime minister had lost control of the coronavirus crisis. In a clash focused entirely on the government’s response to Covid, the Labour leader posed a series of sometimes detailed queries on the testing system. Johnson generally ignored these, instead accusing Starmer of trying to “create political opportunity” out of the pandemic. One of the more confusing exchanges during prime minister’s questions came when Starmer quizzed Johnson on his insistence in the Commons on Tuesday that the performance of test and trace had no bearing on the coronavirus rate, contrasting this with Johnson’s previous insistence that the system would be “a real game-changer”.
“Yesterday the prime minister said the complete opposite. Standing there he said testing and tracing has very little or nothing to do with the spread or transmission of the disease. Both positions cannot be right. Which one is it, prime minister?” Starmer asked. Johnson’s reply appeared to argue that in saying test and trace had no impact on Covid infections, he was talking only about the “obvious fact of biology and epidemiology” that it is transmitted by human or aerosol contact. Starmer again asked about the apparent contradiction, prompting the prime minister to accuse him of not listening. The Labour leader responded: “I listened to the answer that the prime minister gave to the question. That’s why I asked him the question. Because yesterday he said the complete opposite of what he said today.” Overall, the exchanges followed the recent pattern of prime minister’s questions, with Johnson avoiding direct answers to instead accuse Starmer of seeking to inflame tensions. The Labour leader castigated Johnson over the lack of available tests, especially for families with school-aged children, and accused him of being in denial: “Pretending there isn’t a problem is part of the problem, prime minister.” He asked the Johnson if the reason for the difficulty of some people in getting tests was “we haven’t got enough capacity, because nobody could have expected the rise in demand – that’s the Dido Harding defence – or is it, we’ve got all the capacity we need, it’s just that people are being unreasonable in asking for tests? That’s the Matt Hancock defence. So which is it?” Johnson replied by accusing Starmer of making “unseemly and unjustified” attacks on Harding, the head of NHS test and trace. While saying he did not “deny the anxiety of those who want tests, which I readily accept”, Johnson called for a “spirit of togetherness”.
Starmer angrily rejected this: “The prime minister knows my complaint is not with the NHS, it’s with the government. My wife works for the NHS. My mother worked for the NHS. My sister works for the NHS. So I’m not going to take lectures from the prime minister on supporting the NHS.” In another exchange, Starmer asked Johnson about the numbers of pupils forced to miss school because they were awaiting a Covid test, with the prime minister replying by talking about the very low risk from the virus faced by children. Starmer said: “That’s such a poor defence. The point isn’t whether the children have got Covid, it’s that they’ve got Covid symptoms and they’re off school.” He added: “If the prime minister doesn’t see that he’s really out of touch with families and what they’re going through with schooling, day in and day out, in the last few weeks. “The reality is that losing control of testing is a major reason why the prime minister is losing control of this virus.”"
2020-09-23T12:03:53Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit will cost UK more than Covid, report finds","The economic cost of a no-deal Brexit could be two or three times as bad as the impact of Covid, a report has concluded. Analysis by the London School of Economics and UK in a Changing Europe says “a no-deal Brexit would represent a further major shock to a UK economy” with a “major set of changes” to the economic relationship with the country’s largest trading partner. “Our modelling with LSE of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England’s forecast for the impact of Covid-19,” says the report. LSE modelling puts the long-term economic hit from a no-deal Brexit at 8% of GDP, similar to that of the government’s own forecast in 2018 of 7.6%, which amounts to £160bn in today’s money, or £2,400 per person. This compares with the Bank of England’s latest forecast of the impact of Covid which shows a reduction of 1.7% of GDP to the economy up to 2022. This amounts to £40bn, or £600 per person, and is dwarfed by cost of a no-deal Brexit, which will have an impact on GDP for years to come. “In the long run, Brexit is likely to be more significant” depressing the country’s economic output over 20 years, says the report, titled 'What would no deal mean?
In the short term it is “almost certainly correct” that “the economic impacts of Covid-19 dwarf those of Brexit,” it says, as not even the most pessimistic forecasts suggest the initial fall in output caused by a no-deal could lead to a downturn like that seen in the second quarter of this year. But it concludes that there will be longer term damage to the country’s reputation for ease of doing businesses, with delays due to administrative burdens at ports, constraints on travel and tourism, as well as curbs on immigration and free movement of labour. This is on top of the impact of the imposition of tariffs such as 10% on cars and 50% on cheddar cheese imports, which would be imposed for at least one year until the UK came up with its own tariff arrangements with trading partners including the EU. Economists have talked of V-shaped, W-shaped and K-shaped recoveries from Covid, but a no-deal Brexit will make it “harder for the UK to ‘grow its way out of trouble’,” the report says. The authors of the report say the risk is that “EU-based businesses will seek to avoid exposing themselves to UK suppliers, and that multinationals will seek to minimise the degree to which trade crosses the new border”. They add that the deal being discussed is low on ambition and “relatively thin”, leading to its conclusion that this will not be the end of discussions with the EU. “No deal or the thin deal on offer are both likely to be unsustainable endpoints,” they say."
2020-09-22T20:23:56Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Boris Johnson says 'there have been too many breaches' and warns restrictions could go further – as it happened,"Thatâ€™s it for our live blog today, thanks to everyone for reading along on what has been a tumultuous day for the UK and its battle against coronavirus. Our coronavirus coverage will continue into the night over on our global blog. Hereâ€™s quick recap of all the latest developments: Boris Johnson refuses to rule out second Covid-19 lockdown. The prime minister warned the weary British public to summon their resolve for a tough winter ahead, as he refused to rule out a second national lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking in a televised address, he appeared to suggest â€œfreedom-lovingâ€� Britons will be to blame if more draconian restrictions are applied. New restrictions to last â€˜perhaps six monthsâ€™ says Johnson. The UK is at a â€œperilous turning pointâ€� and must act, Boris Johnson told MPs, announcing new restrictions for England including slashing the size of wedding celebrations and bans on indoor team sports, as well as a return to home working. Nicola Sturgeon announces Scotland-wide ban on household visits. Household visiting will be banned across Scotland, as Sturgeon moves to limit a key driver of coronavirus infections before the winter. The same measure was introduced in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. Pubs in Wales to close at 10pm from Thursday. Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to close at 10pm, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, announced. Hospitality businesses will have to provide table service only and all off-licences, including supermarkets, will have to stop selling alcohol at 10pm. The move is in line with similar measures announced in England and Scotland. Rishi Sunak weighs up German-style wage subsidies to replace furlough scheme. The chancellor is weighing up plans to replace the furlough scheme with German-style wage subsidies as part of a wider emergency support package to help businesses through a second wave in Covid-19. Local lockdowns failing to stop Covid spread in England, experts warn. Experts said there was little evidence that the piecemeal restrictions introduced in parts of England over the summer had worked, with the infection rate rising sharply in almost all areas where local measures had been imposed. Younger women â€˜bearing bruntâ€™ of second wave of Covid in UK. Hospital records reveal a substantial rise in the number of women aged 20 to 40 admitted for serious coronavirus infections since the beginning of August, a country-wide trend that suggests younger women are now more exposed to the virus. Businesses warn Boris Johnson over U-turn on office working. Business lobby groups have warned that the prime ministerâ€™s U-turn on encouraging office workers back to their desks is â€œextraordinarily reactive and extraordinarily disruptiveâ€� and risks â€œderailing an already fragile recoveryâ€�."
2020-09-22T20:05:19Z,politics,Politics,"It's Boristime v Coronatime, and there’s only ever one winner | John Crace","Some men are born mediocre. Some achieve mediocrity. Others have mediocrity thrust upon them. In 1940 we had Winston Churchill. In 2020 we have Boris Johnson, a man who believes himself to be Churchill’s reincarnation, but is nothing more than a poundshop imitation. Where to start with the prime minister’s TV address to the nation? The trademark smirk? The nervous hand gestures? The fact he thinks he’s fighting a war, not a pandemic? Or just the brazen cheek as Boris tried to claim the credit for what he called the stunning triumph over the coronavirus so far? The 50,000 dead and the endless screw-ups of his own government, from care homes to test and trace, were simply airbrushed out of history. The prime minister is not just a man without quality. He is a man without shame. All this was just a warm up for the grandiose announcement of a few extra restrictions that had already been announced and would almost certainly prove to be insufficient to cope with the second wave. Boris apologised for the new measures, though he laid the blame squarely on the British people for not having been able to abide by the existing measures. Perhaps he should have run that line past Dominic Cummings who set an example so many followed. “Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour,” he said, winding up the Churchill rhetoric. “There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.” Qualities that have yet to be found in Johnson. It had been much the same story in the Commons earlier in the day and you had to feel for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, who must now be wondering why they had gone to so much trouble the previous day to explain just how critical the coronavirus rates of infection had become and that the threat had now risen back to level four. For after a few token nods to the gravity of the situation – “a stitch in time saves nine” – Boris Johnson used his commons statement to introduce a few minor tweaks to lockdown restrictions that rather suggested he wasn’t too bothered. He wanted schools, colleges, universities and businesses to remain open – with the one proviso that all those he had previously threatened with the sack if they didn’t go back to work were now advised to work from home if at all possible. His biggest change was that pubs, restaurants and bars should now all close at 10pm – it has apparently been proved that the coronavirus is mainly a nocturnal creature and is most contagious after dark – though people were obviously free to go home in groups of six, get totally hammered and infect one another afterwards. Like most Johnson statements it felt rather as if it had been written on the fly. By a committee of his left and right brain, with little synaptic contact between the two. There were few attempts to explain the situation carefully and carry the country with him. Just a load of off the cuff measures – mandatory face masks for shop and hospitality workers etc – and the threat of stricter measures to come if people didn’t comply or the restrictions proved ineffective. This time he was really, really serious, he said, trying not to smirk. He understood that, unlike the Hun, we Brits were too freedom loving to comply with every law – nothing to do with the government’s mixed messaging obviously – but there were limits. There was nothing the public liked less than one law for the powerful and another for everyone else, so unless it involved driving up to Durham for eye tests it was time to rein in our libertarian instincts. These restrictions could last for up to six months, Boris added. Which immediately raised eyebrows on both sides of the Commons. Because the prime minister’s idea of time rarely coincides with anyone else’s. It was Boris who had initially said the worst of the pandemic would be over in 12 weeks. It was Boris who had said we should be back to normal by Christmas. Now he was saying we were in for another half-year. Which probably meant that you could probably double it. Maybe he was thinking of Christmas 2021. The pandemic has highlighted the stark difference between Boristime and Coronatime. Because he is unable to treat the country as grownups and can’t handle being the bearer of bad news, Boris invariably shortens any given Covid timeframe. Years become months, months become weeks. Meanwhile Coronatime has the last laugh of turning each of his strategies from months into weeks and weeks into days. You sometimes can’t even tell if one of his promises is going to last till the end of a sentence. If Keir Starmer was put out that his powerful virtual conference speech had been all but forgotten by lunchtime he showed no sign of it. Rather he maintained his familiar tactic of broadly supporting the government’s new measures, before pointing out some of their more obvious shortcomings. Were there any signs that localised lockdowns were proving effective? What financial support was he planning to offer for jobs and businesses affected by the new restrictions? And whatever had happened to the world-beating test-and-trace system that everyone had agreed was essential to containing the virus? Mostly, though, Boris’s concentration was focused on keeping his own backbenchers happy, as half of them want to avoid any further restrictions to keep the economy open and half have genuine concerns that the party will not be forgiven if the death toll in the second wave matches or exceeds that of the first one. And by and large he succeeded in treading an uneasy balance between being too bullish and too pragmatic. Up until the end, that is. Then his natural enthusiasm got the better of him. The ludicrous £100bn “Operation Moonshot” was still on course and with any luck everything would be fine within a matter of a few months. We were back on Boristime. Though not for long, as moments after he had finished speaking Nicola Sturgeon made her own statement to the Scottish parliament. Where Boris had sounded somewhat rambling and, at times, contradictory, in his statement, Nicola was a model of clarity and precision. She has a clear grasp of her priorities and sticks to them. She had listened to the advice of Whitty and Vallance and concluded it was necessary to go a lot further than England. In Scotland the “rule of six” was a goner, and there would be no unnecessary socialising between families indoors for the foreseeable future. With Northern Ireland having already reached a similar conclusion, that left Boris as something of an outlier. Already people were taking bets that his new restrictions would have to be updated within a week. In the battle between Boristime and Coronatime, there’s so far only ever been one winner."
2020-09-22T19:09:33Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's speech in full: 'the fight against Covid is by no means over',"Good evening, the struggle against Covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face, none of them easy, and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time. And I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress Covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not Covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply. And once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the “rule of six” indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the devolved administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet – of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through."
2020-09-22T13:01:48Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer tells Labour conference: we deserved to lose election,"Keir Starmer has staked out his intention to make Labour a “competent, credible” opposition, using his first conference speech as leader to promise a new beginning for the party and to say that under Jeremy Corbyn it deserved to lose the 2019 election. Making the speech in a near-empty arts centre in Doncaster as part of Labour’s virtual conference, Starmer condemned Boris Johnson in deeply personal terms, calling the prime minister fundamentally unserious, and “just not up to the job”. He also criticised what he said were repeated government failings over coronavirus, as well as with education and social care, saying the state of the latter system was “a disgrace to a rich nation”. Significant sections of the speech sought to recast Starmer as a different leader to Corbyn, based not just on perceived competence but Starmer’s repeated references to his patriotism, for example his family’s pride when he was awarded a knighthood at Buckingham Palace for his previous work as director of public prosecutions. The speech won a generally favourable reception from those within Labour and the unions, although Momentum, the Jeremy Corbyn-linked campaign group called it “a missed opportunity to show substance”.
A key element was an appeal to former Labour voters in “red wall” seats in northern England and the Midlands to look again at the party. Starmer was introduced by Ruth Smeeth, the former Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, who lost her seat in December’s election. It was pointless complaining about the result, Starmer said, adding: “Let’s be brutally honest with ourselves. When you lose an election in a democracy, you deserve to. You don’t look at the electorate and ask them: ‘What were you thinking?’ You look at yourself and ask: ‘What were we doing?’ “The Labour party has lost four general elections in a row. We’ve granted the Tories a decade of power. The Tories have had as many election winners in five years as we’ve had in 75. It’s a betrayal of what we believe in to let this go on. It’s time to get serious about winning.” Starmer stressed his efforts over combating antisemitism in Labour, saying the party was “becoming a competent, credible opposition”. He continued: “But that’s not enough. I didn’t come into politics to be in opposition, and neither did you. I came into politics to change lives. “Never again will Labour go into an election not being trusted on national security, with your job, with your community and with your money. That’s what being under new leadership means.” With the emphasis on winning elections, Starmer mentioned only three Labour leaders, all of whom had become prime minister: Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair. After condemning what he called the government’s incompetence in areas such as this summer’s exams results, and the Covid-19 death toll in care homes, Starmer turned his fire on Johnson, saying that “a crisis reveals character like nothing else”. “He’s just not serious. He’s just not up to the job,” Starmer said. “Whenever he encounters a problem, Johnson responds either by wishing it away or by lashing out.”
He continued: “While Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns about bendy bananas, I was defending victims and prosecuting terrorists. While he was being sacked by a newspaper for making up quotes, I was fighting for justice and the rule of law.” The mention of Brexit was relatively brief, as has been the recent case with Starmer. Calling the leave or remain debate “over”, the Labour leader said: “The prime minister has repeatedly promised that he will get a deal. So go on and get one.” Starmer ended with an appeal to voters who had abandoned Labour: “To those people in Doncaster and Deeside, in Glasgow and Grimsby, in Stoke and in Stevenage, to those who have turned away from Labour, I say this: we hear you. “Never again will Labour take you or the things you care about for granted. And I ask you: take another look at Labour. We’re under new leadership.” Allies praised Starmer for his tone and approach. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, tweeted: “Keir proves he’s in touch with what working families want – a chance to get on in life, a decent job and a guarantee that hard work pays.” But Momentum, which has been seeking to reinvent itself as a community campaigning group since Corbyn was replaced, said that while it welcomed the attacks on Johnson, the speech was lacking in specifics. Andrew Scattergood, the organisation’s co-chair, said: “If Starmer wants to appeal to working-class voters, his pitch should be based on solidarity with the working class and defending their interests, not just slogans and platitudes.” Scattergood pointed to comments by the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, indicating a possible shift away from Corbyn-era commitments such as increased income tax for top earners, and public ownership of utilities. He said: “Breaking your promises to your electorate is no way to win back trust. If Keir Starmer wants to win this country’s confidence, he must show he’s a man of his word, not another careerist politician who will say what is needed to win power and then abandon his promises once he gets there.”"
2020-09-22T11:59:15Z,politics,Politics,'Cutting it tight': Dover port still awaiting Brexit infrastructure funds,"Dover port is not Brexit ready because it is still waiting for government funds to be released for vital infrastructure for the new border operations, it has been revealed. It comes as it emerged that the government was considering forcing drivers to obtain a special Brexit passport before entering Kent in a bid to avert queuing chaos in January. Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit at the port, said the government was “cutting it quite tight” with just 100 days to go before Brexit is implemented on 1 January. “The government has a funding scheme which is due to open for application later this month. Clearly that’s cutting it quite tight for stuff to be actually delivered and in place, when significant civil works are involved, by early next year,” he told MPs on the Treasury select committee on Tuesday morning. The money needed to be “issued rather than talked about”, he said.
Chair of the committee, Conservative MP Mel Stride, said the government appeared to be leaving it “incredibly tight” and questioned why “in the latter part of September” there was still “talk about money being available for spades in the ground”. Reardon said he was confident the port itself would be ready but that not everything was in its control. His remarks come days after a leaked government “border and protocol delivery group” document raised the prospect of queues of up to 7,000 trucks on British roads in the event of drivers, carriers and ports not being Brexit ready. One solution being mooted by the government is a special HGV passport, a Kent access permit (KAP), which would only be issued to drivers who had completed their paperwork before boarding ferries or Eurotunnel trains. Labour MP Angela Eagle asked whether this would mean police guarding roads into Kent, raising the prospect of a Brexit border within the landmass of Britain. “Who’s going to be patrolling the Kent borders to make sure that no lorry goes into Kent if it hasn’t got that passport?” she asked. “Where are the border posts for going into Kent going to be? It’s all very well saying we are going to need it, but are we going to have Kent border police or border guards?” Confirmation of the KAP details are expected next week when the second border operating model is issued by HM Revenue & Customs. Also eagerly awaited are details of how goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be treated. Sources said that behind the scenes “good progress” had been made at the UK and EU joint committee, which Gove chairs with the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, and that the chances of security declarations being waived were good. This is despite the explosive row between the EU and UK over the internal markets bill. It was confirmed on Tuesday that the committee will resume its work on Monday fuelling hopes of a breakthrough on Northern Ireland."
2020-09-22T11:25:19Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmerâ€™s message to the Labour party: I am not Jeremy Corbyn,"Keir Starmer’s first party conference speech as leader had been pitched in advance as a moment to set out his values and vision – which sceptics of his leadership have grumbled are hard to discern. Tuesday’s speech at an arts centre in Doncaster fulfilled that brief: Starmer spoke about, “a country that embodies the values I hold dear. Decency, fairness, opportunity, compassion and security”. But the much stronger message woven though the speech was a different one: I am not Jeremy Corbyn. It began even before the Labour leader had said a word, as he was introduced by the Jewish former Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who has been a leading critic of her party’s record on antisemitism. Smeeth talked about the “visceral racism” directed at Jewish colleagues, who had been “bullied out” of the party – and underlined Starmer’s determination to take a different approach. When Starmer took to the podium, he didn’t mention his immediate predecessor by name, instead making reference to the three Labour leaders who have won elections since the war: Attlee, Wilson and Blair. In what appeared to be a veiled criticism of the Corbyn leadership’s political nostalgia – for wholesale nationalisation, sectoral collective bargaining and the banners and brass bands of the Durham miner’s gala – Starmer said the message from all those election-winning leaders was, “don’t look back, look to the future”. “What we say at the next general election isn’t written yet. But it will be rooted in Labour values. It won’t sound like anything you’ve heard before. It will sound like the future arriving,” he said. He swatted away the idea, promulgated by Corbyn himself in an Observer article after December’s defeat, that despite losing scores of seats, Labour had “won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate”. By contrast, Starmer told his online audience: “Let’s be blunt. Let’s be brutally honest with ourselves. When you lose an election in a democracy, you deserve to. You don’t look at the electorate and ask them: “what were you thinking?” You look at yourself and ask: “what were we doing?” And he rejected another central element of Corbyn’s playbook, too – the determination to avoid personal attacks on the Tories. “They go low, we go high” was a strongly-held principle for Corbyn. But Starmer’s team believe the contrast between their man and the prime minister is one that can only benefit Labour – particularly after six months of botched handling of the pandemic. “This is the big difference between the prime minister and me: while Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns about bendy bananas, I was defending victims and prosecuting terrorists. While he was being sacked by a newspaper for making up quotes, I was fighting for justice and the rule of law,” Starmer said. There was also a jibe at what Corbyn’s critics sometimes claimed was his ambivalence about actually winning a general election. “It’s time to get serious about winning. That means we have to change, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said – adding, as if to hammer the point home, “this is a party under new leadership”. That appeared somewhat different to the tone during his leadership campaign, when to placate Corbyn’s army of leftwing supporters, Starmer signed up to 10 “pledges,” which included a wholesale adoption of much of the 2019 Labour platform. There was little or no policy on view on Tuesday. Unlike Corbyn, who faced the imminent threat of a general election throughout much of his leadership, Starmer has the luxury of at least another four years to make his case – and party strategists see little benefit in showing their cards now. Instead, he signalled his intention to continue attacking the government over its incompetence – Labour’s central, simple message, pasted into every press release. Another Covid lockdown, Starmer said, would be “a sign of government failure, not an act of God”. Perhaps the only topic where some continuity between Corbyn’s Labour and Starmer’s was discernible was a deeply ironic one: Brexit. Back in 2018, Corbyn was lambasted by many in his party for saying a Labour government would go ahead and implement the result of the referendum. That stance resulted not just from Corbyn’s instinctive Eurosceptism, but from fears among some in his top team about the electoral impact in Labour heartland seats of ignoring the Brexit vote. Starmer’s was among the voices urging Corbyn towards the position ultimately adopted for the general election last year, of promising another referendum. But since December’s crushing defeat, Starmer too has regarded Brexit as a done deal (as indeed, since 31 January, it is). Corbyn and his close allies could have been excused for raising a wry eyebrow at their laptops, as Starmer insisted, “let me be absolutely clear. The debate between leave and remain is over. We’re not going to be a party that keeps banging on about Europe.”"
2020-09-21T21:30:00Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to urge 'red wall' voters to take another look at Labour,"Keir Starmer is to appeal directly to “red wall” voters who abandoned the party last year to “take another look at Labour”, telling them his party loves Britain and is under new leadership. Speaking from Doncaster, South Yorkshire on Tuesday at the online event replacing Labour’s annual conference, Starmer will stress a change in approach for Labour since he succeeded Jeremy Corbyn. “To those people in Doncaster and Deeside, in Glasgow and Grimsby, in Stoke and in Stevenage, to those who have turned away from Labour, I say this: we hear you,” he will tell the online-only conference. “I ask you: take another look at Labour. We’re under new leadership; we love this country as you do.” While key elements of the speech are calculated to resonate broadly, notably a pledge to close gaps in educational attainment and to provide a long-term vision for social care, the direct appeal to former Labour voters in northern and Midlands towns forms part of a wider post-Corbyn rebranding. Amid concern within Starmer’s team that Labour had become too closely associated with critiquing the UK, the hope is to provide a more positive vision, based around the values of “decency, fairness, opportunity, compassion and security”. “My vision for Britain is simple: I want this to be the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in. A country in which we put family first,” he will say, according to extracts of the speech released in advance. In more personal elements, Starmer will point to his own background as the first member of his family to go to university, and his rise to become director of public prosecutions before entering parliament. In a direct challenge to Boris Johnson’s much-touted “levelling up” plan, Starmer will call for opportunities such as his to be spread nationally. He will talk of: “An economy that doesn’t force people to move hundreds of miles from family and friends just to find a decent job. “One that truly works for all regions and nations of this United Kingdom, with opportunity and security in every part of the country and at every stage of our lives.” As well as the constraint of no live audience, Starmer will be competing against the public and political focus on coronavirus, with the speech being moved forward by an hour to avoid clashing with Johnson’s address to parliament on the subject. He will give the speech from the Danum gallery, library and museum in Doncaster, which – although itself represented by Labour MPs – is surrounded by constituencies that turned blue at the last election. Other elements of the speech will seek to sketch out a more distinct vision on other issues, such as a greater focus on the climate emergency, with Starmer promising that a policy will be “judged not just by how much it costs today but by what it does for the planet tomorrow”. Labour MPs and members will closely scrutinise his words for signs of the direction Starmer seeks to take the party, beyond his team’s initial focus on attempting to project an image of competence and responsibility. In winning the leadership in April, Starmer repudiated little of Corbyn’s sometimes radical platform, but has since been coy about policy ideas. This has brought frustration from some sceptics in the party, despite Labour’s subsequent rise in the polls. The new message for the party was also evident in Monday’s speech to conference by Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor – which also had to be moved, so as to not clash with a coronavirus briefing by the government’s two top scientific advisers. Dodds stressed Labour’s different approach to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, reiterating her call for some sort of targeted employment support to replace the soon-to-end furlough scheme. She highlighted her intention to ensure “public money was always spent wisely – targeted where it’s needed most, not splurged where it isn’t”. This message of fiscal responsibility was repeated several times, with calls for “value for money” on government contracts. She added: “We in Labour know that if you are responsible with public money, it can transform lives.” A more obviously contrasting vision to that of the government was set out on Monday with the speech by Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, saying Priti Patel “likes to talk tough”. “When it comes to issuing press releases and talk of mobilising the armed forces against dinghies she’s there,” he said. “With her words, she seeks to divide when she should seek to unite. Yet, she fails to act when injustice stares her in the face. “Let me be clear: as home secretary, I would not stand by whilst the victims of the Windrush scandal continue to suffer. It is the least we owe to that remarkable generation of people who were so shamefully treated.”"
2020-09-21T18:43:43Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May says 'reckless' Brexit bill risks UK's reputation,"Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on the government’s plan to give itself powers to renege on the special arrangements for Northern Ireland in the Brexit deal. She described the plans as “reckless” and “irresponsible” and said they “risked the integrity of the United Kingdom”, as they would not only tarnish Britain’s reputation globally as an upholder of the law but could contribute to a reunited Ireland. In a strongly worded speech in the House of Commons, she said: “I cannot emphasise enough how concerned I am [that] the Conservative government is willing to go back on its word to break an international agreement signed in good faith, and to break international law.” Sitting beside two former Conservative party Northern Ireland secretaries, Karen Bradley and Theresa Villiers, and Sir Bob Neill, who threatened a backbench rebellion against the government, she said there could never be a time a minister could walk through the voting lobbies and say yes to breaking the law. May said the bill would also mean trust would be undermined in future negotiations with other countries. “So much for global Britain,” she quipped. The Belfast South MP, the SDLP’s Claire Hanna, said Boris Johnson’s government had to own the consequences of the type of Brexit it agreed and should not “feign shock” when nine months later it emerged there would be trade barriers between east and west. “The government is acting recklessly and irresponsibly with no thought to the long-term impact on the standing of the United Kingdom in the world. This will lead to untold damage to the United Kingdom’s reputation. It puts the future of the United Kingdom at risk. And, as a result, with regret, I have to tell the minister I cannot support this bill,” she said. The bill, which is designed to regulate trade within the UK after Brexit, was unveiled by Downing Street two weeks ago, catching Conservative MPs, opposition parties and the EU off guard. A backbench rebellion, now thought to have been brought under control by Downing Street, emerged when it became clear the bill included three clauses that would allow the government to disapply parts of the Northern Ireland protocol without regard to the co-signatories of an international treaty. The Northern Ireland Office minister Robin Walker defended the clauses, saying they were needed to ensure nothing in the protocol of the withdrawal agreement “prevents unfettered access from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK”. But May hit back and said there were three reasons why clauses 41 to 45 had “no place” in the bill and could weaken support for Westminster in Northern Ireland. “That, in turn will lead to some communities having less willingness to trust the United Kingdom government and that would have a consequence on the willingness of people in Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom,” she said. “So, far from acting to reinforce the integrity of the United Kingdom, in pursuit of trying to appear to be tough to the European Union, I think the government is putting the integrity of the United Kingdom at risk,” the former prime minister added. The former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith said he did “not believe a word” of claims that breaking international law would undermine trust in the UK because, he said, the EU itself broke international law."
2020-09-21T18:38:42Z,politics,Politics,From scandal to PR cock-up: how the Boris Johnson Perugia mystery unravelled,"When someone at Perugia airport decided to drum up a bit of publicity on the back of the footballer Luis Suárez flying to Italy, they were probably hoping for a couple of lines somewhere in the sports pages. They got a lot more than that. Four days later, an innocuous press release about celebrity guests spotted at the airport resulted in a British media feeding frenzy – as well as an angry denial from Downing Street, an intervention from Westminster Cathedral, the forensic analysis of a backbencher’s Zoom records, and a sheepish clarification that Boris Johnson was not the same person as Tony Blair.
The mayhem began when the Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported on claims that Johnson had made a secret trip to Umbria a week earlier. “There is a new mystery surrounding Boris Johnson,” the English-language version of the story began, before explaining that airport sources had said he had flown into and out of the airport either side of a weekend getaway to the region. There was speculation about a visit to the nearby estate of the Evening Standard owner and imminent lord Evgeny Lebedev, possibly in order to baptise his son. The story had emerged, la Repubblica reported, from a press release put out by the airport after disgruntled Barcelona star Suárez’s visit to take an Italian test, and thereby secure himself an EU passport that would ease any transfer. “Over the past few days, many names and personalities from the political, sporting and economic world have arrived here in Perugia,” the statement said. “From Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli to the British PM Boris Johnson, preceded by Tony Blair (former UK premier) and not least the champion footballer Luis Suárez … Umbria and our airport are at the centre of the world.” About 1,000 miles north of the centre of the world, a Downing Street source was quoted flatly saying that “this claim is wrong”. . But such interventions hold little sway with critics of the government who remember – among other indiscretions – Downing Street sources’ complex relationship with the truth over the Dominic Cummings affair. It did not help that Johnson had been busted on an incognito trip to the region before, captured in an infamous photograph looking bleary-eyed and bedraggled after a weekend at Lebedev’s castle. Before long, scenting old Etonian blood over an allegation that appeared to place the prime minister in the Italian countryside even as Brexit talks and the coronavirus pandemic lurched into their latest states of crisis, social media users had enthusiastically taken up the mystery as a national scandal. There were memes of Italian eye tests, new claims that a “lady on the check-in desk” had confirmed the story, and derision of the idea that anyone would take the word of the prime minister over that of an anonymous airport PR, which is probably not the ringing endorsement on trust that Johnson was hoping for as he weighs the wisdom of a second lockdown. By Monday afternoon, though, the story had comprehensively unravelled. First Grant Shapps denied it. Then the backbencher Andrea Jenkyns gave the Sun a screengrab of Johnson on a Zoom call when he was supposed to be cavorting in a medieval palazzo. While the prime minister certainly looked like he would rather have been anywhere else, the picture did appear to place him firmly in Downing Street. Johnson could not have been in Italy, it was then said, because his son’s christening had taken place in London – an assertion later backed up by Westminster Cathedral. Finally, the airport issued a crimson-faced clarification. Records had been checked, and the single passenger on a private flight from Farnborough was “a private citizen and not Boris Johnson”; meanwhile, the enthusiastic PR person had simply confused two British prime ministers, and accidentally made it sound as if they’d both made a trip. And with that, Perugia airport’s brief intrusion into Britain’s political consciousness was over."
2020-09-21T18:01:26Z,politics,Politics,Italian airport quashes claims of secret Boris Johnson trip,"An Italian airport has quashed reports the prime minister landed there to make a secretive trip to the country less than a fortnight ago, a claim described by Downing Street as “completely untrue”.
Citing unnamed sources, La Repubblica and Umbria 24 on Sunday reported that Johnson landed in Perugia on 11 September and left on 14 September. The story emerged after the airport issued a statement on 17 September boasting about the arrivals of a host of VIPs, including Johnson and former prime minister Tony Blair “in recent days”. No 10 issued a firm rebuttal of the report on Monday morning, saying Johnson had held a meeting with Conservative MPs via Zoom on Friday 11 September, and had attended his son’s baptism service on Saturday 12 September. The president of Perugia’s San Francesco d’Assisi airport said on Monday afternoon there had been an “error” in previous communication and that Johnson did not recently land there. “He absolutely did not recently land in Perugia. In recent years, yes, he passed through, but not recently,” Stefano Panato told the Guardian. “I have checked the registries and spoken to people, this is the official denial.” Panato said the newspapers’ sources may have mistaken Blair for Johnson. “Tony Blair arrived the 13th and left 14th. Someone said the British prime minister had passed through but the British prime minister is no longer Tony Blair,” he said. The Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported on Johnson’s alleged trip to Italy after the Barcelona footballer Luis Suárez flew into Perugia on 17 September. The airport issued a press release saying that as well as Suárez, Johnson had also arrived there in recent days. La Repubblica said that after it made inquiries about the Johnson trip, the airport, confirmed he had landed there during the week before Suárez came. The newspaper cited one airport staff member as saying the British PM arrived either on 11 September, or the day before. Another source said he had arrived on Friday 11 September at 2pm and left on Monday 14 September at 7.45am. A Downing Street spokesman said: “This story is completely untrue. The prime minister has not travelled to Italy in recent months. Anyone who publishes these claims is repeating a falsehood.” A spokesperson for Westminster Cathedral confirmed that baby Wilfred was baptised into the Catholic church in a private service on 12 September by Father Daniel Humphreys. There were fewer than 30 guests at the ceremony as required by Covid restrictions, the spokesperson said. The Catholic church requires at least one parent to practise the faith in order to have a child baptised. Johnson was baptised a Catholic but was confirmed in the Church of England – in effect converting to Anglicanism – when he was at Eton, although he has never been a regular churchgoer. His partner, Carrie Symonds’ Catholicism was not widely known until now. The claim of Johnson making a seemingly undercover visit to Perugia was especially intriguing as he had done it before. In April 2018, while he was foreign secretary, Johnson was photographed looking somewhat dishevelled at San Francesco d’Assisi airport. It emerged that Johnson had stayed at Palazzo Terranova, a restored castle owned by the media billionaire and socialite Evgeny Lebedev, who is renowned for holding lavish parties. The pictures of Johnson at the airport suggested he went to Italy without a police escort. According to another passenger on the flight back to the UK, Johnson was on his own, apparently without any luggage and very much the worse for wear."
2020-09-21T17:51:03Z,politics,Politics,And it's bad news from them: downbeat double act deliver Covid facts | John Crace,"Where was Boris Johnson? Normally whenever the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser are giving a Downing Street briefing, the prime minister – or failing that, a cabinet minister – is on view alongside them. But on Monday, Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty went out just as a double act. Either because they didn’t trust the prime minister not to undermine the gravity of the situation – Boris hates being the bearer of bad news and can usually be relied on to make light of the situation – or because the government is paralysed and has no idea how to act on the new information. Not that what Whitty and Vallance had to say came as any great surprise. It has been clear for some time now that the coronavirus pandemic has been getting rapidly worse and the two lugubrious amigos, who have always seemed most comfortable when downbeat, just laid out the data as plainly as they could. Infection rates were doubling every seven days; by mid-November there could be 200 deaths a day; only 8% of the population had been infected so herd immunity was a pipe dream; the virus wasn’t getting milder though treatment had improved; people can’t be trusted to manage their own risk as it increases everyone else’s risk. The use of the term “world-beating” was now on the proscribed list. Testing wasn’t even mentioned. They had seen the way things had gone in France and Spain before and how the UK had still suffered more deaths than both countries. With France and Spain currently experiencing a second wave could we afford to outperform their fatality rates again? You’ve got to ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? Having raced through the “we’re basically still screwed” scenario, Whitty and Vallance made a dash for the exit without taking any questions. Their job was to level with the public over how they saw the science, not provide solutions. That was for the politicians who had been notable by their absence. So we never got to learn what the CSA and CMO made of the government’s previous pronouncements on getting back to work and eating out to help out. Or indeed the effect of Dominic Cummings’ Durham safari. Neither did we find out how rigorously the “rule of six” should be implemented – Boris has always been notably relaxed on this – or if it had ever been a good idea; whether pubs and restaurants should be closed or given curfews; if new lockdowns should be imposed or what constituted “unnecessary contact between households”. Nor what the scientists considered an acceptable trade-off between prioritising public health – including non-Covid illnesses – and minimising the effects on the economy. That was all well above their pay grade. And for the time being at least, seemingly above the pay grade of the prime minister. At a time of national anxiety that had just been ramped up several notches by the press conference, all the chickens were headless. The inescapable inference was that the government was clueless, had largely been making things up as they went along and that all the difficult decisions were now just too difficult. It all seemed a long way from Johnson’s previous remarks that things would be back to normal by Christmas. Around lunchtime it was announced that the prime minister would be responding to Whitty and Vallance’s presentation with a statement the following day. That just left Matt Hancock to give his by now customary Monday Commons update on the announcements he had either made the previous Friday or leaked to the Sunday papers. As the CMO and the CSA had said, the situation was critical, he said – Matt is one of their biggest fans in cabinet, so there would be further local lockdowns, £10,000 fines for persistent rule-breakers, a £500 hardship payment for people on low incomes forced to self-isolate and an exemption for carers looking after children under the age of 14. Labour’s Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, had little to say in reply. Partly because none of what Hancock had said was news. Though, not for the first time, he did wonder why the test-and-trace system was still in such a mess after the government had had several relatively quiet months to put in place measures that really could make a difference over the autumn and winter. Matt merely shrugged. Either he too had given up on the UK’s record on test and trace or he couldn’t believe it should still be a bone of contention. It was Chris Grayling, Simon Clarke and Graham Brady who gave Hancock the hardest time, however. There is a growing band of Tory libertarians who think the government has gone far too far in its efforts to keep people alive during the coronavirus pandemic and that too many restrictions have already been imposed. The cure was turning out to be worse than the disease, they claimed. We were turning into a Stasi state and it was time for every true-born Brit to be free to take whatever risks they saw fit. Matt decided just to humour them with polite pleasantries. For once this was not his fight. Tomorrow, Boris would have to come to the Commons and explain that while he might have sounded a bit casual about lockdown in the past, this time he really, really meant it. How far he would go on further lockdowns and restrictions on social gatherings, Hancock hadn’t a clue. Though Matt was sure he would support them regardless of whether he agreed with them. Because that’s what Door Matts do."
2020-09-21T17:37:41Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: alert level to be raised from 3 to 4; Northern Ireland bans mixing indoors,"The UK has â€œturned a cornerâ€� for the worse and is on course for up to 50,000 new daily cases of Covid-19 by mid-October, which could lead to 200 deaths a day by the following month, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific and medical advisers have warned. A few hours after their briefing the Covid alert level was raised for the first time since the system was introduced in the spring; it is now back up at level 4, meaning â€œtransmission is high or rising exponentiallyâ€�. (See 5.44pm.) The statements seem intended to ready the public for an announcement from Boris Johnson tomorrow which is expected to see restrictions tightened in some way at a national level, not just locally as has been the case in recent weeks. Johnson will chair cabinet and a meeting of Cobra before announcing the measures in the Commons in the early afternoon. Today he spoke to the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in advance of the decision. Afterwards No 10 put out a statement saying the PM and the first ministers had â€œall agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks aheadâ€�. And Nicola Sturgeon, who will make her own announcement tomorrow, posted this on Twitter.
Scottish ministers are considering far-reaching restrictions to combat the surge in Covid cases including local lockdowns linked to school holidays next month, travel restrictions, closing play parks and shutting down hairdressers, a leak has revealed. About a quarter of the Welsh population will be subject to local lockdowns after sharp rises in Covid-19 cases triggered restrictions in four new areas. Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, has announced everyone in the region will now be covered by a ban on mixing in other peopleâ€™s homes.
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has announced that in England there will be an exemption for childcare from local lockdown measures. (See 3.46pm.) He also announced how people will be prioritised for testing. (See 4.59pm.) Thatâ€™s all from me. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here:"
2020-09-21T13:42:18Z,politics,Politics,Tory donor's husband 'given $8m by Kremlin-linked oligarch',"A Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin has secretly funded the husband of Lubov Chernukhin, a Russian-born donor to the Conservative party, according to the BBC’s Panorama programme. Chernukhin has given £1.7m to the Conservatives over the past eight years. In February, she bid £45,000 at a charity auction to play tennis with Boris Johnson, and previously spent £165,000 for another tennis game with Johnson – the then mayor of London – and David Cameron. Leaked files show that Chernukhin’s husband Vladimir – a former deputy economics minister in Vladimir Putin’s government – received $8m (£6.1m). The money came from Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian billionaire sanctioned in 2018 by the US Treasury. Chernukhin’s lawyers say her donations to the Tories are not tainted by Kremlin influence. The $8m transaction emerged in a leak of banking “suspicious activity reports” called the FinCEN files and seen by Panorama. It shows that Vladimir Chernukhin received the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Kerimov and his family. The transfer took place on 29 April 2016, two months before the EU referendum vote that led to Brexit. The majority of Chernukhin’s donations to the Conservatives – more than £1.5m – took place after this date. It is not clear if any of that cash went to the Tories, Panorama reported. Officials at Deutsche Bank in New York raised concerns about the payment, which was among $278.5m of transactions involving the offshore company. It was made by Definition Services Inc, a firm controlled by Kerimov’s children. The BBC cited documents that show the company’s funding comes from Kerimov himself. Deutsche said Definition operated in a “high-risk jurisdiction” and said one of its “large transactions” was sent to Vladimir Chernukhin. According to Panorama, it said “the commercial purpose of the transactions and the relationship between the parties could not be determined”. Kerimov is one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals with a fortune put at $22bn. His rise has been fuelled by loans from Russian state banks and his investments included Polyus Gold, Russia’s biggest gold producer, now owned by Kerimov’s son Said. In 2013, Vladimir Chernukhin sat on the company’s board. The US Treasury sanctioned Kerimov together with other oligarchs linked to Putin. It said the Russian government operated “for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites” and engaged in “a range of malign activity around the globe”. Lawyers for Vladimir Chernukhin declined to say whether he received $8m from Kerimov, with the money designated in the leaked files for “property projects”. They said Lubov Chernukhin had never received cash from Kerimov or “any company related to him”. Her donations to the Conservatives were not “tainted by Kremlin or any other influence”, they added, and were in line with electoral commission rules. “None of the money donated to the Conservative party by Mrs Chernukhin came, or was in any way derived from, Mr Kerimov,” they said. Kerimov’s lawyer denied Panorama’s allegations and said they had “no dealings with Ms Chernukhin whatsoever”. Labour politicians called on Monday for the Conservative party to return Lubov Chernukhin’s money. A former banker, she is the biggest female donor in British political history. Chris Bryant – a one-time Europe minister – said the party was “utterly complacent and naive” about accepting Russian-linked cash.
The Conservatives have rejected similar calls in the past from the SNP. A spokesperson said: A Conservative party spokesperson said: “There are people in this country of Russian origin who are British citizens and have the democratic right to donate to a political party. Many have been vocal critics of Putin and it is completely wrong and discriminatory to smear them all with the same brush.” The leaked banking documents were provided to BuzzFeed News, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, BBC Panorama and other media outlets. The documents are said to suggest major banks provided financial services to high-risk individuals from around the world, in some cases even after the US government had sanctioned them. The documents relate to more than $2tn of transactions dating from between 1999 and 2017. • This article was amended on 22 September 2020 because while Vladimir Chernukhin sat on the board of Polyus Gold briefly in 2013, it was not for an extended period as an earlier version may have implied."
2020-09-21T05:00:06Z,politics,Politics,Momentum to focus on resisting evictions during Covid-19 crisis,"Momentum, the political group closely linked to Jeremy Corbyn’s former leadership of the Labour party, is launching what it calls a “resistance campaign” against residential evictions as part of a shift in focus for the organisation towards community-based action. With the government allowing court eviction hearings in England and Wales to resume from 20 September, there are concerns that tens of thousands of people who have fallen into rent arrears amid the coronavirus crisis could lose their homes. Momentum has linked up with Acorn and the London Renters Union, which represent tenants, and is organising members who will take action such as peacefully resisting eviction attempts by bailiffs. The group will also campaign for an extension of at least a year to the eviction ban, as well as an amnesty for rent arrears built up amid the pandemic, with parallel, means-tested support for landlords, and a wider end to “no fault” evictions. It marks a new direction for Momentum, the grassroots campaigning organisation which, while officially separate from Corbyn, became widely seen as a vanguard force for his leadership and policies within the party. Some Momentum members had believed the group was in danger of becoming just another Labour faction, based largely around seeking influence in local parties and promoting particular policies. After Keir Starmer replaced Corbyn as Labour leader, Momentum held its own internal elections, in which candidates from a reforming wing called Forward Momentum won all 20 seats on its governing body, the national coordinating group.
The new leadership has decided to pursue what is seen as a shift in attitude and tone, based around more community organising, with the anti-evictions campaign the first phase of this. The group says the scale of the crisis is shown by estimates of more than 220,000 private renters having fallen into arrears, and an estimated 60,000 eviction notices served. Andrew Scattergood, Momentum’s co-chair, who is a regional secretary for the Fire Brigades Union, said: “As we face the worst recession in 300 years, working-class people are once again paying the price, with redundancies coming in thick and fast and hundreds of thousands already unable to pay their rents, while British billionaires increase their total wealth by 20%.” The expected rush of evictions would not only bring destitution, but “risks causing a surge in overcrowded living conditions, which has already led to hotspots of Covid-19 deaths”, he said. “Momentum will not stand idly by while this Tory government forces working-class people to bear the brunt of a crisis of the Tories’ own making, in order to safeguard private profits. That’s why we’re supporting our activists to help at risk tenants in their communities by mobilising to peacefully resist bailiffs and stop these evictions from taking place.” Lee Burkwood, from the London Renters Union, said: “Hundreds of our members have attended trainings recently and we’re ready to support our members to stay in their homes and non-violently prevent bailiffs from carrying out evictions.”"
2020-09-20T21:30:03Z,politics,Politics,Anneliese Dodds to accuse Tories of 'file of failure' over jobs,"The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, will accuse the Conservatives of wasting billions of pounds of public money through botched outsourcing and poorly-designed job schemes, as she delivers her party conference speech on Monday. Addressing “Connected”, an online event replacing Labour’s annual conference, Dodds will highlight a “file of failure”, as she seeks to underline the Tories’ poor record. She will claim that Rishi Sunak’s “job retention bonus,” the £1,000-a-head payout that firms will be able to claim in January for staff they have brought back from furlough and kept on the payroll, could mean £2.6bn being paid to firms that would have retained staff anyway. And Dodds will also raise questions about a series of outsourcing contracts, including £133m paid to a consortium involving Randox, the testing firm that employs the former Tory minister Owen Paterson, and £150m for facemasks that weren’t suitable for frontline NHS staff, from the investment firm Ayanda. She will accuse the chancellor of having a “cavalier” attitude to spending public money. Dodds will set out more details of what a Labour government would do to protect the jobs market in the coming months, including a “national retraining strategy” to help prepare for alternative employment, and support for businesses who may struggle to repay the emergency loans they received from the Treasury. Labour has repeatedly warned about the risks of bringing the government’s furlough scheme to an abrupt end next month, but had previously given few details about what should replace it, saying it must not be “one size fits all”. Dodds has been a relatively low-key figure since becoming Keir Starmer’s surprise pick for shadow chancellor. Labour strategists are keen to raise her profile as they present the shadow cabinet as a government in waiting. She will contrast her record of campaigning for tougher financial regulation in parliament and before that as an MEP, with Sunak’s past jobs in the City. “While the chancellor was profiting from a financial system that took huge risks and then passed them on to ordinary people, I helped to rein it in,” Dodds will say. Responding to reports of what Dodds planned to say, Steve Barclay MP, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “All Sir Keir Starmer and his team have to offer are the recycled economic plans of Jeremy Corbyn, which would hold our country back and hinder our recovery from coronavirus.” Dodds’ intervention comes as Labour seeks to put the pressure on the Conservatives for cronyism. Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, has written to the new cabinet secretary, calling the Tory peer Dido Harding’s appointment to be head of the new National Institute for Health Protection a “flagrant” breach of the civil service code. Civil servants are not allowed to act “in a way determined by party political considerations” – but Harding has continued to vote on the Conservative side in the Lords."
2020-09-20T17:00:50Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson's Brexit bill straight out of Trump playbook, David Lammy says","Boris Johnson’s law-breaking Brexit bill is straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, and leaves justice secretary Robert Buckland looking “a very small figure,” says shadow justice secretary David Lammy. As the controversial internal market bill returns to the House of Commons this week, the prime minister appears to have bought off most Tory rebels by promising a parliamentary vote before the powers in it would be used. But Lammy, who was a barrister and the first black Briton to attend Harvard law school before becoming Labour MP for Tottenham, says the government has dented the UK’s standing in the world by legislating to tear up the Brexit withdrawal agreement that Johnson himself signed up to. “The conservatives have abandoned the rule of law, abandoning an international agreement which we signed up to just a year ago and then claiming as we go to negotiate trade deals with the rest of the world that they can’t see this,” he said. “It’s a very, very curious position. I’ve never seen it in my lifetime.” Asked about the government’s motive for the drastic measure, which Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis openly conceded would break international law, Lammy said it was “populism” and compared it to the no-holds-barred politics of the Trump White House. “It’s a playbook. Notes are passed, strategies discussed,” he says.
“People describe [Johnson’s chief adviser] Dominic Cummings as a revolutionary, and I’m afraid … it’s not clear where [Johnson] stands because he hasn’t really got a position. He will take the position that’s most advantageous to him at that particular point in his life; and he’s attached himself to some very dangerous people determined to get their way. And I don’t know what they’ll leave behind but I think Britain will be a very different country.” Asked about the role of Buckland, Lammy said:“I think he’s looked a very small figure.” He cited the resignations of Richard Keen as advocate general for Scotland, and head of the government’s legal department Jonathan Jones over the legislation, and criticism of the legislation by the Bar Association and the Law Society. Lammy said: “He is in a unique position, because he is the only cabinet member to have made a special undertaking to stand up for the rule of law. And he hasn’t stood up for the rule of law, he’s rolled over, he’s allowed his belly to be tickled.” With the Tories keen to portray Labour as “soft on crime” Lammy stressed the government’s poor record in keeping the streets safe – as well as the importance of rehabilitation. “They’re committed to giving us 20,000 police officers – the 20,000 police officers that they’ve cut. And what that has meant is that crime is soaring. It is an absolute disgrace that knife crime, gang crime, drug crime is all up under this government, and the serious violence taskforce I was asked to sit on by Theresa May has not met under Priti Patel.” Lammy highlighted the fact that Labour had backed recent changes to anti-terror laws in the wake of the Streatham and Fishmonger’s Hall attacks, saying: “We’re not afraid to be clear that sentencing has to reflect the public mood.” But he added: “I do believe in second chances. I do believe in rehabilitation. I want probation restored. The vast majority of prisoners have to come out one day, and you want them to come out and not go back and commit more crime.” An ardent supporter of calls for a people’s vote during the last parliament, Lammy was plucked from the backbenches by Keir Starmer when he won the Labour leadership earlier this year. Lammy said that under Starmer, Labour had begun to “get our mojo back” and said the party was “enjoying a kind of renewed professionalism”. But he stressed the “long haul” to the next general election in 2024. Starmer has been criticised by some BAME MPs and party members for failing to take the Black Lives Matter movement seriously enough. But Lammy praised his leader’s refusal to be drawn into a culture war. “The key issues of our time are the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy and the huge joblessness,” he said. “Yes, Boris Johnson would prefer you to believe that the key issue is securing Winston Churchill’s statue, or singing at the Proms. But that’s a distraction – and Labour would be being incredibly naive if it fell into those distractions.”"

Hancock has said that people should report anyone failing to self-isolate to the police - apparently contradicting Boris Johnson, who said last week he had “never much been in favour of sneak culture myself”. Asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr whether he would snitch on a neighbour to police himself, Hancock said: Yes. And for the self-isolation part, that is absolutely necessary because that is how we break the chains of transmission. Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government should act “in the next few days” to tackle the rising number of coronavirus cases, instead of waiting for weeks. (See 10.20am.) Starmer has said that Labour should be less shy about expressing its patriotism. (See 12.26pm.) Shortly after he made the comment in an interview on Times Radio, his deputy Angela Rayner used her speech to Labour’s virtual conference to argue that the “fire and rehire” policies being adopted by some major firms were not just immoral but unBritish. (See 12.19pm.) She said: Mass firing, and re-hiring, on lower pay and worse terms, using the threat of the dole queue to pick the pockets of the very staff who have kept those companies going. So I say to companies like British Airways and British Gas. If you use our country’s name, then you better respect our country’s values. Rayner used her speech to condemn Boris Johnson as a “Bullingdon Club blagger” less equipped to serve as prime minister than any of his predecessors. (See 12.19pm.)

2020-09-20T10:59:48Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs plot rebellion over renewal of emergency Covid laws,"Conservative MPs irked by the government’s sweeping lockdown measures are plotting a rebellion when emergency Covid legislation is renewed this month, led by the party grandee Sir Graham Brady. Many Tories have publicly expressed their frustration at aspects of the restrictions. Some are also concerned the emergency law passed six months ago leaves too much power in the hands of ministers. There is also irritation at policy being announced in late-night briefings to journalists instead of in the House of Commons. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, recently threatened to run the health secretary, Matt Hancock, “ragged” if he persisted in making announcements to the press instead of MPs. Brady told the Sunday Telegraph: “In March, parliament gave the government sweeping emergency powers at a time when parliament was about to go into recess and there was realistic concern that NHS care capacity might be overwhelmed by Covid-19. “We now know that the NHS coped well with the challenge of the virus and parliament has been sitting largely since April. There is now no justification for ministers ruling by emergency powers without reference to normal democratic processes. “It is essential that going forward all of these massively important decisions for family life, and affecting people’s jobs and businesses, should be exercised with proper supervision and control.” Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, plans to try to amend the legislation to allow a parliamentary vote each time new emergency powers are used, or restrictions introduced. His intervention is a sign of the scale of disquiet among Boris Johnson’s backbenchers about the way he is handling the pandemic. Some Conservative MPs, such as Desmond Swayne of New Forest West, are concerned the government’s restrictions are too draconian. Swayne has complained that rules on face coverings were imposed without “the democratic legitimate right to ask you the counter case and vote upon it in parliament”. Others have expressed doubts about the “rule of six”, though government sources said this was imposed through pre-existing public health law without requiring powers in the coronavirus Act. The six-month review of the Covid-19 legislation was agreed to by the government in March amid pressure from Labour and some backbench Conservatives. The lawcontained a wide range of powers, from allowing ministers to limit the size of social gatherings to permitting funeral directors to register deaths where relatives were unable to do so. It is unclear whether Labour is planning to support the wholesale renewal of the legislation or back Brady’s amendment."
2020-09-20T08:00:40Z,politics,Politics,"‘I’m terrified of causing trouble’: Sasha Swire, a diarist creating a Tory storm","It is already being described as a publishing sensation, four days before going on sale. And a quick glimpse at almost any one of its 544 pages instantly reveals why. Sasha Swire’s Diary of an MP’s Wife, in which she unceremoniously dishes the dirt on Tory “friends” from David and Samantha Cameron, to Michael Gove and his wife Sarah Vine as well as George Osborne and Boris Johnson, is so full of spice, gossip and disloyalty that it is hard to know where to start.
Swire is a former journalist, the wife of old Etonian MP Sir Hugo Swire and daughter of former Tory defence secretary Sir John Nott. They live opulently in a huge pile in the West Country. However, Hugo never made it to the cabinet, even under the premiership of his old friend Cameron, and something clearly rankles. In the twilight of her husband’s career, Swire has now made up for the couple’s relative lack of notoriety (in the lofty circles in which they exist) and struck out. Throughout her memoir the anecdotes flow about sex, alcohol and lewd behaviour in the ruling Tory elite. Past indiscretions and very private jokes between old friends, in their rarified snobby world, are told as if the original acts and then the telling of them are both entirely normal and to be expected. The competition for most embarrassing revelation is stiff indeed. But one stands out. Swire claims that during a coastal walk with the former prime minister in Cornwall in 2011, Cameron told her to stride behind him rather than ahead on the path because “the scent you are wearing is affecting my pheromones. It makes me want to grab you and push you into the bushes and give you one”. Swire adds: “This is not flirting by the prime minister. This is probably lewdness. But hell, I’m so starved of masculine interest at my age it made me smile.” If that tale – and that fact that she has put in print – is not startling enough, her attempts to play the innocent in an interview with the Observer are perhaps even more so. “Maybe I was naive. But I’m terrified of causing trouble,” she tells Rachel Cooke. She fears the subtler, finer messages of her book will be misunderstood, and lost: “People are going to make this all about David; they won’t see the integrity of the diary as a whole.”
Throughout the book she refers to Cameron chummily as Dave, saying he loves a combination of drink and dirty jokes. Their time together in Cornwall was filled with barbecues, loads of booze and “a lot of sex talk” from Cameron and her own husband. After he lost the Brexit referendum she says he hit the bottle and “chomped on cigars” and that Samantha could only join him as he made his resignation speech after a large negroni cocktail. Already the falling out has begun. The Swires stayed with the Camerons again in Cornwall only a couple of weeks ago. But will they be invited again? The former PM is clearly seething. “I don’t recall that conversation,” he said of the walk story when asked about it an interview with Times Radio last week. But he felt unable to deny it outright: “If someone wrote down all your banter in private over the years, there probably might be a few bits and pieces that weren’t very flattering.” Vine too has hit back at Swire with force in her columns in the Daily Mail. Swire’s suggestion, as Vine put it, that she was “always meddling” and “making fish pie while Samantha swanned around being glamorous” got the Mail columnist’s blood boiling. The whole thing was not only unforgivably disloyal. It was also horribly snooty and partial. “It’s a bit like someone writing an account of Winston Churchill during the war years, and only ever mentioning the cigars and the Pol Roger,” Vine wrote. Amid the glut of smut, there are interesting revelations. She says Cameron as well as Osborne believed that Brexit could be stopped in early 2018 and that Samantha Cameron favoured another referendum. She implies Cameron was sympathetic to a second vote too.
In the diaries, Swire describes Dominic Cummings as “stark raving mad”. She tells the Observer: “It will all go tits up with him, it always does. He’ll explode.” And of Theresa May, she says: “She didn’t have an original idea in her head. And no friends, either.” At one point in the interview, she insists that she is not going to say any more about her “friends” than is in the book. But then she can’t resist. Asked if she stands by her view that Gove is bonkers, she says: “Actually, I love Michael. I can forgive anything if they’ve got colour. The more dangerous, the more alcoholic, the madder they are, the better.” She then pauses. “Where Michael is slightly dishonest is with his ambition. He’s always lied about that. He’s a typical hack. He loves being at the scene of the crash. I think he’s quite dangerous,” she says, not, of course, meaning to upset anyone or cause a stir."
2020-09-20T08:00:40Z,politics,Politics,Susan Michie: 'Bars and pubs and other high-risk places should not be open',"Susan Michie, 65, is a professor of health psychology at University College London and leader of the Human Behaviour Change project funded by the Wellcome Trust. She has been part of the Covid-19 behavioural science team, a sub-group of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). She also sits on the independent Sage committee chaired by Sir David King. How important was behavioural thinking in the advice given to government by Sage initially. How interested were they in that aspect of the response? The behavioural science advisory group is more than 30 people from many different disciplinary backgrounds, and types of expertise, many of them world leaders in their areas. We’ve probably published 60 or 70 papers over the past six months. I have to say I haven’t seen very much of that coming through in terms of the government’s response. Certainly not since the “Stay Alert” type messaging. It doesn’t appear to me that they’ve read the advice. What was the most crucial thing you think they ignored? The consistent message from us to government has been that, to maximise the adherence of the population, you need to build up trust. That means direct, honest and open communication and taking responsibility for things when they go wrong. They seem to have a pathological fear of owning mistakes. Why do you think that is? I’m not going to get into the politics of it. But I would say, one of the worst things leaders can do in terms of trust is to start to blame others when things go wrong. Ministers have started to blame young people for the increase of transmission of the virus, when they did what the government told them to do. They went to pubs and bars. Do you think Sage could have been more robust in calling that out? It’s a very difficult situation. I was on Sage in 2009 when I think there were just 14 scientists, during the H1N1 pandemic. It was a very independent, science-driven effort. The Sage meetings now are enormous with large numbers of people from other government departments, from Public Health England, and political advisers. Why has that changed? I don’t know. Obviously, PHE didn’t exist in 2009. Political advisers now have huge amounts of power. We had to sign something saying we won’t talk about anything that happens within Sage meetings. I think there has been a sense that advice and decisions happen behind the scenes. Was there not a case for the scientific community to say: we are not going to operate on these terms? The reason Sir David King set up the independent Sage was that he was so disturbed by the government strategy and the secrecy around the science. I was delighted to be invited. It’s a small group (with a small behavioural advisory group), so much more workable, and able to communicate directly with the public and the media. I guess when the inevitable inquiry eventually happens, it will focus on those early weeks in the middle of March, when infection was rife, but we were slow to lock down. I was looking at an interview you did with Andrew Neil at that time, when you were concerned about the unintended consequences of, for example, cancelling sporting events. Do you think, with hindsight, we should have been more far concerned with direct consequences, rather than possible knock-on behaviours? I do. And I remember that interview. And at the beginning, I was very uncomfortable about these events going ahead. But I also knew that trusted leadership was really important in terms of adherence. And so I supported what Chris Whitty was saying and what the government was saying. I stopped because there was too much of a contradiction between what I thought and what was being said and done. The thinking at that time was that if you prevent crowds going to these outdoor events, people will go and watch them in pubs. In retrospect, we should have also closed down the pubs.
The situation was so serious at the beginning that you wanted to give the government, in a sense, a chance to get it right? The population was prepared to do that too. What happens in a crisis routinely, the default is to trust the leadership. Was that delay based on a hunch about the British context – the British character – that we couldn’t go too far too fast? Why do you think there was an apparently instinctive reluctance not to just go along with World Health Organization advice? I think there are now very few scientists who would question the fact that we should have locked down earlier and harder. People might speculate about the reasons – British exceptionalism, the Tory ideology of keeping businesses going at all costs, that we were putting too much emphasis on influenza models. It was probably a bit of everything. I don’t know. However, what I do think is a completely different situation is what’s been happening over these past two months, over July and August. We now do have the benefit of hindsight and learning from the rest of the world. On Independent Sage all through the summer we have been saying the government must use these months to drive down Covid transmission in the community towards zero. Specifically, we said bars and pubs and other indoor high-risk places should not be open. We should have had outdoor summer camps for schoolchildren, should have brought back retired teachers in the way that we brought back doctors and nurses, and should have utilised the many empty buildings so we could create proper distancing for schools. None of that was done. They wasted all that time. Sage and the scientific community knew from the beginning that they were dealing with a government that had set itself against “experts” and had just been elected on a manifesto full of non-evidence-based promises. Do you think there was a subconscious sense of second guessing – of trying to meet them halfway in the advice given, in order at least to get something done? No, we draw on published evidence, and on expert consensus where there isn’t evidence. In terms of the false promises, the government didn’t have to make them. Nobody needs a “world-beating app” – just one that works. We don’t need Operation Moonshot and hundreds of millions of pounds wasted on private test-and-trace contractors when there was an existing local public health infrastructure with a good track record. These offers and promises are just a wing and a prayer in the hope it will make people feel better. In the long run, that doesn’t work. But this prime minister has built his career on the fact that, in the short term, those vast empty promises do appear to work. Should we not spend more time addressing that quite cynical, irrational, tribal idea of human motivation? The motivations of this government appear to be quite ideological and that’s a whole other conversation. The fact remains that changing behaviour is at the heart of how to get out of this pandemic and behavioural scientists have not been used as they could have been. Where do you think we will be in six months’ time. I imagine you fear the worst… I don’t know what the worst is. At the start the government kept saying “we are following the science”. That generally meaningless mantra was a concern to many of us, because we thought we might be being set up to blame if things went wrong. Now, they have even stopped saying that. The current messages that pitch the economy against health are so wrong. There is only one way of getting the economy back on track and that is to consistently do all the things necessary to drive transmission of the virus down."
2020-09-20T07:12:39Z,politics,Politics,Dido Harding appointment ‘corrupting our constitution’ – Lord Falconer,"Boris Johnson has been accused by a former Labour lord chancellor of corrupting the constitution by appointing Tory peer Dido Harding to powerful twin civil service roles in the fight against Covid-19. Lord Falconer, who is also a former justice secretary, spoke out as his party’s leader in the House of Lords Baroness Angela Smith wrote to the newcabinet secretary, Simon Case, asking for urgent clarification of what appeared to be a clear breach of the civil service code.
Harding, a former chief executive of telecom group TalkTalk, is currently head of the much criticised NHS test and trace, and was recently also appointed to lead the new National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP). In both roles Labour says she works as a public servant and is therefore covered by the civil service code, which states that civil servants should not “act in a way determined by political considerations”. But Harding sits as a backbench Tory peer and takes the Conservative whip, operating there in a political capacity. As recently as last week, she voted in line with her party on the agriculture bill in the upper house. Lord Falconer said he had never known of anyone being allowed to mix public service and political roles in such a way, in the Commons or Lords, and demanded that she either sit as a non-aligned cross-bench peer, or be appointed by the prime minster as a government minister. She could then, as a result, be held accountable and answer questions in the upper house. Falconer told the Observer: “It is such a corruption of our constitution to make a Tory backbencher in parliament a senior civil servant without any process and without even requiring the most basic rules of political impartiality. “It is hardly surprising that our track and trace system is going so wrong if your talent pool is restricted to Tory backbenchers in parliament.” Government sources said that Harding had shown herself to be accountable and had appeared last week before the science and technology select committee to answer questions about the Covid-19 testing system she runs. Last month, health secretary Matt Hancock defended her appointment as head of NIHP, after the controversial decision to scrap Public Health England (PHE). The appointment raised eyebrows, however, because of the poor performance of NHS test and trace, which she has led since May, and because Harding was an active Conservative in the Lords. The scrapping of PHE also prompted a chorus of criticism that Boris Johnson’s administration was trying to shift the blame for its own failings during the pandemic. Lady Harding, 52, has been a Conservative member of the House of Lords since she was given a life peerage in 2014 by her friend David Cameron, the then prime minister. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the leader of the British Medical Association, warned at the time her appointment was announced in August that the public health body should be free of any political influence that might hinder its work. “The BMA strongly believes that the nation’s public health medicine service should be truly public, [and] completely independent of political influence,” he said. “It must be able to operate with full transparency in order to advise the government, inform the public and do its work, which is so vital to the health of the nation.”"
2020-09-19T17:00:21Z,politics,Politics,Labour donor who quit over antisemitism is set to rejoin,"One of Labour’s most generous private donors, who dramatically quit the party over antisemitism, has signalled he is ready to rejoin in a further sign that Keir Starmer is winning back Jewish supporters. Sir David Garrard revealed he had quit in 2018 as Labour struggled with accusations of antisemitism within the party. He said at the time that he no longer felt “any affinity or connection” with the party, adding that the Labour he joined “no longer exists”. Garrard said “it should be taken for granted that I will almost happily rejoin the party” should Starmer tackle antisemitism in the way he has pledged. In a sign that Labour is attempting to reach out to previous supporters, Garrard is also due to meet the party’s new general secretary, David Evans.
It comes with Starmer attempting to cast his leadership as a new beginning. As Labour’s virtual conference began this weekend, the party revealed that its new slogan would be “a new leadership”. It is designed not just as a contrast to Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, but also that of Boris Johnson. The conference is also the first staging post to a major round of local elections next May. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, has already used the virtual conference to demand that Britain’s care workers be paid a “living wage” of £9.30 an hour (£10.75 in London) . Stark party divisions remain, however. The forthcoming publication of a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is investigating the party over its handling of alleged antisemitism, is likely to reopen them. Many on the left maintain the issue was exaggerated by opponents of Jeremy Corbyn to undermine his leadership. Garrard said he had been “encouraged by what I have perceived to be Sir Keir Starmer’s position with regard to the elimination of antisemitism in the party and an even-handed and balanced approach, which I am hopeful the party will now take to the Palestinian/Israeli issue. “I am particularly comforted by Sir Keir’s comments made during a meeting held with LFI [Labour Friends of Israel] and chaired by LFI’s parliamentary chair, Steve McCabe MP. In that meeting, Sir Keir said that under his leadership, Labour will once again be an honest broker on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It gave me further comfort to learn that the ending of the disproportionate obsession with Israel is also vital to making our party a safe and welcoming space for Jewish members once again, as well as winning back the trust of the Jewish community. Surely if the historic events of this week with two Arab nations [the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain] signing peace treaties with Israel, it is time for the party to at least be seen to start to forge a positive and constructive approach.
“So, you can see why I am cautiously optimistic. You have asked me whether I will be rejoining the Labour party. On the assumption that Sir Keir, with his leadership of the party, will ensure that it moves forward on the basis he has suggested, then it should be taken for granted that I will almost happily rejoin the party, which I have worked both for, and so closely with, over many decades.” It is understood that Garrard, who has donated about £1.5m to Labour since 2003, regards it as too early to decide whether or not to take the further step of backing the party financially again. Labour currently receives the vast majority of its income from membership fees and donations from affiliated unions, rather than private donations from wealthy backers. Other senior Jewish figures have suggested that Starmer is repairing relations after the accusations of antisemitism that plagued it. Lord Sacks, the former chief rabbi, said last week that the Jewish community felt “very reassured” by Starmer’s leadership so far."
2020-09-19T16:17:40Z,politics,Politics,'It's a lifesaver': Glasgow drug users and MP hail safe-injecting space,"It’s lunchtime on a sunny Friday and there are two queues on Glasgow’s Parnie Street. At Street Level Photoworks gallery, one group waits to enter an exhibition of the work of Oscar Marzaroli, famous for photographing the city’s postwar working classes amid social upheaval and division. Opposite, a line forms outside a white Ford Transit van emblazoned with “Safe Consumption” as some of the city centre’s drug-dependent population wait for access to take illegal drugs. “It’s a lifesaver,” says one visitor to the van, which is kitted out with sterile seat and table covers, needle bins, injecting kits and Naloxone, used to reverse the effects of overdose. “Without it I’d be using a dirty alley and stepping all over broken glass and old needles.” A friend of his recently overdosed around the corner and had to be saved, he adds, pointing to an alleyway where a 17-year-old girl also died days earlier: “Why can they not just make this van legal?” The question is a complicated one that has been at the centre of efforts to curb fatalities in the city, dubbed Europe’s drug deaths capital. Scotland’s drugs death rate is three times higher than that in any EU country, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Glasgow. While the city council, backed by the Scottish government, has long called for the establishment of supervised drug consumption facilities in the city, these are interpreted as contravening the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and have therefore been repeatedly blocked by the Home Office. “My plan is to push the boundaries so that an official facility where people can get proper help and support becomes inevitable,” says Peter Krykant, a former drug addict who set up the van earlier this year. While it ensures a clean environment safer than the street, an official facility could provide services such as wound care, signposting and treatment. “This is not a magic wand and I can’t do this forever; it’s about forcing the change.” Krykant risks arrest by operating the van, which exists in a grey area of the law: while selling or assisting in the procurement or preparation of illegal drugs is an offence, users of the van bring their own substances and prepare them alone. “People in Glasgow recognise the issues that the city faces with regards to drug injecting and drug-related deaths, and it’s scandalous the Home Office continue to reject public health interventions like the implementation of supervised drug consumption facilities,” says Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP for Glasgow Central. “In the absence of support from the UK government, it’s hardly surprising that some have taken the matter into their own hands. However, it shouldn’t be the case that citizens have to take risks due to the failings of UK government ministers.” The Home Office says its approach to drugs “is clear”. “We have no plans to introduce drug consumption rooms and anyone running them would be committing a range of offences including possession of a controlled drug and being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug,” said a spokesperson. But for people like William, 48, who exits the van after injecting cocaine, the facility is the difference between dignity and stigma – and life and death. “It’s a great thing he’s doing here,” he says of Krykant. “People keep dying in alleys and they’re going to take drugs whether you like it or not. Here it’s safe and it’s clean and you can get a hit in private without the police or strangers walking by. Of course it should be allowed. Either you want people to die or you don’t.”"
2020-09-19T06:00:09Z,politics,Politics,Labour conference: five key issues for Keir Starmer's party,"No cheering crowds of members, no karaoke, no plotting in the hotel bars and no late night compositing: Keir Starmer’s first party conference as Labour leader, which starts this weekend, will be unlike any other. Instead of Liverpool’s airy ACC convention centre, it is being held online, with the strapline: A New Leadership. Labour has certainly made progress in the opinion polls since Starmer won the leadership contest, but many challenges remain. Here are some of them: What is Starmerism? Labour’s new leader has praised Britain’s veterans, condemned protesters who pulled down the Colston statue in Bristol and needled the prime minister over his failings in tackling the pandemic. But Starmer has said less about his vision for Labour and for Britain. He is expected to use his speech on Tuesday to talk about his personal values and politics. But he will continue to be wary of setting out detailed policies – on tax and spend, for example. Starmer’s supporters regard this caution as sound politics. But sceptics claim it means he lacks Corbyn’s ideological clarity.
Brexit During recent debates Starmer could not have been clearer: Brexit is concluded as an argument, Labour lost and Boris Johnson needs to get on with finalising a deal. While this does blunt attacks on Starmer as an out-of-touch remainer lawyer, there are difficulties ahead. Labour objects to the internal market bill not because it lays the legislative framework for Brexit, but because it details how the government could unilaterally rewrite the withdrawal agreement with the EU, thus breaking international law. But every time Labour votes against the measure, or similar ones, Johnson and his team will loudly proclaim that Starmer is seeking to “frustrate Brexit”. Government in waiting? Labour’s strategy is to hammer homethat Johnson and his cabinet are “incompetent”. But voters – including those in “red wall” seats – need to trust Starmer’s team to do better. Yet many of them, including the shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, remain low-profile. One aim of this week’s virtual conference is to try to bring them into the spotlight, along with Starmer’s deputy, Angela Rayner. Party tensions Tensions between Labour’s left and right were reignited by the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey and the leak of an internal report that detailed a “hyper-factional” atmosphere in party HQ. When Starmer set up a review, chaired by Martin Forde QC, to examine the claims in the explosive report, Jeremy Corbyn was among those who urged it to investigate allegations that staffers had deliberately sought to sabotage the 2017 election by channelling funds to chosen constituencies. The review is yet to report, but it is likely to spark a new outbreak of hostilities. Many on the left are reserving judgment until they see more policy details emerge from Starmer and his team – he signed up to 10 “pledges” during his leadership campaign, which included the wholesale adoption of much of Corbyn’s leftwing prospectus. Antisemitism Starmer won praise from Jewish leaders for his immediate promise on taking over the leadership to get a grip of antisemitism cases within the party, and the issue has since receded in media prominence. This could change, however, with the imminent publication of a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into allegations of institutional antisemitism within Labour. While Starmer will respond to the findings by emphasising a different approach under his leadership, it is likely to reignite internal party arguments from the Corbyn era. Meanwhile, the Conservatives will undoubtedly try and remind voters that Starmer was a key shadow cabinet member under Corbyn."
2020-09-18T14:35:58Z,politics,Politics,Sinking without trace: rightwing press turns on Boris Johnson,"“Where’s Boris?” asked this week’s Spectator, the weekly magazine the prime minister once edited and from which Johnson might once have expected a better press had it not been for the coronavirus crisis. With a front cover image featuring a distant blond dot on a tiny boat bobbing rudderless and oarless on a stormy sea, the message of chaos and drift from the title was emphatic – a criticism of the prime minister’s leadership in the battle against the pandemic that is being replicated across an increasingly sceptical rightwing media. “The question now is whether he can become a proper leader with a sense of direction and purpose,” said the magazine’s editor, Fraser Nelson, effectively arguing that Johnson’s premiership was at a crossroads, that a narrative was close to being set. After a week in which Britain’s test-and-trace system – once intended by the prime minister to be “world-beating” – was at the point of collapse, Nelson asked “whether the pattern we have seen in recent months – of disorder, debacle, rebellion, U-turn and confusion – is what we should henceforth expect”. Others writing in the same magazine put it more idiosyncratically. “What on earth happened to the freedom-loving, twinkly-eyed, Rabelaisian character I voted for? Oliver Hardy has left the stage, replaced by Oliver Cromwell,” said columnist Toby Young, complaining of a “lack of engagement with the detail”. Earlier on Thursday, the same day the Spectator cover emerged, the Daily Mail had reached a similar conclusion. “Boris: We’ve Failed” the front-page headline blared, with the paper claiming it had warned of a “looming test crisis five months ago”. The rightwing tabloid highlighted Johnson’s subdued performance the day before in front of parliament’s liaison committee, where he had been forced to admit that “the short answer” was that there were nowhere near enough Covid tests available. Only a week earlier, the prime minister talked optimistically about a “moonshot” plan to test millions of people a day as way to return to pre-coronavirus normality. Now he had humiliatingly been forced to admit there were nowhere near enough tests for worried parents at a level closer to 230,000 a day. “Too often the government has over-promised and under-delivered,” concluded a leader in the Times on Friday morning. “Policies have had to be swiftly abandoned after the exposure of entirely predictable problems,” the centre-right broadsheet continued, adding the A-level fiasco and the problems with the contact-tracing app for good measure. The paper – perhaps with one eye on a promotion for the former Times journalist Michael Gove – argued that Johnson needed to appoint “competent deputies” before “the public come to a settled and unflattering view about his ability to do the job”.
It was a few months after another surprising general election win in 1992 that John Major’s reputation was shredded on Black Wednesday. But for all the growing criticism and pandemic policy failures the situation is nowhere near as grave for the current prime minister: the Conservatives remain ahead in polls at just over 40%.
Neither the Times nor the Mail nor other traditional rightwing titles are talking about switching support to Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. And there remain good arguments that the British public takes far longer to change its mind than Britain’s fickle and fast-moving press. Pollster Deborah Mattinson, author of a new book, Beyond the Red Wall, that analyses Johnson’s seizure of Labour strongholds in last December’s election, said: “Red Wallers, though disappointed, are more forgiving than you might expect. They have taken this big decision to leave Labour and are seeking to justify that.”"
2020-09-18T14:25:28Z,politics,Politics,Welsh and Scottish leaders: Johnson hasn't talked to us for months,"The first ministers of Wales and Scotland have attacked Boris Johnson for failing to speak to them directly about the possibility of a new national lockdown in England. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said there was a “vacancy” at the heart of the UK government and argued his country’s porous border with England made it crucial for the prime minister to communicate directly with him regularly. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, backed Drakeford, saying the UK was at “the most critical point of decision-making” since March, and calling for a Cobra meeting involving the heads of all four nations to be convened immediately.
Keir Starmer echoed the demand. The Labour leader said: “There is mounting concern about whether we have got the virus sufficiently under control. This is the time for swift, decisive national action. We cannot afford to be too slow. That’s why I’m asking the prime minister to convene a Cobra meeting and to update the country on the measures the government is taking to keep the virus under control, including to fix testing. “The British public want to know what the situation is and what the government is going to do about it.” There is growing frustration in the Welsh and Scottish governments at a lack of direct communication from Johnson. Drakeford said he had only spoken to the prime minister once since the end of May, while Sturgeon said she could not remember the last time she talked to him. At a press conference on Friday, Drakeford said there were lockdowns in north-west England, close to the Welsh border, and “speculation” of a “circuit-breaking” lockdown across England but he had had no recent direct communication from the prime minister.
“This is simply unacceptable to anyone who believes that we ought to be facing the coronavirus crisis together,” Drakeford said. “We need a regular, reliable rhythm of engagement: a reliable meeting even once a week would be a start. “I make this argument not because we should all do the same things, but because being round the same table allows each of us to make the best decisions for the nations we represent. “There is a vacancy at the heart of the United Kingdom, and it needs urgently to be filled, so we can talk to each other, share information, pool ideas and demonstrate a determination that the whole of the country can face these challenges together at this most difficult time.” Sturgeon called for an immediate Cobra meeting, warning that politicians needed to act “quickly, decisively, early” to prevent the virus getting out of control again. Speaking at her daily briefing, she said: “I want to give the nation advance notice that the coming days are likely to see some hard but necessary decisions. “This weekend is a critical moment for us to take decisions about the additional steps we need … I do want to have four-nations discussions around this, I have asked the prime minister to convene a Cobra, we will ideally align as much as possible. “But if there are things that I think, based on my data and advice, are essential in Scotland, I am not going to hold back. I hope we will have discussions over the weekend and try to come to a shared position on the steps that are necessary.” She underlined that she was not talking about a full lockdown but about further measures to avoid such severe restrictions again and allowing Scotland to keep schools open. Sturgeon also cautioned against non-essential overseas travel and travel to parts of the north of England under tougher restrictions. Asked about Drakeford’s comments, Sturgeon said she could not remember the last time she had spoken to the prime minister directly, “which maybe tells its own story”. She added: “Mark Drakeford is not saying anything that is not correct. It would be very helpful to have a PM-led, four nations Cobra-type discussion over this weekend.”"
2020-09-18T13:27:12Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: consortium of companies led by Fujitsu wins £200m Irish Sea contract,"A £200m contract to implement Brexit checks on goods in the Irish Sea has been won by a consortium of companies led by Japanese company Fujistu. HMRC announced on Friday that a two-year contract for the new trader support service (TSS) had been awarded to a consortium led by the tech company and its partners, the Customs Clearance Consortium, an organisation run by customs expert Robert Hardy and the Institute of Export and International Trade. The latter counts among its patrons the former Ulster Unionist party leader Reg Empey, who is listed as one of the organisation’s vice-presidents. Lord Empey said he had no involvement in the bid and his role as patron was entirely honorary. The winning consortium, which also involves McKinsey consultants, said it was “very pleased to be the successful supplier” of what will be “a free service available to all traders moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and importing goods into Northern Ireland from the rest of the world, which will help them to comply with new requirements under the NI protocol”. Empey was vehemently opposed to any Brexit deal that involved trade barriers down the Irish Sea but more recently called on cabinet ministers to stop denying their existence in the Brexit deal. In July, he said the “attempt to hide from the reality is doing no service to business or the general public” as the protocol made clear “there will be a border in the Irish Sea” and these would be implemented on 1 January trade deal or not.
On Friday, he said he found the row between the UK and the EU over the checks as a “deeply deeply worrying” development. “The way both sides are using this place [Northern Ireland] as a bargaining chip is disgusting,” he said. Businesses in Northern Ireland welcomed the trader support service, which effectively nationalises the Brexit bureaucracy for local businesses. Seamus Leheny, policy manager for Logistics UK for Northern Ireland, said the TSS work would need to commence immediately. He said Fujitsu and its partners had huge task and responsibility. He added: “The TSS will need to be on their top game if it’s to succeed.” Consultant Shanker Singham, one of the leading advocates of “alternative arrangements” to Theresa May’s backstop solution was not named in the government announcement but is known to have advised the bidders. With the backing of former Conservative MP Nicky Morgan and the Tory MP Greg Hands, he worked closely with Fujitsu in developing an alternative system for Irish border checks last summer involving technology and mobile units away from the border. The £200m contract is the first concrete implementation of the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. Hinduja Global Systems is also in the consortium. Earlier this week, the government gave the go-ahead for a second tender for works for sanitary checks at ports in Northern Ireland. HMRC said TSS would go live at the end of September so businesses can register for support and start preparations for the end of the transition period. It said: “The Trader Support Service will provide unprecedented support to all businesses engaging in new processes under the NI Protocol and its announcement has been warmly received by them.” Fujitsu, the Institute of Export, Singham and Hardy have been approached for comment."
2020-09-18T11:48:41Z,politics,Politics,Home Office 'bases immigration policies on anecdotes and prejudice' – MPs,"The Home Office has drawn up immigration policies based on “anecdote, assumption and prejudice” instead of relying on evidence, an influential parliamentary committee has concluded. The public accounts committee said Priti Patel’s department was unaware of the damage caused by policy failures on “both the illegal and legitimate migrant populations”. In a highly critical report published on Friday, the committee said in summary that Home Office officials had “no idea” what its £400m annual spending on immigration enforcement achieves. “We are concerned that if the department does not make decisions based on evidence, it instead risks making them on anecdote, assumption and prejudice,” the cross-party committee concluded. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said: “The Home Office has frighteningly little grasp of the impact of its activities in managing immigration. It shows no inclination to learn from its numerous mistakes across a swathe of immigration activities – even when it fully accepts that it has made serious errors. “It accepts the wreckage that its ignorance and the culture it has fostered caused in the Windrush scandal – but the evidence we saw shows too little intent to change, and inspires no confidence that the next such scandal isn’t right around the corner.” The committee was examining the role and function of Immigration Enforcement. This is the directorate within the department responsible for preventing abuse of the immigration system, in light of a critical National Audit Office (NAO) report, which was released in June. Officials were questioned by MPs about the department’s “compliant environment” policy, which limits access to work, housing, benefits and other government-funded services. The report said that despite “years of public and political debate and concern”, the department still did not know the size of the population in the UK illegally. The committee reiterated criticism by the NAO, saying the department had not estimated that population since 2005 and had “no answer” to concerns that “potentially exaggerated figures calculated by others could inflame hostility towards immigrants”. Some of the report examined the legacy of the Windrush scandal, and concluded that the internal culture that created the hostile environment still remains. The Home Office does not know whether hostile environment policies deterred illegal migration, while a lack of evidence and significant lack of diversity at senior levels has created blind spots in the organisation, the report said. “Only one member of its executive committee came from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background. The department described the benefits of greater diversity at senior levels for its decision-making, leadership and governance, but acknowledged diversity as being its biggest issue,” the report said. Regarding the UK’s exit from the EU, the report warned officials were “unprepared for the challenges”. It added that the department had been unable to provide evidence, when asked in July, that it had begun discussions with EU counterparts on international operations, including regarding “the return of foreign national offenders and illegal migrants”. The committee said it was not convinced that the department was sufficiently prepared to properly safeguard the existing, immigrant population in the UK legally, while also implementing a new immigration system and responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. The committee gave the Home Office six months to produce a detailed plan to make sure its decision-making is led by data and evidence so that it can analyse its work, particularly with regard to tackling illegal migration. Minnie Rahman, campaigns and public affairs manager for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the report painted a “very accurate picture of a clueless, careless and cold-hearted Home Office. It is but the latest in a slew of reports to slam the Home Office’s working culture and practices.” The charity echoed the committee’s calls for change, adding: “Immigration policy and practice must be based on robust evidence, proper staff training and a new culture of respect and care for individuals.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office’s ultimate priority is to keep people safe and that includes having a strong border. “We have developed a balanced and evidence-based approach to maintaining a fair immigration system. Since 2010, we have removed more than 53,000 foreign national offenders and more than 133,000 people as enforced removals. “On a daily basis we continue to tackle those who fail to comply with our immigration laws and abuse our hospitality by committing serious, violent and persistent crimes, with immigration enforcement continually becoming more efficient.”"
2020-09-18T11:25:09Z,politics,Politics,Is the UK government ready for a Covid winter?,"In mid-July, an Academy of Medical Sciences report urged the government to use the remainder of the summer to prepare for a second wave of coronavirus during the winter. Commissioned by the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, the 79-page study warned that a resurgence of the virus had the potential to kill up to 120,000 hospital patients in a worst-case scenario. The Guardian has examined the government’s response to five of the report’s main recommendations – and found significant shortcomings in nearly every case. Minimising transmission of coronavirus in the community, with a public information campaign for all, as well as advice tailored to individuals and communities at high risk. Earlier this month, the government announced it was launching a “hands, face, space” campaign to run across TV, radio, print, social and display advertising in England to prevent the spread of coronavirus indoors during the winter and to avoid a second peak. The slogan was originally launched by the prime minister in July, but was overshadowed by the “eat out to help out” campaign of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. This month’s announcement did not contain any details on whether the campaign would contain tailored messaging – the lack of which has been highlighted by some as a contributory factor to recent local spikes. The academy’s report highlighted that factors such as education, income and ethnicity can affect exposure to public health messages. Prof Dame Anne Johnson, the vice-president of the academy and an author of the report, said: “We’ve had throughout the pandemic these sort of very generalised messages; we haven’t seen much of that more nuanced or more targeted or culturally competent [messaging].” She also said that with the recent rise in transmission in young people “it would be great to hear their voices on all this and how they feel. It will be working with them to get the right messages across that doesn’t put their lives on hold, but enables them to keep as safe as possible.” Guardian rating: 5/10 Reorganising health and social care staff and facilities to maintain Covid-19 and Covid-19-free zones, and ensure there is adequate PPE, testing and system-wide infection-control measures to minimise transmission in hospitals and care homes. PPE shortages blighted efforts to combat the first wave of coronavirus. The government says it has ordered 31bn items and PPE will be free for staff and residents in care homes. In theory, regular testing (retesting) for care homes in England, under which staff would be tested weekly and residents every 28 days, has been available since July – but Care England says this has not been delivered. The government has also provided £546m to the care sector to pay wages for staff self-isolating and to hire more staff to restrict movement between homes and therefore the spread of the virus over the winter. It has also promised a “dashboard” to monitor care home infections. Trusts have been using government funds to divide healthcare settings into “hot” and “cold” settings, as suggested in the report. But Prof Johnson said testing was crucial to other measures. “If we want to get on top of this backlog of people who are needing urgent care, then clearly you’ve got to make sure that they go in Covid negative for surgery, that the staff aren’t infected, and you’re not getting cross-infection,” she said. “That needs a really robust testing system to be in place, so all this does go back to both the testing system but also the way that we train and protect staff and make sure that they understand how to reduce transmission.” Testing problems have forced hundreds of physicians to take time off, according to the Doctors Association UK. Guardian rating: 3/10 Increasing capacity of the test, trace and isolate (TTI) programme to cope with the overlapping symptoms of Covid-19, flu and other winter infections. The academy’s report states: “TTI will only be effective if it is carried out quickly, accurately, is acceptable to the public, and encompasses a high proportion of symptomatic cases.” The most recent figures, for the week ending 9 September, show that 15,526 people were transferred to the contact tracing system in England, compared with 8,117 when test and trace launched at the end of May. At that time, the proportion of close contacts who were reached and asked to self-isolate in England was 91.1%; the latest figure was 73.9%, albeit up from 69.2% over the previous seven days. Testing problems have been rife recently and are expected to last for weeks. The latest test-and-trace figures say there is capacity for 2.5m tests in the UK a week; only 1.6m were processed in the most recent week for which data is available. Additionally, the proportion of in-person test results received within 24 hours in England was 33.3% – dropping to 14.3% when home test kits and satellite test centre figures are included – a far cry from Boris Johnson’s pledge to ensure all coronavirus test results were delivered within 24 hours by the end of June. During the winter flu peak, Prof Johnson said the number of people with symptoms could reach 500,000 – the same daily capacity for Covid tests the prime minister has pledge to deliver by the end of October, but which must be doubtful on current form. There have also been concerns a significant proportion of people are not self-isolating fully when they are supposed to. Guardian rating: 2/10 Establishing a comprehensive, near-real-time, population-wide surveillance system to monitor and manage a winter wave. Although it is not real-time, Prof Johnson praised Public Health England’s weekly Covid surveillance report which uses multiple sources to gauge incidence. The daily dashboard of cases relies on the testing regime, which has been experiencing major problems and is generally reserved for people with symptoms, limiting information on incidence.
Prof Johnson said: “We’ve got a much, much better idea now about the proportion of cases that were identified … PHE publishes data on age, ethnicity and area, which is a great help. So you’ve got more idea, and the data coming from outbreak investigations is better but, for example, it would be good to see much more information understanding where the transmission is going on. “So if you ask people: ‘Where do you think you’ve got the infection?’ Are they getting infected at home? Are they getting infected at work? Is it hospital-acquired infection and what are the risk factors? – you’ve got a lot more granularity. We’re beginning to get some of that but it would be good to have more detail, particularly on these very high-risk situations in hospitals and care homes and particular outbreaks.” She said it was clear more data was being collected but “it’s not easy to get it all collated together”. Guardian rating: 7/10 Guarding against the worst effects of flu with a concerted effort to get people at risk, and health and care workers, safely vaccinated. In late July, the government said it would offer a free flu jab to more than 30 million people, calling it the most comprehensive flu vaccination in UK history. It involves extending the NHS free vaccination programme to everyone over 50 (previously only over-65s were eligible), people shielding and those who live with them, plus children in their first year of secondary school. Last year 25 million were invited to participate in the programme, but only 15 million did so. Prof Johnson said: “Obviously they have taken that [recommendation] on board but again the proof is in the pudding. It will be important to see that … it’s being delivered in a timely way and that the uptake is high. Particularly in health and social care workers, you want to get [uptake] rates closer to 100%.” Guardian rating: Too early to tell"
2020-09-18T10:38:06Z,politics,Politics,Don't stop your grousing … and other Covid rule-of-six exemptions,"When the government announced that grouse shooting would be exempt from the “rule of six” coronavirus restrictions in England, it prompted widespread scorn. While two families stopping in the street to chat was described as illegal mingling by the home secretary, Priti Patel, parties of up to 30 are permitted to meet for shooting and hunting trips, after a ministerial intervention ensured it would be classed as a licensed outdoor activity. But it is not the only activity exempt from the rule of six. Casinos The rule of six does not apply to organised activities that abide by Covid-secure guidance and that includes casino games, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. This means that while a group of seven might be unable to get a table in a restaurant, they can all get a seat at a poker table, provided there is a screen between each seat – and the chips are wiped down regularly, of course. Museum tours Updated guidance states that museums can continue to host tours of up to 30 people, provided safety measures are in place. “Guided tours of up to 30 people may take place indoors or outdoors provided businesses undertake risk assessments […] and put any necessary mitigations in place,” the regulations state. So, while a big birthday party at the park might be a no-no for now, history buffs can gather their mates for a tour of interesting artefacts.
Conference planning If history is not your cup of tea, but large-scale event planning is, then you could arrange a tour of your nearest conference venue. “Exhibition and conference centres are also allowed to show small groups (of up to 30 people, with social distancing requirements) around to view the facilities and plan future events,” the guidance says. Places of worship At a press conference, Boris Johnson confirmed that places of worship were exempt from the rule, provided there were no individual groups larger than six. The archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: “After contact with government we hear that there is no change to guidance on places of worship. Worship is the work of God – not a social gathering – and gives the strength to love and serve.”"
2020-09-18T09:20:33Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Trump envoy warns of risk of Ireland 'border by accident',"Donald’s Trump special envoy to Northern Ireland has warned of the risk of creating a hard “border by accident” on the island of Ireland, as Boris Johnson’s newly drafted plan to rewrite the withdrawal agreement was rejected again by the EU. Mick Mulvaney, who was appointed by the US president in March, admitted to concerns about recent developments, including government legislation that could unilaterally override aspects of the agreement on Northern Ireland struck with Brussels last year. “Everyone assures me that no one is interested in seeing a hard border between the republic and Northern Ireland,” the former acting White House chief of staff said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We appreciate that, we respect that and we agree with that. The one thing I keep trying to assure is on the front of everybody’s mind is avoiding a border by accident. The Trump administration, state department and the US Congress would all be aligned in the desire to see the Good Friday agreement preserved to see the lack of a border maintained.” The comments follow a critical intervention by the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, after the UK government published its internal market bill and admitted it would breach international law. “We can’t allow the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,” Biden tweeted. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has also warned that Congress will refuse to ratify any UK-US trade deal that comes before it if the British government fails to abide by the terms of the withdrawal agreement.
Mulvaney said he had discussed the internal market bill with the Irish government and that he was closely monitoring the debate over it. His comments will be seen as all the more significant given they come from a Republican figure close to the White House. “I feel there’s so much left to be decided on Brexit including the [internal market bill]. I see nothing in particular that would inevitably lead to a hard border, but again I am simply concerned that everyone be aware of the potential risks,” he said. “We’re going to wait and see because the underlying EU-UK trade discussion could end up mooting the [internal market bill].” Under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will stay in the single market, including its state aid rules on domestic subsidies, and the full EU customs code will be enforced on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This would require refundable tariffs to be paid on goods that are “at risk” of moving through Northern Ireland and on to the Republic of Ireland, if a wider “zero tariff, zero quota” trade deal between the EU and the UK is not struck this year. The internal market bill and an upcoming finance bill will give ministers the power to limit the reach of the EU’s state aid laws where they might go beyond Northern Ireland and impact on businesses in the rest of the UK from next year. Ministers would also be given the power to decide unilaterally what goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would be judged to be “at risk” of moving into EU territory. The bill would additionally ensure that no export declarations were required for goods entering Britain from Northern Ireland. There are concerns that the failure of the UK to live up to its promise to enforce a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea could lead to the need for such checks to occur on the island of Ireland, a position that all sides are determined to avoid. Following an outcry by Tory MPs, Downing Street on Thursday clarified that it would only ask parliament to override parts of the Brexit agreement if the EU undermined the “fundamental purpose” of the Northern Ireland protocol. In the deal brokered with the rebels, the government said it would also seek to use the dispute resolution mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement at the same time as implementing the contentious clauses in the internal market bill. While some EU diplomats saw the government’s move as “promising”, senior EU officials close to the trade negotiations insisted the bill’s contentious clauses remained a breach of the withdrawal agreement. One such official said the UK was still seeking to negotiate “with a gun on the table – albeit not cocked”. “It’s better than more escalation. But … it’s trailing more breaches of the withdrawal agreement to come in the finance bill which is hardly reassuring.” One senior diplomat said the EU had been “distressed and appalled” by the UK’s attempt to unilaterally rewrite the withdrawal agreement but that the EU was determined to continue the talks. “Because it’s two separate tracks: one is the withdrawal agreement which the UK has decided to violate, and the next is going to be the future relationship,” the diplomat said. “We’ll see at the end of the month what the state will be then. We have several options at our hand on how to continue.” The EU is examining two main options: taking the UK to the European court of justice or continuing the negotiations and then presenting the British government with the choice of dropping the relevant clauses of the internal market bill in order to secure a trade deal or leaving without an agreement."
2020-09-17T18:13:57Z,politics,Politics,Viva Las Vagueness: Door Matt and Dido star in a cabaret of Covid cluelessness,"In Las Vegas, they would call it a residency. So shabby has the government’s performance and messaging been over the coronavirus that Matt Hancock has found himself in the House of Commons almost on a daily basis, either to answer an urgent question or to make a ministerial statement on the latest Covid shambles. And sure enough, the health secretary was back in the chamber on Thursday to outline the latest regional lockdowns that account for about one-seventh of the country – it can’t be long before there’s just a couple of villages in Cornwall open for business that are preventing another national lockdown being declared – and to announce a triage service for A&E departments. Press 1 if you think you are going to die in the next hour. 2 if you think you have a 50/50 chance of making it to the end of the day. 3 if you have broken a leg, and stop moaning. 4 to sod off and take some ibuprofen. Hancock didn’t think to mention the collapse of coronavirus testing in many parts of the country. Nor did he say that the R number is now thought to be an alarming 1.7 in London and other areas. There again, if he had, he would have used up some of his best material for next week’s shows. Not that Matt seems to be getting much enjoyment from all the attention, as he has become increasingly ratty. Like most Door Matts, Hancock’s natural instinct is to punch down. So rather than accepting his share of the blame for the things the government has got wrong, he has now taken to attacking opposition MPs – and even some on his own benches – for not being supportive enough. Like Boris, he can no longer accept a word of criticism. His reply to Labour’s Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who had merely pointed out some blindingly obvious truths, was a model of sneering gracelessness. At times like this, I think Hancock may be closer to losing his grip than even he realises. Still, at least we will always have Typhoid Dido Harding, the interim chief executive of the National Institute for Health Protection, who was making a rare appearance before the science and technology committee. Right from the start she looked to be on edge. And once she opened her mouth, it immediately became clear why. Typhoid Dido really didn’t have much of a clue about anything. She began by informing the committee that England only had the capacity for 242,000 tests a day, but she was totally unable to give an exact figure on the levels of demand. You could never be too sure, because about 27% were demanding tests when they had no symptoms. Typhoid Dido appeared to have no symptoms of meaningful neural activity. Trying to be helpful, her best guess was that demand outstripped capacity by three or four times. She thought that was a result. Typhoid then went on to say that all would be well because testing capacity would double to 500,000 in a matter of six weeks. The committee chair, Greg Clark, raised an eyebrow. Given that the government had missed all its other testing targets, why should we believe this one? And as 500,000 was the average daily figure of people experiencing Covid-like symptoms in a normal year, wasn’t the level of tests hopelessly short of coping with a pandemic? Typhoid seemed astonished to learn that there was a pandemic going on and even more surprised to learn that children went back to school in September.
Things went from bad to worse as it emerged that tests were being rationed because laboratories couldn’t keep up with demand and that far from meeting the prime minister’s target of a 100% results turnaround within 24 hours, the government was only achieving a figure of about 33%. “The system is failing,” said Clark. Typhoid begged to differ. She reckoned 33% was a trailblazing success. Eventually, Labour’s Graham Stringer intervened and asked the question on everyone’s mind: what on earth made her think she was the right person to head the new National Institute for Health Protection? Typhoid thought for a bit. It could have been that she had been chief executive of TalkTalk when it suffered a massive data breach resulting in her ignorance being described as a lesson to us all. It could have been that she had been on the board of the Jockey Club that gave the go-ahead to the Cheltenham festival. It could have been that she had been in charge of NHS test and trace, a service in which many employees made just two calls a month. Or it could just have been that she was a Tory peer, married to a Tory MP, who was prepared to step up to the plate when her country called. An expert in logistics and key performance indicators who “could act faster over a broader landscape”. It now became clear she saw that her main asset was to be able to talk bullshit – though not particularly convincingly. She wasn’t sure whether she would still be in the job if interviews ever started for it to be made permanent, but she wasn’t that bothered. Like Chris Grayling, who has just landed a £100k-a-year sideline in advising ports, despite having awarded a ferry contract to a company with no ferries, Typhoid Dido has the priceless asset of being able to fail upwards."
2020-09-17T17:08:17Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: demand for Covid tests outstripping capacity, MPs told – as it happened","Dido Harding, head of the UKâ€™s test-and-trace programme and the newly created National Institute for Health Protection, has told parliamentâ€™s science and technology committee that demand for coronavirus tests across the UK is three to four times higher than capacity Almost nine in 10 of all Covid-19 tests in England are now taking longer than 24 hours to produce results, as figures also revealed a 75% increase in positive weekly cases. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has announced an almost doubling of the infection control fund for care homes in England in an attempt to stop mobile temporary staff spreading Covid-19 in the coming months. Nearly 2 million people in north-east England will be banned from mixing with other families under the strictest measures imposed since the country eased out of nationwide lockdown. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has complained about what he called â€œthis endless carpingâ€� about shortages of coronavirus tests, prompting Labour to accuse the government of being out of touch with public concerns. That prompted this response from Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London.
Scientists have warned the government must act fast to contain the spread of coronavirus, including further restrictions on public mixing, though ministers have denied they are considering a full England lockdown. Downing Street has clarified that it would ask parliament to support using powers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement only if the EU undermines the â€œfundamental purposeâ€� of the Northern Ireland protocol.

2020-09-17T14:17:08Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Boris Johnson makes fresh concession to Tory rebels,"Downing Street has clarified that it would ask parliament to support using powers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement only if the EU undermines the “fundamental purpose” of the Northern Ireland protocol. Boris Johnson brokered a deal with Conservative rebels on Wednesday to see off a potential party revolt, agreeing to grant MPs a vote before invoking powers in the UK internal market bill that would break international law by breaching the EU withdrawal agreement. In a fresh concession to rebels, No 10 published a policy paper on Thursday setting out the circumstances in which it would use the powers, as well as confirming that the government would also seek to use the dispute resolution mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement at the same time. The government’s deal with backbenchers, a group of whom were supporting senior Tory MP Sir Bob Neill’s amendment to give parliament a veto over use of the measures in the bill, came on Wednesday hours after the resignation of Lord Keen, the UK government’s law officer for Scotland. In its policy paper on Thursday, the government explained that it will ask parliament to support the provisions in the relevant clauses “only in the case of, in our view, the EU being engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith or other obligations, and thereby undermining the fundamental purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol”. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, Northern Ireland would continue to enforce EU customs and follow product standards rules to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. No 10 also confirmed that “in parallel with the use of these provisions, it would always activate appropriate formal dispute settlement mechanisms with the aim of finding a solution through this route”.
Examples of behaviour prompting the use of the measures included in the internal market bill would include, the government said on Thursday, the EU refusing to grant third-country listing to UK agricultural goods for “manifestly unreasonable or poorly justified reasons”. Other examples listed include an insistence that GB–NI tariffs and related provision should be “charged in ways that are not related to the real risk of goods entering the EU single market”, as well as an insistence on export declarations for NI goods going to GB. The former Tory leader Lord Howard, who backed Brexit but has been an outspoken critic of the government’s bill, said the compromise “isn’t enough” for him to back it in the Lords. “The government is still asking Parliament to break international law,” he told the BBC on Thursday. Even with the changes, he described the chances of the bill being approved by the Lords as “not great”. He added: “I don’t know what my colleagues will do, but as far as I’m concerned this is a matter of principle.” While some EU diplomats saw the government’s move to compromise with rebels as “promising”, senior EU officials insisted that the contentious clauses in the internal market bill remained a breach of the withdrawal agreement. “It may convince the Commons, but not the EU,” said a senior European diplomatic source who said Brussels would scrutinise the legal text as it emerged. “It is still a violation of the withdrawal agreement, but is an interesting development all the same.” A second senior EU official said the UK was still seeking to negotiate “with a gun on the table – albeit not cocked”. Brussels is now viewing the last week of September and the first two weeks of October, before an EU leaders’ summit on 15 October, as “very crucial” to the outcome of the trade and security negotiations. One senior diplomat said the EU had been “distressed and appalled” by the UK’s attempt to unilaterally rewrite the withdrawal agreement, but added that the bloc was determined to continue the talks. “Because it’s two separate tracks: one is the withdrawal agreement which the UK has decided to violate, and the next is going to be the future relationship,” said the diplomat. The EU is examining two main options: taking the UK to the European court of Justice or continuing the negotiations and then presenting the British government with the choice of dropping the relevant clauses of the internal market bill in order to secure a trade deal or leaving without an agreement. “It is up to the UK now,” said an official. The bill passed its second reading in the Commons on Monday evening by a majority of 77 despite a group of Tory MPs abstaining. A joint statement issued on behalf of Neill, Damian Green MP, chairman of the One Nation caucus, and 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening said the government had agreed to table an amendment to the internal market bill at committee stage. Writing in the Telegraph last weekend, Johnson claimed that he had been anxious in recent weeks as negotiators believed there was a “serious misunderstanding” about the terms of the withdrawal agreement. “We are now hearing that, unless we agree to the EU’s terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea,” he wrote."
2020-09-17T13:39:52Z,politics,Politics,David Cameron signals that he wants Joe Biden to beat Trump,"David Cameron has strongly indicated he thinks a Joe Biden win in the US election would be a good outcome for the UK and wider world, calling Donald Trump a block on international cooperation over pressing issues such as the climate emergency. In a radio interview to promote the paperback edition of his memoir, the former prime minister also said he felt “big beasts” such as Jeremy Hunt should be in the UK cabinet, and obliquely chastised Boris Johnson for missing the first five emergency meetings about coronavirus. While Cameron stressed he was “not going to get involved in the US election”, he made his feelings plain about the outcome when asked who of Trump or Biden would be a better president for the UK. “I think that on all the, as it were, international issues – you want to see global action on climate change; you want to see action to continue to deal with the scourge of global poverty; if you want to see a promotion of trade and anti-protectionism, it’s hard to argue that Donald Trump is good for those things,” he told Times Radio. “I profoundly believe that we need that international cooperation to cope with these big problems, whether it’s terrorism, or climate change, or global poverty, or whatever. And an America that withdraws from those things makes it far more difficult to achieve anything. Whoever it is, we need engagement.” There was a “kernel of truth” in some Trump views, such as some European nations not paying enough towards Nato, Cameron said, but he added: “I know Trump drives everyone mad, and he certainly drives me mad a lot of the time.” Cameron, who said he had spent some of the Covid lockdown helping at a food bank in Chipping Norton, near his Cotswolds home, and that he and Johnson spoke or texted “from time to time”, was less forthright on UK politics. But he did strongly indicate that Johnson should reinstate the former health and foreign secretary Hunt and other “big beasts” to a cabinet which is often characterised as filled with ministers picked mainly for loyalty. “Jeremy is hugely capable,” Cameron said. “I hope his talent isn’t lost to politics forever, if I can put it that way.” Cameron said his approach to ministerial appointments was that “I didn’t fear the tall poppies”. He added: “I think you want to have the big players around the table.” While he did not directly criticise Johnson for missing the first five meetings of the government’s Cobra emergency committee called to decide a response to the then emerging coronavirus crisis – “I don’t know exactly what the circumstances were, so I’m not passing judgment” – Cameron said he would have acted differently. “As a way of understanding the situation and driving the necessary decisions, it’s brilliant,” he said of the meetings. “I didn’t always attend the first Cobra meeting of every emergency, [but] I always thought you had to get to focus on it quite quickly.”
He added: “The job of the prime minister in chairing Cobra is to get everyone together, find out the information, and then bang the table and ask some sometimes quite obvious questions.” Cameron, who this week mildly criticised Johnson for proposing to break international law by unilaterally unpicking the departure deal with the EU, said he could understand the government’s frustration over Brexit, but thought it was a mistake. He said: “The signal is bad. I have misgivings about it. It’s something you should do if all else has failed, and not put it on the table early doors.”"
2020-09-17T12:31:59Z,politics,Politics,North-east England lockdown: what are the new Covid restrictions?,"Who is affected by the latest restrictions? Nearly 2 million people who live in Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Gateshead, County Durham and Sunderland are covered by the new rules. What do the new measures say? Residents in these areas should not socialise with people outside their households from midnight on Thursday. This includes meeting people indoors, outdoors, or in social venues such as restaurants, bars and pubs. People who live alone and have formed a support bubble with another household will be able to see those people but no one else.
People should only use public transport for essential purposes, such as travelling to school or work; take holidays only with people in their own household or support bubble; and avoid attending amateur and semi-professional sporting events as spectators. Restaurants, pubs and bars will be restricted to table service only. Late-night restrictions will be introduced so these venues and other leisure and entertainment settings such as casinos must close between 10pm and 5am. Why have they been introduced? There has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in these seven council areas in the past three weeks, far outstripping the UK-wide rise in infections. A Guardian analysis shows the number of infections has tripled in these areas in the past three weeks, while in England generally it has nearly doubled. The region accounted for 15% of England’s coronavirus cases in the week to 14 September, despite making up only 3% of the population. The infection rate in Sunderland is 103 cases per 100,000 people, nearly three times the England average, and it is above 70 in South Tyneside, Gateshead and Newcastle. How do these restrictions compare with those in other areas? They are broadly similar to the measures introduced in other areas in recent weeks, including in west central Scotland, parts of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands. However, this is the first time a 10pm curfew on nightlife has been extended to cover such a broad area. How long will the restrictions be in place? There was no immediate detail from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on how long the rules will be in place. However, similar measures have in the past been reviewed every fortnight and it is unlikely they will be lifted before then. That would mean a review on or around the 1 October. Further detail is expected to be published on the government website later on Thursday."
2020-09-17T10:10:15Z,politics,Politics,Angry Tory MPs reject Joe Biden's comments on UK-EU Brexit talks,"Conservative MPs have reacted angrily to an intervention by Joe Biden, the US Democratic presidential candidate, in the UK Brexit talks, accusing him of ignorance of the Northern Ireland peace process. In a tweet on Wednesday, Biden warned the UK there would be no US-UK free trade agreement if the Brexit talks ended with the Good Friday agreement being undermined. He tweeted: “We can’t allow the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit. “Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.” His intervention was welcomed by Richard Neal, the chairman of Congress’s ways and means committee. The backlash was led by the former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who told the Times: “We don’t need lectures on the Northern Ireland peace deal from Mr Biden. If I were him I would worry more about the need for a peace deal in the US to stop the killing and rioting before lecturing other sovereign nations.” Donald Trump has made law and order a key theme of his re-election campaign after months of unrest triggered by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said: “Perhaps Mr Biden should talk to the EU since the only threat of an invisible border in Ireland would be if they insisted on levying tariffs.” Biden spoke out after the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, met the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in Washington in a bid to reassure her that the British government was not seeking a hard border on the island of Ireland via measures in its internal market bill, a move that is seen by the US pro-Irish lobby as potentially fatal to the peace process.
Raab has argued that the measures in the UK internal market bill are proportionate, precautionary and necessary due to the EU’s politicising of the stuttering talks on a trade deal between the UK and the EU. However, the EU hit back on Thursday, saying an agreement on a trade and security deal remained conditional on the government pulling the contentious clauses in the internal market bill. The European commission’s vice-president for the economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, said: “If the UK does not comply with the exit agreement, there will no longer be a basis for a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK. The UK government must correct this before we continue to negotiate our political and economic relations.” The dispute between Biden and Downing Street poses a broader threat to UK interests if Biden, a pro-EU and pro-Ireland politician, decides to turn against Boris Johnson, who has made a virtue of his close relations with the Trump administration. The former UK trade minister Conor Burns tweeted: “Hey JoeBiden would you like to discuss the Good Friday agreement? It is also called the Belfast agreement so it doesn’t offend both traditions. Did you actually know that? I was born in NI and I’m a Catholic and a Unionist. Here if you need help.” The Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, Joy Morrissey, replied that “Biden is shamelessly pandering to the American Irish vote while refusing to engage with the UK government or UK diplomatic channels. Nice.” She later deleted her tweet, but added: “Clearly it’s all about the Irish American vote.” Burns added: “The error those of us who supported Brexit was to assume the EU would behave rationally in seeking a free trade agreement with a large trading partner like the UK..” Alexander Stafford, the Conservative MP for Rother Valley, tweeted: “Is this the same JoeBiden who once described Britain’s position in Northern Ireland as ‘absolutely outrageous’. And who hit the headlines in the 1980s for his stand against the deportation of IRA suspects from the US to Britain?” John Redwood, a leading Brexiter, said: “Trade deals are nice to have but not essential. We did not have a trade deal with the US when we were in the EU. Getting back full control of our laws, our money and our borders is essential.” Theresa May’s former chief of staff Nick Timothy rejected the frenzy, dismissing “the sudden discovery that Democrats don’t like Brexit and prefer the Irish”. Other Tory MPs including Stewart Jackson tweeted articles claiming that two of the representatives criticising the UK over the Good Friday agreement were overt IRA sympathisers, and a third was a supporter of Martin McGuinness, the now deceased former deputy first minister for Northern Ireland. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “This shows the scale of the damage the government have done to Britain’s standing in the world. They’ve lost trust and undermined cooperation at the moment we most need it – and all to tear up an agreement they negotiated. Reckless, incompetent and utterly self-defeating.” Daniel Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to the US, has been working the corridors in Washington for the past fortnight, lobbying to lessen the threat the Irish perceive to the Good Friday agreement posed by the British proposals. He has been tweeting his gratitude to those representatives issuing support for the Good Friday agreement. No free trade deal between the UK and the US can be agreed unless it is supported by two-thirds of Congress. In a sign of Trump administration concern about the row, Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting chief of staff, will shortly make his first trip to the the UK in his new role as the US special envoy for Northern Ireland. The Foreign Office, criticised by some for failing to anticipate the likely US backlash, will argue Raab’s visit to Washington may have drawn a predictable reaction from some corners, but was necessary to reassure and counter Irish propaganda. But UK diplomats will be anxious that the UK is not seen to adopt a partisan stance in the US elections, especially since Biden currently holds a fragile poll lead."
2020-09-17T09:39:08Z,politics,Politics,Chris Grayling lands £100k job advising some of UK's top ports,"Chris Grayling, the former transport secretary who awarded a lucrative ferry contract to a firm that had no ferries, has been given a £100,000 job advising the owner of some of the UK’s top ports, it has emerged. The MP for Epsom and Ewell has been hired to give advice to Hutchison Ports, which operates Harwich and Felixstowe, among other terminals. According to the MPs’ register of financial interests, he will be paid for seven hours work a week for a year. The appointment has been approved by a Whitehall watchdog despite it raising concerns of a “perceived risk” that it may give the firm an unfair advantage. Grayling stepped down as transport secretary when Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, having served under his predecessor, Theresa May, for three years. He was criticised for awarding a contract to a group of ferry operators to provide extra capacity after the UK left the EU. Seaborne Freight, which was awarded a £13.8m contract in 2018 to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate to the Belgian port of Ostend if the UK left the EU without a deal, had no ferries and no trading history. It was one of three agreements worth a total of £107.7m signed by the government without a tendering process to help ease “severe congestion” at Dover by securing extra lorry capacity. The contracts, which Grayling described as an insurance policy, were later cancelled. The National Audit Office estimated that the costs incurred to the taxpayer could be as high as £56.6m. Some of Hutchison’s staff have been angered by Grayling’s appointment after being asked to cancel bonuses and accept shift changes to help the company weather the impact of the pandemic. Unite’s regional officer Miles Hubbard said: “For Felixstowe port’s hourly paid staff, who have lost their annual Christmas bonus and undergone detrimental shift changes to help the company get through the pandemic, Mr Grayling’s cushy number at the port is an insult. Hutchison Ports clearly has money to burn if it can afford to spend £100,000 on a part-time adviser.” The ferry contract was not the only decision made by Grayling while in cabinet that received criticism.
When justice secretary, he was condemned for deciding to part-privatise the probation service, which ended up costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds; attempting to cut legal aid to prisoners; and awarding a £6m contract to train prison staff in Saudi Arabia despite its appalling human rights record. He was also criticised for awarding a contract to Carillion to run prison maintenance when it was clear the firm was about to collapse. More recently, Johnson sought to install Grayling as chair of the powerful Commons intelligence and security committee in July. MPs on the committee voted to back his colleague Julian Lewis instead. Grayling later resigned from the committee. The MP is the latest former cabinet minister to get a lucrative job in the private sector while remaining in the Commons. The former chancellor Sajid Javid was recently signed up as an adviser by the investment bank JP Morgan. Philip Hammond, May’s chancellor who was elevated to the House of Lords last month, has taken on 11 paid positions, including advising the Kuwait Investment Office and giving “urgent advice” to Mohammed Al-Jadaan, the finance minister of Saudi Arabia. The advisory committee on business appointments said Grayling had reassured them he would not be advising Hutchison Ports on its commercial maritime activities, or risks and opportunities associated with Brexit. The body, which has been criticised for failing to clamp down on the revolving door from parliament to the private sector, said the role would be limited to advising the firm on its environmental strategy and its engagement with local enterprise bodies. It said the MP must comply with these and other conditions, including a ban on him lobbying ministers on behalf of the company or giving advice on UK government tenders, until July 2021, two years after he left the cabinet."
2020-09-17T06:00:50Z,politics,Politics,Calls for ‘wild belt’ land to be part of England's planning strategy,"New areas of protected “wild belt” land across the English countryside and in towns and cities must be created as part of the government’s planning changes to help nature recover, the Wildlife Trusts has said. The trusts’ analysis of the planning changes outlined by the government in a white paper suggests they will damage nature, increase air pollution and leave local people with no say on protecting urban wildlife corridors. The Wildlife Trusts is calling for the inclusion of areas of land to be specifically designated as places for nature recovery. They would be known as “wild belt”, protected from development and managed to allow the recovery of nature. The trust said wild belt areas were needed in towns, cities and the countryside to ensure that 30% of England was in nature recovery by 2030. Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “What is critical is making space for nature close to where people live and we need to protect them in the long term to allow nature to recover. “This wild belt could be a roadside embankment, a river valley or somewhere which is important to local people. So we take a piece of land which is not much good in terms of biodiversity and give it wild belt status and manage it to put nature into recovery. “This is our only hope. We have to help nature recover rather than just talking about slowing its decline.” The government changes say local authorities must designate areas for growth, renewal or protection. But Bennett said the government should also map out a network of nature recovery areas in each of these zones to designate as wild belt. Populations of the UK’s most important species have plummeted by an average of 60% since 1970, according to comprehensive analysis published last year. This week the RSPB highlighted how too little land was managed for nature in the UK, and said the government had failed to reach 17 out of 20 UN biodiversity targets agreed 10 years ago. The Wildlife Trusts said the white paper in its current form was a threat to nature. It said it has a bias towards permitting new developments, weakens environmental assessments of land and undermines the democratic process by reducing people’s opportunity to influence planning decisions. The new zones suggested by the government would do nothing to reverse nature’s decline or integrate it into people’s lives, the analysis said. The trusts are urging members of the public to demand that the government prioritise wildlife and nature recovery in the reforms. The wild belt designation would mean land that is of low biodiversity value could be designated for the recovery of nature. Bennett said it must reach into every part of England, from rural areas to towns and cities, securing the future of the new land that we are putting into recovery so that we can reach at least 30% of land in recovery by 2030 and address the climate and biodiversity emergency."
2020-09-17T05:00:49Z,politics,Politics,UK awards border contract to firm criticised over role in US deportations,"The government has awarded oversight of the UK’s post-Brexit border and customs data to Palantir, an American tech firm notorious for assisting the Trump administration’s drive to deport migrants from the US. Palantir, whose co-founder Peter Thiel has been a vocal supporter of Trump, was formally awarded a contract last week to manage the data analytics and architecture of the UK’s new “border flow tool”, which will collate data on the transit of goods and customs from 31 December, according to a Cabinet Office document seen by the Guardian. The “reasonable worst-case scenario” document, drawn up by a team of civil servants tasked with overseeing the transition to post-Brexit border arrangements, warns of queues of 7,000 lorries and two-day delays to enter the European Union. The document describes how a Cabinet Office working group, the border and protocol delivery group, is creating a “border impact centre” in Whitehall to assess issues with customs and the movement of goods after 31 December. “Services are being procured from Palantir, a leader in data analytics, to provide the data infrastructure and analytics capabilities to support the development of a border flow tool,” the document states. Founded in 2004 by Thiel and the technologist Alex Karp, Palantir has developed a multibillion-dollar business, in large part based on supplying data analytics software to branches of the US government, such as the Central Intelligence Agency and Los Angeles police department. Thiel is a libertarian who publicly endorsed Trump’s plan to “rebuild” the US in a speech at the Republican national convention in 2016. “Fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump,” he said at the time. According to the Wall Street Journal, however, Thiel has withheld donations from Trump’s 2020 campaign, expressing doubts he can win in the face of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Palantir has attracted sustained controversy over its ongoing partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the US government department charged with deporting undocumented immigrants from America.
Documents leaked to the Intercept describe Palantir’s Investigative Case Management software as “mission critical” to Ice’s deportation efforts. The firm was awarded a $41m (£31.5m) contract to develop the software in 2014. Palantir has previously sought to downplay its involvement in Ice operations. In a statement to the New York Times in 2018 it implied that its contract with Ice was in support of a separate division to that tasked with investigating migrants. Following internal criticism from staff over its collaboration with Ice’s drive to increase deportations under the Trump administration, and high-profile withdrawals from government by other Silicon Valley firms, Karp responded that Palantir was proud of its work, while Thiel accused Google of “treasonous” behaviour for withdrawing from its own government contract, according to the Washington Post. Earlier this year the Guardian reported on leaked documents revealing that Downing Street had recruited Palantir to compile and analyse a vast array of disparate datasets from UK public authorities, including some with confidential patient data, to help inform the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Palantir initially agreed to carry out the work for a nominal fee of £1. The contract was subsequently renewed in July for £1m. According to the Cabinet Office document, from January to April next year Palantir’s border flow tool will monitor any potential impacts resulting from border controls being imposed by EU member states on goods or people coming from the UK. After that, the software will be used to implement the UK government’s own controls. “As immediate disruption associated with low levels of trader readiness for member state controls subsides, the analytical insights derived from the BFT will be used to support the phased implementation of UK controls,” it states. The software, the document predicts, will help to bring about “delivery of one of the best borders in the world for 2025”.
The document, which is dated from last week and marked “official – sensitive”, states the contract with Palantir to develop the border flow tool would be in place by 11 September 2020. Testing would last several months with the tool in place to go live on 14 December. Palantir’s software will draw on data from HMRC, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Home Office and the Department for Transport. An amendment will be added to a government trade bill later this year to provide the legal basis for sharing the data required by the software, the document says. A government spokesperson said Palantir would only process data in the UK. “The procurement of any services from Palantir will be done transparently and fully in line with well-established government procurement rules,” he said. “Robust testing has shown Palantir’s technologies are effective, making the company well-placed to deliver the border flow tool. As with all contracts of this nature, the government will put in place strict measures to protect data.” Palantir declined to comment. • This article was amended on 17 September 2020 to correctly identify Peter Thiel as having accused Google of “treasonous” behaviour. An earlier version incorrectly attributed this to Alex Karp."
2020-09-17T05:00:48Z,politics,Politics,Robert Buckland urged to join Lord Keen in quitting over Brexit bill,"The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, is facing calls to resign over government plans to override international law after another senior law officer, Lord Keen, quit rather than continue to support the policy. Downing Street confirmed Keen’s departure as advocate general for Scotland. In his resignation letter, he said he “found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a law officer with your policy intentions”. It came a week after the resignation of the government’s top legal civil servant, Jonathan Jones – and turned the spotlight on Buckland, who is also lord chancellor, and the attorney general, Suella Braverman. A senior Tory source close to Keen said he had offered his resignation after clashing with Braverman during a private discussion they had on Tuesday night about the internal market bill. The Guardian revealed last week that a rift between the two had emerged after Keen said he believed the government’s attempt to override the EU withdrawal treaty would put ministers in breach of the ministerial code. Braverman and Michael Ellis, the solicitor general, said the ministerial code only covered breaches of UK law.
Buckland was pressed on Wednesday about whether he should resign, rather than support legislation that gives ministers the powers to bypass the withdrawal agreement, which is an international treaty. He said he would do so only if the law had been breached “in a way that cannot be fudged”. He told Sky News the government was not yet at that stage. Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general, called on both Buckland and Braverman to resign, rather than support legislation that breaks international law. Grieve said: “The attorney general seems to be an enthusiastic endorser of this completely warped view of international law. She and Ellis don’t appear to have provided any legal precedents for their comments on [breaking] international law in their [advice to the government]. “I’m afraid that I think the lord chancellor’s position is even more clearcut. He takes an oath of office to uphold or protect the rule of law. The rule of law includes international law. “Although I feel some sympathy for ex-colleagues because of the position they have been put in, I think [Buckland’s] position is untenable. He should, I’m afraid, have resigned on the day the bill was published. He may have decided to stay and try and moderate [the government’s position]. I can understand that from a moral position but I think that’s wrong.” The Conservative former solicitor general Lord Garnier praised Keen for resigning and called on Braverman, Ellis and Buckland to consider their positions. “I have questioned why the law officers are still in office,” he told the Guardian. “Richard Keen has struggled very hard to make the government behave. It has been an unequal struggle. I applaud him for what he has tried to do. He has done the right thing now in resigning. I hope that Richard Keen’s departure will make the AG [attorney general], solicitor general and lord chancellor look very carefully at their positions.” Joanna Cherry, a senior lawyer and the Scottish National party’s justice spokeswoman at Westminster, said Keen had finally done the right thing by offering his resignation but that it exposed the six Scottish Tories who voted for the measures this week to fresh questions. “No Scottish law officer could possibly reconcile the lack of regard Boris Johnson and his government has for the rule of law with his or her obligation as an officer of the Scottish courts,” she said. “It shows, yet again, that this Tory government cannot be trusted. And it leaves Douglas Ross and the six spineless Scottish Tory MPs who voted for the bill totally exposed and in an utterly untenable position.” Ross, the Tories’ leader in Scotland, had previously sought to distance himself from Downing Street, resigning as a minister in the summer in protest over Dominic Cummings’ lockdown drive to Durham. The shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer, said: “The lord chancellor is a decent person and a good lawyer. Lord Keen and Jonathan Jones, both serious lawyers, have gone. The lord chancellor cannot stay and expect to be taken as a serious lawyer.” Keen’s resignation followed testy exchanges with Falconer over the legislation, during which Keen suggested the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, had “answered the wrong question” when he said the bill would break the law. Lewis flatly contradicted that on Wednesday, telling MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs committee: “I’ve spoken to Lord Keen, when he’s looked at the specific question I was asked last week. He has agreed with me that the answer I gave was correct. That answer I gave reflects the government legal advice.” No 10 sources suggested Keen had been close to resignation for several days, and said he did not speak to the prime minister on Wednesday. His departure came despite Downing Street reaching an agreement with Conservative rebels who declined to back the internal market bill at its second reading on Monday – and an insistence from the prime minister that he was merely taking a “belt and braces” approach to the Brexit negotiations. Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: “No government should put before parliament a bill that deliberately encourages the legislature to breach international law. This is especially so where neither the circumstances nor the signatories have changed from when the government originally signed the treaty a few months ago. “The role of each law officer is to uphold and defend the rule of law, even when it is unpopular with the government.”"
2020-09-16T22:09:48Z,politics,Politics,Biden and Pelosi warn UK over risking Good Friday agreement,"Joe Biden on Wednesday joined the clamour of Democrats warning Boris Johnson not to let the Northern Ireland Good Friday agreement become a casualty of his Brexit talks. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is in Washington trying to repair relations with pro-Irish Democrats amid concerns that the UK’s attempt to leave the EU on its own terms will undermine the Good Friday peace agreement. Democrats have warned that if the UK undermines the peace process or reinstates a hard border to secure Brexit on its terms, the UK’s chances of securing the required congressional support for a UK-US free trade deal will disappear. Biden, the Democrat presidential candidate, said in a tweet on Wednesday night: “We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit. Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.” UK diplomats will be deeply disturbed that with fewer than 50 days to the presidential election, the UK government has contrived to set up a major political clash with the candidate currently given a 75% chance of becoming the next president in January 2021. Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker and leading Democrat, also issued a warning to Raab after their meeting. Raab had earlier accused the EU of trying to politicise the Brexit withdrawal agreement, and insisted the UK had no desire to set up new infrastructure on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Pelosi said she welcomed his assurances but that she had reiterated the message she said she had given to leaders in London last year. She added: “If the UK violates its international agreements and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of UK-US free trade agreement passing the Congress. “The Good Friday agreement is valued by the American people and will continue to be proudly defended by the US Congress.” Pelosi met Raab with the chairman of the Congress ways and means committee, Richard Neal. The pro-Irish lobby in Washington is as politically influential as that in the UK, even though its economy and defence capabilities are no match for London’s. Pelosi’s warning shows how the UK efforts to renegotiate the Northern Ireland protocol is having wider repercussions across the Atlantic, and so risking free trade with the US, one of the major touted benefits of Brexit. The possible election of Joe Biden as president only increases that risk, but whichever candidate wins a free trade deal needs the support of two-thirds of Congress to pass. Earlier, Raab, standing alongside the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had told reporters: “Our commitment to the Good Friday agreement, and to avoid any extra infrastructure at the border between the north and south [of the island of Ireland], is absolute. “To be absolutely clear, the UK action here is defensive in relation to what the EU is doing. It is precautionary – we have not done any of it yet – and is proportionate. “What we cannot have – and this is contrary to the Northern Ireland protocol and a risk to the Good Friday agreement – is the EU seeking to erect a regulatory border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain.” Pompeo said simply it was a matter for the UK government but “he had great confidence that they will get this right in a way that treats everyone fairly and get a good outcome for the people of the UK that voted for this several years back”. Pompeo struck an aggressive note on Iran, the other point of friction between the UK and the US, by saying the US would return to the UN next week to reimpose UN sanctions, adding that this would mean the arms embargo on Iran, due to be lifted in October, would become permanent next week. “We’ll do all the things we need to do to ensure that those sanctions are enforced,” he said when asked how the US would achieve that and what it would do to punish countries that did not reimpose the measures. A major pro-Irish lobby group, the ad hoc committee to protect the Good Friday agreement, has vowed to build “a green wall” to defend the agreement, citing a compelling statement from former prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair.
Four senior congressmen in a joint statement warned the UK’s plans “could have disastrous consequences for the Good Friday agreement and the broader process to maintain peace on the island of Ireland”. They added: “Many in the Congress and the US consider the issue of the Good Friday agreement and a potential US-UK free trade agreement are inextricably linked.” They also said they supported Pelosi’s statement that she would not back any free trade agreement that undermined the broader Irish peace process. The quartet urged Raab “to abandon any or all legally questionable and unfair efforts to flout the Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement”.
The letter was signed by Neal, Eliot Engel, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Congress, William Keating, the chair of the House subcommittee on European affairs, and Peter King, the only Republican congressman in the quartet. All four represent seats with large Irish populations. Neal told the New York Times he had been given previous assurances by Raab about the Good Friday agreement, but said he had been blindsided about the latest proposed changes in the withdrawal agreement. The British position has not been helped by the conflicting government explanations for why the protocol is being changed or the news that the external legal advice commissioned by UK law officers came exclusively from pro-leave barristers."
2020-09-16T19:31:30Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson bows to Tory rebels with Brexit bill compromise,"Conservative rebels have forced Boris Johnson into an embarrassing climbdown, with the PM brokering a deal to see off a potential party revolt over a bill that would break international law. After two days of private negotiations, the prime minister agreed to grant MPs a vote about when to invoke controversial powers in the UK internal market bill that would breach the EU withdrawal agreement. The deal came hours after the resignation of Lord Keen, the UK government’s law officer for Scotland. He said he had grappled with the proposed breaches of law in the bill and come to the conclusion he could not defend it. His departure will put further pressure on the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the attorney general, Suella Braverman, to consider their positions. Dominic Grieve, who previously held Braverman’s post, joined calls for them to quit on Wednesday. Jonathan Jones, the government’s top legal civil servant, had quit his post over the internal market bill a week earlier. Johnson’s new deal with his restive MPs is unlikely to give any comfort to enraged leaders in Brussels, because the move still gives ministers the power to potentially trangress international law. Labour has also raised alarm about one aspect of the compromise, which would appear to restrict any legal challenge to use of the new powers, saying it would make the bill “worse, not better”. The Guardian has learned that France is pushing for the EU to launch a swift infringement proceeding against the UK over the bill.
After a meeting with senior MPs in Johnson’s Commons office on Wednesday afternoon, No 10 issued a joint statement with Bob Neill, chair of the justice select committee, who tabled an amendment to the bill, and Damian Green, chair of the One Nation caucus of Tory MPs, many of whom had threatened to rebel on the bill. The Guardian understands the deal was brokered by the deputy chief Brexit negotiator Oliver Lewis, the former research director of Vote Leave, with the chief negotiator, David Frost, currently in Brussels. The change will give MPs a separate vote to invoke those powers – one Johnson is likely to win with the government’s majority. In the joint statement, the two sides said it would give “a clearer, more explicit democratic mandate for the use of these powers, and also provides more legal certainty”. The government is also set to table another amendment which sets clear limits on the scope and timeliness of judicial review into the exercise of these powers, according to the statement – a move set to provoke concern in legal circles. The shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer, tweeted: “This doesn’t remedy the breaches of international law which arise from the bill. And it envisages restricting people who have private rights taken away by the powers in the bill from going to court to complain about it. Honestly it’s getting worse not better.” One aim is to provide some legal certainty for businesses that decisions made by ministers using powers granted by the bill would not be subject to immediate legal challenge. The statement said there was “near-unanimous agreement” within the party that the government “must be able to use these powers as a final resort, that there must be legal certainty, and that no further amendments are required on these powers”. Many senior Conservatives had appeared prepared to rebel to back an amendment by Neill next week, in order to signal their disquiet with the bill’s powers. Those who abstained at the second reading of the bill on Monday included the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox, the former chancellor Sajid Javid, and two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Karen Bradley and Julian Smith.
All five living former UK prime ministers had raised concerns about the bill. During a meeting in Brussels with ambassadors of the 27 member states on Wednesday, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier described Downing Street’s actions as a “provocation”. He suggested that the tabling of the legislation had been a tactical move to put pressure on Brussels to agree a trade deal and iron out problems with the withdrawal agreement. In response, the French president Emmanuel Macron’s representative in the meeting called for the bloc to move ahead and launch legal action, opening up the potential for the UK to be confronted with huge fines. A number of member states also raised the issue of trust following a week of “noise” from London, including claims that the EU was seeking to “blockade” Northern Ireland. “This was seen as a sign of how low the UK was prepared to go,” a source said. “One delegation said that the UK government was a master of disseminating fake news and the EU had to be prepared to counter those messages.” At the liaison committee meeting of senior MPs on Wednesday, Johnson said he believed the EU may not be negotiating with the UK in good faith and that provisions in the bill would guard against the bloc behaving in an “unreasonable” way if the UK failed to agree a trade deal. Asked by Labour’s Hilary Benn whether he thought the EU was negotiating in good faith, the prime minister said: “I don’t believe they are.” The comments contradict the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, who earlier told a separate sitting of MPs he believed the EU was acting in good faith. Johnson said it was “always possible that I am mistaken and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong”. The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said Labour would continue to oppose the bill. “This does not fix the problem of breaking the law, damaging our reputation around the world and damaging our future prosperity,” he said. “We need a trade deal with Europe and that is what we were promised at the election. Breaking our own word and the treaty the prime minister signed puts that at risk. On the basis of tonight’s statement, this bill still breaks international law, reopens the Brexit debate and Labour will continue to oppose it.”"
2020-09-16T18:43:12Z,politics,Politics,Lord Keen: what were the events that led to Tory peer's resignation?,"It was last week that questions over Lord Keen’s position as one of the government’s senior law advisers first emerged. A three-page letter, marked “official – sensitive”, seen by the Guardian, revealed his serious reservations over Downing Street’s intention to override the EU withdrawal agreement. It summarised the legal opinions of the government’s three law officers: the attorney general, Suella Braverman, the solicitor general, Michael Ellis, and Keen, then the advocate general for Scotland.
The letter showed that Keen, who was also the Ministry of Justice spokesman in the Lords, was alone in advising the government it would breach the ministerial code if ministers defied international law and overrode the withdrawal agreement. Despite that revelation, Keen held the government line on the necessity of the bill, refining its position by arguing in the Lords that “the bill does not of itself constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law”. On Tuesday, however, he took a different tack, appearing in the Lords and putting himself at odds with Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, whose startling admission last week that the internal market bill breached international law triggered the latest Brexit crisis.
Keen suggested that Lewis’s words should be qualified because he had “essentially answered the wrong question” when he spoke to MPs. But on Wednesday, the Northern Ireland secretary, giving evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs select committee, emphatically rejected that suggestion. He had given the “correct” answer, Lewis said, and it was a “very straight answer” that was “absolutely in line” with legal advice. Doubling down, he said he had read from a script. “I read out something very specific because I wanted to ensure that what I said … to make sure that I was giving the house a straight answer. My answer was in line with the legal opinion given by the law officers. The position I took at the dispatch box is not a breach of the ministerial code, but I am not the arbiter of that.” Lewis said he had spoken to Keen and that he had “agreed that the answer I gave was the correct answer”. Over the previous hours, there is now known to have been a behind-the-scenes clash with the government, which had been attempting to maintain a unified front, at least at cabinet level. Keen’s attempt to impose a different narrative on the legislation seems to have failed. Later on Wednesday, he confirmed he had handed his resignation to the prime minister, bringing to an end a years-long tenure as a minister – and adding to the government’s Brexit headaches."
2020-09-16T18:32:48Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson is tested on Covid and Brexit, his specialist subjects of ignorance | John Crace","It’s no great secret that Boris Johnson has problems with women. And not just his wives, girlfriends and IT advisers. So going in to prime minister’s questions to face Angela Rayner – a working-class former care worker and the type of woman he has probably never previously encountered – who was standing in for the self-isolating Keir Starmer, Johnson’s sole objective was to try to avoid being his normal aggressive, condescending, patronising self. And though he did occasionally peer across the dispatch box, as if to check whether Rayner was from another planet, he did just about hold it together. There were no jokes or insults. This was about as close to polite as Boris can manage. Rayner appeared understandably nervous at first – this was her first outing at PMQs – but quickly got into her stride with a story about a man called Keir who couldn’t get to work that morning, before reminding Boris that she had once worked in the care sector and did he have a clue what the average wage for someone working in that profession was? He didn’t, but wasn’t bothered. He was just focused on trying not to sound too rude. Which is pretty much the way the rest of the session played out. Rayner would ask some telling questions about the government’s failures to meet either its own – or even adequate – coronavirus testing targets, and Boris would just waffle along with as much ersatz charm as he could manage. It didn’t matter if he didn’t know the answer or came out with some figures that even he knew were bullshit; the only strategy in play was to sound as if he was treating Rayner as an equal. Rayner did get in some good lines about driving to Durham for a Covid test and the government prioritising grouse shooting – Johnson’s self-inflicted wound that he was acting on the people’s priorities raised the odd groan from his own benches – but Boris was long past caring. The Labour deputy leader might have got the better of the exchanges, but he had lasted the 15 minutes without portraying himself as too much of an unreconstructed, entitled dinosaur. Which, given the circumstances, just about counted as a draw. Far more revealing – as in, revealing of just how little command of the detail the prime minister actually has – was his appearance before the liaison committee, the supergroup of select committee chairs, later in the afternoon. Then the committee does have the advantage of being able to carry on asking questions until Johnson’s cluelessness is exposed. It was also unfortunate for Boris that two of the main areas under examination were his specialist subjects of ignorance: the coronavirus and Brexit. The science committee chair, Greg Clark, got things under way by observing that the government’s Covid testing systems were – to put it kindly – a bit of a mess. Boris merely fidgeted and rubbed his bloodshot eyes, searching for inspiration. We’re definitely going to be testing 500,000 per day by the end of October. Clark sighed. At that time of year there were normally 500,000 people each day displaying symptoms consistent with Covid anyway, so that really wasn’t going to be enough to begin to deal with the problem. Johnson tugged his hair and suggested it would be helpful if only those who definitely had the virus should ask for a test. Moments later, he denied to Meg Hillier having any knowledge of ever promising Operation Moonshot that would deliver 10m tests a day that delivered results in just 20 minutes. Hold that thought. We have a prime minister who can’t remember having committed his government to spending £100bn live on TV a week earlier. Sometimes it’s a wonder he can get himself dressed in the morning. That, though, turned out to be Boris at his most coherent. For the rest of the session he looked like an overgrown schoolkid who had been put on the naughty step for failure to deliver his homework. When was there going to be a public inquiry? Never, he hoped. Though there might be a “lessons learned” inquiry some time in the future whose conclusion would be to never hold a public inquiry. Labour’s Catherine McKinnell then asked him about a report he clearly didn’t know existed and followed up by suggesting that if it was OK for the government to break the law in limited and specific ways, then why couldn’t members of the public choose which laws they wanted to break in specific and limited ways. Boris again had no answer, other than to claim there had always been one rule for him and another for everyone else. Things turned uglier still when the subject moved on to Brexit. Johnson just smirked when asked why he was choosing to break international law rather than abide by the arbitration procedures he himself had negotiated in the withdrawal agreement. When pushed further, he hinted that he hadn’t realised that leaving the EU meant leaving the EU in its entirety, rather than being able to pick and choose the bits we fancied keeping. This, Johnson claimed, was proof that the EU had not been negotiating in good faith. Yet again, satire proved to be a straightforward transcription service. Not least because Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, had only that morning told the select committee that the EU had acted reasonably throughout. Nor could Boris say who was right: the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, who claimed the internal markets bill only broke the law if implemented, or Brandon Lewis, who said it did so under any circumstances. “I refer you to the advice of the attorney general,” Johnson shrugged. When you’re relying on the synaptically challenged Suella Braverman – whom you wouldn’t employ to fight a parking ticket – for answers, then you know you’re fighting a lost cause. The session ended in confusion, with the prime minister unable to say whether Lord Keen, the Tory advocate general for Scotland, had resigned after being corrected by the Northern Ireland secretary over his remarks on law breaking in parliament. Minutes later, it was announced that Keen had indeed resigned. Though whether the Tories would be able to get a replacement was another matter, as anyone who agreed to take the job would be immediately disbarred for being willing to break the law. As so often, the line between farce and tragedy was becoming increasingly blurred."
2020-09-16T17:58:02Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Labour says No 10 concession over internal market bill makes it worse â€“ as it happened,"Downing Street has offered a concession to Tory MPs worried about the internal market bill, which gives ministers the powers to break international law. The move will satisfy many Tory MPs who refused to vote for the bill at second reading on Monday - it has been welcomed by Sir Bob Neill, who was leading this particular rebellion - but some Conservatives, particularly in the Lords, may continue to oppose the legislation because today’s concession does not address the argument the very act of passing the bill breaks the Brexit withdrawal agreement - even if its powers are never used. (See 6.22pm.) Labour has said the changes announced tonight will make the bill worse. This is from Charlie Falconer, the former lord chancellor who is now shadow attorney general.
Boris Johnson has told MPs on the liaison committee that he thinks the EU is not negotiating with the UK “in good faith” - even though Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told another committee this morning that it was. Johnson has admitted that the UK does not have enough coronavirus testing capacity. He told the liaison committee: We don’t have enough testing capacity now because, in an ideal world, I would like to test absolutely everybody that wants a test immediately. Angela Rayner has tackled Johnson over a “collapsing” Covid test regime and a wider crisis in the care sector, using a prime minister’s questions where she stood in for Keir Starmer to accuse Johnson of refusing to take responsibility for his failings. Headteachers and school governors have written a strongly worded letter to the prime minister “imploring” him to take personal charge of the crisis in Covid testing, warning that children’s return to education is being put at risk by failures in the system. Johnson has suffered another embarrassing resignation over his controversial Brexit policy after Lord Keen, the UK government’s law officer for Scotland, stepped down. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is facing a growing backlash in the US Congress after senior Democrats warned they would scupper any future US-UK trade deal if the UK does anything to jeopardise the Good Friday agreement in an attempt to leave the European Union on its own terms. At a press conference in Washington, Raab defended the internal market bill, the UK proposal that has alarmed Democrats, saying the UK was responding to a threat posed by the EU and that any measures taken would be defensive, precautionary and proportionate. The British public backs an ambitious transformation of the UK into a greener, fairer more equal society as it emerges from the Covid-19 crisis, according to an inquiry by a cross-party group of MPs. A spate of deaths from Covid-19 in a hospital in Greater Manchester are “a canary in the mine” for the rest of the country if it continues to struggle to test and trace infections, one of the UK’s most senior public health chiefs has warned. A trip to Doncaster races by a group of sports fans from south Wales is being blamed for a cluster of Covid-19 cases in an area where a new, strict lockdown is being imposed. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on the global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-09-16T17:54:30Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak to use 'creative' ways to keep people in jobs,"Rishi Sunak has insisted that he will close the furlough scheme at the end of next month – but this week hinted that he could announce new measures to protect employment, telling MPs he would use “creative” ways to help keep people in jobs. The government will pay bonuses of £1,000 for employers who bring back furloughed staff, and has launched the £2bn “kickstart” job creation scheme to fund work placements for under-25s. But business groups, trade unions and Labour want additional measures to prevent a full-blown job crisis this autumn. Some of the options he could consider include: Targeted furlough extension The powerful Commons Treasury committee has urged the chancellor to consider targeted extensions to the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. While the share of the UK workforce on furlough has fallen from 30% in May to 11% most recently, the figures are far higher for some sectors, where businesses remain closed or face tough physical distancing measures. More than 40% of workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation industries were still on furlough in mid-August, while almost a third of workers in hotels and restaurants are still away from their posts. UK Hospitality warned that 900,000 jobs in the sector were at risk without targeted support from government. Short-time working schemes The TUC has outlined a plan for a short-time working scheme, which would involve the government subsidising workers’ wages for hours they do not work. The TUC has the ear of the chancellor, after helping Sunak design the furlough scheme earlier this year. Under the TUC proposal, workers would receive 80% of pay for the hours they are not in work, including when they are training. Their employer would receive a 70% state subsidy, provided they bring back every worker for a minimum proportion of their normal working hours. Such a plan would cost less than the full furlough scheme, as companies must contribute. The plan is similar to schemes used in Europe, such as the German Kurzarbeit (“short work”) scheme, which has been extended from 12 to 24 months – taking it well into 2022. Austria and France have also extended similar systems. Employer national insurance contributions Business groups want the government to reduce the cost of employing workers. According to research from the Institute of Employment Studies, employer NICs are the single largest non-wage labour cost companies face. The thinktank said employer NICs represent a tax of 13.8% on earnings above £8,788 a year, adding about £2,400 to the cost of employing someone on an average wage. Sunak could raise the threshold at which employer NICs are made to encourage firms to hire workers. Business rates The chancellor could consider other ways to reduce the costs businesses face, helping them to retain or take on new staff, although such policy moves would lack a direct link to employment. One move called for by companies is a reduction in business rates – the tax companies pay on the premises they occupy. Business rates holidays have already been used for some retail, leisure and hospitality firms in response to Covid-19, but employers’ groups want the government to go further. The government is due to complete a review of business rates next spring. Expanding kickstart More funding for the Treasury’s kickstart job creation scheme could be used to expand the programme. The scheme provides funding for businesses to take on a 16-24-year-old for a six-month work placement on the minimum wage. Employers can choose to top up wages. The Learning and Work Institute, a thinktank, has called for an additional £1bn funding for the scheme to expand it to include over-25s. Public sector hiring After Boris Johnson campaigned on a promise to hire more police officers, doctors, nurses and teachers at the election, the chancellor could provide more funding for public sector jobs to prevent higher levels of unemployment. The TUC has urged the government to create 600,000 new public sector roles across health, social care, local government, education and public administration. The Learning and Work Institute has also said £7.6bn should be ploughed into social care, childcare and adult learning schemes to create 270,000 roles across the economy. Creating green jobs Sunak announced a £2bn “green homes” grant to make Britain’s draughty homes more energy-efficient and £1bn to retrofit public buildings, aimed at creating new green jobs in construction and helping to meet the government’s net-zero targets. However, campaigners, thinktanks and trade unions have called for the chancellor to go further, saying the package is worth much less than £36bn of spending announced for similar plans in Germany. The TUC has called on the government to bring forward at least £85bn of infrastructure investment, with the potential to create 1.24m jobs. Boosting demand The government could use tax and spending policies to raise demand in the economy for goods and services, giving companies greater confidence to keep staff or hire new workers. However, these measures are not directly linked to employment. Sunak used the eat out to help out scheme and a targeted VAT cut for food and non-alcoholic drinks to help the hospitality sector, and could expand his use of such policies. He has also defended the stamp duty holiday, until March next year, as a means of stimulating housing market activity and raising demand for goods and services connected to moving home – such as solicitors, estate agents, removal firms and tradespeople. The Resolution Foundation has suggested Sunak use a voucher scheme to give all adults £500 and children £250 in vouchers to spend in the hardest-hit industries. Unemployment benefits Sunak announced a temporary boost to universal credit at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis to cushion the financial blow for those who did not benefit from furlough or the self-employed income support scheme. The £1,000 increase did not, however, make up for a decade of austerity. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that families falling out of work will get £1,600 less on average in benefits than they would have done in 2011. The boost is also due to expire in March 2021. Calling for the increase to be made permanent, the Resolution Foundation has warned that allowing it to expire would risk six million households seeing their income falling by more than £1,000 from the start of April next year."
2020-09-16T17:05:48Z,politics,Politics,Lord Keen resigns over Boris Johnson's Brexit plan,"Boris Johnson has suffered another embarrassing resignation over his controversial Brexit policy after Lord Keen, the UK government’s law officer for Scotland, stepped down. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Lord Keen has resigned as advocate general for Scotland. The prime minister thanks him for his service.” Keen had confirmed to Scottish paper the Press and Journal several hours earlier that he had tendered his resignation, but Boris Johnson told MPs on the cross-party liaison committee in the afternoon that “conversations on that matter are continuing”, prompting speculation he was trying to persuade the senior law officer to stay. Keen, the government’s advocate general for Scotland, was involved in an angry clash with the shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer, over the internal market bill on Tuesday.
Keen appeared to suggest that the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, had “answered the wrong question” when he said the bill would break the law. Lewis’s concession last week that the legislation “does break international law in a specific and limited way” provoked a backlash among Conservative MPs. When challenged about the remark in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Keen said: “It is my view that the secretary of state for Northern Ireland essentially answered the wrong question.” Lewis flatly rejected that explanation on Wednesday, telling MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs committee: “I’ve spoken to Lord Keen, when he’s looked at the specific question I was asked last week. He has agreed with me that the answer I gave was correct. That answer I gave reflects the government legal advice.” The Guardian understands Keen had previously told friends he was staying to “steady the ship”. One ally said: “That’s what he seems to have been doing.” Downing Street initially endorsed Lewis’s line about breaking international law, but has appeared to take a more emollient approach in recent days after a string of senior MPs, including the former chancellor Sajid Javid, refused to back the legislation. Talks are continuing between the government and backbench rebels to try to secure their support – perhaps by limiting the circumstances in which the law, which would override aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol, could be used. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, denied on Wednesday that he was “wobbly” over the legislation, as claimed by some colleagues. But he said he would resign if the government broke international law in a way that could not be “fudged”. The government’s chief lawyer, Jonathan Jones, stepped down last week as ministers prepared to publish the legislation. The Guardian revealed last week that Keen had warned that tearing up aspects of the withdrawal agreement would breach the ministerial code – a view rejected by the attorney general, Suella Braverman. “It is his opinion that [the ministerial code] includes the obligation under international law to act in good faith with respect to the UK’s treaty obligations,” an official paper leaked to the Guardian said.
However, Braverman and Michael Ellis, the solicitor general, said they were confident there was no breach of the code. The former shadow attorney general Lady Chakrabarti, who faced Keen across the dispatch box in the House of Lords, said: “All true Conservatives will be searching their souls today. Governments of both sides have broken domestic and international law this century; sometimes catastrophically. “But never before have they bragged about it in advance. There aren’t enough police officers on the planet to achieve the rule of law by force. If there were, who would protect us from them and their paymasters? This is not Conservatism in action, it is something far more terrifying. It has reared its head before in Europe and it doesn’t end well.”"
2020-09-16T15:26:02Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings: Met refuses to look into reports of second Durham trip,"The Metropolitan police has refused to help clarify whether Dominic Cummings made a second trip to Durham during lockdown at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Deputy commissioner Sir Stephen House said he understood “the passion” the behaviour of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser provoked, but he insisted the Met was sticking to its decision not to retrospectively investigate breaches of the Covid regulations. Speaking to the London assembly, House suggested the Met did not have the resources to investigate whether Cummings left London for an alleged second trip to Durham on the weekend of 18-19 April. In May, Cummings admitted making the first trip at the end of March and a visit to Barnard Castle on 12 April, his wife’s birthday, as revealed by the Guardian and Daily Mirror. But he denied he was in Durham on 19 April, despite the testimony of a witness who said they saw him admiring bluebells that morning in Houghall woods on the outskirts of the city. Since then, three other witnesses, including two who complained to the police, said they also saw someone they believed to be Cummings on the morning of 19 April in the same area.
In his Downing Street rose garden statement in May, Cummings said he had phone data to prove he was in London that day, but he has repeatedly refused to produce the evidence. Johnson told MPs he had seen this evidence but refused to submit it for independent scrutiny. Unmesh Desai, the Labour chair of the London assembly’s police and crime committee, urged House to help clear up the matter “in the interests of transparency”. He said: “The prime minister said that they had looked at the evidence [and] accepted that he was not there. There are four witnesses who said very clearly that they saw Mr Cummings in Durham. Shouldn’t the Met investigate where he was on 19 April?” House replied: “I understand the passion involved in it. But the Met is not investigating Covid breaches retrospectively.” In May, Durham police found Cummings may have breached health protection regulations by travelling to Barnard Castle, but they concluded there was “insufficient evidence” that he was in Durham on 19 April. This prompted a complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct from Dave and Clare Edwards, who gave statements to the force claiming they saw him that morning. Desai suggested that as Durham police’s investigation may have been “compromised”, the Met could intervene to help settle the matter. He also said the disputed second trip should be a matter for the Met because it involved an allegation that he left London. But House rejected the request. He added: “We have spent a lot of this meeting talking about police resources stretched in relation to rape, public order and antisocial behaviour. We have to take some decisions, and that’s one of the ones we’ve taken.” Desai replied: “If people in [a senior] position will not set some standards then clearly the public will say, ‘Why should we then be subjected to the same restrictions?.’”
London’s deputy mayor for crime and policing, Sophie Linden, said she could not instruct the Met to investigate. She said: “Politicians do not intervene or interfere in operational decision-making about who or who isn’t investigated.” But she added: “I think it’s incredibly important that everybody complies [with the Covid regulations]. When high-profile people blatantly flout the rules, it is incredibly damaging, and we saw that for the case that you’re referring to.”"
2020-09-16T14:21:16Z,politics,Politics,Tameside hospital Covid deaths are 'canary in the mine',"A spate of deaths from Covid-19 in a hospital in Greater Manchester are “a canary in the mine” for the rest of the country if it continues to struggle to test and trace infections, one of the UK’s most senior public health chiefs has warned.
Jeanelle de Gruchy, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said the 18 Covid-19 deaths in a week at Tameside general hospital – up from six the week before – were an indicator of what will happen if community transmission continues to rise amid a crisis in testing capacity. No tests were available in the area on Wednesday morning through the government website, which has been overwhelmed with demand. “Where community rates are going up, people vulnerable to Covid are getting ill, are being hospitalised and unfortunately a number of them are dying from Covid,” De Gruchy said. “It’s a signal to us about the direction this is taking. There are going to be consequences for the vulnerable: admissions and deaths are going to go up.” She called for resources to be diverted to help local health officials trace the contacts of a rising number of infected residents – in particular school teachers and pupils – amid rising frustration among directors of public health at a lack of testing capacity, delays on requests for mobile testing units, poor quality or missing data from testing, and slow and low quality contact tracing. De Gruchy is also the director of public health for the Tameside area east of central Manchester where she said outbreaks were part of a “worrying picture”. She said there had been cases in about 20 schools. “We are seeing a real rise in community transmission not just in Tameside, but across Greater Manchester and the north-west,” she said. “It is happening quite rapidly. It is going up in areas where previously it was low, Wigan and Liverpool for instance.”
But she warned that public trust in the official response to keeping the pandemic in check was being eroded, partly by comments made by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, last week that testing shortages were a result of asymptomatic people seeking tests when they shouldn’t. The testing crisis has fostered a “disengaged and distrustful public”, she said. “It is eroding trust and councils are being put in a difficult position where they are having to front the failures of the system.” On Wednesday morning tests were not available across much of the north-west, including in Bolton, which currently has the highest infection rate in England. It was impossible to book a test in Preston, which has the third highest infection rate in the country, and in Oldham, which has the fourth; or in Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Warrington, Knowsley, Liverpool, Wirral, Bury and Salford, according to checks by the Press Association. Callan Glover, a mother in Leicester, was among those unable to book a test for her six-year-old son unless she went to Aberdeen, so she paid £125 for a private test with results expected in 48 hours. “He also has had five positive cases in his school over the last few days,” she said. “I can only assume there are many more cases but we can’t test our children.”
De Gruchy reiterated calls for local health experts to be given more resources to tackle the problems in their areas, saying that a key way to tackle school outbreaks is to have health officials working directly with headteachers on contact tracing, rather than through centralised call centres. “In June, we were told test and trace would not be fully operational until September but when schools and universities reopened, we would have a system ready,” she said. “But that is not the case.

2020-09-16T13:46:43Z,politics,Politics,'Alternative to Irish backstop' consultant in line for Â£200m contract,"A consultant who had a leading role in the campaign for an alternative to Theresa May’s Irish border “backstop” is in the running for all or part of a £200m government contract related to the post-Brexit checks down the Irish Sea. Shanker Singham, one of the main proponents of the so-called “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border, is understood to have teamed up with the customs expert Robert Hardy and the technology company Fujitsu for the Trader Support Service (TSS) contract. The contract, the first of the Brexit spoils in Northern Ireland, was put out to tender in the summer with the appointment announced in time for implementation in September. Deloitte and the Institute of Export are also believed to have been involved in bids. None of the parties would comment because they are in a legally binding “standstill” period under government procurement rules.
According to the government advertisement, “the service would provide a route for traders and carriers to comply with changes set out in the command paper on the movement of goods under the Northern Ireland Protocol from 1 January 2021.
The government confirmed in May there will be Brexit checks on animals and food goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK from next January, checks that it is committed to irrespective of the explosive row between the UK and the EU over checks on goods going the other direction from Northern Ireland into Britain. “The trader support service will be a free, at-the-point-of-use service available to all traders moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and importing goods into Northern Ireland from the rest of the world for at least two years,” the advertisement states. It is believed Deloitte had also bid for the work. Singham, a former Washington lobbyist, described by the Daily Telegraph as the “Brexiteers’ brain”, was one of the key experts involved in the non-government Alternative Arrangements Commission, which was headed by the Conservative MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands and had the backing of many Brexiters. It campaigned against the backstop for Ireland and in a hefty report last summer argued that technology and mobile control units operating miles away from the border would be an alternative to May’s backstop and such alternative arrangements could be up and running within three years. Singham also has good connections with the current government. He was appointed a member of the international trade secretary Liz Truss’s trade and agriculture commission in July, which, post-Brexit, will have a role in food standards, including controversial decisions over chlorinated chicken imports from the US. HMRC declined to comment on bidders but said: “The TSS will provide unprecedented support to all businesses engaging in new processes under the NI Protocol and its announcement has been warmly received by them. “We are running a transparent and open procurement process to identify a bidder capable of delivering this. We are engaging actively with stakeholders as part of this process.” While it is believed there is a legally required 10-day “standstill” period in which none of the bidders can comment on one organisation, speculation that the Institute of Export is involved in the winning consortium was fuelled as it is already advertising jobs. “The main function of this job is to provide specialist customs and trade knowledge to support delivery of the Trader Support Service. Knowledge requirements will cover the trader, carrier and intermediary communities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain,” said HMRC. Hardy set up the Customs Clearance Consortium to address the demand for customs advice to businesses trading with the EU post Brexit and both he and Singham have given expert evidence to House of Commons select committees."
2020-09-16T05:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Plans to record pregnant women's alcohol consumption in England criticised,"Pregnant women’s alcohol consumption could be recorded on their child’s medical records under plans for England being considered by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), prompting criticism from pregnancy rights advocates. The proposal from Nice has been drawn up as part of a consultation to cement guidelines for doctors to diagnose and prevent foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Proponents argue that the risk of FASD – a range of physical and mental conditions caused by drinking in pregnancy – to an unborn child means the mother’s right to privacy should be secondary. Pregnancy charities including the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BASP) and Birthrights suggested that the guideline on recording alcohol consumption could fall foul of data protection regulations.
“Women do not lose their right to medical confidentiality simply because they are pregnant,” said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at BASP, pointing to a survey of 725 women carried out by the charity that found 60% felt alcohol consumption data should not be shared without consent. “I think it’s a really quite shocking state of affairs, and we are very surprised that this is the path that Nice have gone down,” she said. “What we’ve ended up doing is creating this climate in pregnancy which leads to real heightened anxiety, stress, worry and huge maternal guilt, particularly if something goes wrong.” But Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of Adoption UK, said: “There is undoubtedly a balance to be struck here between the protection for the freedoms of the mother and the protection for the health of the unborn child. “But the situation that we’re in at the moment is that … governments and health systems are only at the beginning of being able to correctly identify and then manage the condition. So, we’re obviously in a situation where some things are going to need to change if we’re going to improve.” Alcohol abuse is a factor in seven out of 10 cases when children are put up for adoption.
The incidence of FASD in the UK is unknown. Symptoms include severe behavioural problems, poor impulse control and learning difficulties. While drinking more than 1-2 alcohol units a day has been strongly linked to lower birth weight and premature births, research on the effects on a baby of low levels of drinking in pregnancy can be difficult to interpret. A 2016 report by the UK chief medical officer found the risks are probably low, but the “precautionary” principle suggests it is safest to avoid drinking alcohol in pregnancy, it concluded. Nice says “there is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy”. A yet to be published study of 7,000 women, funded by the Wellcome Trust and conducted by BASP, found that women are aware of the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, Murphy said. “It’s a source of real frustration for me that … studies try to prove that somehow women are living in ignorance about this.” Brown said: “Unless the records are clear… the child is often prevented from seeking a diagnosis. So, there’s quite a lot at stake in getting this right. The research shows that if a child is diagnosed before the age of six, their likely later prevalence of mental health problems is halved.” Nice said: “The draft quality standard on FASD is based on guidance published in Scotland last year and in use elsewhere in the world, and takes into account the recommendations made by the chief medical officer … The feedback we receive from external organisations and members of the public during this consultation period will help us better understand what works, and what doesn’t, for practice in England.”"
2020-09-15T18:27:53Z,politics,Politics,'Rule of six': Priti Patel's neighbours unimpressed by her shopping lawbreakers,"It’s the question millions of Britons are having to ask themselves. And for Priti Patel, there was only one answer. If she saw her neighbours breaking “the rule of six”, would she dob them in it? Yes, said the home secretary. “Quite frankly, I would call the police.” Which came as something of a disappointment to some of those living near her house in London, who felt that snitching on the neighbours wasn’t very – well – neighbourly.
Besides, said one, the government had bigger fish to fry to stop the spread of the virus. “I wouldn’t do it because I have a good relationship with my neighbours, why should I call the police on them?” asked one neighbour, called Faisal. “The next day, that guy will be coming to my door asking me what I was doing and calling the police on me … There would be conflict if someone did, it’s not a good idea, to be honest.” Another neighbour, called Michael, said he would report gatherings “if it got too bad, but I would live and let live in the first place”. He thought the government had “made a pig’s ear of the whole job” and suggested the ministers might have “more important things to worry about than dobbing in your neighbour”. The government has been on the back foot about the law introduced on Monday that bans more than six people meeting in one place – with many commentators deriding the “Covid marshals” who are supposed to break up large gatherings, and report any wrongdoing. Ministers have warned that those found in groups of seven or more face on-the-spot fines of £100, which will double on repeat offences up to £3,200. The home secretary stirred the debate some more on Tuesday when she told broadcasters she would have little compunction in calling in the authorities if she caught anyone flouting the rules. Asked if she would call them out, Patel told Sky News: “I’m rarely at home but if I saw something that I thought was inappropriate then, quite frankly, I would call the police.” Another of her neighbours, who did not want to be named, was complimentary about Patel on a personal level. But telling tales on a neighbour? “It’s just not in my nature.”"
2020-09-15T17:27:32Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 3,105 new cases amid rise in hospital admissions and patients on ventilators - as it happened","Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been accused of “losing control” of attempts to stem the rising tide of Covid-19, as Downing Street comes under fresh fire over its handling of the country’s testing system. Boris Johnson has privately sought to calm angry MPs who plan to back an amendment to dilute his bill that unpicks the EU withdrawal agreement. Laboratories that analyse swabs from people in the community, including care homes, were stretched to capacity even in late August, unable to process all the Covid test samples coming in and seeking help from the NHS, the Guardian can reveal. More than one in nine state school pupils were absent last week as schools across England reopened, according to Department for Education figures. Two families of four stopping for a chat in the street would contravene England’s “rule of six” coronavirus restrictions and constitute mingling, the home secretary has said. Tens of thousands of people may require kidney dialysis or transplants because of coronavirus, according to experts who warn the long-term effects of Covid are causing an “epidemic in primary care”. Noel Gallagher has said he refuses to wear a mask during the coronavirus pandemic, complaining that it is a violation of his liberty. That’s all from me for today.

2020-09-15T17:03:16Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Johnson seeks to calm MPs before next showdown over bill,"Boris Johnson has privately sought to calm angry MPs who plan to back an amendment to dilute his bill that unpicks the EU withdrawal agreement. His intervention raises expectations that the government will do a deal with backbenchers at a parliamentary showdown next week. More Conservative MPs have said they could join a rebellion against the government to block a breach of international law, unless an agreement is reached. However, the Guardian understands Johnson has spoken to a number of key MPs behind an amendment that would put a “parliamentary lock” on using the controversial powers in the internal market bill and given reassurances that a deal can be done over the clauses that override parts of the withdrawal agreement. The PM is said to have privately conceded to MPs who spoke to him on Monday night that the admission by Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the bill broke international law had been the wrong tactic. A source close to Lewis said his statement that the powers in the bill breached international law had not been an error – but was an agreed “direct answer” which had been signed off by Number 10 and government lawyers. A change in tone was also seen in the House of Lords, where the advocate-general Lord Keen said it was his view that the powers were lawful. However friends of Lewis pointed out that Keen was among those who agreed with the government’s legal statement last week, which said the opposite. Several MPs said they now expected the government to give assurances when the amendment from Conservative MP Bob Neill comes back to the House of Commons would persuade them to back the government. It is thought those concessions could come at the debate or after the bill comes back from the Lords if peers amend the legislation. “I think the government is eventually going to get its way on this,” one senior rebel MP said. “There will be a deal.” Although the UK internal market bill passed with a comfortable 77 majority at its second reading, the focus in Westminster is next week’s vote on the Neill amendment. At present, controversial measures in the bill would hand unilateral powers to ministers in key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January. Neill’s amendment would ensure the powers in the bill that breached the Northern Ireland protocol would not be used until there was another specific vote in parliament to use them, as a last resort. Should no deal be reached with the government, supporters of Neill’s amendment believe there may be a number of MPs who, having voted with the government on Monday as a way of demonstrating support for its purpose but uncomfortable breaking international law, could be persuaded to back the amendment. Andrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary, told the house he was content to let the bill pass to second reading but would not then vote to pass a bill into law that would break an international treaty. “I do not believe I have ever gone into a lobby to vote in a way that I knew was wrong, and I will not be doing it on this occasion either,” he said. One MP said they agreed with “95% of the bill” and wanted to see it pass to second reading. “But I am uncomfortable with the three clauses and I will see what happens this week.” A number of MPs who abstained still believe Neill’s amendment does not go far enough. “These are pernicious clauses and I’d rather see them out of the bill altogether,” said one prominent rebel. “I may be prepared to go further if there was a viable option to do so.” The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, whom one source said was “wobbly” over parts of the bill, is due to address restive MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers on Wednesday evening. The list of Conservative MPs who deliberately abstained on the internal market bill is now known to be at least 20, including two former Northern Ireland secretaries – Karen Bradley and Julian Smith. Other senior Conservatives who abstained include two former attorney generals, Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright, the former chancellor Sajid Javid, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, Charles Walker, and a number of other select committee chairs, including Simon Hoare and Tobias Ellwood.
No 10 would only say publicly on Tuesday that MPs would get a standard vote on invoking the powers contained within the bill as a statutory instrument (SI). That vote would take place only after ministers had taken the decision to use those powers, and would not prevent a potential breach of international law. Neill has said such an assurance was not enough and a standard SI vote would not provide enough opportunity for scrutiny.
The bill is also likely to face a difficult passage in the Lords, where even veteran Brexiters, such as Norman Lamont, have spoken against its implications. However, a No 10 spokesman said the Salisbury convention, a non-statutory but widely respected rule saying the House of Lords would not vote down policies in a governing party’s election manifesto, applied to the internal market bill. “Guaranteeing the full economic benefit of leaving the EU to all parts of the United Kingdom and ensuring Northern Ireland’s businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the UK were clear Conservative manifesto commitments which this legislation delivers,” the spokesman said. Some peers are likely to contest this interpretation, because the Conservative manifesto also said the party would implement the Brexit deal. “The Lords is going to be a totally different game,” one MP backing the rebels said. “I think Boris and Dominic Cummings are going to be shocked at the visceral anger at some of the constitutional lawyers up there.” On Tuesday, William Hague became the latest senior Conservative and fourth former Tory leader to criticise the bill, joining Theresa May, David Cameron and Michael Howard. Hague, a former foreign secretary, said passing a law that would deliberately abrogate an international treaty would be a “serious foreign policy error” that would “have a lasting and damaging effect on our international reputation and standing, diminishing our ability to exert our influence and protect our interests”. Labour sources in the House of Lords said opposition among peers was likely to focus on amending individual clauses of the bill, rather than throwing it out. They questioned whether the Salisbury-Addison convention, which implies the Lords shouldn’t prevent a government from implementing its manifesto, was relevant, pointing out that the Tory manifesto said the government would: “get Brexit done”. Any clash in the Lords is unlikely to be imminent, since peers rarely amend bills until their report stage, which for this legislation is not expected until mid- to late November – by which time it should be clearer whether a no-deal exit is a possibility."
2020-09-15T16:24:02Z,politics,Politics,MPs try to talk Matt Hancock down from the heights of delusion | John Crace,"This time it was personal. The Speaker is meant to be impartial, but just hours before Matt Hancock was due to answer an urgent question on the government’s handling of the coronavirus testing systems that he had granted, Lindsay Hoyle tweeted that many of his constituents in Chorley were experiencing severe problems getting a test. As a warning shot across the health secretary’s bow, it could hardly have been more explicit. This time Hancock was expected to come to the Commons with some real answers. But like almost all the cabinet these days, Hancock has become a law unto himself. He is a man so near the edge he is genuinely incapable of taking responsibility for anything that happens on his watch, because to do so would inevitably lead to a complete breakdown. So reports that tests were unavailable in 10 of the areas most badly affected by coronavirus were at best exaggerations and at worst complete fiction. A leaked email that private laboratories couldn’t handle capacity even when things were relatively quiet during August was just scaremongering.
Instead Hancock continued to insist the UK’s testing system was the envy of the world, people were actually travelling shorter distances to get tests than the previous week – presumably because more individuals had sensibly decided that a 700 mile round trip to Aberdeen wasn’t worth the effort – and that he had always prioritised those in acute clinical care and social care. Which will have come as news to those who were kicked out of hospitals and into care homes with no tests. And to those care homes still struggling to get tests. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, calmly and patiently tried to introduce Hancock to the reality of the situation. It wasn’t just troublemaking Labour MPs whose constituents weren’t getting access to tests, it was also Tory MPs who were trying to deal with the fallout of the government’s lack of planning. Just wait to hear what his own backbenchers had to say. What made it all the more tragic was its sheer inevitability. Matt had known that there would be extra demand in the autumn but had done nothing over the summer to prepare for it. It was as if we were living in La-La Land. The government would introduce a target – tests, phone apps and Typhoid Dido’s track and trace – which would invariably get missed. Culminating in the absurd £100bn “Operation Moonshot” that would test 10 million people a day. But instead of apologising and trying to sort out the mess, Door Matt would allow Boris Johnson to just come out with an even bigger and less feasible target. This had been going on for months now, said Ashworth, and it was time to stop. The government’s new definition of “world beating” was sending off our tests to be analysed in German laboratories because all the UK postgrads who had been doing them had gone back to university. Still Matt refused to accept the evidence of MPs from every area of the country. Record numbers of people were getting tests and those who were missing out were just very unlucky. It was also the fault of all those people who were going along and getting tests that came back negative. If they hadn’t wasted so much NHS time and resources on their imaginary symptoms, it would have meant that those who really needed the tests could have got them. In Door Matt world, the only good coronavirus test is a positive test. Hancock ended with a familiar Boris trope. Rather than complaining when the government got things wrong, Labour should be congratulating it for not having killed even more people. That, though was just the start of Matt’s problems. The health select committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, observed that Hancock had promised him a week ago that the testing problems would be resolved in a fortnight. So was he on schedule to meet that promise in seven days’ time. An internal circuit in the increasingly simple software of Hancock’s brain crashed and the health secretary found himself unwittingly telling the truth. “It could be a matter of weeks,” Matt said sadly. Any number of weeks as a week was just a human construct. Or months possibly, as Hancock went on to describe him as one of the world’s natural optimists. I guess he needs to be. The trouble is that the country needs a minister who knows what he’s doing. The rest of the session consisted mainly of MPs from both sides of the house trying to talk Matt down from his deluded state. But all that Hancock could offer when told of the many constituents who hadn’t been able to get tests was to refer to the 23 lucky ones who had. The Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson observed that the only way residents in Twickenham were able to get tests in the area was if they were to enter an Aberdeen postcode. Would it help if everyone was to enter a postcode hundreds of miles from where they lived to get a test on their doorstep? “No,” said Matt testily. The drive would do them good. If they got back alive their symptoms couldn’t have been that bad. Inevitably, some Tory MPs were keen to seek clarification on the rule of six. Was it possible to introduce some exceptions? It wasn’t. If Boris wasn’t allowed to see all his children at the same time – other than at a grouse shoot – then the same rule had to apply to everyone. This was a first. Normally most rules don’t seem to apply to the prime minister. It was time to get serious and Door Matt was with Priti Patel. The law was the law and it was a citizen’s duty to dob in anyone found breaking it. In which case there are going to be a a large number of Tory MPs in court for breaking international law next week."
2020-09-15T15:07:42Z,politics,Politics,"Alex Salmond known for 'bullying' behaviour, says Scotland's ex-chief civil servant","Alex Salmond was known for “bullying and intimidatory behaviour” and angry outbursts against civil servants who worked for him, Scotland’s former chief civil servant has told MSPs. Sir Peter Housden, who worked as permanent secretary for the Scottish government when Salmond was first minister, told a Holyrood inquiry the day-to-day running of Salmond’s private office in Edinburgh was “punctuated by this kind of behaviour”. Giving evidence on oath, Housden said there were no “egregious” incidents involving Salmond which needed formal investigation, nor were there formal complaints against the former first minister or any suggestions of sexual misconduct. Housden acknowledged he did not directly witness any incidents of bullying and harassment, but he told the committee: “I knew that the former first minister could display bullying and intimidatory behaviour, yes.” He added later: “I was well aware that those behaviours took place; I had a number of conversations with people who had been on the receiving end of that.” The committee is investigating the Scottish government’s mishandling of an internal investigation in 2018 into allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond, and also Nicola Sturgeon’s actions before, during and after that investigation. The inquiry found Salmond had a case to answer in August 2018 and its report triggered a police investigation into complaints of alleged sexual misconduct against the former first minister – complaints Salmond has consistently denied. In January 2019 Salmond won a judicial review against the Scottish government after it admitted a key part of its inquiry was mishandled; he was later given £512,000 to cover his legal costs. In March 2020, Salmond was acquitted of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, after a two-week trial at the high court in Edinburgh.
Tensions rose several times during Tuesday’s hearing after Housden refused to confirm whether he warned Sturgeon about the alleged bullying incidents involving Salmond. Housden took over as the Scottish government’s permanent secretary in late 2010, just as the government’s new anti-bullying procedure, part of a new “fairness at work” policy which included ministers, came into force. That policy would have required Sturgeon to be told of any complaints about Salmond’s conduct. He said he was required by civil service rules to protect the confidentiality of ministers but agreed that under normal circumstances it would be appropriate to notify Sturgeon. He conceded he did raise those issues with a senior minister. “It would be appropriate in all the settings I’ve worked to speak to a senior member of the administration concerned, yes, but I’m not confirming thereby who I spoke to on these matters in Scotland,” he said. Alex Cole-Hamilton, a Liberal Democrat MSP, accused Housden of “hiding behind this defence of confidentiality” but was blocked by Linda Fabiani, the committee’s Scottish National party convenor, from pressing Housden to confirm Sturgeon had been told. “We are not putting Mr Salmond on trial at this committee so can we be less specific about people,” Fabiani said. Housden said he knew of concerns about only a handful of Scottish ministers but said he had never heard of any allegations or rumours of sexual misconduct against any of them, including Salmond. Civil servants were proud of working for the first minister and “energised” by their job, Housden added. It was, however, extremely demanding and he made sure any concerns about ministers’ conduct were raised with the minister concerned. Implying he had spoken to Salmond too, Housden said: “I would ensure that the minister concerned knew that I knew.” He said the civil service had a legal duty of care to its staff. “I think the civil service is entitled to expect ministers are able to control their behaviour and where that had gone beyond reasonable bounds but had not triggered a complaint, it didn’t seem to me unreasonable that that should be a fact that was known about.”"
2020-09-15T13:31:53Z,politics,Politics,"Matt Hancock is losing control of Covid-19 in UK, says Labour","The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been accused of “losing control” of attempts to stem the rising tide of Covid-19, as Downing Street comes under fresh fire over its handling of the country’s testing system. In a bruising Commons encounter, Hancock said there had been a “sharp rise” in demand and explained that testing for patients with acute medical needs and people in care homes would be prioritised. The health secretary said there were “operational challenges” in the testing system and admitted problems could take “weeks” to resolve. Hancock was also forced to warn against attempts to “game the system” after an MP highlighted that people in south west London had succeeded in obtaining tests there after being advised to input an Aberdeen postcode when booking.
It comes after it emerged that people in England’s 10 worst-hit coronavirus hotspots were unable to get tests on Monday, prompting claims that the system was a “shambles”. Health leaders have also warned that a lack of testing is contributing to staff absences across the NHS, putting services at risk. “We have seen a sharp rise in people coming forward for a test, including those who are not eligible,” Hancock said on Tuesday, responding in the Commons to an urgent question tabled by Labour. “Throughout this pandemic, we have prioritised testing according to need. Over the summer, when demand was low, we were able to meet all requirements for testing, whether priorities or not. “But as demand has risen, so we are having to prioritise once again and I do not shirk from decisions about prioritisation. They are not always comfortable, but they are important.” The “top priority” for tests is acute clinical care, Hancock said, followed by social care. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, highlighted that at the weekend in Bolton, where infections are highest, a mobile testing centre failed to turn up. Hundreds queued for five hours for a test in Bury, he said. He added that a father with a sick child in Walsall travelled 76 miles to an appointment in Wales to find on arrival that tests had run out. He said: “ The prime minister promised us whack-a-mole but instead his mallet is broken. The secretary of state is losing control of this virus. He needs to fix testing now.” Responding, Hancock highlighted that capacity for testing was at a record high and said that the government had processed 9,278 pillar 2 tests (tests carried out in the community) in the top 10 worst-hit areas on Monday. On Monday, in areas with the highest infection rates, people trying to arrange a test were told none were available at walk- in centres, drive-through facilities or for home delivery. According to one official, there was capacity at test centres, but a backlog in laboratories meant people were being told no tests were available. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt pressed Hancock on his claim to the health and social care committee last week that he expected to have testing problems resolved in two weeks. “Well, I think that we will be able to solve this problem in a matter of weeks,” Hancock said, adding: “In his [Hunt’s] own constituency yesterday 194 people got their tests so we are managing to deliver record capacity but, as he well knows, demand is also high and the response to that is to make sure we have prioritisation so the people who most need it can get the test that they need.” In a sign of confusion, the Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson said that some people struggling to access tests had been advised that if they put an Aberdeen postcode into the booking system they could get one in her Twickenham constituency – and succeeded in doing so. Asked if she should tell constituents to “game the system”, Hancock replied: “No … in fact it’s incumbent on all of us to take a responsible approach and tell our constituents that tests are available in large numbers, that the average distance travelled is 5.8 miles and that people should take this seriously and not game the system.” Boris Johnson’s spokesman gave a robust defence of the system on Tuesday, denying that tests were impossible to obtain in virus hotspots. “It’s wrong to say that testing is not available in these areas. Our capacity continues to be targeted to where it is most needed,” the spokesman said. He said the cabinet had discussed the testing system; and appeared to suggest there would be little imminent improvement, highlighting a new testing system being built in Leicestershire, which would increase capacity by 50,000, in the “coming weeks”. “Testing was discussed, and we have been clear that we are committed to increasing capacity,” he said. Asked whether the testing system was, “world-beating”, as the prime minister promised, his spokesman said: “It is one of the world’s largest testing programmes, built from scratch,” adding, “we’re continuing to process more than a million tests a week.” “We’ve been clear that we will target capacity to where it’s needed most, which is why booking slots are regularly made available, and home testing kits are regularly made available.” Asked about the government’s claims that up to 25% of people receiving tests are not entitled to them, he said “the criteria for getting a test has always been clear, and that remains the case”. It emerged at the weekend that the government’s coronavirus testing programme was trying to clear a backlog of 185,000 swabs, with some being sent to Germany and Italy to be processed."
2020-09-15T13:05:26Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab to face hard questions about Irish border on US visit,"The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is travelling to Washington for talks with senior US officials and senior Democrats, where he is expected to be pressed by pro-Irish legislators to explain whether the UK is intending to break international law and undermine the Good Friday agreement. The Irish ambassador to the US, Daniel Mulhall, has been lobbying in Washington, warning that the UK’s latest row with the EU may yet lead to the re-emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland. With the US presidential elections less than 50 days away, and the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, still the favourite to win, according to polls, Raab will be eager to reassure members of the Senate and the House of Representatives about the UK’s plans to revise the EU withdrawal agreement. The pro-Irish lobby in Washington rivals that of the UK, and the Democrats, who tend to be Brexit sceptics, want to see the dispute settled without threats, real or imagined, to peace in Northern Ireland. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned last week that there would be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade deal passing Congress if Britain violated its international agreements and Brexit undermined the Belfast accords. Any such trade deal needs two-thirds support of the Senate, and so requires substantial support from Democratic senators. A key target of UK lobbying is also likely to be Richard Neal, the chairman of the ways and means committee, which oversees trade agreements. In a statement last week he pointed out that the US was a guarantor of the Good Friday agreement. “I urge both sides to uphold the terms of this joint agreement, particularly with respect to the treatment of Northern Ireland, in accordance with international law,” Neal said. “The UK’s departure from the EU at the end of this year and any US-UK trade agreement must preserve the Good Friday agreement, which has maintained peace and prosperity for British and European peoples since 1998. “I sincerely hope the British government upholds the rule of law and delivers on the commitments it made during Brexit negotiations, particularly in regard to the Irish border protocols.” Tony Blinken, a senior foreign policy adviser to Biden, warned on twitter: “Joe Biden is committed to preserving the hard-earned peace & stability in Northern Ireland. “As the UK and EU work out their relationship, any arrangements must protect the Good Friday agreement and prevent the return of a hard border.” Biden has Irish roots and will look askance at anything that brings the threat of a hard border closer. A set-piece speech at the Atlantic Council thinktank on Thursday may be Raab’s single biggest public chance to explain UK government thinking on Ireland, as well as Iran. The UK is at loggerheads with the Trump administration on the US claim that it has the right to impose UN snapback sanctions on Iran. The UK also questions the practical impact if the US unilaterally declares it has the right to order UN member states to reimpose the sanctions lifted in 2015. The US already has punitive secondary sanctions against Iran. Like the US, the UK would like the UN embargo on conventional arms sales to Iran to be extended, but cannot see a way in which the Russia and China would not use their security council veto to block such a move. Raab on his trip will also be seeking an update on the civil lawsuit being filed by the parents of Harry Dunn in Virginia against Ann Sacoolas, who was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash last year in Northamptonshire that resulted in the 19-year-old’s death. The US has refused a UK government request for the extradition of Sacoolas, the wife of a CIA operative. The UK is not expecting the US administration to change its position on extradition, but is sympathetic to the case."
2020-09-15T13:00:44Z,politics,Politics,MPs passed the Brexit bill  – but what happens now?,"The internal market bill, described by the government as a key element of Brexit legislation, has cleared its first Commons hurdle, with two Tory MPs voting against it and nearly 30 more abstaining. But why is the bill so significant? What does the bill do? It is yet another piece of legislation intended to fill the vacuum created by the end of EU laws and standards, in this case connected to trade between different nations in the UK. With the end of unified Brussels standards, the bill sets out rules on areas such as mutual recognition to keep trade seamless. However, the bill also includes a power for the government to amend parts of the withdrawal agreement, signed by Boris Johnson and the EU in January, notably over elements connected to preventing a post-Brexit hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Separately, some Scottish and Welsh MPs are angry at what they say is a power grab for Westminster within the bill, bringing power away from devolved governments. Why is this controversial? The withdrawal agreement is a binding treaty, which contains arbitration mechanisms in the event of disputes. For one side to unilaterally change it would be – as the government has conceded – a breach of international law. This is seen as hugely significant given the centrality of the rule of law to global affairs, not least in the UK’s concerns about the actions of other countries, for example China’s changes to laws inside Hong Kong. Why has the government said it needs to act? The reasons given have been varied, including that the withdrawal agreement was rushed and contained unexpected complexities, and that the new law is needed purely to sort some unintended complexities that might arise. But the main reason cited is the idea that if the UK left the transition period in December with no permanent trade deal in place, Northern Ireland could face a significant customs border on goods from the rest of the UK, or even a blockade in effect, owing to EU rules under the withdrawal agreement. Is this true? Not really. It is a complex area, and one where there is certainly an argument that the EU has been somewhat bellicose at times. But there are two key points. One is that the complex issue of a customs border in the Irish Sea was explicit within Johnson’s deal with the EU, and had been an option Theresa May always ruled out. The other is that the internal market bill contains no measures that would actually address this issue, as Ed Miliband pointed out to Johnson in the Commons on Monday. So what happens now? On the EU front, talks continue as before, though amid some bad feeling, and with the next formal discussions not due before next week. In parliament, Johnson faces a battle over an amendment to the internal market bill tabled by backbencher Bob Neill and signed by another dozen Tory MPs. On Monday, the bill passed the second reading – the first chance MPs get to vote on a prospective law – and Neill’s amendment will likely be among those considered and voted on next Tuesday. What does Neill’s amendment do? It would mean the government could only unilaterally tinker with the withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol if it first set this out in a Commons motion that was then passed by MPs. There is an argument that this doesn’t especially assuage the worries about a loss of trust caused by ministers breaching international law, given the amendment doesn’t prevent this, but only seeks parliamentary approval. But it would certainly be something of a brake on government actions. Will the amendment pass? That’s unclear at this stage. While the second reading was won easily by the government, a number of Tory MPs who backed the bill in principle could decide to support Neill’s amendment. The list of Conservatives who abstained is reasonably broad, including two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Julian Smith and Karen Bradley, so support could spread. Another factor is whether Downing Street offers some concession to Neill. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Johnson hinted at this, although No 10 subsequently indicated this will not happen. Is the Commons the only obstacle? No. Even if it arrives unamended, the bill is likely to get a bruising time in the Lords, with stated opponents of its powers on the withdrawal agreement including Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader and long-time Brexiter. Under convention, the Lords is not expected to hold up or significantly amend legislation delivering on a government’s manifesto promise, and ministers will undoubtedly argue that arrangements for Brexit fall into category. In response, expect peers to note that the manifesto mentioned nothing about breaking international law. • This article was amended on 16 September 2020. Ministers, not minsters, will argue that arrangements for Brexit fall into the government’s manifesto promise."
2020-09-15T10:06:48Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: barristers question selection of legal team leading UK drive to override deal,"The government is facing increasing scrutiny over its decision to use “committed Brexiteer” lawyers to provide advice on the legality of breaching the EU withdrawal agreement. On Saturday, the attorney general, Suella Braverman QC, who chaired the annual general meeting of the Bar Council that represents barristers in England and Wales, faced repeated criticism over her role as the government’s chief legal adviser, according to those present. Jessica Simor QC, the vice-chair of the council’s EU law committee, asked Braverman why “in the light of the extremely serious matters at issue, such advice [was not] sought from Treasury counsel, Sir James Eadie QC?” Instead, she said, an opinion was sought from Guglielmo Verdirame QC, a professor of law at King’s College London, Richard Ekins, a professor of law and constitutional government at Oxford University, and Richard Howell, a barrister at Brick Court chambers in London. The involvement of Verdirame, Ekins and Howell in advising the government was first revealed by the Guardian. Simor said: “Howell is a one-year qualified barrister … who was also brought into the team for the prime minister in the prorogation case despite at the time being a pupil barrister. He was active in Vote Leave and was praised by Dominic Cummings in his blogs for his contribution to Vote Leave winning. “The two professors are committed Brexiteers. Prof Ekins wrote a paper for [the thinktank] Policy Exchange, advocating breaching the withdrawal agreement. Verdirame is also a member of various high-level Brexit groups. He apparently has connections with Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings.” None of the three, Simor said, were on the attorney general’s panel, which is a list of approved lawyers who normally carry out work for the government. Braverman was also asked who had instructed the three lawyers. Verdirame was a member of the attorney general’s panel before becoming a QC. In 2015, he and Ekins co-authored a paper for the UK Constitutional Law Association advocating precisely the approach now adopted by the government. It said: “It would be wrong for ministers to be required to treat international legal obligations, including unincorporated treaties, as of equal standing to acts of parliament or common law duties.” The government, therefore, knew their opinions before instructing them. According to a report of the Bar Council meeting, tweeted by Alison Padfield QC, who was attending, the attorney general said it was the convention that law officers could not comment on the “content of advice” and therefore she could not say very much. She added that Braverman said it was “not uncommon for law officers to seek specialist advice” and that she took her duties very seriously, put the rule of law first and politics second while always relying on legal authorities rather than opinions The Guardian has not seen the advice she was given by the three lawyers and does not know its content. In her separate advice to the Cabinet Office, revealed by the Guardian last week, Braverman argued that parliamentary sovereignty could, if necessary, override the UK’s international treaty obligations. Another critic of Braveman, Philippe Sands QC, a professor of international law at University College London, told the Guardian: “What a sensible attorney general would do is get advice from someone who is genuinely at arms length to avoid criticism that they went to fellow travellers.” There is no suggestion the lawyers were influenced by ministers when giving their advice. Critics argue it would have been better for the government to seek advice from lawyers without views on the Brexit debate. The Guardian asked the attorney general’s office why Ekins, Verdirame and Howell were instructed by the government to give an external legal opinion. It declined to comment. The three lawyers did not respond to requests for comment."

2020-09-15T04:55:16Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit bill hugely damaging to UK's reputation, says ex-ambassador","Britain’s former ambassador to Washington has described the internal market bill as “hugely damaging to our international reputation”, warning that it could deter other countries from entering into agreements with the UK in the future. Kim Darroch told the Guardian that if it becomes law, in violation of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year, it would endanger the country’s prospects of achieving trade deals with the EU and the US, and have an enduring impact on its global standing. “It is the most astonishing thing I can recall through my entire public service career: a minister said we are knowingly breaking international law,” said Darroch in an interview. Over the course of a 43-year career at the foreign office, he served as envoy to the EU in Brussels and national security adviser, before becoming ambassador to the US. “It’s potentially hugely damaging to our international reputation. It puts at risk future international agreements, if people think the Brits are just going to say: we didn’t like this on reflection, and we would like to rewrite this part unilaterally,” the retired diplomat, now Lord Darroch of Kew, said. The bill survived its latest parliamentary hurdle on Monday night, passing its second reading in the House of Commons by a margin of 77 votes. Governing the flow of goods and services between the UK’s four constituent nations, the bill stipulates it takes precedence where it contradicts elements of the withdrawal agreement, and the British government has admitted that would break international law. Darroch said the impact could be first felt in negotiations with the EU to establish new trade relations after Brexit. “I’ve talked to a few people in Brussels, and they are determined not to just walk away from the table because of this. It’s equally inconceivable you would get the UK-EU deal through if this passes into law,” he said. The effect of the bill on Northern Ireland would have other ramifications, particularly if it led to customs checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland, something the withdrawal agreement was designed to prevent. The return of a hard border would jeopardise the 1998 Good Friday agreement, to which the US is guarantor. “The UK-US deal is at risk because, even if Donald Trump is reelected, it’s quite hard to see the Republicans taking back the House [of Representatives],” Darroch said. “And as long as the House is in Democratic hands, the leadership have made it clear that a UK-US free trade deal wouldn’t be possible if we put at risk the Good Friday agreement.” Darroch was forced to resign as ambassador to Washington in July last year after his reports back to London on the turmoil and dysfunction in the Trump administration were leaked. Donald Trump declared his officials would no longer deal with the UK ambassador, and Boris Johnson, who was at the time running to replace Theresa May as prime minister, failed to offer Darroch a clear statement of support. The former diplomat gives an account of his turbulent time in Washington in a memoir, Collateral Damage, published in the UK on Tuesday. Darroch speculated the internal market bill could be a negotiating ploy to force concessions from Brussels. If so, he said, it was not a very good one. “If we were to back down or find a way through with the EU, that would limit the damage, but the fact that we contemplated it is still damaging,” he said. “The downsides, with the EU free trade deal, the US free trade deal and our international reputation are so big, I can’t quite believe they will carry through on it.”"
2020-09-15T01:05:49Z,politics,Politics,Rebel alliance: the Tory politicians opposing new Brexit bill,"Boris Johnson might have taken over from Theresa May with a pledge to be a very different kind of prime minister, but there is one part of her legacy he has been unable to shake off – threats of rebellion from Tory MPs over Brexit. Next week, Johnson faces a potentially tricky vote on an amendment to the government’s internal market bill, which paves the way for ministers to breach international law by unilaterally unravelling sections of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. On Monday night, 30 Conservatives abstained on the vote in the Commons on the bill, and two – Sir Roger Gale and Andrew Percy – voted against. The bill eventually passed with a majority of 77 but the vote fails to end the tension within the party on the issue. In another parallel with May, Johnson faces objections from two separate groups among his MPs. Here are some of the malcontents. Bob Neill While a knighted Tory parliamentarian of 14 years standing – he is officially Sir Robert Neill – might seem an unlikely rebel, the Bromley and Chislehurst MP is a former Brexit sceptic and was among 14 Conservatives famously pictured on the Daily Telegraph front page in November 2017 as a “Brexit mutineer”. Neill, a barrister who chairs the justice select committee, has been an outspoken critic of the government’s plan to potentially break international law and is the lead signatory of an amendment to the internal market bill, the legislative vehicle for the No 10 plan, which would seek to curtail it. He abstained on Monday.
Geoffrey Cox Not officially a rebel, in that he has been careful to only say so far that he cannot support the internal market bill as it stands – keeping open the possibility of abstention or a change of heart if the measure is tweaked – the theatrically voiced former attorney general is nonetheless an unwelcome addition to the list of dissenters for Johnson. The Torridge and West Devon MP, a leading criminal and civil barrister, was attorney general under Johnson amid the key stages of Brexit, and also advised him that proroguing parliament last year was legal – which the supreme court disagreed with. His decision to speak out will confirm some suspicions that Cox was replaced as attorney general by Suella Braverman, a more junior lawyer, as she is seen as more malleable by No 10. He abstained on Monday.
Tobias Ellwood A former defence minister, who lost his government role when Johnson took over as PM, Ellwood now chairs the Commons defence committee and is a powerful backbench voice. He is also clear on Johnson’s proposal to break international law, calling it the “Nixonian Madman Theory” of negotiation. The Bournemouth East MP is relatively low-profile as a politician but received public acclaim in 2017 when he tried to resuscitate Keith Palmer, the police constable fatally stabbed by a lone terrorist who attacked the Houses of Parliament. He abstained on Monday.
Tom Tugendhat Another leading backbencher who chairs a key committee, the Tonbridge and Malling MP heads the Commons foreign affair committee, where he has been an outspoken voice on areas including Hong Kong. This role has also given his views more heft on the potential reputational damage of the government’s plans, with Tugendhat saying the economy in based, ultimately, “on the perception that people have of the UK’s adherence to the rule of law”. In the end, he did vote with the government on Monday night.
Theresa May The former PM is generally so loyal that she stayed silent when Johnson claimed a victory in signing a Brexit deal based on a concession – customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – that May had always rejected. But even May has her limits. In June she broke cover to ask why David Frost was being made Johnson’s new national security adviser despite his lack of relevant experience. Then, last week, she used a Commons debate to argue that breaking international law could damage trust in the UK. May abstained on the vote on Monday night, it emerged that she was in South Korea on a planned invitation for the World Knowledge Forum but she has made clear she was unhappy at the bill’s implications. Sajid Javid The former chancellor has become something of a thorn in the prime minister’s side after dramatically quitting the cabinet earlier this year after objecting to restrictions which Downing Street wanted to place on his advisers. He became the most high-profile former Johnson cabinet minister to criticise the internal market bill on Monday, saying he had studied the legislation and did not see why it was “necessary” to break international law. He abstained on Monday night.
Michael Howard Discontented peers are not uncommon but the former Tory leader’s intervention in a Lords debate last week was striking, given that he is a long-standing advocate and an unofficial high priest of Brexit opinion in the party. Howard was also notably blunt, asking: “How can we reproach Russia, China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards, when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?”
Steve Baker On the other side of the ideological divide, less vocal so far but permanently watchful, are the Brexit ultras, represented by the European Research Group, formerly chaired by the energetic Baker. Baker, who has said Johnson promised him he would not sign up to a withdrawal agreement on the terms he did, argues that the UK should now reserve the right to repudiate the entire treaty if the EU continues to negotiate in bad faith. Although he sided with the government on Monday night, Baker and his allies would thus be furious if Johnson were seen to concede ground to Brussels. • This article was amended on 18 September 2020 to establish that Steve Baker thinks the UK should reserve the right to repudiate the withdrawal agreement, not that the PM should immediately do so; and to clarify the promises he said Boris Johnson had made to him. The reference to the European Reform Group was also corrected to the European Research Group."
2020-09-14T23:37:33Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: 'Much to play for' says Sir Roger Gale after voting against bill — as it happened,"A comfortable win, as expected, for the government as MPs voted by a majority of 77 to approve the internal market bill at its second reading, despite concerns it would give the government the power to override key elements of its own withdrawal agreement with the EU - notably on the Northern Ireland Protocol - and breach international law. Despite 30 Conservative abstentions (which could be for a number of reasons, e.g. some might be away), including from senior Tories, only two actually voted against the government at this stage - Sir Roger Gale and Andrew Percy. As it was widely expected the government would win this vote and the potential Tory rebellion would not mount to what some touted, attention turns to Bob Neillâ€™s amendment which, if disillusionment among backbench Conservative MPs continues to fester, will be the real showdown for No 10 and its own party. That amendment would require a vote of parliament before ministers can exercise the new powers in the bill. The bill now moves to its committee stage and MPs are due to begin detailed line-by-line scrutiny of the bill tomorrow, with votes expected next week on amendments to the Northern Ireland provisions which some Tories may back.
And thatâ€™s it for tonight. Thank you for reading along!"
2020-09-14T22:13:25Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: internal market bill passes by 77 votes amid Tory party tension,"Conservative MPs fired a warning shot at Boris Johnson’s conduct of the Brexit process on Monday night, as former cabinet ministers and attorney generals withheld support for a controversial bill which will break international law. One government source said the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was “wobbly” and had asked for additional cabinet scrutiny of a controversial clause of the bill.
Among those who refused to support the bill on Monday were a slew of senior Conservatives, select committee chairs and QCs – most notably the former chancellor Sajid Javid and ex-attorneys general Sir Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright. Others who abstained included two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Julian Smith and Karen Bradley. In total 30 Tory MPs abstained, though some had prior engagements and did not attend the vote, and two – Sir Roger Gale and Brexiter Andrew Percy – voted against. However, Johnson’s sizeable majority meant the UK internal market bill passed with a comfortable cushion of 77 votes on Monday night, by 340 votes to 263. The real showdown is now set to be next week’s vote on an amendment by Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the justice select committee. MPs had urged the government to accept that amendment – rather than proceed with the internal market bill which breaches part of the Northern Ireland protocol as set out in the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. After the vote, Gale said: “I believe very strongly we should obey international law. I believe the United Kingdom’s word is its bond and I think this is damaging our international reputation for honesty and straight-dealing.” He added that there was “much to play for” when the Commons comes to consider amendments to the bill next week. The select committee chairs Neill, Simon Hoare and Tobias Ellwood all abstained. A number of former lawyers also failed to back the bill including MPs Rehman Chishti, who resigned as a special envoy, and Gary Streeter. Buckland, who did vote for the bill, was said to be particularly concerned about clause 45. This states that regulations made by ministers under the legislation cannot be found incompatible with international law. It appears to be an attempt by Downing Street to avoid future legal challenges. All five living former prime ministers had expressed concern about the bill, as well as the former Conservative leaders William Hague and Michael Howard. Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee abstained and suggested the brewing rebellion, even if it did not kill the bill, was the result of mounting tension within the party – not only over the breach of international law but over coronavirus restrictions – both of which he called “profoundly un-Conservative.” “I’m not going to be voting for this bill. Because if you keep whacking a dog don’t be surprised when it bites you back,” he said. “We are all members of parliament and we deserve to be taken seriously.” Some MPs were told the threat of withdrawing the Conservative whip had not been ruled out if they rebelled. In a nod to some angry MPs, Johnson said he would never invoke the controversial powers in the internal market bill if a Brexit trade deal was reached with the EU. He said the UK would “simultaneously pursue every possible redress under international law, as provided for in the [Northern Ireland] protocol” – a measure suggested by Cox. Opening the debate in the Commons, the prime minister claimed the EU was willing to “use the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that goes well beyond common sense, simply to exert leverage against the UK in our negotiations for a free trade agreement”.
Johnson said the measures in the bill – which would hand unilateral powers to ministers in key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January – were “a protection, it’s a safety net, it’s in an insurance policy, and it is a very sensible measure”. He said threats from the EU, which the bloc has denied, had made the legislation necessary, claiming the bloc could prevent food exports from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That claim drew incredulity from the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, who responded for Labour. He said the bill did “precisely nothing” to address that issue, offering mockingly to give way to Johnson in the Commons if he had found anything in the bill that dealt with the “supposed threat”. “He didn’t read the protocol, he hasn’t read the bill,” Miliband said. “What incompetence, what failure of governance, and how dare he try and blame everyone else? This is his deal, it’s his mess, it’s his failure.” The debate also saw two of the 2019-intake of Tory MPs say they would decline to back the bill. Imran Ahmad Khan, who represents Wakefield, said: “Moral authority is hard-earned and easily lost.” The other was Dr Ben Spencer, who has the former chancellor Philip Hammond’s seat of Runnymeade and Weybridge. Javid, who quit the cabinet earlier this year, said it was not clear why international law had to be broken and that he was “regretfully unable to support the UK internal market bill” unamended. He added the UK should wait until it was clear the EU intended to act in bad faith and until then use safeguards already enshrined in the withdrawal agreement. An amendment next week has been put forward by Neill – another former barrister – which is gathering support. It would require parliamentary approval before any future decision could be made by the government to disapply the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. One senior backbencher accused the whips of scare tactics ahead of the vote. “Unfortunately this is being framed as being pro or against Brexit again, even whether you are patriotic,” the MP said. “Cox’s intervention should prevent it descending into those shallow waters. “They are now leaning heavily on loyalty to the prime minister – and there are many people who do want to go back into government and they will be tested today, there’s no question.” There is consternation even among loyal long-serving Conservatives who are planning to back the government. One former cabinet minister said they would only back the bill “through gritted teeth”. On Monday, David Cameron said: “Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be an absolute final resort. So, I do have misgivings about what’s being proposed.” The former Labour prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and the former Conservative prime minister John Major all said the bill risked the UK’s international obligation. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, also made clear in parliament she is concerned about the implications of the bill. The former prime minister did not vote on the bill on Monday – but was in South Korea on a pre-planned invitation for the World Knowledge Forum."
2020-09-14T19:49:52Z,politics,Politics,Ed Miliband revels in making Boris Johnson look like a second-rate conman,"You could have been forgiven for imagining you were lost in a 2019 time warp. The House of Commons debating the Brexit withdrawal bill, nearly a year after that very bill had been passed. A bill that had been negotiated by the prime minister, declared “an oven-ready triumph” by the prime minister and on which he had won an 80-seat majority at the general election after promising a despairing country that he would “Get Brexit Done”. On the plus side, though, we were treated to one of the best speeches of this and recent parliaments from Ed Miliband as he comprehensively ripped Boris Johnson’s facile and fraudulent arguments to shreds. Admittedly, it wasn’t the hardest of tasks, up against a man who can barely remember what he believed yesterday or even what excuses he might have made for his failures, but Miliband left Boris hopelessly exposed. It wasn’t immediately clear why Johnson had even made the last-minute decision to open the debate in person, as the business secretary, Alok Sharma, had been originally handed the poisoned chalice. And would probably have done a far better job as Sharma has the unique talent of putting even himself to sleep whenever he opens his mouth. But perhaps hubris got the better of Boris. Or maybe he’s just a common crook who can’t resist returning to the scene of the crime. Either way, his guilt oozed from every pore. This was Boris at his very worst. Normally Johnson has little trouble in dealing in bullshit and lies: in fact he has made a career out of it. Yet right from the very start, he appeared nervous and defensive, even though a near empty chamber saved him from having to take too many embarrassing interventions from both the opposition and Conservative benches. Instead, what we got was total incoherence. The EU wasn’t negotiating in good faith. It was trying to blockade clotted cream being imported to Northern Ireland from Devon. The EU was trying to destroy the Northern Ireland protocol and no British parliament could possibly sign up to this. Except of course, it already had. Under his own leadership. Boris refused almost all interventions from the Labour benches, instead choosing to take those from the intellectually challenged Andrea Jenkyns and the timid rebel Bob Neill, who said he might be prepared to break international law provided parliament was allowed a specific vote on it first. Boris happily indulged him in this nonsense. Just one Tory, the former attorney general Jeremy Wright, challenged Boris on the ministerial code of breaking international law. Johnson ummed and ahed and said that Suella Braverman – a lawyer whom you wouldn’t trust to witness a passport application and had been chosen as attorney general for her compliance – had reckoned that the government could do anything Boris wanted it to. Wright – as with all the other former Tory attorney generals, prime ministers and cabinet ministers of any integrity – just shook his head in disbelief. Under normal circumstances, the Labour leader would have replied for the opposition. But Keir Starmer was self-isolating after one of his children had been found to display coronavirus symptoms, so Miliband, as shadow business secretary, got to make the speech he had originally prepared. And Miliband couldn’t believe his luck, because many of his jibes might have fallen flat had they been levelled at Sharma. So much more fun to have the person actually responsible for trashing the reputation of both the country and the Conservative party in front of you rather than a dull-witted apparatchik. Miliband didn’t put a foot wrong, both goading the prime minister for his failure to understand key aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol and inquiring how he expected other countries to take us at our word if we were so willing to break international treaties, before taking him down point by point. At first Boris merely rolled his eyes, willing Ed to disappear, but by the end there was nothing but stone-cold fury in his stares. Boris has been found out countless times before by almost everyone who has had the misfortune to have dealings with him, but seldom so comprehensively and so publicly. Or with such obvious enjoyment. Miliband knew he had Johnson bang to rights as a second-rate conman and wasn’t going to let him off the hook. All his arguments were delivered with the panache and flourish of a man who knew he had right on his side. Even the Tories sensed it with only Bernard Jenkin foolish enough to intervene on the prime minister’s behalf. Miliband did for him in a couple of short sentences, saying that the Tory-led Northern Ireland select committee had reported that the EU had been negotiating in good faith. What followed was one highlight after another. Serial incompetence of a man who couldn’t remember it was his deal he was reneging on. The list of politicians who agreed that the deal had protected the Northern Ireland protocol. The observation there was already a dispute resolution procedure that didn’t involve the failed state option. But the collector’s item was his invitation for Boris to back up his assertion that the withdrawal agreement imposed a blockade on GB goods into Northern Ireland. “Come on,” Ed said, his voice laced with condescension. “I know you’re a details man. Show me the blockade. I will give way to you.” Boris remained almost immobile, the blood draining from his face. He was so, so busted. But Miliband wasn’t finished. He also enjoyed himself with the five possible reasons for breaking the law. Especially the one about doing so in a specific and limited way. As if not going really big by actually invading Brussels and executing Michel Barnier somehow made it OK. He did, though, leave out a sixth reason. That Boris has yet to come across a law that ever applied to him. The speeches that followed were something of an anticlimax in comparison. Bill Cash found that he could be even more angry now that Brexit was happening than when it wasn’t, while SNP leader Ian Blackford attacked Johnsons’s proposals to remove powers from the devolved governments. Not that Boris was there to hear them. He had sneaked out of the chamber shortly after his evisceration. It turns out that Boris does have a humiliation threshold after all. And Miliband had just found it. This article was amended on 15 September 2020 to remove an erroneous reference to narcolepsy."
2020-09-14T18:55:56Z,politics,Politics,PM calls EU tactics 'extreme' while defending breach of international law,"Boris Johnson accused the EU of preparing to go to “extreme and unreasonable lengths” in Brexit talks as he defended breaching international law amid a mounting rebellion from Tory backbenchers. The former chancellor, Sajid Javid, became the most senior of the prime minister’s past cabinet colleagues to say they could not support the UK internal market bill prior to a Commons vote on Monday night. Javid joined two former Conservative attorney generals, Jeremy Wright and Sir Geoffrey Cox. David Cameron, one of Johnson’s predecessors, had earlier expressed “misgivings” about the creation of powers to row back on elements of the withdrawal agreement involving Northern Ireland. All five living former prime ministers have now expressed concern about the bill. More than 20 Tory MPs are expected to withhold support for the bill but most will abstain unless the government makes concessions on giving parliament a vote on the new powers before the vote.
Whips told some MPs the threat of withdrawing the Conservative whip had not been ruled out if they rebelled. In a nod to some angry MPs, Johnson said he would never invoke the controversial powers in the internal market bill if a Brexit trade deal was reached with the EU. He said the UK would “simultaneously pursue every possible redress under international law, as provided for in the [Northern Ireland] protocol” – a measure suggested by Cox. Opening the debate in the Commons, the prime minister claimed the EU was willing to “use the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that goes well beyond common sense, simply to exert leverage against the UK in our negotiations for a free trade agreement”.

This is his deal, it’s his mess, it’s his failure.” Intervening in Johnson’s speech, Wright raised the ministerial code which he said bounds ministers to respect international law. Earlier the former attorney general had said he along with many others, were “profoundly disturbed by what’s going on”. Two former barristers – Cox and Rehman Chishti, who quit as the special envoy on religious freedom – also told the government they would not back the bill, along with former solicitor Gary Streeter. “There is concern among some lawyers in parliament about what effect this would have on their practice after they leave parliament – the bar has made its view very clear,” one MP said. The debate also saw the first of the 2019-intake of Tory MPs decline to back the bill. Imran Ahmad Khan, who represents Wakefield, said: “Moral authority is hard-earned and easily lost.” Javid, who quit the cabinet earlier this year, said it was not clear why international law had to be broken and that he was “regretfully unable to support the UK internal market bill” unamended. He added the UK should wait until it was clear the EU intended to act in bad faith and until then use safeguards already enshrined in the withdrawal agreement. Others planning to abstain include Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, who said: “Everything is getting very high-octane, and the collateral damage to Britain is reaching the US Congress, where people are bewildered we are going down this avenue. “Many of us are conflicted because I came into politics to further Britain’s place on the international stage, and now we are at a time where there is an absence of political leadership, and we can’t hold our heads up high if we are being seen to challenge international law.” Most MPs with concerns about the bill will be expected to abstain rather than vote against, saving their ire for votes next week where amendments will be tabled. Asked whether Tory MPs who rebelled on Monday night could lose the whip, Johnson’s spokesman stressed it was “critical” that Conservatives backed the bill. An amendment next week has been put forward by the chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill – another former barrister. It would require parliamentary approval before any future decision could be made by the government to disapply the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. Those backing the Neill amendment include the former cabinet minister Damian Green, the QC and former justice minister Oliver Heald, the Northern Ireland select committee chair, Simon Hoare, and Damian Collins, former chair of the culture select committee, who are all expected to withhold support for the bill.
Others expressing serious concerns were the chair of the foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat, former transport minister George Freeman and the veteran Tory Sir Roger Gale who said: “An Englishman’s word used to be his bond. Under Johnson that is not so.” One senior backbencher accused the whips of scare tactics. “Unfortunately this is being framed as being pro or against Brexit again, even whether you are patriotic,” the MP said. “Cox’s intervention should prevent it descending into those shallow waters. “They are now leaning heavily on loyalty to the prime minister – and there are many people who do want to go back into government and they will be tested today, there’s no question.” There is consternation even among loyal long-serving Conservatives who are planning to back the government. One former cabinet minister said they would only back the bill “through gritted teeth”. On Monday, Cameron said: “Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be an absolute final resort. So, I do have misgivings about what’s being proposed.” The former Labour prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and the former Conservative prime minister John Major all said the bill risked the UK’s international obligation. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, has also made clear in parliament she is concerned about the implications of the bill."
2020-09-14T17:37:50Z,politics,Politics,"Official post-Brexit report warns of queues of 7,000 lorries in Kent","The scale of disruption predicted to hit UK borders post-Brexit is revealed in confidential government documents warning of queues of 7,000 lorries in Kent, and two-day delays to cross into the EU. A “reasonable worst-case scenario” report, drawn up by the Border and Protocol Delivery Group, forecasts that thousands of passengers could also be forced to wait an extra two hours for Eurostar trains.
Dated last week and seen by the Guardian, the 46-page document marked “official – sensitive” says that a core IT system for hauliers is not expected to be tested publicly until the end of November. With the UK leaving the customs union and the single market on 1 January, it means that border disruption could ensue whether or not the UK secures a trade deal with the EU.
The document was presented to a meeting of the XO (exit operations) committee chaired by Michael Gove for decisions on the next stages of development in the border operating model, the goods vehicle management system and so-called “smart freight” software designed to regulate the flow of traffic into Kent and guard against congestion. It notes that preparations for new post-Brexit border operations are all-consuming, affecting 26 government departments using 100 IT systems. Some departments legally cannot share data with others, with legislation required to ensure information flow, the report says. On road haulage, it forecasts that 50-70% of large businesses will be ready for cross-border trade. When it comes to smaller businesses, it assumes that as few as 20-40% of small- to medium-sized businesses will know what to do from 1 January. In the reasonable worst-case scenario, in which 30-60% of lorries carrying freight are ready, Kent would be plunged into chaos, bringing disruption to businesses across the country.
“It is estimated a maximum queue of 6,500 HGVs may develop in January,” the report says. “Disruption could be lower in the initial days of January but we would expect sustained disruption to worsen over the first two weeks as demand builds”, with people returning to work after the Christmas and New Year holidays.
“Considering demand levels in the first week of February, it is estimated that if readiness does not improve by then, queues could reach a length of 7,000 HGVs. In each case it is estimated that HGVs could take two days to reach the front of the queue,” it says. Kent authorities have rebooted Operation Fennel, with contingency plans to cope with the queues, it adds. But their efforts will be frustrated unless the smart freight system – a web portal operating a red, amber and green traffic light system for hauliers – is working on time. Only those given the green light, after passing a documentations test, will be given a Kent access permit. The document reveals the system will not go into a public beta testing phase until the end of November, leaving little time to launch it fully or train drivers and their customers. “Smart freight is all great in theory but how are they going to weed out the drivers who haven’t got the green light?” said an industry source. “Even if they use automatic number plate recognition technology, how are they going to stop trucks just driving into Kent thinking they will finish the paperwork when they get there? Do they have enforcement officers pulling people over? Do all trucks have to go to a lorry park for clearance? This is why you hear people talking about a border within Kent. But these questions have not been answered by the government yet.” The report piles pressure on the government to decide and publicise plans for lorry parks across the country where support can be provided in the early days. So far it has only confirmed one, in Ashford in Kent, with legislation passed on 4 September to give powers to build others in 29 council areas. It calls for advice centres to be set up across the country, with 39 sites identified at truck stop and service stations on all main motorways including the M6, M40, M1 and M20. These should be equipped with printers to help hauliers who do not have the right documentation prepare for their onward journey to ports in Kent, Portsmouth, Holyhead and Felixstowe among others, it says. But insiders say if they don’t also have customs clearance at these sites then “there isn’t much point to them”. With fewer than four months to go before the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, the document also notes that ongoing work at the Department for Transport to provide the advice centres “is currently unfunded” with a parallel treasury bid for £18.5m still in development.
It recommends that a “Border Impact Centre (BIC)” is set up by 31 December to help national and local authorities get to grips with the change in border-destined traffic. Technical discussions with France may not start until the end of September, although the document explores the option of Kent authorities co-locating with France’s “Lille crisis cell” to jointly manage the potential chaos on the roads. Passengers on Eurostar and at airports could also face “significant disruption” if UK nationals are not allowed to use e-gates. This would not be the default in a no-deal scenario. Modelling from last year indicated that new border controls at the Eurostar gates at London’s St Pancras station “could lead to queues of many thousands”, the document says. It adds that Eurostar “has committed to mitigate this scenario, including in extremis cancelling services”. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “As a responsible government we continue to make extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios, including the reasonable worst case. This is not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a stretching scenario. It reflects a responsible government ensuring we are ready for all eventualities.”"
2020-09-14T17:00:02Z,politics,Politics,"Rivals have surged ahead of UK's armed forces, Ben Wallace warns","The British armed forces will need to become more nimble to counter the increasingly underhand tactics of nations such as Russia and China, defence chiefs have warned. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the UK’s enemies have surged ahead recently, as he set out plans for a wide-ranging review of foreign, security and defence policy during a briefing on the Royal Navy’s newest ship, the offshore patrol vessel HMS Tamar, on Monday. “The global picture has changed. Our enemies have studied up on our abilities and adapted far more quickly than us,” Wallace said. “The static concept of war versus peace no longer applies as we are contested on either side of the threshold of armed conflict on a regular basis.” Wallace said the UK would need an armed force that is “more forward-deployed, deterring Russian activity in Europe, combating terror in the Middle East and the Sahel and countering Chinese activity in the Asia Pacific”. He said the review would create an armed forces who were “fit for tomorrow’s battles, not fighting yesterday’s”. The chief of defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, added that the UK’s opponents “no longer distinguish between peace and war, between foreign and domestic policy, or, for that matter, between public and private”. He said: “They now compete in all these different areas and they take a great opportunity in blurring these distinctions. Now, part of that of course is that our posture will have to change. It’s a posture … that will be much more about campaigning.” Defence chiefs have reportedly been looking at ways to use artificial intelligence to protect data, networks and intellectual property in recent months as they seek to combat what they see as the most likely threat from Beijing in the future. And the chief of defence intelligence, Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, has warned that the UK’s adversaries are presenting a threat both digitally and in space. “Whilst conventional threats remain, we have seen our adversaries invest in artificial intelligence, machine learning and other groundbreaking technologies, whilst also supercharging more traditional techniques of influence and leverage.” At Monday’s briefing, Carter said: “We will think much more about a force structure that is not just through the navy, the army and the air force, as we used to describe it. Rather, it will be a force structure that will be designed through the new domains of space and cyber and maritime, air and land.” Wallace set out his vision for an armed forces prepared to be on a constant campaign footing to protect British interests around the world; as well as to be prepared to fight in more traditional conflicts. The defence secretary has faced criticism for his decision to hold the review during the coronavirus pandemic, amid concerns the “reckless and irrational” timing could be used to mask “intolerable” cuts. The chairman of parliament’s intelligence watchdog and former chairman of the Commons defence select committee Julian Lewis said in his submission to the review: “Undertaking a complex review would be daunting and difficult, even in stable conditions.” Writing in a personal capacity, he added: “Persisting at a time of financial implosion and social dislocation smacks of desperation, immaturity or ulterior motives – possibly a combination of all three.” The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said: “As Britain faces more complex threats and conflict, it is vital the government gets this defence review right. “This is the third review in 10 years and the last two have been driven by cutting costs. Since 2010, the Conservatives have cut the strength of British forces by a quarter, with 40,000 fewer full-time troops now than 10 years ago. “First and foremost, this review must safeguard Britain’s capacity to maintain a world-class fighting force. Britain cannot afford ministers who repeat the mistakes of their past.”"
2020-09-14T15:52:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Sajid Javid among Tory MPs expected to abstain or vote against bill,"More than 20 Conservative MPs, including the former chancellor Sajid Javid, are expected to rebel or abstain at the vote on Boris Johnson’s internal market bill, which the government admits will break international law. The government has not ruled out the possibility that rebels could lose the Conservative whip, though most prominent names are expected to abstain at this stage of the bill. Two former barristers – the ex-attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Rehman Chishti, who quit as the special envoy on religious freedom – have also told the government they will not back the bill on Monday night, along with former solicitor Gary Streeter. “There is concern among some lawyers in parliament about what effect this would have on their practice after they leave parliament – the bar has made its view very clear,” one MP said. Javid, who resigned from the cabinet earlier this year, said it was not clear why it was necessary to break international law and that he was “regretfully unable to support the UK internal market bill” unamended. He said instead the UK should wait until it was clear the EU intended to act in bad faith and until then use the safeguards already enshrined in the withdrawal agreement. Others planning to abstain include Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, who said: “Everything is getting very high octane, and the collateral damage to Britain is reaching the US Congress, where people are bewildered we are going down this avenue,” he said.
“Many of us are conflicted because I came into politics to further Britain’s place on the international stage, and now we are at time where there is an absence of political leadership, and we can’t hold our heads up high if we are being seen to challenge international law.” Most MPs with misgivings about the bill will be expected to abstain rather than vote against, keeping their powder dry for the votes next week where amendments will be tabled. Asked whether Tory MPs who rebelled could lose the whip, Johnson’s spokesman said this was a political consideration rather than a question for him, but stressed it was important that Conservatives backed the bill. “This is a piece of legislation that delivers a vital legal safety net in order to ensure that the integrity of the United Kingdom can be protected, and it is critical that MPs pass this bill before the end of the year,” he said. Asked whether it would thus be treated in effect as a confidence issue for the government, he replied: “As I said, it’s critical that we get this legislation passed and on the statute books before the end of the year.”
More Tory MPs said on Monday they planned to abstain on the legislation with a number hoping the government will back an amendment next week by the chair of the justice select committee, Bob Neill – another former barrister – which would require parliamentary approval before any future decision could be made by the government to disapply the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. Those backing the amendment include the former cabinet minister Damian Green, the QC and former justice minister Oliver Heald, the Northern Ireland select committee chair, Simon Hoare, and Damian Collins, the former chair of the culture select committee, who are all expected to withhold support for the bill. Ellwood said the amendment was “a face-saving way the government could allow us to advance this”. Others who may abstain on Monday night include the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, and the former transport minister George Freeman. Others may rebel outright. The veteran Tory Sir Roger Gale has been one of the most vocally angry, saying: “An Englishman’s word used to be his bond. Under Johnson that is not so.” One senior backbencher opposed to the bill said the tactics being used by the whips were designed to scare those who were uncomfortable. “Unfortunately this is being framed as being pro or against Brexit again, even whether you are patriotic,” the MP said. “Cox’s intervention should prevent it descending into those shallow waters. “They are now leaning heavily on loyalty to the prime minister – and there are many people who do want to go back into government and they will be tested today, there’s no question.” There is consternation even among loyal long-serving Conservatives who are planning to back the government. One former cabinet minister said they would only back the bill “through gritted teeth”. All five living former prime ministers have expressed concern about the bill, as well as the former Conservative leaders William Hague and Michael Howard. On Monday, David Cameron said: “Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be an absolute final resort. So, I do have misgivings about what’s being proposed.” Another MP who was undecided said some saw the House of Lords as a way out. “It hasn’t got a cat in hell’s chance of passing there – not with Michael Howard and Norman Lamont opposed – and we have a minority there anyway.” The former Labour prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and the former Conservative prime minister John Major all said the bill risked the UK’s international obligation. Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May has also made clear in parliament she is concerned about the implications of the bill. “How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?” she said. It remains unclear what May, the only former prime minister who remains an MP, will do on the legislation itself. Downing Street has said the prime minister would open the debate on Monday afternoon, a last-minute change from the business secretary, Alok Sharma. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, will be at the dispatch box for Labour, with Keir Starmer self-isolating after a family member showed symptoms of coronavirus."
2020-09-14T12:42:17Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: David Cameron joins former PMs warning against Boris Johnson's bill,"David Cameron has become the third former Conservative prime minister to express disquiet about Boris Johnson’s proposal to breach international law by unilaterally redrafting part of the Brexit deal with the EU, saying he had “misgivings” about the idea. In comments on Monday, before MPs began debating the internal market bill that sets out the plans, Cameron said: “Passing an act of parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. “It should be an absolute final resort. So, I do have misgivings about what’s being proposed.” Theresa May and John Major have warned in stronger terms about the plans, saying they could damage the UK’s international reputation, as has another former Conservative leader, Michael Howard. Cameron said he also had to consider that the UK was “in a vital negotiation with the EU to get a deal and I think we have to keep that context, that big prize in mind”. He added: “And that’s why I have perhaps held back from saying more up to now.” The comments come amid a potential Tory backbench rebellion about the plan, with the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox saying on Monday that breaking international law risked causing “very long-term and permanent damage to this country’s reputation”.
Ahead of the second reading of the bill, the first opportunity MPs will have to debate it, Cox said he understood government arguments that the EU was acting in bad faith over the Brexit withdrawal agreement. “But what you can’t do, and what I think is wrong, is to abandon an agreement, to rewrite unilaterally parts of an agreement, which you only signed nine months ago, and to which we have given our solemn word,” he told Times Radio. He added: “The breaking of the law, ultimately, leads to very long-term and permanent damage to this country’s reputation. And it’s also a question of honour, to me. We signed up, we knew what we were signing. We simply can’t seek to nullify those ordinary consequences of doing that.” Cox did, however, indicate that while he could not support the bill as it stood, this could change: “If the government were to say that these powers will only be used in these specific circumstances, where it would be lawful to act in this way, then that might well be a different position. But I haven’t had those assurances yet.” Hours after Cox’s comment, another Brexit-backing Tory MP and former barrister, Rehman Chishti, a key backer of Johnson in the Tory leadership contest, also said he could not support the bill. Chishti resigned as the prime minister’s envoy on religious freedom in order to withdraw his support for the legislation, underlining how uncomfortable many current and former lawyers on the Conservative benches are with the proposed bill. “I will not be able to support this bill as a matter of principle. I have real concerns with the UK breaking its legal commitments under the withdrawal agreement,” he said. “During my 10 years in parliament and before that as a barrister, I have always acted in a manner which respects the rule of law. I feel strongly about keeping the commitments we make, if we give our word, then we must honour it. Voting for this bill as it currently stands would be contrary to the values I hold dearest.” Defending the government’s stance, the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said that even with his job he had no qualms about supporting a measure that potentially broke international law. “I’m policing minister, so I’m responsible for the criminal law, and this is obviously a civil matter and an international law matter,” he told BBC1’s Breakfast programme. Malthouse argued that the action was needed because the EU had threatened to potentially threaten food exports to Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which Brussels has rejected. He said: “The lawyers will bat it backwards and forwards, I have absolutely no doubt about that. But from my point of view, as a non-lawyer, I’m looking at the practical effect.” Malthouse rejected the idea that the government planning to break the law could prompt people to ignore UK laws, for example new rules on coronavirus: “We think it is a good example.” Labour’s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, disagreed, saying: “How can we on the one hand be saying you’ve got to obey the law, which we all say rightly as legislators, and then the government comes along and says, well it’s OK for us to break the law because it’s specific and limited. We can’t be having that.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, echoed this on his monthly call-in appearance on LBC radio. “Here we are, on the world stage for the first time in many years on our own, and what’s the first thing we do? We break a treaty,” he told one listener. Starmer said many people would be baffled at Johnson’s row with the EU: “I think the vast majority of the population would say, ‘What on earth is going on? You’re reopening things that we thought were closed. You said you’d get a deal, get on and get a deal.’ ”"
2020-09-14T12:04:26Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to miss crucial Brexit debate due to self-isolation,"The Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, will miss Monday’s crucial Brexit debate in the House of Commons because he is self-isolating while a member of his household awaits the result of a Covid-19 test. MPs are set to debate the government’s internal market bill, which includes clauses ministers have conceded would break international law if enacted. But a Labour spokesperson said Starmer would not be participating in the debate. “This morning Keir Starmer was advised to self-isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. The member of his household has now had a test. In line with NHS guidelines, Keir will self-isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals,” the spokesperson said.
It is understood Starmer has not experienced any coronavirus symptoms. Labour said he received the news just after leaving the LBC studio, where he took part in a phone-in. If the test is positive, the Labour leader’s period of isolation would be likely to extend into Connected, the event replacing this year’s party conference that is scheduled to be held largely online. Starmer had been expected to make a speech at a public venue during the event. It is unclear which member of Starmer’s household has been experiencing symptoms; but he has two school-age children.
Labour later said the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, would stand in for Starmer at Monday’s afternoon’s debate. Starmer has toed a careful line on Brexit since becoming Labour leader, insisting last December’s general election result meant the issue was resolved, and urging the government to focus on tackling the pandemic. He told LBC on Monday morning that “the vast majority of the population” would say to Boris Johnson: “get on with it.” The test on a member of Starmer’s household comes as a new “rule of six” comes into force in an effort to limit the size of social gatherings and prevent Covid-19 infections from running out of control. Official figures have shown a rapid increase in new cases in the UK, to more than 3,000 a day. Starmer challenged Johnson last week at prime minister’s questions about the availability of tests, with widespread reports suggesting they are difficult to obtain, and many patients are being sent on long journeys to testing centres. • This article was amended on 15 September 2020 to make it clear that is not Keir Starmer who had the Covid-19 test, but a member of his household."
2020-09-14T11:02:36Z,politics,Politics,Lib Dems drop mayoral contender over antisemitic comment about Jack Straw,"The Liberal Democrats have suspended a prospective party choice for mayor of London after footage emerged of her urging Muslim voters not to vote for a Labour candidate in a previous general election because he was Jewish. The footage from the 1997 general election, uncovered by the PoliticsHome website, was filmed when Geeta Sidhu-Robb was taking on Labour’s Jack Straw, who is not Jewish, in his Blackburn constituency. It shows Sidhu-Robb telling a reporter that Labour had accused her of being anti-Islam, and that in response she would “get into a car and walk around, and drive through town telling everyone Jack Straw is a Jew”, adding: “How is a Muslim going to vote for someone who is Jewish?” It then shows her using a megaphone from a car being driven around Blackburn saying, in Urdu, what the footage translates as: “Don’t vote for a Jew, Jack Straw is a Jew.” It then shows Sidhu-Robb saying she did this in anger, and wished she had not. A London Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “Geeta Sidhu-Robb has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and will not be on the ballot paper to be the Liberal Democrat candidate for mayor of London. There is an investigation under way in accordance with due process.” The health company owner was among candidates seeking to fight next year’s London mayoral election for the Lib Dems. The poll had been due in May this year, but was put off for a year due to coronavirus.
Speaking via Twitter, Sidhu-Robb apologised for her language in 1997, writing: “I am deeply ashamed of the ignorant and abusive language I used on one occasion in the 1997 General Election campaign. As shown in the footage, I instantly regretted my appalling behaviour, which I continue to do. “Those words are entirely inconsistent with my views and values, and though there are no excuses for my actions, there is some context; that is, that I was under a great deal of strain and retaliated to the racial abuse I was receiving in Blackburn ‘like for like’. “Two wrongs never make a right. I made a mistake and I take responsibility for my abhorrent actions 23 years ago, they were never repeated. I urge you to judge me on who I am today, a campaigner committed to eradicating inequality and discrimination in all its forms.” The party is seeking a new candidate after Siobhan Benita, who had been due to run in May, said she was pulling out as she could not commit to another year of unpaid campaigning. However, in a series of tweets on Sunday, Benita said she had since left the Lib Dems altogether. She said: “I wish the party – and it has many amazing people – only the best. But my deciding to stand down wasn’t based on finances alone. There are serious issues that need fixing in the London region and I couldn’t run the campaign I wanted to.”"
2020-09-14T10:45:32Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: how true is Boris Johnson's claim EU wants to 'cut off' part of UK?,"What is Boris Johnson’s claim? Boris Johnson has argued that the EU was seeking to “blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off” in justification of breaking international law and breaching the withdrawal agreement through the internal market bill. The prime minister claimed in a Daily Telegraph article that the threat of a block on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain had emerged as the two sides were thrashing out details of how the withdrawal agreement’s clauses on Northern Ireland would be implemented from 1 January. Is it true? Not really. The prime minister’s argument in favour of the internal market bill is a mixture of truth, untruth and conflation, although there are grounds to criticise the EU’s rather high-handed approach.
What is the truth? Under the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement agreed and ratified last year, Northern Ireland will in effect stay in the single market and follow EU standards in goods at the end of the transition period, while the rest of the UK exits and does its own thing on standards. Under the agreement, the EU’s customs code would also be enforced on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, although Northern Ireland would stay in the UK’s customs territory. This “in-out” arrangement was agreed in order to prevent a customs border being implemented on the island of Ireland. In the event of a wider trade deal not being agreed by the EU and the UK this year, that could mean tariffs being applied to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain if they are deemed “at risk” of entering the Republic of Ireland at a later point. Tariffs would be repayable to importers where it could be proven that the goods had not gone over the border into the Republic. But tariffs and checks would be done in the first instance, creating barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This outcome was the reason Theresa May, as prime minister, had been adamantly against any such customs border between the four nations of the UK. However, to make this more palatable to the British side, it had been agreed that a joint EU-UK committee would analyse the range of goods that move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
It was hoped that a decision could be made on whether some ranges of goods were “at risk” of entering the Republic before they were exported. For example, the UK government argued that goods being exported into Northern Ireland to be sold in British supermarket chains in the province should not be deemed “at risk” of entering the south of the island of Ireland. The negotiations on what goods are deemed “at risk” are ongoing. But under the Northern Ireland protocol agreed by Johnson, a failure to agree on it would end in a default position of all goods entering from Great Britain being regarded as “at risk”, and therefore attracting tariffs. The prime minister has said that this would be an “extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol” and that it would “impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea”. In reality, it is simply what was agreed. But Johnson is no longer comfortable with what was agreed. The internal market bill and a finance bill to follow would overrule key clauses, leaving major decisions, including what is “at risk”, in the hands of British ministers. Is it just tariffs that the prime minister is concerned about? No. “We are being told that the EU will not only impose tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that they might actually stop the transport of food products from GB to NI,” he writes. Here, the prime minister is bringing in an entirely separate issue and not one that is solved by the internal market bill. In order for British exporters to move agricultural produce into the EU’s single market, including Northern Ireland, Brussels needs to give “third-country approval” to the UK regulatory regime. It is a health check. For example, a country must have a salmonella control programme for chickens to be imported. The EU has said the UK has so far failed to provide sufficient details of the so-called sanitary and phytosanitary regime for animal and plant products post-Brexit. The UK government says the EU has ample information. Either way, there is nothing in the internal market bill that would resolve this particular dispute. Critics argue that the prime minister has a habit of not letting facts get in the way of a good story."
2020-09-13T23:01:13Z,politics,Politics,Motor manufacturers  warn of £100bn losses if no Brexit deal struck,"British and European motor manufacturers have warned of “catastrophic” £100bn losses in the industry over the next five years if a Brexit trade deal is not struck. As trade talks hang by a thread in the face of a political showdown over the EU withdrawal agreement, sector leaders from across Europe predicted a wave of job losses in both factories and their suppliers if the UK crashes out of the single market. In a joint statement signed by 23 automotive trade associations, they say the calculated €110bn (£100bn) impact comes on top of the estimated €100bn cost of the Covid pandemic. “These figures paint a bleak picture of the devastation that would follow a no-deal Brexit. The shock of tariffs and other trade barriers would compound the damage already dealt by a global pandemic and recession, putting businesses and livelihoods at risk,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the UK. Hildegard Müller, the president of the German automotive association, the VDA, said some businesses would be at risk if cross-border trade was hit by tariffs. “This would jeopardise closely linked value chains and possibly make them unprofitable. Our member companies have more than 100 production sites in the United Kingdom. We hope that the EU and the UK will continue their close partnership – with a comprehensive free trade agreement.” The head of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, Eric-Mark Huitema, said it “absolutely must have an ambitious EU-UK trade agreement in place by January”.
Over the past two years, the auto industry has consistently warned of the deep cost of no deal on the car industry, which employs 14.6 million people directly and indirectly in factories, component supplies, engineering, design and marketing and sales. They hope this latest warning from the combined forces of leaders in both the EU and the UK will help both sides see past their political differences and strike a trade deal. Brexit talks are continuing this week, but on Sunday, Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said it would be difficult to conclude a trade deal if the British government passed legislation allowing it to renege on parts of the withdrawal agreement. The motor industry fears a collapse in talks would mean punitive tariffs – 10% on car sales and 22% on vans and trucks, but also hit jobs and sales revenues that underpins more than €60bn investment in technical innovation and research every year, which Sigrid de Vries, the secretary general of the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) said makes it “the EU’s largest private R&D investor”. Its latest calculations suggest production levels would fall by 3m units in the UK and the EU over the next five years in a no-deal scenario. This is on top of a 3.6m reduction in the annual 18.6m units produced a year because of coronavirus.
In a separate development, the Unite union has warned of border chaos in Britain unless “decisive action is taken over incomplete IT systems to deal with post-Brexit customs”, along with plans, revealed last week, for 29 lorry parks across the country to deal with possible delays at Dover. Deal or no deal, drivers on trucks carrying car components and other products face a fine of £300 if they do not have the correct and completed paperwork to cross the Channel. Unite said it was “completely unacceptable” to penalise drivers “who are not responsible for preparing customs declarations for their loads”. The union’s national officer, Adrian Jones, said border chaos would also come at a great cost not only to drivers but to local authorities, who with “less than four months to go” still do not know the locations of the majority of lorry parks."
2020-09-13T23:01:12Z,politics,Politics,"Key workers and public services need more support, say UK unions","Union leaders have urged the government to avoid mass unemployment in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis by continuing to support key workers and public services. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Unison, one of the UK’s largest unions, will launch their campaigns in tandem on Monday demanding the government stand by working families and increase spending on public services. They told ministers key workers would suffer if a planned minimum wage rise next year did not go ahead. Speaking to the TUC’s 152nd Congress in London, the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, will say time is running out to prevent the misery of mass unemployment. During her virtual speech, O’Grady, will appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, urging him to continue government support of the job retention scheme (JRS), as well as a rise in the minimum wage. “Unions pushed for the job retention scheme. Millions of livelihoods were saved – both employees and the self-employed,” she will say.From this Thursday, it will be just 45 days before the JRS ends. That’s the notice period that companies have to give if they intend to make mass redundancies. “If the government doesn’t act, we face a tsunami of job losses. So my message to the chancellor is this: we worked together once before. We are ready to work with you again – if you are serious about stopping the catastrophe of mass unemployment. “Rishi Sunak: stand by working families – don’t walk away.” Analysis published by the union showed 2.1 million key workers would benefit from the planned increase in the national minimum wage in April 2021. The TUC said putting the brake on that rise would be no way to recognise their dedication and hard work. O’Grady said: “Coronavirus is no leveller. It has exposed huge inequality in modern Britain. Hard work should pay for everyone, no matter who you are or what kind of job you do. Yet, many of those who kept this country going through the crisis don’t get the respect they deserve. “They do valuable, skilled work. But they are short-changed. The minimum wage – the wage of 2 million key workers – must rise as planned. Ministers: don’t punch down.” Meanwhile, Unison said key workers and others employed in health, local government, social care and education have been supporting communities across the UK throughout the pandemic. The public services union said the cuts, underfunding and decline that have been commonplace for the past decade could not continue. During the launch of its No Going Back to Normal campaign, the general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: “Everyone is desperate to get back to normal. However, ‘normal’ cannot mean a return to low pay, penny-pinching and public services staff being undervalued. “For too long, this has been the reality for those providing vital amenities including health and social care, policing, education and local government. “The government must invest properly in public services and respect workers by paying them fairly and keeping them safe. It must reverse a decade of neglect,” he added."
2020-09-13T20:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Tory rebellion widens over Boris Johnson's bill to override Brexit deal,"Downing Street is facing a showdown with Conservative backbench rebels as criticism over its plans to break international law with a controversial bill that could override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement grew louder on Sunday. It is understood that opposition among the party is growing, with dozens of Tory MPs expected to support a key amendment to the internal market bill that would give parliament a crucial veto of any changes to the agreement. MPs will have an opportunity to air their opposition during a second reading and debate of the bill on Monday, when it will also be put to a vote before passing to committee stage. A number of Tory MPs intend to abstain in Monday’s vote, with up to 30 expected to back the amendment tabled by Sir Bob Neill, the chair of the justice select committee, next week. Geoffrey Cox, Boris Johnson’s former attorney general, broke cover on Sunday evening to say he could not support the bill, describing the government’s plan as “unconscionable”. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, confirmed that Labour would also vote against the bill in its current form. Neill, who will be abstaining on Monday, told the Guardian: “I’ve had some very positive support from fellow Conservative MPs, significantly from both people who supported Brexit, as well as remainers. I’m confident that support is growing.” His comments come as the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said he would resign if the law was “broken in a way that I find unacceptable” but stressed that “we are not at that stage”. He told BBC One’s the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the legislation was a “break the glass in emergency provision if we need it”.
Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice of England and Wales from 2013 to 2017, said he did not accept Buckland’s argument and in effect called on him to consider his position. Referencing the resignation of Jonathan Jones, the head of the government’s legal department, he told BBC Radio on Sunday: “Obviously Sir Jonathan felt that the situation was such that he felt he could not continue. I do not see the lord chancellor [Buckland] being in any different position.” Former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair also criticised the prime minister’s threat to break international law over the weekend. In a joint article written for the Sunday Times, the pair urged MPs to reject the legislation, saying it imperiled the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK’s integrity. Writing in the Times on Monday, Cox said: “When the Queen’s minister gives his word, on her behalf, it should be axiomatic that he will keep it, even if the consequences are unpalatable.” Meanwhile, a new war of words broke out on Twitter between Downing Street’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, over the Northern Ireland protocol, under which it would continue to enforce EU customs and follow product standards rules to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Frost claimed the EU had made it clear there is no guarantee it will add Britain to its list of approved third countries for food imports. But Barnier said it needed details from the UK on its future health standards for food, plant and animal origin products for export, known as sanitary and phytosanitary standards.
Neill said his amendment would not reach parliament until the second week of debates but would “allow time for momentum to grow,” adding: “Ministers will be under pressure to explain what their opposition is to a parliamentary lock. The amendment doesn’t actually remove these clauses from the bill. Some people will say: ‘You ought to go further and take them out completely.’ But this is done in the spirit of compromise if the government really needs to use them in an emergency. “What you can do is have the provision in the bill but you wouldn’t actually activate it until the House of Commons, on a minister’s motion, specifically authorised those clauses to come into effect by voting for it.” In an extraordinary scene in the Commons last week, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that the proposed bill “does break international law in a very specific and limited way”. The bill, which would give ministers powers to “disapply” part of the deal signed by Johnson last year, has infuriated Brussels. Writing for the Telegraph on Saturday, Johnson claimed that he had been anxious in recent weeks as negotiators believed there was a “serious misunderstanding” about the terms of the withdrawal agreement. He wrote: “We are now hearing that, unless we agree to the EU’s terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea.” Johnson described the internal market bill as a “legal safety net” to “protect the free flow of goods and services between NI and the rest of the UK”.
After its expected passage through its second reading on Monday, the bill will come before the committee stage on Tuesday and Wednesday but, because of scheduling, Neill’s amendment is unlikely to be voted on in parliament until next week, when there will be a further two days of debate. The opposition is unlikely to overcome the government’s 80-seat majority but provides another headache for Downing Street amid growing discontent among Conservative MPs following a series of high-profile U-turns this year over Covid-19 policy decisions. Former Tory leaders Theresa May and Sir Michael Howard have spoken out against the bill. Neill said he hoped other parties might also support his amendment. Reeves said Labour “would need to look at the detail” of Neill’s amendment before deciding to back it, and that it would be tabling amendments of its own. The Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, and one of the Conservatives backing Neill’s amendment and abstaining on Monday’s vote, said: “This isn’t about a rebellion, this is about advancing the strategies to ensure we don’t lose sight of who we are and what we stand for and that is absolutely critical in these dangerous and changing times. “Britain is one of the founding fathers of modern democracy and international law and at a time when the rules-based order is eroding, we should be seen to defend it rather than undermine it.” The veteran Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale said he would be both voting against the internal market bill and supporting Neill’s amendment. “As far as I’m concerned, there is an international agreement that we signed up to freely and willingly and which we must now honour. End of story,” he said. Meanwhile, there were new calls from Brussels and EU capitals on Sunday for the internal market bill to be dropped. After a phone call with Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, the president of the European council, Charles Michel, tweeted: “Withdrawal agreement to be fully implemented, ensure peace and stability in Ireland and preserve the integrity of single market. Time for UK government to take its responsibilities. International credibility of UK signature at stake.” France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said it would be inconceivable for London to adopt a bill that would partly contradict the agreement ratifying its divorce from the EU."
2020-09-13T15:32:56Z,politics,Politics,Wagner's treaty warning to the Tories,"Further to letters (10 September) regarding the Tories’ disregard for the rule of law, I am reminded of the fate of Wotan and the other Germanic gods as told by Richard Wagner. Wotan the one-eyed, philandering leader, intent upon little else than prestige in his eyes and the eyes of the world, made frequent excursions on Earth. During these wanderings he carried a spear upon which were engraved runic characters spelling out the importance of treaties. His spear was the symbolic guardian of oaths and treaties. When times got tough and difficult decisions had to be made, Wotan was assisted by that master of trickery and deceit, Loge (aka Loki), who encouraged his master’s duplicity in breaking solemn treaties. We know how, eventually, that all went up in flames. I wonder whether Boris Johnson, the proud classicist, is aware of the manifestly parallel paths being trodden by his own cabinet and that of Wotan and his fellow gods? Graham Bould Dereham, Norfolk • So top lawyers are split over the legality of the proposed UK internal market bill (Government’s top legal advisers divided over move to override Brexit deal, 10 September). A case for the supreme court to determine? Gina Miller, who has some experience in this area, wrote presciently before the general election of the dangers of a Boris Johnson victory (Rest assured, Boris Johnson won’t be allowed to ride roughshod over our laws, 20 October 2019). Please come back, Gina, and complete the hat-trick. Your country needs you. Dr Anthony Isaacs London • In Suella Braverman we have an attorney general who seems alarmingly deficient in understanding the respective scope and limits of our constitutional law and international law. Indeed, her paper-thin statement on the government’s legal position on the internal market bill and Northern Ireland protocol suggests either confusion or wilful blindness. This concerns not least the apples-and-oranges distinction between questions surrounding enforcement of international law in our domestic courts and the duty of the state to comply with its international treaty obligations. Crucially, this latter duty is fundamental to the survival of a rules-based international legal order. Mark Stallworthy Swansea"
2020-09-13T14:28:52Z,politics,Politics,"Revealed: ex-MPs use parliament access passes over 2,500 times in a year","A “strategic counsel” for the lobbying firm Crosby Textor is among 324 former MPs who together used grace and favour passes to access the Houses of Parliament more than 2,500 times in a single year. Data released after a significant freedom of information victory by the Guardian reveals how frequently individual former MPs have been using their “category X” parliamentary pass, which grants the bearer continued access to the corridors of power after they step down, along with parliament’s subsidised restaurants and bars. MPs who serve a single parliamentary term are automatically eligible to apply for a pass, but critics argue the system is open to abuse. Commons authorities attempted to prevent the information being released, claiming it would infringe former members’ personal data rights. However, the information commissioner ruled in the Guardian’s favour, determining that the public interest in the material was of such strength that it should override data protection safeguards. The data revealed that Stewart Jackson, the Conservative MP for Peterborough from 2005 to 2017, used his grace and favour pass 82 times in the year from July 2018 to June 2019 – almost one in every two days on which parliament sat in that period. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has worked as a lobbyist since August 2018, first for Crosby Textor as a “strategic counsel” and latterly for his own outfit, Political Insight, as well as being a columnist for The Telegraph. Jackson did not respond to attempts to contact him.
The most prolific returnee was Nick de Bois, the Conservative MP for Enfield North from 2010 to 2015, who visited 84 times. He said he served as Dominic Raab’s chief of staff and later as a volunteer for his campaign to be leader of the Conservative party during the year in question. He was also a radio host during the same period. Phil Woolas, the deputy leader of the Commons at the time the passes were introduced and subsequently a Labour minister, said the reasons for introducing the scheme were purely social. “If you’ve worked for somewhere for 40 years, and you get your gold watch and you get thrown out, it’s quite nice to be able to meet your old mates. It was as simple as that,” he said. “It was just a reason for ex-MPs to meet up and have dinner.” Woolas, who used his pass once, was removed as MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth in 2010 after an electoral court found his campaign had made false allegations that his Liberal Democrat opponent was linked to Islamist extremism. He now works for the consultancy UK Partnerships. He said he had not held a category X pass for several years and did not use it in connection with business purposes.
Ivor Caplin, the Labour MP for Hove from 1997 to 2005 who now runs Ivor Caplin Consultancy, used his grace and favour pass 48 times. A profile on the website of a volunteering charity where Caplin serves as a trustee describes how his consultancy work “has continued to bring him into regular contact with both politicians and officials” in the UK and abroad. However, Caplin said he did not use the pass for his private work, visiting in his capacity as a national spokesman and then chair of the Jewish Labour Movement. “Given the antisemitism crisis in the party at that time I made numerous visits to the house to discuss this with MPs, peers and others, including journalists,” he said. “I do not and never have used the house for the purposes of my business.”
Stephen Dorrell, a health secretary under John Major and now chair of the companies Dorson Group and LaingBuisson, visited 29 times. However, he also denied using his pass for any company business and said in an email that his visits related to his work with the European Movement campaign group. “I attended numerous meetings convened by MPs of all parties who were opposed to Brexit, and keen to link with European Movement grassroots activity,” he wrote. “I also attended occasional meetings in parliament in that period in connection with my role as chair of the NHS Confederation and, in a social capacity, to visit former colleagues who remain friends,” he added.
The Guardian first wrote to the House of Commons requesting information about the use of grace and favour passes in August last year. Citing data protection, the Commons released a list of the numbers of times each pass had been used in a single year, but refused to link each number to a named former MP. Following a complaint by the Guardian, the Information Commissioner’s Office, which regulates freedom of information and data protection regulations, ordered that the information be released and warned that the parliamentary authorities’ current system was so unregulated as to be vulnerable to misuse. The ruling observed that while ministers, MPs, peers, political journalists and parliamentary assistants are required to make transparent their identities and financial interests, ex-MPs with grace and favour passes are not.
“Given that the evidence suggests that several of the passholders are employed by lobbying or public relations companies, there is a legitimate concern about how such passes are used,” it read. “Whilst the commissioner is not aware of any evidence to suggest widespread misuse of the passes, she does consider that the current system is vulnerable to abuse.” Rachel Davies Teka, the head of advocacy at the anti-corruption campaign Transparency International UK, said grace and favour passes threatened the integrity of parliament and should be banned. “Close access to lawmakers is highly valued by those seeking to influence public policy. Using a parliamentary security pass in the course of paid lobbying activity is an abuse of that privilege,” she said. “We cannot see any justification for this entitlement that warrants accepting this risk.” A Commons spokesperson said: “It has been practice for some time to provide Palace of Westminster security identity passes to former members of parliament,” adding that it was forbidden for former MPs to use their passes for lobbying.

2020-09-13T14:00:01Z,politics,Politics,How the Covid crisis is changing minds on Scottish independence,"It was at the height of Scotland’s lockdown that it struck Henry most profoundly that the union was obsolete. A traditional Labour voter in his late 40s from a unionist family, he watched as the disorienting, dumbfounding news of the pandemic scrolled across his TV screen and realised that the bonds of the UK seemed “no longer fit for purpose”. As the crisis progressed, Henry says, he was “appalled by the arrogance of the Westminster elite, in particular the behaviour of Dominic Cummings”. He compares this to the conduct of Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. “I’ve never been a supporter of the SNP or a massive advocate for Sturgeon, but when she appeared on those daily briefings there was an honesty that shone through. I’m not naive, I know how politicians operate, but I felt she showed a down-to-earth empathy.” He also felt Sturgeon, unlike Boris Johnson, was in command of the situation. Henry is no nationalist convert, and indeed he declares it a “certainty” that he would not vote for the SNP in an independent Scotland. But he will now vote for that state to come into being. “And the reason I’d vote yes is because I really feel it’s time we moved on.” In part this is because he feels constitutional matters have dominated the political agenda in Scotland for too long. As a teacher, he knows there are other issues that deserve attention. “But other parties can’t escape the shadow of independence, so let’s see what’s next.” It’s partly bluff-calling, to see what the SNP comes up with when it can no longer blame Westminster. “Independence scares me,” he admits, “but the current political stagnation is worse.” YouGov polling for the Times last month put support for independence at 53%, up two points from January, excluding “don’t knows”, and in August a Panelbase survey for Business for Scotland found 45% answered no to the question “should Scotland be an independent country?”, reversing the result of the 2014 referendum. The rise in support for independence is an old story, quips Sir John Curtice, the veteran analyst and professor of politics at Strathclyde University, before acknowledging that although a four-point lead may not qualify as a surge, this is the first time in Scottish polling history that yes has been consistently ahead over an extended period of time. It may be some way off the convincing proportions that many in the pro-independence camp believe they must secure to avoid Brexit-style division, but it’s nonetheless reportedly caused concern around the Westminster cabinet table. Not least because, as Curtice explains, the character of those who have switched over the past six months is different to those who were prompted to reconsider independence after the 2016 EU referendum. “This is no longer a Brexit story,” he says. After the Brexit vote, there was some counterbalance between Scots who voted remain and then moved from no to yes on independence, and those disenchanted leave voters who abandoned their nationalist sympathies. With so many more remain voters in Scotland, the arithmetic took the country to 50/50 by January, says Curtice. “But since then the increase in support for independence has occurred amongst remain and leave voters.” He explains: “Firstly, coronavirus is the most important public policy that devolution has had to deal with since 1999. Two, there’s an enormous difference in public perception of how well the Scottish and the UK government have been handling it: 70-75% think Nicola Sturgeon is doing brilliantly, it’s almost the opposite for Boris, and crucially this is not just yes voters saying: ‘Nicola walks on water.’ “Three, there are a couple of polls asking: ‘Do you think that the coronavirus would have been handled better or worse if Scotland was an independent country?’ The crucial contrast is only 4% of those who voted yes in 2014 think it would have been handled worse under independence, while 20% of those who voted no say it would have been handled better.” Speaking to those who have changed their minds over the past six months, as well as the activists greeting them at virtual yes hubs, it is striking how often Sturgeon’s daily briefings are mentioned. Last Thursday, the BBC announced it was stopping its live TV broadcasts of the briefings, prompting a furious row and accusations that the corporation was capitulating to unionist demands to halt the “SNP party political broadcasts”.
As Maggie Lennon, from the non-aligned Women for Independence, puts it: “Women who voted no because they felt they weren’t getting enough information, especially on the economy, now have seen a woman prepared to stand up every day and answer questions.” The change in demographic profile of those moving to yes has been ongoing since 2016, says Ailsa Henderson, a professor of political science at Edinburgh University and head of the Scottish Election Study. “Women are over-represented, in particular having voted remain, while the age of yes supporters has crept upwards. Most recent polling found that a third of Labour voters would vote yes.” Henderson points out that the perception that the SNP government is competent is not new, but what is different about the pandemic is that the UK and Scottish government are comparable on exactly the same issue, as events are unfolding. “The policy difference may not be that striking, but the management has been very different.” Likewise, people’s understanding of risk has fundamentally shifted. “Those with a greater appetite for risk were more likely to vote yes in 2014, but if the status quo doesn’t seem to be much of a safe haven, that risk argument can’t be run in a similar way.” For Donald Macpherson, a semi-retired former CEO of a large manufacturing company, living in Edinburgh, the move to yes has been an incremental process. Though his upbringing was “unionist to the core” – his father was an army chaplain – he says he has been “uneasy for some time about the growing gap between Scottish and UK politics”. It is the practical lessons from the pandemic that have consolidated his views on independence. “I do think it has helped me and others to see this is positive proof that independence could work,” he says. “I’m pretty confirmed now. What I’ve seen of how Scotland can cope under pressure has only tipped me further towards independence.” * Some names have been changed • This article was amended on 15 September 2020 to include Sir John Curtice’s title."
2020-09-13T13:36:15Z,politics,Politics,‘A threat to democracy’: how Europe’s media reacted to UK’s plan to renege on Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson’s internal market bill is a “threat to democracy” by a government on an “ideological crusade” that is driving Britain into ever-increasing isolation, while the world “stares on in disbelief”, European media have concluded. “In the space of four short years, the UK has grown from a prominent and respected member of the European Union to an isolated state, angry with its allies and closest trading neighbours – and watched by the world with disbelieving eyes,” said France’s Libération. At the end of a week in which the UK government doubled down on its plans to pass a law “providing for the possibility of violating a binding international treaty” it had itself negotiated and sold to voters as a triumph, the left-leaning daily said the UK had, step by steady step, “sapped the EU27’s confidence and goodwill”. Provocation is not uncommon as sensitive international negotiations reach their conclusion, it said, “but this goes further. It has caused fury, and profound disbelief, abroad,” from Brussels and the other capitals of the EU to Washington.
“Officially, negotiations with the EU on a possible free trade deal continue,” Libération said, “but what will the negotiators now say to each other when there is no progress on the key sticking points – fish, governance, a level playing field? How far will Boris Johnson go? And and for how long?” Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung was equally brutal. What had happened in London this week “was simply not normal”, the paper said. “With his plan to breach the Brexit treaty with the EU, Boris Johnson has shaken the very foundations of British democracy.” Britain’s word was once its bond, the paper said, “but once again, it is evident that this prime minister bends the law for his own ends. He puts his Brexit ideology above the law, just as he did a year ago when he illegally suspended parliament – and only the supreme court could stop him.” Now, the paper said, it is up to that same British parliament to stop Johnson and “show the government who is sovereign. It is incumbent on the women and men gathered there to reject this bill intended to undermine the Brexit treaty. Johnson’s manoeuvre is a threat to democracy.” In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant noted that pacta sunt servanda – the rule that agreements must be kept – was “the oldest principle of international law”, so it was “a deliberate, and hugely far-reaching, step by the Johnson government to table a bill that violates the Northern Ireland provisions in the withdrawal agreement, which is an international treaty”. The EU and the UK, it added, “have little time to reach an agreement that, to a greater or lesser extent, will affect many millions of people. ‘Robust’ language and other antics are all part of the negotiation process, but this latest British move crosses too many lines. “The British voted for Brexit, not for an ideological crusade. Boris Johnson must quickly retrace his steps – and not just because the EU demands it, but because the British national interest demands it.” The French international affairs commentator Pierre Haski pointed out on public radio France Inter that the British government’s latest move was so shocking it had prompted the EU to threaten legal action, “an astonishing first in a saga already far from lacking in plot twists”. The only response possible, Haski said, was “that of the EU27: a unity that has so far withstood all of the tests thrown at it by London, which plainly wants nothing more than division. Plus the certainty that if these talks end in failure, everyone will suffer – but the UK far more than the rest.” Le Monde said the world was left guessing at Johnson’s true intentions, wondering whether he “can really prefer no deal to a compromise on the future relationship. Has he truly pulled the pin out of the grenade by deciding to renege on the divorce agreement and trigger a complete breakdown with Brussels?” Spain’s El Pais said Downing Street clearly had “no intention of dialling down the tension in a standoff that it has itself provoked, insisting that the sovereignty of the British parliament takes precedence over any international treaty”. The paper suggested Johnson had “embraced the flag of sovereignty to camouflage its decision – already taken – that there will be no free trade agreement with the EU”. Its calculations done, No 10 is “confident the ravages caused by Covid-19 will hide the negative economic consequences of a harsh exit from the EU”, it said."
2020-09-13T13:09:53Z,politics,Politics,Heckling of London mayor Sadiq Khan during protest condemned,"A video showing Sadiq Khan being aggressively heckled has attracted widespread condemnation. The mayor of London was abused as he walked back towards his office in City Hall during a protest by London black-cab drivers. During the 54-second clip, Khan can be seen walking away impassively as he is followed by a group shouting abuse at him, swearing and calling him a “hypocrite” and “the destroyer of London”. Khan, the MP for Tooting before succeeding Boris Johnson as London mayor, continues to walk away as the group chase after him. They become increasingly aggressive and goad him to respond using a racial trope. Last year, it was revealed that the Labour politician had to be given round-the-clock police protection after receiving a number of death threats. The measure was taken after City Hall referred 17 cases to the police in a three-month period with a further 237 separate threats made to Khan via social media. In an interview at the time, Khan revealed that the “name-calling, trolling and threats to terrorism” had intensified since the 2016 EU referendum. Khan, a practising Muslim, told the Times magazine: “It can’t be right that one of the consequences of me being the mayor of London and a Muslim in public life is that I have police protection. “The referendum campaign allowed things to come to the surface and normalised things that should not be normalised.” David Lammy, the shadow lord chancellor and Labour MP for Tottenham, condemned the video, which has been viewed 1.3m times. Lammy tweeted: “In what world is it acceptable to speak to anyone like this while doing their job? No one in public or private life deserves this despicable abuse. Solidarity, Sadiq Khan.” Piers Morgan joined in the condemnation, describing the clip as “absolutely repellent”. He said: “Whether you like him or not (I do), Sadiq Khan does not deserve this kind of mindless Neanderthal abuse. Just vile.” Meanwhile, the London borough councillor Khayer Chowdhury, who reported the clip to the Metropolitan police, called for action, saying Khan suffered more abuse than any other politician in the country. “When I see what he has to put up with it makes me feel awful and can understand why it would put anyone off going into public service,” said the Ilford councillor. “Being an Asian politician we face problems on several scales anyway but then to be hounded as you are just walking into work is completely unacceptable.” The clip, which was filmed on Thursday, was taken shortly after protesters had marched across London Bridge towards Bishopsgate holding banners that read “Khan you have blood on your hands” and “Islington residents say NO to forced road closures – we demand to be heard”. A crowd then gathered outside Khan’s office chanting “Khan out”, protesting against the mayor’s green plans to make large areas of London car-free. The Metropolitan police said they were investigating the incident. “We are aware of a video circulating on social media, which appears to show the mayor of London being verbally abused on Thursday 10 September outside City Hall,” a spokesperson said. “We have received an allegation of crime, which is being investigated, and inquiries to assess the circumstances of the incident are ongoing.”"
2020-09-13T10:35:29Z,politics,Politics,Minister says he would resign over Brexit bill if law is broken ‘in way I find unacceptable’,"The UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has said he would resign if the law was “broken in a way that I find unacceptable”, as Downing Street continued to come under pressure over planned legislation that would override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a remarkable scene in the Commons last week that astonished Conservative backbenchers, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted the internal market bill “does break international law in a very specific and limited way”. The publication of the bill on Wednesday, under which key parts of the withdrawal agreement agreed last year with the EU would be negated, has infuriated Brussels and prompted a Tory rebellion. With the bill’s second reading on Monday before a parliament vote, Labour has confirmed it will vote against it in its current form. Buckland, who as justice secretary has taken an oath to uphold the rule of law, faced repeated pressure on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday to say whether he would consider resigning over the bill. The legislation was a “break the glass in emergency provision if we need it”, Buckland claimed.
Pressed on whether he would walk away from the government, he said: “If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then, of course, I will go. We are not at that stage.” Asked again directly if he would resign if the government breaks international law, Buckland said: “What I will be seeking to do, and indeed the government will be seeking to do, is to resolve that conflict as soon as possible.” He added: “I don’t believe we’re going to get to that stage. I know in my mind what I have to do. But the government collectively here also has a responsibility, we’ve got to resolve any conflict, that’s what we will do.” Pressed a further time if he would resign at the point the government actually breaks international law, he said: “I don’t believe we’re going to get to that point and that is why I shall be working very hard to ensure we don’t.” There is growing discontent among Conservative backbenchers over the bill, with senior Tory MP Sir Bob Neill tabling an amendment to impose a parliamentary lock on any changes to the withdrawal agreement. On Friday, Boris Johnson sought to quell signs of a rebellion during a Zoom call with his MPs, telling them that the clauses in the bill were necessary to prevent a foreign power from “breaking up our country”. However, on Sunday, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, dismissed the prime minister’s assertion that the Northern Ireland protocol could be used to break up the UK. “Protocol on IE/NI is not a threat to the integrity of the UK. We agreed this delicate compromise with Boris Johnson and his government in order to protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. We could not have been clearer about the consequences of Brexit,” he tweeted. Barnier also denied the EU is refusing to list the UK as a third country for food imports. “To be listed, we need to know in full what a country’s rules are, including for imports. The same objective process applies to all listed countries,” he said. Speaking on the Marr programme, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, confirmed her party would vote against the internal market bill in its current form as well as urging both the UK and the EU “to stop the posturing and get back to the negotiating table and take this seriously”. She said: “So legislation is needed, a bill is needed, but we would like to see a greater level of collaboration between the nations of the United Kingdom rather than a power grab by Westminster.” Asked if Labour would support Neill’s amendment, she said her party “would need to look at the detail of that amendment” and that it would be tabling amendments of its own as well.
Meanwhile, Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, told the show that a post-Brexit trade agreement was still possible and that a no-deal would represent a failure of politics. “Both the British and Irish economies are going to be damaged significantly and that will be a significant failure of politics not anything else,” he warned. He also dismissed the idea that Brussels would block food deliveries to Northern Ireland, adding: “The British government is behaving in an extraordinary way and British people need to know that, because outside of Britain the reputation of the UK as a trusted negotiating partner is being damaged.”"
2020-09-13T07:35:57Z,politics,Politics,Blair and Major hit out at Boris Johnson's plans to override Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson is facing mounting criticism over his plans to introduce legislation to override his Brexit deal, as former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair criticised the threat to break international law. Major and Blair united to urge MPs to reject the legislation, saying it imperils the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK’s integrity – despite the prime minister saying that Brussels could “carve up our country” without his new bill. The former Conservative and Labour leaders united to condemn Johnson’s UK internal market bill in an article for the Sunday Times. “We both opposed Brexit. We both accept it is now happening. But this way of negotiating, with reason cast aside in pursuit of ideology and cavalier bombast posing as serious diplomacy, is irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice,” they said. “It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal – crucial though they are. It questions the very integrity of our nation.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, accused Johnson of “reigniting old rows” by working to flout his own withdrawal agreement, but pledged Labour support if the prime minister addressed “substantial” concerns about the legislation. He called on Johnson to throw out clauses that could breach international law and those that have led the devolved administrations to warn of a “power grab”. “If the government fixes the substantial cross-party concerns that have been raised about the internal market bill, then we are prepared to back it,” Starmer wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. “But if they do not, and the talk collapse, then it is their failure and incompetence that will have let the British people down.” Tory rebels suggested their numbers were growing and opinions were only hardened by Johnson’s increased rhetoric that the EU could impose a trade border in the Irish Sea. Despite Johnson’s attempts to drum up support, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee, Tobias Ellwood, said on Saturday he could not support the legislation without it being changed. “Already this bill is damaging brand UK, diminishing our role-model status as defender of global standards. As we go to the wire, let’s see more British statecraft - less Nixonian Madman Theory,” he tweeted. The Commons justice committee chairman, Sir Bob Neill, who has tabled an amendment that he said would impose a “parliamentary lock” on any changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he still contended it contained “objectionable” elements. Damian Green, who was Theresa May’s deputy when she was prime minister and is backing the amendment, was also understood to not have been won over by Johnson’s argument. Sir Roger Gale also remained a vehement critic, telling Times Radio: “If anybody is responsible, if it happens, for bringing the union down, it will be [chief aide Dominic] Cummings and Mr Johnson.”"
2020-09-13T07:05:52Z,politics,Politics,"No kicks, coughs or slip-ups as party conferences go online","Utter the phrase “conference season” to a Westminster veteran and don’t be surprised if their initial reaction is a shudder. For regular attendees of the annual party gatherings, which kick off next weekend, they raise the prospect of lengthy policy sermons and curled cheese sandwiches by day, followed by sweaty bars and third-hand gossip by night.
This year, however, any attendees consuming questionable catering and astringent wine will only have themselves to blame, while the boring conversation will be inflicted not by policy wonks, but their immediate family. When the 2020 season starts, Westminster’s strange autumn tradition will decamp not to a seaside resort or city conference centre, but online. The queues will relocate from the bars to the virtual tech help-desks. For some regulars, the list of conference traditions that will not be missed roll easily off the tongue. “Terrible food that’s incredibly expensive, meaning you have to search the fringe agenda for places putting on free grub,” suggests the former Downing Street adviser and Lib Dem strategist Sean Kemp. “Being confronted with mobile phone recordings of MPs saying bizarre things to rooms made up almost entirely of journalists waiting for them to say something daft; the odd smell of the conference hotel bar by day three; accompanying an MP on an early morning media round when you’ve only had an hour’s sleep – and having to explain to journalists why charging them huge sums of money for the rent of a wooden table and a plug is totally justifiable.”
For the parties, the online switch has come as a mixed blessing. The prospects of being stuck talking to dubious lobbyists or dealing with an incendiary fringe event have reduced, but parties are facing a financial hit from the cancellation of a physical meeting – as are the thinktanks and political magazines who target the events as a money spinner. Labour insiders have not disguised the fact that the loss of conference income, which is said to run well into six figures, will be a significant hit. Labour, first up with its virtual offering this year, has turned its conference into an event much more focused on party training. Its gathering, rebranded as Connected, is focusing on training members, explaining how to run as a councillor and the art of deploying social media in campaigning. It will be interspersed with the usual shadow cabinet speeches and, handily for the new leader, potentially tricky votes on policy and party rule issues have been jettisoned. The party is retaining one conference tradition. The leader’s speech, the first delivered by Keir Starmer, is planned as a major moment that will allow him to make his first major address to the country, broadcast live on television as usual. Starmer is planning to give the speech in a key marginal seat. Locations in the so-called “red wall”, where the Tories made historic gains in the 2019 election, are being looked at.
Despite the scaled-down conference, policy work is already under way behind the scenes on how Labour’s next manifesto will be constructed. Starmer has ordered a “triple tick” system, ensuring that all policies are tested against their impact on spending, safeguarding the union and reducing carbon emissions. An examination of spending commitments is already being carried out by MP Bridget Phillipson. Matthew Pennycook, the shadow minister for climate change, is now marking all policies with “a green pen”. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems are trying to retain as much of the usual conference as possible, with all the normal votes and motions that ensure an embarrassing if predictable defeat for the leadership. Key debates are planned on a universal basic income and Europe, and members can apply to speak using an “electronic speaker’s card”. The Tories will attempt to ensure the party does not miss out on the financial boost provided by their conference, offering virtual stalls in an online exhibition hall for prices ranging from £6,000 to more than £25,000 plus VAT. Exhibitors are promised benefits including “ministerial virtual visits from senior members of cabinet” and a “brandable, dedicated interactive stand”. Other political players are also trying to make the most of the virtual format. The Spectator magazine, whose party is usually the hottest ticket in town at the Tory conference, is holding its own virtual conference later this month, complete with cabinet minister interviews and sponsored sessions. KEY CONFERENCE MOMENTS Kinnock takes on Militant Neil Kinnock gave perhaps the most famous leader’s speech in 1985, as he denounced “the grotesque chaos of a Labour council” in Liverpool being swayed by the hard left Militant group. Heckler ejected In 2005, a New Labour government already under pressure over its attitude to civil liberties did itself no favours when Walter Wolfgang, an elderly Labour party member, was ejected for shouting “rubbish” during a speech by Jack Straw. The no notes speech David Cameron went from rank outsider to dead cert after his 2005 conference speech, setting out why he should be Tory leader. His roaming, teleprompter-free speech caught the imagination of Tory members and set something of a trend. The 3.15am briefing On the last night of the 2008 Labour conference, Downing Street spinner Damian McBride gathered journalists in the bar of the Midland hotel in Manchester to confirm that cabinet minister Ruth Kelly was to quit. May loses her voice The 2017 conference witnessed the stuff of nightmares for any politician, let alone a leader. Theresa May struggled through what was billed as a make-or-break conference speech after losing her voice and having a coughing fit."
2020-09-13T07:02:52Z,politics,Politics,Peers call on Jenrick  to explain opposition to smoke-free zones,"The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, is under cross-party pressure to explain why he opposed smoking bans for pavement areas outside pubs and restaurants, echoing arguments made by tobacco companies. The government recently introduced a law allowing hospitality venues to expand onto pavements, to help them boost capacity amid social-distancing restrictions. Councils were given a discretion as to whether these would be smoke-free zones. Jenrick wrote to Manchester City Council warning that “if smoking were banned outside pubs and cafes, as you suggest it will be in Manchester, it could lead to significant closures across the country”. A group of cross-party peers led by Tory Lord Young has asked to see evidence to back up Jenrick’s claim. Young, along with Baroness Northover, Baroness Finlay of Llandaff and Lord Faulkner of Worcester, have written to Jenrick asking him to “share any evidence he has to substantiate the assertion that there would be adverse economic consequences if 100% smoke-free conditions were imposed”. The peers said: “The evidence from the UK and other jurisdictions ... does not show this to be the case. It is difficult to see why, given the option to extend premises to include the pavement, any licensee would prefer to close. Nevertheless, the tobacco industry, which clearly has an interest here, does make this argument.” A spokesman for the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association said that it welcomed Jenrick’s intervention but denied lobbying him on the issue. “An extended ban will only result in piling further pressure on many small businesses who are struggling in the face of Covid-19,” the spokesman said.
Arguments against tobacco restrictions have been made by the Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA), a thinktank that pushes an anti-regulation agenda. It has a number of affiliates and takes money from British American Tobacco, which is listed as a member of the institute in the EU transparency register. The IEA, which last year hosted an event for Jenrick at the Tory party conference, has also accepted money from tobacco giants JTI, Philip Morris International and Imperial Brands. In an emailed response to questions from the Observer about whether Jenrick or any of his staff had been briefed by the IEA or its affiliates, a spokeswoman for the thinktank said: “Many people are ‘affiliated’ with our organisation. One of the long list of people affiliated with the IEA may or may not have had ‘communication, via voice or email or in person’, be it private or in public, with ‘any member of Mr Jenrick’s department’ his special advisers and/or himself regarding the impact upon the pub and restaurant trade if councils were to make pavements smoke-free zones.” A spokesman for Jenrick said that the minister had not met, or received a briefing from, the IEA. “To suggest otherwise is a total fabrication,” the spokesman said. “The spur for the letter was a report in a local newspaper – the government values local newspapers and regularly monitors such local news reporting. Our motivation was, and remains, to protect hospitality businesses impacted by the pandemic and save people’s jobs.” Young was told by the communities minister, Lord Greenhalgh, that guidance to councils over pavement licensing was issued jointly with the Department of Health and Social Care. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said: “Lord Young and his cross-party colleagues wrote to the communities secretary pointing out that his letter to Manchester amounts to guidance and Parliament was told guidance would be joint with the Department of Health. They asked two simple questions: did the minister clear the letter with health colleagues before sending it, and what evidence did he have for his claims?” In June, Labour reported Jenrick to parliament’s watchdog over his role in a controversial planning decision, now quashed, that benefited the Conservative donor, Richard Desmond. At the time, a spokesman for Jenrick described the referal as “unfounded, spurious and vexatious”. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Desmond."
2020-09-13T06:19:54Z,politics,Politics,"Theresa May, Michael Howard, Norman Lamont: the new Tory awkward squad","Normally, rebels in any political party can be identified fairly easily. They will have acquired a reputation for stepping out of line. As a result, most will not have risen far up the ladder. But the government’s recent behaviour on Brexit and coronavirus has turned people who are normally loyal, including John Major and two other former party leaders, into critics of Boris Johnson. This week some surprising names joined the Tory awkward squad… Theresa May (MP for Maidenhead) Boris Johnson’s predecessor as Conservative leader has observed a dignified, if at times strained, loyalty to him since stepping aside last summer. But having battled to secure a Brexit deal herself, she was furious at Johnson’s willingness to trample on an agreement he himself had signed. Evidently furious, she told the Commons on Tuesday: “This parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation. The government is now changing that agreement. Given that, how can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?” Michael Howard (Tory peer) Also a former party leader and home secretary, Howard is a lawyer and one of the most hardline of the Brexiters. But even he rebelled when he heard that the government was ready to break international law. Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Howard said he could not believe what he was hearing. He asked peers: “How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?” Sir Charles Walker (MP for Broxbourne)
Walker is vice-chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers and as such has the ear of the prime minister and whips. He counts himself as a Johnson loyalist but has attacked the government in recent weeks for its string of U-turns on coronavirus and exams – and then on Wednesday said he could not vote for anything that meant the UK was breaking international law. He is worried that Tory MPs will not be able to defend the government’s actions to their constituents. Sir Robert Neill (MP for Bromley and Chiselhurst)
A prominent Remainer, Neill, chairman of the all-party justice select committee, extracted the admission on Tuesday from Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the government was planning to break international law. On Friday, Neill tabled a rebel amendment to the internal market bill that will have its second reading on Monday. If passed, which is unlikely so early in its parliamentary life, it will scupper the Johnson plan and give parliament a veto. Norman Lamont (Tory peer and former chancellor) Like Howard, Lamont is a hardline Brexiter. Also like Howard, he does not back breaking the law. He too made his views very clear on Thursday. “I think the government are in a terrible mess and in a hole and I don’t think it is easy to justify,” he told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme. Tobias Ellwood (MP for Bournemouth East)
Ellwood is chairman of the defence select committee and a strong Remainer. In March 2017 during a terrorist attack at the House of Commons, the former army officer gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to PC Keith Palmer who later died of his injuries. On breaking international law he suggested that the government had lost its moral compass: “We are all trying to get a trade deal over the line, but in the process we risk losing sight of who we are and the values we uphold.” Tom Tugendhat (MP for Tonbridge and Malling)
Tugendhat chairs the powerful select committee on foreign affairs. He said that breaking international law would harm Britain’s economy, as well as the UK abroad. “Our entire economy is based on the perception that people have of the UK’s adherence to the rule of law. I hope it’s clear where I stand on that.” Sir Desmond Swayne (MP for New Forest West)
A parliamentary private secretary to David Cameron when he was Tory leader, Swayne has become fiercely critical of the way Covid-19 restrictions are imposed without debate in parliament. “What remedy is there for those of us who enthusiastically support the prime minister but nevertheless want to restrain the government’s ability to govern by order without debate?” he asked on Wednesday, adding that ministers should hang their heads in shame."
2020-09-13T06:18:35Z,politics,Politics,Covid confusion and Brexit betrayals: is this any way to run Britain?,"Late on Wednesday afternoon Boris Johnson addressed the nation from Downing Street, flanked by Union Jacks. It was a familiar scene, but he had a new, serious message. Coronavirus cases were rising fast across the UK, doubling every seven days. Public health officials from all corners of the country had reported horrifying rises, particularly among the young. Schools had re-opened in England ten days earlier. The government was urging people back to work. And university campuses were beginning to fill up for the new academic year. Ministers and Public Health England knew that within days, Covid-19 cases could be rising much faster still and that hospital admissions could soon be on a rapid upward curve, as they already were in France and Spain. The Prime Minister had been stung by accusations that he had acted too late to prepare the country and curb the spread of the virus back in March, and he would not allow such criticism to be made again. New limits would be introduced on the size of gatherings, and the full force of the law would be used to enforce them. “In England from Monday we are introducing the rule of six,” he said. “You must not meet socially in groups of more than six and if you do you will be breaking the law.” Those who disobeyed the orders, he added, could be fined or even arrested. But Tory MPs were anxious and many parliamentarians in both the Commons and Lords saw great irony in this Prime Minister’s insistence on complying with rules. Other MPs were fuming that they had not been allowed to debate the new Covid restrictions, about which the media had been informed first. They felt ignored and overlooked as well as worried. One senior Tory MP, Desmond Swayne, had risen in the Chamber earlier on Wednesday to complain that bypassing parliament was completely unacceptable in a crisis like this – a view shared by a clearly incensed Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. What could possibly be done “to restrain the Government’s ability to govern by order without debate?” Swayne asked. The spike in Covid-19 cases was not, however, the only crisis besetting Johnson, his ministers, the Tory Party and the country, as he rose to speak. The week past has been one during which two huge but unrelated problems have coincided, intersected and fed off one another.
The other concerned Brexit, which has shot back to the top of the agenda as the end of the transition period on December 31 approaches. After four and a half years of often fruitless post referendum negotiations with Brussels, they resumed on Monday amid talk of deadlock and the rising likelihood of an economically disastrous No Deal outcome. Behind the scenes in Downing Street, however, the three prime Tory movers behind Brexit, Johnson, his most senior aide Dominic Cummings and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove had hatched a new plan, a gambit that would see the UK break with parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that Johnson had signed so enthusiastically back in January (he had described it then as a “fantastic moment”). There were problems, they had belatedly realised, that related to provisions in the Northern Irish Protocol which could impede the free movement of goods across the Irish sea. Reading from a written note, which proved his words had been prepared, approved and cleared at the top, the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis stunned the Commons on Tuesday, admitting that ministers would use the internal market bill, which has its second reading in the Commons tomorrow to make the changes, which were so important that they would be required to break the law to put things right. “Yes, this does break international law in a very specific and limited way,” Lewis said. “We’re taking the powers to disapply the EU law concept of direct effect … in a certain very tightly defined circumstance.” With a second coronavirus wave approaching and the Covid 19 testing system under terrible strain just when it was needed most, was this an attempt to rally and distract the country in a new patriotic anti-European venture? If so it backfired terribly. In an already restive Westminster, and in Brussels, Berlin, Dublin and Washington, Johnson’s actions were met with disbelief. The Prime Minister was asking people to comply with the law at home, but was himself trashing it abroad. Three former Tory leaders John Major, Theresa May and Michael Howard went public, questioning whether the UK’s word would ever be trusted again on the world stage. Howard, the most ardent of eurosceptic grandees, rose in the Lords to ask: “How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?” Tory Brexiters were making common cause with Tory Remainers for the first time in decades. Jonathan Jones, the head of the Whitehall legal department, promptly quit in protest. Former Treasury permanent secretary Lord Nick Macpherson echoed concerns across Whitehall saying that “for anybody who cares about the rule of law, this is deeply disturbing. ” Commentators from left, right and centre questioned how any government could behave in such a way. Alex Thomas, a former civil servant and now the Institute for Government’s programme director said: “If reports as to why Jonathan Jones has resigned are true there are HUGE questions for the Attorney General and Lord Chancellor. Will they try to draw a different line on the law?” One senior MP on the 1922 committee, himself a committed Brexiteer, said he would vote against the internal market Bill which ministers will introduce to the Commons tomorrow to try to effect the changes. Tory MPs warned that there could be a large rebellion with dozens abstaining before a bigger crisis erupts later in the Bill’s parliamentary passage. “There is no way I can support breaking international law. If someone like Michael Howard, the grandfather of euroscepticism, speaks out, then that means something is not right here,” said another senior Tory. “This is ministers of the crown saying they don’t respect the law. That is not something I can defend to my constituents.” Senior Labour officials said privately that they believed that Johnson was deliberately trying to wreck the formal talks process. “I think he wants that to fail so it comes down to political leaders, so he and Merkel have to sort it out.” This weekend the row is not abating. On Friday evening Johnson held a chaotic zoom meeting with Tory MPs, but his connection failed mid-way through and Michael Fabricant filled a ten minute pause by singing Rule Brittania. Before the technical glitch cut him off Johnson said what he was doing with the internal market bill was a “total no brainer”. It was “vital to protecting the integrity of our country.” Action to over-ride the existing agreement with the EU was “vital if we want to prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country.”
In an article in the Daily Telegraph yesterday Johnson upped the ante further, accusing the EU of wanting to impose “a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea” that could stop the transport of food from Britain to Northern Ireland. But the Conservative MP Sir Bob Neill, who has tabled an amendment to the Bill to give parliament a veto over the plan, said he was not reassured and neither were plenty of others. If this was a problem now, why had Johnson and Gove not spotted it before before signing off on the deal with the EU months ago? Abroad the damage had been done. Despite daily contacts between UK and EU teams in Whitehall and Brussels over the summer, news of Johnson’s Brexit gambit came as a shock when it first reached the Belgian capital on Sunday evening. “Word came about a Financial Times story and we just waited for shit to hit the fan”, said one source. “There wasn’t any notice at all. We knew where the UK had concerns. We knew there was a bill coming up. But we didn’t think there would be anything in it to concern us. They didn’t tell us anything.” The withdrawal agreement had been tortuously put together. The Northern Ireland protocol, keeping the province in the EU’s single market and putting a customs border in the Irish sea, had been grudgingly accepted by Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, the agreement’s most vociferous critic, in the wake of Johnson’s thumping win at last December’s general election. “Why would you stir all that up now?”, asked one EU diplomat as the bill was published on Wednesday. When the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič, a Slovak, met Michael Gove in London for emergency talks mid week he set the UK government a three week deadline to remove the contentious parts of the internal market bill. “Gove was unrepentant”, said one source. “But if those parts of the bill that break international law are still there in October there won’t be a deal”, predicted an official in Brussels. There were threats of legal action from Brussels. “We haven’t a clue what their (the UK’s) strategy is and that is probably what they are hoping. But it might also be that they don’t know yet. And that’s the biggest worry,” added a source. The trade and security negotiations continue next week with Brussels determined not to be the ones to walk out. “Both sides are extremely polite and they did their work last week well considering that someone had effectively set fire to the building”, said another EU official. “But the three week deadline stands. People say that state aid and fisheries are the biggest stumbling blocks to a deal. It isn’t. It is trust. “And we have seen how far we can trust the British government”. Germany’s ambassador to the UK Andreas Michaelis also broke with the normal restrained diplomatic language used by his country. “In more than 30 years as a diplomat I have not experienced such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation”, he said. “ If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don’t accept it.”
Inside the Irish government there was equal dismay – but hope that it would all turn out to be bluff. The Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, vented Ireland’s “very strong concerns” in a 30-minute call with Johnson on Wednesday. “This is no way to behave in terms of international relations,” said Martin. If trade talks between London and Brussels collapse Ireland’s economy will take a big hit, with significant tariffs on many Irish exports to the UK. The other concern is the border and Northern Ireland. The foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said Northern Ireland was “too fragile” to be used as a pawn. “I would caution anyone who is thinking about playing politics with Northern Ireland on Brexit.” Meanwhile in Washington Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, said there would be “absolutely no chance” of a US-UK trade deal passing through Congress if the Good Friday Agreement was undermined by the row. “If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress,” Ms Pelosi added. “The Good Friday Agreement is treasured by the American people and will be proudly defended in the United States Congress.” Jon Sopel, the BBC’s Washington correspondent summed up the bemusement there. “I cannot exaggerate the bewilderment in Washington over what UK government is doing over #GoodFridayAgreement. Why, a senior official asked me, is Britain doing something that will lead to a no deal Brexit, and result in no trade deal with the US either?” ONLY a few weeks ago, when Covid-19 numbers were falling, the Prime Minister had expressed his hope in a bullish Downing statement that if all went according to plan the country could be returning to something close to pre-Covid normality before Christmas. With a Brexit deal done by then, the UK and its economy would be able to move forward. Post Brexit and post Covid 19 Britain would become Global Britain. But as has so often been the case with this government, when dealing with both the pandemic and the UK’s exit from the EU, false hopes had been raised, only for harsher, colder realities to bite. Now, the way Boris Johnson is conducting the whole process of government at home and abroad is compounding the nation’s problems. Back in January when the Prime Minister signed the Withdrawal Agreement he was full of optimism. “We can now move forward as one country - with a government focused upon delivering better public services, greater opportunity and unleashing the potential of every corner of our brilliant UK, while building a strong new relationship with the EU as friends and sovereign equals.”
Nine months on, as he implores people to obey new rules on Covid-19, yet himself disregards international law, faith in his ability to deliver on those heady objectives is being questioned more than ever - not just at home but across the world."
2020-09-13T06:00:51Z,politics,Politics,A Japan trade deal is little consolation if Britain is locked out of the EU,"There was a consistent message from business leaders to international trade secretary Liz Truss’s claims that she had signed a “historic” deal with Japan to lower tariffs and gain access to previously restricted markets. Thank you, they said, but could you please sign a deal with the EU because that is our most important export market. Truss is not a minister to be moved by such demands. The former chief secretary to the Treasury has a mission to bolt together as many trade deals with non-EU countries as she can while No 10 takes on the task of signing a comprehensive agreement with Brussels. Officials at the signing ceremony with Japan confirmed that the deal was expected to boost UK trade with the world’s third-largest economy by an estimated £15.2bn, though there was no date by which this figure would be achieved. It would also add only 0.07% to UK gross domestic product, which compares with forecasts by government economists of a 5% loss of GDP from leaving the EU customs union and single market. No wonder Mike Hawes, the boss of car lobby group the SMMT, and Adam Marshall, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, were quick to point out that a deal with the EU was far more important. Truss was undaunted, though her attempts so far to sign other significant deals, and especially with the US, have proved fruitless. Under normal circumstances, a deal with the US is not a priority. It might be the largest economy in the world and the single largest destination for UK goods and services exports outside the EU, but it is an open market characterised by low import tariffs. That was the situation until Donald Trump began his bruising battle with China over what he claimed were trade barriers damaging to US companies. In the last couple of years this trade war has expanded to take in the EU. Importantly for Truss, the UK has been one of the biggest losers. In particular, single malt Scotch whisky has suffered from a 25% import tariff, pricing it out of the US market.
Truss needs to win over the US to push trade tariffs back down to more normal levels, or better still to zero. However, there is a high price to be paid for favours in Washington. Farmers are an especially powerful lobby group in the US and want full access to foreign markets as the price of any trade deal. They expect Congress to abide by this maxim, and it usually does. Before the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal that included Australia, Vietnam and Japan, Washington had extracted concessions for US beef and other farm produce that were effectively banned in many TPP countries up to that point. The former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who last week officially joined Truss’s advisory board, has long wrestled with criticism that his determination to sign trade deals meant that many domestic industries were thrown overboard, including agriculture and manufacturing. Truss is under pressure to protect UK agriculture from being steamrollered by cheap US produce. If she is to uphold farming standards – ones that would allow the continued export of livestock and food to the EU – Truss must not lower UK rules in order to give access to industrial-scale farmers in the US who use growth hormones on their beef and chlorine washes on their chicken. Whether to comply with the US or the EU rules is not a question that troubles business leaders. It is the EU every time. This makes sense when you consider the numbers. If you include services industries, imports and exports between Britain and the EU were worth a total of £672.5bn last year, more than 20 times the value of UK-Japan trade and three times the £200bn sent back and forth to the US. A deal with the EU will be the historic prize. A woman has got to the top of Wall St. But others still face a climb The appointment this week of the first female leader of a Wall Street bank was greeted with a roar of approval. Jane Fraser, the Scottish-American banker from St Andrews who will lead Citi, is “a pioneer”, declared David Solomon over at Goldman Sachs. It is indeed a landmark moment. But, now that a breakthrough has finally happened on Wall Street, a bastion of corporate maleness, should we expect a rush of female appointments? Don’t bet a cent on it. That hasn’t been the wider experience in the US or the UK. The first woman to become chief executive of a FTSE 100 company was Dame Marjorie Scardino in 1997, and her appointment at Pearson was similarly hailed as groundbreaking. Almost a quarter of a century later, one can say the predicted rush of female FTSE bosses was a trickle. The highest number within the 100-strong club at any one time has been seven. Within banking, the first female chief executive of a UK top-four firm was Alison Rose at NatWest Group, appointed as recently as last year. It’s true that the UK’s top boardrooms overall have become less male over the years. A third of board positions at FTSE 100 companies are held by women, the Hampton-Alexander Review found this year. Yet the review also highlighted a “concerning lack of female representation in senior leadership and key executive roles” in FTSE 350 companies: only 15 female finance directors among FTSE 100 firms, for example. In the US, the picture is similar: progress, but painfully slow. Only 31 women lead S&P 500 firms. On Wall Street, there are two men for every woman on banks’ operating committees, according to Bloomberg. Fraser’s success is a personal triumph, but the corporate world has not undergone a revolution. Rio resignations signal the end for profit without accountability When Rio Tinto announced last week that its chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, would be stepping down, it marked a new low for the mining giant – but potentially also an inflection point in corporate accountability. Jacques resigned, alongside two other senior bosses, after investors lined up to condemn the company’s leadership for overseeing the destruction of an Australian heritage site of importance to Indigenous communities. The world’s biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia, after blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, which held irreplaceable artefacts. The executive clearout was by “mutual agreement”, according to a statement, but it should send a clear signal to others culpable for environmental destruction in the pursuit of corporate profit. Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) may once have been regarded as a box-ticking exercise for company executives, but growing public intolerance of shoddy ESG standards can no longer be ignored. Investors, too, are unwilling to turn a blind eye to poor practice. If the 2015 Samarco dam disaster, which resulted from a joint venture between miners BHP Billiton and Vale, had happened today it is difficult to imagine that executives would be let off as lightly as they were at the time. The dam’s collapse left 19 dead, hundreds homeless and is considered the single worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. For Andrew Mackenzie, BHP’s then boss, it meant sacrificing a short-term bonus, even though hundreds living near the dam are still without homes. The past loss of life and natural heritage at the hands of mining companies can never be replaced. But the swift condemnation of reckless corporate greed today could help safeguard the future."
2020-09-12T20:00:39Z,politics,Politics,Top lawyers slam Suella Braverman for wrecking UK’s reputation,"The attorney general, Suella Braverman, was on Saturday accused of sacrificing the UK’s reputation, sidelining legal advisers and bypassing the ministerial code during an extraordinary confrontation with some of the country’s top lawyers. During the annual general meeting of the Bar Council, the professional association for barristers, Braverman was asked how Britain could retain “a shred of credibility” in imploring other countries to follow international law after revealing its own willingness to breach agreements. The criticisms came after the government last week unveiled plans to give ministers sweeping powers to “disapply” part of the Brexit deal that Boris Johnson signed in January. Five QCs confronted the attorney general during Saturday’s meeting, telling her that a crime which broke the law in a “specific and limited way” – the phrase used by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, when he announced the move – was still a crime.
The attacks came as Boris Johnson faced a growing rebellion over the explosive proposals in the internal market bill, with more senior Tories suggesting they could not support provisions that ministers admit breach international law. Former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair jointly condemned the Brexit legislation as imperilling the Irish peace process, trade negotiations and the UK’s integrity. “It puts the Good Friday agreement at risk, because it negates the predictability, political stability and legal clarity that are integral to the delicate balance between the north and south of Ireland that is at the core of the peace process,” they wrote in the Sunday Times. “This has wide-ranging ramifications. It will not only make negotiation with the EU more difficult, but also any trade negotiations with other nations, including the United States. Once trust is undermined, distrust becomes prevalent.” They said that while they had opposed Brexit, they accepted it was happening, and this approach was “wrong in principle and dangerous in practice”. Some critics are imploring Theresa May to take the lead in opposing the plans, to be debated in the Commons this week. One former minister said there was “exasperation” among Tories and that “the mood had changed”, even among some pro-Brexit new MPs. Asked if she believed ministers were breaking the ministerial code with the legislation, Braverman on Saturday dodged the question by stating that the code was not legally enforceable. Pressed, she suggested the cabinet secretary had ruled that the code would not be breached. She was also confronted over why she had sought advice on the measures from three pro-Brexit legal figures, including one junior barrister who had worked with the Vote Leave campaign, rather than relying on senior government lawyers. She refused to disclose the advice she had received, but said that seeking external opinions was not unusual.
Braverman was asked what had changed since former justice minister Lord Faulks stated in 2015 that ministers would not breach international law. She said his statement reflected “government policy at the time”. The proposals were needed to resolve tensions between domestic and international law created by the EU withdrawal agreement, she said, but the government remained “committed to the rule of law”. The new measures are designed to ensure that in the event of a no-deal outcome, no checks are needed when goods travel from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and that the UK can set its own state aid rules. However, they breach the EU withdrawal agreement. The EU has made clear that there can be no future trade deal should the UK press on with the measures. Olaf Scholz, the German finance minister, said on Saturday that a no-deal Brexit would hurt the British economy far more than the EU. “Europe would be able to deal with it and there would be no particularly serious consequences after the preparations we have already made,” he said. Tory concerns were mounting over the new legislation this weekend. A significant rebellion would be needed to overturn the government’s 80-strong majority, but potential rebels are hoping that May will lead the charge. She is said to be away from the Commons for the first vote on the plans on Monday, when many Tory MPs are likely to at least withhold their support. However, key votes could yet happen next week. Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said: “The EU is behaving extremely badly in these negotiations. It is quite extraordinary that they appeared willing to offer Theresa May a Canada-style deal which they are now not prepared to offer Boris Johnson. However, while the [internal market] bill overall is important and right, I think it will be extremely difficult to vote for provisions which quite specifically seek to breach international law.” Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the defence select committee, also said he could not vote for the measures unamended. “Already this bill is damaging brand UK, diminishing our role-model status as defender of global standards. As we go to the wire, let’s see more British statecraft – less Nixonian madman theory,” he tweeted. Senior MPs said they still believed a serious rebellion could break out in the Commons if provisions in the internal market bill were rejected by the House of Lords. One leading backbencher said there could be early support for an amendment to give parliament a veto, tabled by the Tory chair of the justice select committee, Sir Bob Neill: “I think there will be some votes against at second reading but some will also abstain. Others may vote for a second reading then reconsider and vote for amendments later if ministers do not back off. If the Lords reject it and the government does not give way, I think it could lose in the Commons on this very important issue.”
In an Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday, 46% of all voters say it is “unacceptable” for the government to break international law, against 33% who say it’s acceptable. Among people who voted remain in 2016, 67% say it is unacceptable and 21% acceptable. Among leavers, fewer than half (45%) think it is acceptable while 31% believe it unacceptable. The poll puts the Tories on 42% (up two on a fortnight ago) with a three-point lead over Labour on 39% (down one), and shows 52% now believe the UK will leave the EU without a deal; 50% believe this would be bad for the economy."
2020-09-12T17:36:08Z,politics,Politics,"Labour left must work with Starmer or risk ‘return to tomb’, says Corbyn adviser","Labour’s left must work constructively with Keir Starmer and resist the temptation to go “back in our sealed tomb”, Jeremy Corbyn’s former policy chief has warned, amid a growing split on the left over how to respond to the new leader. Andrew Fisher, a key figure during Corbyn’s leadership, acknowledged doubts within the left over Starmer’s sincerity in endorsing a series of policies drawn up during the Corbyn era. However, he said it was the responsibility of senior figures within the party’s left to reassure new members that Corbyn’s replacement would not lead to their marginalisation. A debate is already under way over how the left should respond, with other senior figures calling on the left wing to have a plan to gain control within the party once again when opportunities arise. Others are watching and waiting. Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s former chief of staff, told the Observer that dissent could quickly grow if Starmer ignored the concerns of the left.
Fisher said Starmer’s 10 leadership election pledges, which included commitments on abolishing tuition fees, taxing the wealthy and public ownership, was “still basically our policy programme”. He added: “There’s the kind of people like me, members for 20-odd years – or 40-odd years for people of Jeremy and John McDonnell’s generation – who need to be careful not to go back to shouting from the sidelines, thinking, ‘We’re back in our sealed tomb, we’re not in the shadow cabinet. We’re not on the front bench. We’re not relevant. We’re hated by the leadership’. “We’re not in that situation. You can clearly see some people think that is the default setting, so we should go back to that. I think that’s a miscalculation. “The left has got to build an alliance with that centre-left of the party that voted for Starmer – and a lot of Corbyn supporters who voted for Starmer – to defend that kind of programme. That’s the sort of constructive role we’ve got to play.” Fisher’s intervention echoes that of former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who received some criticism within the left after saying Starmer had gauged his response to the government’s handling of Covid-19 “exactly right”. He added that he believed Starmer was a socialist. However, others who worked within the Corbyn regime say the left must acknowledge it has already lost influence over the party’s direction and be more forthright in its dealings with Starmer and his team. “Some are now saying, ‘don’t worry, it’s fine. We’ve shifted the conversation to the left. Starmer isn’t as bad as Tony Blair. We’ve still got the 10 pledges’,” said one former frontbench adviser. “I think that’s the most dangerous line the left could take. We need to own the fact we’ve lost the party, and have a plan to win it back. “I don’t mean we should be launching a leadership challenge. That’s ridiculous. But the campaign group has been very quiet and there is no leadership.” Among the most combative in public so far has been Howard Beckett, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) and potentially the next leader of the hugely powerful Unite union.
Work is already under way to unify various factions of the left into a more coherent group, to ensure that the gains under Corbyn are not allowed to evaporate under Starmer. One of the figures coordinating the efforts is Murphy, who had huge influence during his leadership. She said a choice between cooperation or opposition to the Starmer regime was “too binary”, but said Starmer had let Corbyn down at times and that the left did need to hold the new leader to account. “Did Keir wrap himself in the Corbyn flag to appear popular to the membership? Well, he was running a campaign. So of course, there would be an element of that,” she said. “But my view is that he also believes in it. That doesn’t mean to say that the membership or the left should just entrust everything to Keir, because he’s going to come under pressure from the right wing of the Labour party, parliament and the Tories. Keir is an honourable man, a likable person. But is it the responsibility of the left to ensure he’s held to account? Of course it is, and he would welcome that accountability. “It’s up to him to act responsibly. I don’t think he’s always acted responsibly in the past, but that’s a personal view. Is Howard Beckett correct to call out and hold him to account? Absolutely, that’s what he is on the NEC for. And if it continues to happen, then Howard will not be a lone voice in that. Other people will criticise him and that division will grow.
“I’m part of a left group who wants to work with Keir Starmer for the greater good of the working class. We’re not meeting to devise a mechanism the way that others did – an anaconda strategy – to strangle the leadership. It’s completely the reverse. We want to engage in a positive platform on workers’ rights, ensuring that the 10 pledges he stood on are translated into reality.” Efforts to co-ordinate a major gathering of the left are still under way, though they have been disrupted by the pandemic. A Unite insider said: “There have been some very active discussions over the summer with key people on the left and it is clear there is an appetite to work together to help Labour back into power. “When conditions allow, there will be an event that brings us together. That’s clearly not possible now, but it is great to see the enthusiasm for ensuring Labour stands for a better, fairer Britain and that Keir’s 10-point electoral platform is delivered.”"
2020-09-12T13:54:15Z,politics,Politics,Richard Leonard survives as Scottish Labour leader,"A rebellion by Scottish Labour’s centrists aimed at toppling their party leader, Richard Leonard, has collapsed after they failed to force through a motion of no confidence in his leadership. The rebels withdrew their motion at the party’s Scottish executive committee (SEC) meeting on Saturday after failing to gain enough support to win amid last-minute manoeuvring by party officials. There were accusations of dirty tricks from the rebels when, an hour before the SEC meeting began, party officials deselected an executive member, Cooperative and Socialist Societies representative Jane Prinsley, on the grounds an organisation which nominated her group was no longer affiliated with the party. Several sources said that was likely to leave the final result tied so the GMB and Usdaw, two influential unions that had previously backed and financed Leonard, decided to abstain.
One union source said the outcome was an “absolute farce. They have had a botched coup about a lame duck leader. They hardly look like a party of government in waiting. Leonard is presiding over the final death throes of the Scottish Labour party.” In a statement issued as the motion was withdrawn, Leonard insisted he was still the best person to lead Scottish Labour, support for which has slumped to as low as 14% in recent weeks. One recent YouGov poll said 53% of Scottish voters had no opinion of him. Calling for an end to the “internal plotting”, he added: “I have listened to the concerns expressed about me, I will treat those with respect and humility, and I will fight with every ounce of my being to improve the fortunes of the party in the runup to next year’s election. We need unity not division.” The rebel motion was tabled after four MSPs at Holyrood, including two who resigned from their frontbench posts, urged him to quit or face a leadership challenge. They were backed by four Labour peers, including Meta Ramsay, one of the SEC members poised to vote in favour of the no confidence motion. Ian Murray, Scottish Labour’s sole MP and shadow Scottish secretary, was also expected to vote against Leonard. The result is an embarrassing setback for the party’s centrists, who had been extremely confident they had the numbers to force his resignation or to force a leadership contest. They will now have to make peace with Leonard and his allies in the party, or again try to unseat him knowing that carries the significant risk of further damaging the party’s standing in the polls if they fail again. But it also leaves Leonard badly wounded. With the party’s ruling executive split over his suitability as leader, he now no longer has the support of his own union, the GMB, for which he worked for 20 years, nor of Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union. Unite and Unison had both stated publicly Leonard had their support, although it is understood Unite’s leadership is privately unhappy about his performance. Neil Findlay, a Labour MSP who ran Leonard’s leadership campaign, said: “Richard can now move forward. The people who have been plotting against him for three years have been humiliated; he can now move forward with the agenda he has always wanted to take forward.”"
2020-09-12T09:56:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Gove claims internal market bill protects UK integrity from EU 'threat',"Michael Gove has defended the government’s plan to override parts of its own Brexit deal with the EU, claiming the internal market bill was necessary to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He also insisted that the government was acting “within the rule of law” and was behaving in a “constructive and pragmatic” way, despite the Northern Ireland secretary admitting the new legislation would breach international law. The Cabinet Office minister, who was doing the rounds of TV and radio programmes on Saturday morning, told BBC Breakfast the EU could put the integrity of the UK at threat without the controversial legislation the government is trying to push through in the face of outrage even within the Tory party.
“We’re doing our part – generously – to help protect the EU’s own single market, but we’re clear that what we can’t have, even as we’re doing all that, is the EU disrupting and putting at threat the integrity of the United Kingdom,” Gove said. “These steps are a safety net, they’re a long-stop in the event – which I don’t believe will come about but we do need to be ready for – that the EU follow through on what some have said they might do, which is in effect to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.” Gove’s comments echoed Boris Johnson, who in an article in the Telegraph on Saturday wrote that legislation to override parts of his Brexit deal is needed to end EU threats to install a “blockade” in the Irish Sea. The prime minister said Brussels could “carve up our country” and “seriously endanger peace and stability” in Northern Ireland if Conservative MPs rebel to block the internal market bill. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gove was asked to explain what had changed for the government to believe it needs to change its own withdrawal bill. The presenter Mishal Husain suggested there were only two explanations: either the government hadn’t thought the original withdrawal bill through, or had glossed over it because they wanted to get Brexit done. Gove said it was neither. “These are not simple matters. There are clear and important principles here. We voted to leave the European Union, we voted as one United Kingdom. We’re introducing legislation to make sure that our United Kingdom remains strong, united and governed under the rule of law, but it is also the case that if we look at the detail of how we implement the protocol, I don’t think anyone would say that this was simplistic stuff.” He said the government was dealing with the issues in a “constructive and pragmatic spirit”. “That’s why we’re spending money. It’s why we’re investing in order to make sure that the protocol works, because we’re committed to the withdrawal agreement and the protocol. But what we are also committed to is the integrity of the whole UK.” Asked later, on Times Radio, if the dispute over Brexit this week had undermined the UK’s reputation, Gove said: “I don’t think so. I think people recognise that in a negotiation like the one that we’re having as we leave the European Union, there are inevitably changes in the way in which we interact with our neighbours. “But our adherence to the rule of law is clear, and that’s why the attorney general issued a statement earlier this week outlining the way in which all our actions were entirely consistent with the rule of law.”

2020-09-11T16:37:40Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit override plan would breach Vienna convention, QC says","The UK government has been warned its use of domestic legislation to override international treaty obligations with the EU would breach the Vienna convention, to which Britain is a signatory, as well as the ministerial code. Brexit talks with the EU were thrown into chaos this week after the UK government introduced its internal market bill, which would override portions of the Northern Ireland protocol in the event of there being no trade deal with the EU.
However the weight of legal opinion is shifting against advice from the attorney general, Suella Braverman QC, and the solicitor general, Mark Ellis, who backed the plan. Senior lawyers have expressed amazement at their conclusions. In a three-page letter seen by the Guardian that summarised advice from Braverman and Ellis, the pair in effect dismissed duties contained in the ministerial code as irrelevant and concluded that “international law is subordinate to the much more fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty”. Philippe Sands QC, a professor of international law at University College London, said: “Every international lawyer is familiar with the Vienna convention on the law of treaties, and its article 27, which reflects a general principle: ‘A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty’. “There is simply no way around this binding rule – to opine that parliament is sovereign is, in this sense, hopeless.” Ann Taylor, the chair of the Lords select committee on the constitution, wrote to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, on Friday cautioning that: “Any breach of international law threatens to undermine confidence in future treaty commitments made by the UK government and increases the likelihood that the governments of other countries will breach their international law obligations.” She also referenced the Vienna convention, saying article 60 states that a “material breach of a bilateral treaty entitles the other party to invoke that breach as a ground for terminating or suspending the operation of the treaty ‘in whole or in part’”. Lady Taylor said the internal market bill put the entire withdrawal agreement, and other related agreements, at risk and “this would have far-reaching consequences”. She also cited the cabinet manual, which says “ministers are under an overarching duty to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations…”, and the ministerial code, which states that there is an “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law”. In 2010 the code was more explicit, stating that there was an “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations”. This second part was removed in 2015 under David Cameron’s administration, although the former Conservative minister Edward Faulks told the Lords at the time: “The obligations on ministers under the law, including international law, remain unchanged.” A court of appeal judgment in 2018 confirmed that the code included the duty to comply with “international law and treaty obligations”.
Braverman and Ellis, however, claim the ministerial code only applies to UK law, putting them at odds with their fellow law officer, Richard Keen, the advocate general for Scotland, who advised that ministers would be breaching the code if they defied international law. Mark Elliott, a professor of public law at Cambridge University, told the Guardian: “The attempt to suggest that [the code] does not now extend to international law is an attempt to shift the debate. It’s disingenuous to suggest that it’s consistent with the ministerial code [to break international law]. “Respect for the rule of law includes respect for international law, as the UK ministerial code used to make explicitly, and as is still – as the court of appeal has held – implicitly, clear in the current iteration of the code. The promotion by the UK government of [the internal market] bill that expressly breaches the UK’s international obligations is thus nothing short of extraordinary.” The government also sought external legal advice before making its decision. It is unclear what advice they gave, but two of the three barristers chosen by the government to give advice on the legality of breaching treaty obligations – Prof Richard Ekins and Prof Guglielmo Verdirame QC – had previously made their views public. In 2015, they co-authored a paper for the UK Constitutional Law Association advocating precisely the approach now adopted by the government. It said: “It would be wrong for ministers to be required to treat international legal obligations, including unincorporated treaties, as of equal standing to acts of parliament or common law duties. “The rush to apply for such judicial control, as well as the assumption that international law should take precedence over constitutional law, tells us much – and none of it good – about modern legal thinking.” A statement issued by the Cabinet Office on Thursday, defending government legislative plans, declared: “Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK’s treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation.” On Saturday, the attorney general may face sharp criticism over her stance on respecting international law when she chairs the Bar Council’s annual general meeting."

2020-09-11T15:45:54Z,politics,Politics,"'It’s world-leadingly bad, is what it is': the week Covid surged again in UK","For Alex, an NHS call centre worker, the signs that coronavirus was back in earnest came when his phone wouldn’t stop ringing. Over the summer, Alex would log on at home to see 70 or 80 people in the queue for advice on booking an appointment for a Covid test. “You’d get answered in a few minutes,” he said. “Last week, that went up to about 100. By this week it was 1,500.” On Friday morning, he logged on to see 2,120 contacts on hold, and a wait of more than half an hour for a response that might get the callers nowhere. “We’re selling callers wishes and hopes,” said Alex (not his real name). “We are grossly underprepared … customers are angry. They’re not mad at me, they’re mad at the system.” The warning lights had been flashing in Downing Street, too, triggering an abrupt reversal of policy that coincided with a Brexit crisis of the government’s own making, leaving ministers fighting Conservative rebellions on two fronts. All talk of the country tentatively heading towards some kind of normality began to evaporate last weekend as the reality of a Covid resurgence began to bite. With the UK recording nearly 3,000 Covid cases on Sunday, the highest daily total since May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, concluded that he had to act. “That Sunday when the numbers came out and it was that dramatic rise, that dramatic increase, things started moving quickly from that,” a Whitehall source told the Guardian. “It was: OK, we’ve got one data point here, we’ve got to look at this very carefully and get the message out.” Hancock appeared on broadcast news bulletins to issue a warning about the “concerning” increase in the number of new cases. In messaging that would be echoed later in the week by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, he stressed the importance of preventing the UK from following the same path as other European countries that had failed to stop new outbreaks. In the following days, officials examined the daily figures to see if the increase would be sustained. By Tuesday, Boris Johnson had concluded that the evidence was clear enough that a new approach was necessary. On Wednesday, he revived the coronavirus press conference, flanked by Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and set out a plan intended to offer clarity, simplicity and control after longstanding criticism that the government’s communications were confused. From Monday, with a few narrow exceptions, he said, gatherings of more than six people would be banned in the hope of avoiding a wider second lockdown. Johnson emphasised that these steps were not a second lockdown but a necessary evil to avoid one. Still, the headlines the next morning warned of the cancellation of Christmas. On Friday, the figures showed why ministers had begun to panic. The R number across the UK had risen to between 1 and 1.2, and the number of cases in England was estimated to be doubling every 7-8 days. “It has felt, sometimes, like a lot of people just have their heads in the sand,” a senior NHS manager said. “Maybe this is a bit sooner than we hoped, but it was always going to happen.” But if healthcare leaders and call centre workers alike saw the surge coming, and behavioural scientists largely backed the belated move to a simpler set of guidelines, some Tory MPs were anything but philosophical about the change. And with parallel concerns about the government’s “moonshot” £100bn testing plan and the efficacy of the existing track-and-trace system, public and political faith in the government’s handling of the crisis faces perhaps its toughest test yet – at the very moment when its maintenance is most urgently required. On Friday, Tory-supporting newspapers reported unrest in the cabinet, with Hancock said to have been the only member of the coronavirus strategy committee to have supported the “rule of six” decision – which was strongly backed by Whitty and Vallance. “Even the PM was initially cautious about taking the limit all the way down to six,” the Daily Mail quoted a source as saying. “The majority view was that this level of social distancing will have a huge impact on people’s lives and the economy. But Hancock got his way.” Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, reflected the simmering discontent among MPs. He told the Guardian: “Parliament has been sitting since April and there is simply no reason why these measures cannot be put forward for proper debate, scrutiny and decision by elected parliamentarians. And it is high time the government recognise that. The ‘rule of six’ measures are a massive infringement of normal personal liberty and family life.” The former minister David Davis piled in too. “I don’t know what the science is for the six-person limit,” he told the Guardian. He acknowledged that the government had reason to be concerned about the rise in the infection rate, but he asked: “Why six, not eight? How is that supposed to work? How are they going to enforce it indoors? I don’t think they can.” To offer some hope, Johnson had referred to “Operation Moonshot” – mass testing on an unprecedented scale – as a feasible way to bring the crisis under control. But after the Guardian revealed the details of the plans, scientists and other experts mercilessly picked them apart. And the cost? That £100bn figure, mentioned in two leaked official documents, would be twice the entire annual defence budget, and two-thirds of what the government spends each year on the NHS. Dr David Strain, of the British Medical Association, said it was “unlikely if not impossible” to imagine 15m tests being available within the prime minister’s timeframe. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, the chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University, said statisticians were “banging their heads on the wall” at the idea, because even the best tests would generate enough false positives to require quarantine for millions. If the moonshot fails to land, the government will have to rely on the existing testing system, which appears to be cracking under the strain of the recent rise in cases. Though Hancock has repeatedly defended the service this week – and blamed the worried well for causing the backlog – the Guardian has identified people seeking tests in Blackburn, London, Leicester, Greenock, north Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Coventry, Cardiff and Devon who have all been told that their nearest available testing centre was in Inverness, the northernmost site in the country. It was these problems that led the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to warn that the system was on the verge of collapse. Charlie Swarbrick, an 18-year-old student from Penge, was told to go to Malden, Esher, Inverness, Aberdeen, and Norwich City FC. “I thought: I’d rather stay home for two weeks,” he said. He did make the 12-mile journey to Esher but he received an unclear result. A week after he was exposed to the virus, he finally got a negative result on Friday, after finding an appointment in Greenwich. Melonie Brown, from Walthamstow, north London, took her 13-year-old son to school on Tuesday, only to be called in to pick him up because of a cough. “The website sent me straight to Inverness,” she said. “So we tried from a different phone to see if there was a glitch, and that one was in Telford” – 155 miles away. Not knowing what else to do, and desperate for her son to get back to school, she contacted her local MP, Stella Creasy. As it turned out, Creasy was able to point her to a closer testing centre – in Walthamstow. Brown took her son on Thursday and they queued for 10 minutes, with no need to book. Later the same day, a Serco worker there told the Guardian he had no idea know why the centre was not showing up online for locals. “We have the signs [saying tests are only for people with symptoms], but we don’t turn anybody away,” they said, estimating that the centre was conducting about 400 tests a day. “By the time they leave, we get nothing but compliments.” The worker had a friend who had been told to go to Scotland – from Belfast. It is understood the Department of Health is moving to fix the glitch by imposing a new 75-mile limit on searches for test appointments, while new laboratories are being added to process results. A spokesperson for the department reiterated that people without symptoms were not eligible for tests. They said: “NHS Test and Trace is working and our capacity is the highest it has ever been.” David Davis, though, took a similar view to Starmer. “They keep saying it’s world-leading,” he said. “It’s world-leadingly bad, is what it is. They talk about this huge capacity … well, the capacity is obviously in Inverness. There’s a serious bottleneck in the laboratory, and that determines the capacity, so it’s a lot less than it’s claimed. So how are they going to fix that?” At the call centre, meanwhile, Alex was sceptical that things were about to get better. “All we can tell people is just keep trying,” he said. Like most other people, his sense of the future is couched more in hope than expectation. Did he have any idea how things might get better? “Someone does,” he said. “Somewhere.”"
2020-09-11T14:47:53Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: UK negotiators 'believe brinkmanship will reboot trade talks',"Britain’s Brexit negotiators believe Downing Street’s plan to break international law, pushing the trade and security negotiations to the brink, may have helped reboot the talks by offering Brussels a reality check about the looming danger of a no-deal outcome. The publication of the internal market bill on Wednesday, under which key parts of the withdrawal agreement agreed last year would be negated, has enraged the EU and prompted an internal rebellion within the Conservative party. Brussels has set Boris Johnson a three-week deadline to ditch his plans or face financial and trade sanctions, with the clear suggestion that negotiations over a future relationship will fail unless the most contentious parts of the proposed legislation are removed. In a sign of the EU’s anger at Johnson’s move, a committee of MEPs coordinating the European parliament’s stance on Brexit, issued a statement on Friday stating they would refuse to ratify any trade and security deal if the UK government had breached the withdrawal agreement or threatened to do so. A Tory rebellion against Johnson’s bill is gathering pace: an amendment to the internal market bill by the former minister Bob Neill would give parliament a veto on overriding the UK-EU divorce deal.
Late on Friday afternoon, the prime minister sought to quell discontent among some Conservative colleagues over the bill by addressing MPs on the issue during a Zoom call although no questions were taken. In the call, which was disrupted at one stage when the videolink went down, Johnson reportedly stressed that the clauses in the bill were necessary to prevent a foreign power from “breaking up our country”, as well as insisting there were still hopes of a Canada-style trade deal. In a piece in saturday’s Telegraph he claimed the EU was threatening to “blockade” Northern Ireland. “Let’s make the EU take their threats off the table,” he wrote. However, Neill was unconvinced. “I believe [changing the withdrawal agreement] is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,” he told Channel 4 News after the call. Earlier there had been excoriating criticism of the internal market bill by the former Tory leader and Brexit supporter Michael Howard, who predicted many of his colleagues would oppose it and said he would be surprised if it got through the House of Lords, where the government lacks a majority. But Downing Street believes the row with the EU may ultimately prove to be a welcome disruption to the talks, which had been in deadlock throughout the summer over the most thorny issues of the government’s future domestic subsidy regime and access to British waters for EU fishing fleets. The British negotiating team, led by David Frost, believes EU capitals are freshly focused on the trade and security negotiations, with Brussels clear-sighted on the risk of the talks collapsing. Negotiations between the teams led by Frost and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, are to continue next week with both sides in agreement that a deal must be ready to be endorsed by EU leaders by 15 October. “Talks this week have been relatively more constructive than you might expect, but ultimately progress will be determined by whether we get more realism from them on the key areas of divergence,” said one senior UK negotiating official. Progress was claimed to have been achieved after the EU was said to have dropped its policy of “parallelism”, or the insistence that they had to make progress on all elements of talks, ranging from fundamental stumbling blocks of state aid and fisheries to the easier issues. Downing Street’s view of a fresh impetus to the negotiation was not echoed by Barnier in a statement issued at the end of the eighth week of negotiations. He said Brussels had offered to accommodate British red-lines in the negotiation, including a major windfall for British fishing boats and the acceptance that the UK would not follow EU law, but Frost had “not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests”. One senior EU source said the week’s talks had been “better than you might expect” but that Brussels was simply focused on carrying on the negotiations until it was clear there was no chance of a deal. “We don’t want to get caught out – there isn’t time to waste so this is two sets of civil servants doing their jobs,” said a senior EU diplomat. British sources close to the negotiations said they did not recognise Barnier’s account of the latest talks. “We’ve been engaged in talks pretty consistently for many months now,” one UK source said. “The problem is the EU seems to define engagement as accepting large elements of their position. Rather than being engaged in discussions and that’s one of the problems that we’ll need to overcome.” The government on Wednesday published a thin document on its plans for subsidy control in which it pledged not to return to the bailouts for failing companies that were seen in the 1970s. The UK said it would consult over how to control subsidies in the “coming months”. Barnier said the proposal did not offer the assurance the EU needed and fell “significantly short of the commitments made in the political declaration”, in reference to the paper agreed by Johnson and EU leaders last year about the outline of a deal. A UK source said: “We believe statements that we put out on Wednesday constitute a very clear statement of the direction, about domestic policy and how [it] interacts with these negotiations while still giving room to have a constructive discussion on the subject. And we’re sorry that it wasn’t taken in that spirit.” Howard said it was “a very sad day last week” when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that amending the UK’s Brexit deal would break international law. “I never thought it was a thing I’d hear a British minister, far less a Conservative minister, say, which is that the government was going to invite parliament to act in breach of international law,” Howard told Sky News. “We have a reputation for probity, for upholding the rule of law, and it’s a reputation that is very precious and ought to be safeguarded, and I am afraid it was severely damaged by what was said on Tuesday and by the bill which is currently before parliament.” Momentum gathered pace on Friday as Neill’s initiative, which is being backed by the former ministers Damian Green Oliver Heald, was also signed by Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee. Hoare tweeted that US figures “had a point” in warning that potential destabilisation of the Good Friday agreement could result both in a no-deal Brexit and no trade deal with the US."
2020-09-11T12:11:54Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces Tory rebellions on Brexit and Covid rules,"Boris Johnson is facing separate Conservative rebellions on Brexit and Covid-19 rules, as Tory MPs mobilise to undermine the controversial legislation that overrides the EU withdrawal agreement. The tabling of an amendment by a former minister, Bob Neill, to the internal market bill in an effort to create a parliamentary veto on overriding the UK-EU divorce deal sets up a showdown next week on the bill’s second reading in the House of Commons. Momentum gathered pace on Friday as Neil’s initiative - which is backed by the former immigration minister Damian Green and the former minister and solicitor general Oliver Heald - was also signed by Simon Hoare, chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee. Among other senior Conservative figures who have also come out strongly against the bill’s proposed powers is the former party leader Michael Howard, who said he would be “very surprised” if the bill got through the the House of Lords, where the party did not have a majority. The peer said it was “a very sad day last week when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admitted that amending the UK’s Brexit deal with the EU will break international law”. “I never thought it was a thing I’d hear a British minister, far less a Conservative minister, say, which is that the government was going to invite parliament to act in breach of international law,” Howard told Sky News. “We have a reputation for probity, for upholding the rule of law, and it’s a reputation that is very precious and ought to be safeguarded, and I am afraid it was severely damaged by what was said on Tuesday and by the bill which is currently before parliament.” Howard’s intervention came after the former Conservative prime ministers John Major and Theresa May and former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont also strongly criticised Johnson’s proposals. Amid signs of increasing unease among Tory MPs, there was support from a number of influential chairs of parliamentary committees for comments in the House of Lords by Howard. They included Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, and Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence select committee. Ellwood said on Twitter: “The rule of law is everything - if we forget this we forget who we are, what we stand for and the moral high ground that forms the foundation of our soft power.” Although Neill’s initiative would need backing from dozens of MPs in a parliamentary party that has tilted heavily towards a firm pro-Brexit position since the general election, Neill told Times Radio there was support for his amendment on the Tory backbenches. “I wouldn’t be pressing this issue if it was only a hobby horse of mine,” he said. The backlash within Conservative ranks on Brexit coincides with a separate rebellion on Covid-19 rules as one former minister claimed government plans would turn every public space “into the equivalent of going through airport security”. New regulations limiting gatherings in England to no more than six from Monday and moves to have Covid-19 marshals have sparked alarm among some Tory MPs who want parliament to have the power to review measures. Greater parliamentary scrutiny was needed, according to the Tory former minister Steve Baker, who said it was “now time to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people” and there should be a “voluntary system”. “And it is time for us to actually start living like a free people, not subjecting ourselves to constantly shifting legal requirements, which I think now no one can fully understand,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It seems to me the effect of having Covid marshals will be to turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security where we are badgered and directed … I’m not willing to live like this.” Challenged on why the Westminster government had not followed the path of devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, which have exempted children under the age of 12 and 11 respectively from “rule of six” limitations on gatherings, the business minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said the move had been taken in England to provide “simplicity”. “It goes against the grain, the DNA of a Conservative government, to curtail people’s liberties, but the evidence suggests that the virus is at its most virulent in those social interactions, in the home, in the pub and outside, which is why we are reluctantly introducing the rule of six,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme."
2020-09-11T11:58:35Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: can the UK and EU reach a deal before the end of October?,"Brexit: what now? The government lobbed a hand grenade into the Brexit talks this week, by revealing it was ready to break international law by overriding the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson approved less than a year ago. Negotiations on a trade and security deal, nevertheless, stagger on as planned. Informal talks continue for the next two weeks, culminating in the ninth round of negotiations from 28 September to 2 October. The end of September is also a moment of reckoning: the EU has threatened to take legal action if the government goes ahead with the current version of the internal market bill. If the UK ignores its obligations, it is hard to see talks continuing. What if the government changes course? If the government backs down on the bill, or is defeated in parliament, a Brexit deal is back on the cards. Talks will intensify. But time will be tight: one of the few things the prime minister and the EU agree on is that any deal must be done in October. Johnson has said there needs to be an agreement by the EU leaders’ summit on 15 October if it is to come into force by the end of the year. The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has set a deadline of the end of October. His officials have deliberately pencilled in an extra two weeks, expecting a final sprint to the finish after the summit. Why October? The Brexit transition period ends on 31 December, but both sides, especially the EU, have a lot of work to do to get the treaty ready on time. If and when Barnier strikes a deal with his UK counterpart, David Frost, the EU will have to accelerate legal processes and political decisions that take far longer in a conventional negotiation. British and EU lawyers will go through the text with a fine-tooth comb to check for errors, a process known as “legal scrubbing”. The document will have to be translated into most or all of the EU’s 24 official languages. Meanwhile, some EU27 governments must consult their national parliaments – even if no ratification is required by national and regional assemblies – to guarantee political backing at home. “Several countries cannot give a green light unless they have had an OK from their own parliaments. This is not something that can happen in a super-Saturday-style way,” said one EU official. Don’t EU talks always go into extra time? Very often, yes. And some Brexit watchers think the deadline could stretch to mid-November. EU officials, however, insist the end of October is a hard deadline, citing the volume of work required to turn the deal into a legal treaty, expected to run to 1,000 pages. “The end of October is a genuinely hard deadline,” said the EU official. “I honestly physically don’t know how things would work in a shorter time. Normally we would do this in 18 months. But I know no one in the UK believes that.” David McAllister, a German Christian Democrat MEP and close ally of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the Guardian “a ready text must be available by the end of October” to start ratifying the agreement. “This is not a technocratic position, but a legal requirement. The council [of EU ministers] and the European parliament must have the necessary time to scrutinise the agreement and give their consent. We have expressly communicated this to the British side.” What happens on 31 December? Brexit. By automatic operation of the law, the transition period ends and the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union. Even if there is a deal, changes for businesses trading with the EU will be immense. Companies face new paperwork to import or export goods from the bloc, with yet more processes required for certain goods, such as chemicals, alcohol and tobacco. The Kent lorry park will open its gates as the extra paperwork kicks in. Experts have warned that the “just-in-time” production system on which the British car industry relies is unlikely to survive the onslaught of red tape. Travellers will face restrictions: mandatory checks at the EU border (excluding the Anglo-Irish common travel area) and limits on how long they can stay in the bloc without a visa. Tourists will have to get by without pet passports, the European health insurance card and the right to drive on the continent on a UK licence. In the event of no deal, farmers and manufacturers will be hit with tariffs. With the EU supplying nearly one-third of the UK’s food, it’s almost inevitable that some items will become scarcer and more expensive. Lorries will be delayed at the border, possibly for a few days. Hundreds of EU fishing boats could be operating in British waters illegally, sparking skirmishes and blockades at ports. And Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe will hit a nadir that will take a long time to repair."
2020-09-11T10:37:42Z,politics,Politics,Japan trade deal is small beer – but a welcome distraction,"The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a historic moment and in a way it was. For the first time since leaving the EU, Britain has struck a free trade deal and with the world’s third biggest economy – Japan – at that. In practical terms, the agreement is small beer. On the government’s own estimates, the impact will be to boost the size of the UK economy by £1.5bn. Given that Britain’s annual output is about £2tn, that represents less than 0.1% of gross domestic product. What’s more, it will take time for the benefits to show up. The reason the gains are so small is that the deal largely replicates the one already negotiated between Brussels and Tokyo, from which the UK benefited. While Truss was lauding the boost to exports, the deal mattered more for its symbolism than its direct economic effects. There are pros and cons of running an independent trade policy. The upside is that it allows the UK to broker bespoke agreements that focus on sectors in which it is strong, such as financial services, rather than accept an EU-negotiated deal that might be more weighted to the needs of German carmakers or French farmers.
The downside is that the EU can offer access to a market of almost 450 million people rather than the UK’s 67 million, which gives Brussels greater clout. Truss said Britain’s financial sector would enjoy greater market access to Japan as a result of the deal but judging by the estimated size of the boost to UK exports and GDP the Japanese have not given away that much. Still, news of the accord between London and Tokyo provided the government with a welcome – if temporary – distraction from the much more significant trade talks with the EU. Business liked the deal and welcomed it but made clear it would welcome a deal with Brussels even more."
2020-09-11T10:13:17Z,politics,Politics,"Labour faces 'existential crisis' in Scotland, union boss warns","An influential union leader has warned that Labour faces an “existential crisis” in Scotland as rebels tabled a no-confidence vote in the party leader, Richard Leonard. Gary Smith, the secretary of GMB Scotland, said the crisis over the party’s leadership and its plummeting popularity in Scotland raised profound questions about Labour’s future at UK level, with polls putting its support as low as 14%. The GMB helped finance Leonard’s leadership campaign in 2017, giving him £12,000 and a free “phone bank” to canvass members. Leonard was a senior GMB officer for 20 years before becoming a Labour MSP in 2016. He remains a GMB member. Smith said the union would not intervene on Leonard’s behalf. The GMB has refused to support his tenure as leader or back the rebellion led by a group of party centrists. Smith indicated most GMB members voted for the Scottish National party. “At a time like this, our members would not thank us for getting bogged down in an internal Scottish Labour party issue, a party for which many of them no longer vote for,” he said. “The truth is Scottish Labour’s problems run far deeper than one individual. It is facing an existential crisis in Scotland and the knock-on effect for the UK party could be quite profound.” Smith’s comments came as the rebels confirmed they had tabled a confidence motion for a meeting of Labour’s Scottish executive committee (SEC) on Saturday, which has been signed by a third of the committee’s 32 members. They hope to force Leonard to resign or get the Scottish executive to agree to a leadership contest, but Leonard said on Friday morning he would resist their demands. He accused them of fighting a factional war at a time when many Labour policies were being adopted by Nicola Sturgeon’s government. “The last thing Labour supporters and those we need to win back want to see is a party turning in on itself,” Leonard said. “A lot of these people are not mandated by their organisations to vote in this way. “That exposes how this is motivated by faction and that this is an entirely factional move. They have nothing to say or offer, no ideas, no plan to protect jobs and living standards against the backdrop of the Covid crisis.” Leonard’s critics, led by James Kelly, whose resignation last week as Labour’s justice spokesman triggered the rebellion, argue the party’s collapse in support threatens Sir Keir Starmer’s chances of winning a UK general election. They argue the electoral arithmetic dictates Labour has to win back significant numbers of seats in Scotland to win a majority at Westminster. It currently holds one seat. Leonard’s critics also argue few donors will fund Labour’s Holyrood election campaign in May if he is still leader, making it more likely the SNP will win a majority and demand a second Scottish independence referendum. They believe the UK party will be unable to fully fund a Scottish campaign because its finances will be highly stretched with simultaneous election campaigns in Wales, regional mayoral contests and council elections, including for the Greater London assembly. The rebels expect the no-confidence vote to be extremely close, but Leonard has won public backing from two other key unions, Unite, Scotland’s largest, and Unison, and the former veteran Labour MEP David Martin, bolstering his confidence. Those unions each have two votes on the SEC, as does the GMB. Unite gave Leonard £30,000 for his campaign in 2017 and phone bank support, while Unison donated £9,000. Usdaw, the shop workers’ union, also has two votes on the SEC and gave Leonard £5,000 but it has not yet said where it stands on his future. Pat Rafferty, Unite’s Scottish secretary, told the Sunday Post last weekend: “Voters will be repelled by this sort of conduct. They want to see their MSPs focused on supporting communities and saving jobs, not indulging in underhand efforts to dislodged an elected leader. Whoever is organising this disgraceful coup should pack it in at once.”"
2020-09-11T09:17:08Z,politics,Politics,UK government hails 'historic' trade deal with Japan,"The UK and Japan have agreed a free trade deal, as Britain races to secure easy access to overseas markets in preparation for leaving the Brexit transition period at the end of the year. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, said the agreement with Japan was a “historic moment” for both countries. However, the deal takes place against the backdrop of a bitter dispute between London and Brussels after the government admitted it was preparing to break international law by unpicking parts of the withdrawal agreement. Speaking after signing off a deal in principle with the Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, Truss said the agreement was expected to boost UK trade with the world’s third-largest economy by an estimated £15.2bn. Japan is the UK’s 13th-most important goods export market, accounting for about 1.9% of all products sold overseas last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Including trade in services, imports and exports were worth a total of £31.6bn last year, with 9,500 UK-based firms exporting goods to Japan. According to the Department for International Trade, the deal will increase UK GDP by 0.07% – or £1.5bn – after 15 years.
Business leaders welcomed the Japan trade deal as an important signal of progress being made to expand British business in major overseas markets, but warned that a deal with the EU should still be the government’s top priority. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby group, said: “Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a free trade agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations.” The EU is the UK’s biggest single export market, accounting for 46% of UK goods exports. Including services trade, imports and exports between Britain and the EU were worth a total of £672.5bn last year, more than 20 times the value of UK-Japan trade. Heralding the deal as a major step forward, Truss said it was an improvement on the Japan-EU free trade agreement, which entered into force last year but will no longer cover the UK when the transition period ends on 31 December. She said: “The agreement we have negotiated – in record time and in challenging circumstances – goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. “From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the north of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country.” Truss said the agreement was “an important step” towards the UK eventually joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would secure the country access to markets in 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Earlier this month the government confirmed Tony Abbott would serve as a UK trade adviser in a push to build links in the region, despite widespread condemnation of the former Australian prime minister’s record of misogyny and homophobia and his views on global heating. Japan and Britain have been negotiating a deal since June. The talks missed an end-of-July deadline to strike a deal after the international trade secretary insisted on preferential treatment for stilton cheese amid pressure on Boris Johnson from British farmers concerned about the imminent loss of EU subsidies, according to the Nikkei Asian Review business newspaper. Britain exported £18m of blue cheese globally last year, with just £102,000 worth going to Japan.
The Department for International Trade said Britain would “continue to benefit from access to the low tariffs for key food and drink products covered by quotas”, including stilton cheese. Japanese business leaders have voiced alarm over the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit. About 1,000 Japanese companies employing 180,000 people have a presence in the UK, including major employers such as Nissan, which has 6,000 staff at its car manufacturing plant in Sunderland. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, welcomed the deal, but added: “We hope the deal can be ratified swiftly but, for both sides to benefit fully, we still need to urgently complete an ambitious and tariff-free UK-EU deal – and time is rapidly running out.”"
2020-09-11T09:06:32Z,politics,Politics,Ireland accuses Boris Johnson of trying to sabotage peace process,"The Irish government has accused Boris Johnson of trying to sabotage the Northern Ireland peace process with a “unilateral provocative act” based on spurious claims about the Good Friday agreement. As Brexit talks hang by a thread following the UK’s threat to renege on parts of the withdrawal agreement, Thomas Byrne, Ireland’s European affairs minister, branded the UK government’s claims that its move was to protect the peace process as “completely false”. He said what would happen as a result of this bill becoming law was “completely unthinkable”. Relations with the EU have plunged to a new low in the last 24 hours after the UK rejected Brussels demands to withdraw the parts of the internal markets bill that would give the government power to override the Northern Ireland protocol.
The move has also soured Anglo-Irish relations, with no warning of the plan to undo the Brexit arrangements on Northern Ireland by one of the co-guarantors of the Good Friday agreement. Byrne told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: “It’s a totally unacceptable way to do business, and we would value very close relations with Britain. In fact, good relations with Britain are absolutely essential for the peace process to work, as well as at the lack of a hard border, and good relations within the north and north/south. “This was a unilateral, provocative act, that is … uniquely unprecedented. The statement that this is to help the Good Friday agreement is completely false and is completely wrong. “The constitutional status of Northern Ireland is, first of all, protected in the Good Friday agreement, is protected and mentioned again in the protocol which Boris Johnson agreed less than a year ago. “The entire premise of the Good Friday agreement is, in fact, agreement between the peoples of the north, the north and south and between Britain and Ireland. So you cannot then allow one side, in any aspect of the complicated relationships on the two islands, decided to change things unilaterally, and that’s not unique to our situation. “What is not expected is one side of that [peace agreement] simply pulls the plug and says no, we’re going to change something without even consulting.” Byrne called on Johnson to think again and allow “common sense to prevail” and realise he is threatening a peace process that took decades of hard work to achieve. He said: “Boris Johnson agreed this agreement. He ran the general election on the basis of support this agreement, and this is absolutely unprecedented. To then turn around months later and say, well actually we didn’t realise that this was like this? “Everybody knew the complexities of the island of Ireland, and everybody knew this agreement would be to everybody’s benefit both in the island of Ireland and in Great Britain.” Trade talks between the EU and the UK will continue next week but the outlook remains bleak, with relations soured with the EU and key allies. The German ambassador to the UK tweeted on Thursday night that he had not in his 30 years as a diplomat “experienced such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation”.
Johnson is also facing a backbench rebellion led by Sir Bob Neill, with up to 30 MPs reportedly willing to vote for an amendment on the offending parts of the bill and some including Sir Roger Gale saying if the bill is tabled unamended they will vote against it entirely."
2020-09-10T19:14:01Z,politics,Politics,Brexit advice: are ministers obliged to comply with international law?,"The three–page letter sent from the attorney general’s office on 2 September marks the culmination of the government’s search for legal answers to the problems it confronts in implementing Brexit. The memo refers to the Northern Ireland protocol, which is part of the withdrawal agreement between the UK and the European Union, and the internal market bill, the bombshell legislation that ministers have been considering using to override parts of that protocol.
Somewhat euphemistically, given the gravity of what the government appears to be considering, the letter refers to a request for advice on “rule of law issues”. It summarises the views of the three law officers – the attorney general, solicitor general and advocate general for Scotland – who are required to ensure that ministers act within the law. The note is addressed to a senior Whitehall official at the Europe Legal Group, which appears to have been coordinating necessary legislative measures for the Cabinet Office and Downing Street. The letter reveals that an opinion had been submitted on 10 August by Guglielmo Verdirame QC, a professor of international law at King’s College London; Prof Richard Ekins, of Oxford University; and a more junior barrister, Richard Howell, of Brick Court Chambers. The letter responds to questions submitted earlier about the status in international law of various “proposed legislative provisions” that would govern goods entering Northern Ireland, whether export declarations are required for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and what constitutes state aid. The letter states the “law officers” are unanimous that UK “legislation to remove the possibility of challenge before the domestic courts, or prevent the government from complying with the rulings of EU courts, contrary to article 4 of the withdrawal agreement, would be a clear breach of the withdrawal agreement and of the UK’s international law duty to act in good faith with respect to its treaty obligations”. They also agree that there is a “risky but respectable argument” that legislation could be written to be compatible with article 4 of the withdrawal agreement so that domestic law “takes precedence over article 5 of the protocol and s.7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in particular in circumstances of “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to a diversion of trade”. On constitutional questions, the law officers concur that “parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass any legislation it sees fit, including legislation which results in the UK contravening its international obligations under treaties or customary, international law. “Ministerial support for such legislation would not be contrary to domestic law, but the legislation, if enacted, would self-evidently be contrary to the UK’s obligations under international law. In our view, ministers would not be acting contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law in proposing or supporting such legislation. Neither would parliament be acting unconstitutionally in enacting it.” Where Richard Keen, the advocate general for Scotland, parts company with the attorney general, Suella Braverman QC, and the solicitor general, Michael Ellis, is over the responsibilities imposed by the ministerial code. In existence since 1997, but refreshed and amended periodically by new governments, the code sets out the standard of conduct expected of ministers. In 2010 the code stated there was an “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations, and to uphold the administration of justice and to protect the integrity of public life”. It was rewritten under David Cameron’s Conservative administration to state only that there was an “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law and to protect the integrity of public life”. A challenge was brought alleging that it had not been debated in parliament and was illegal. In 2018, the government defeated that judicial review in the court of appeal. In that judgment, the court nonetheless found that despite the change in the wording, the “overarching” duty to comply with the law included international law and treaty obligations. Different readings of the code surface in the letter from the attorney general’s office. “The law fficers do agree that the [ministerial] code itself does not carry the force of law, is not enforceable in the courts, and does not pose a legal bar to action,” it says. “However, the law officers differ as to the interpretation of the underlying constitutional conventions. “It is the opinion of the advocate general for Scotland that the terms of the ministerial code expressly reflect a constitutional convention that ministers shall act in accordance with the rule of law, which in his view includes international law. In his opinion, that includes the obligation under international law to act in good faith with respect to the UK’s treaty obligations. “In contrast, the attorney general and solicitor general are confident that there is a strong legal basis, supported by authorities, which separate the rule of law into its domestic and international spheres. In their view, the reference to ‘law’ in the ministerial code can only be a reference to UK law and UK constitutional principles.” As such, Braverman and Ellis viewed ministerial obligation under the code “as only relating to compliance with the rule of law as a matter of UK law”. There is “strong precedent”, they claim, for the UK government passing legislation “in breach of treaty obligations”. They cite the government’s response to the European court of human rights ruling on prisoner voting. (That long-running disagreement was conducted through the Strasbourg court’s normal dispute procedure and eventually resolved.) They give other examples of “legislative treaty override”, such as the Finance Act 2013, which “contained provisions which expressly disapplied international tax treaties”. (George Osborne has challenged that view, saying all parties agreed to the changes). Canada’s 2018 law legalising cannabis “in direct breach of various international narcotics treaties” was given as another example. The letter concludes that “parliamentary sovereignty” trumps all other legal matters. “All law officers agree that it is an established principle of international law that a state, acting through its executive government, is obliged to discharge its treaty obligations in good faith. This is, and ought to remain, the key principle in informing the UK’s approach to international relations. “However, in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves, the attorney general and solicitor general consider it is important to remember that an established principle of international law is subordinate to the much more fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty.”"
2020-09-10T18:32:45Z,politics,Politics,Brexit plan to breach international law could face battle in Lords,"If Boris Johnson’s government pursues its stated intent to amend part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement regarding arrangements in Northern Ireland, ministers will not only have to persuade a hugely sceptical EU, they must also get a bill through the Commons and the Lords. The UK internal market bill has its second reading in the Commons on Monday. Johnson’s 80-seat majority should ensure it passes, although some Tory backbenchers have spoken out against the breach of international law that it represents. There are many more Conservative MPs who do not like the idea but are staying quiet, in part, they say, in the hope it is all a negotiating bluff by No 10, but also because they fear losing the party whip if they vote against the government, which is the Johnson way. Things are different in the Lords. In a brief debate on the issue on Thursday, Michael Howard became the third former Conservative leader in two days to condemn the promised breach and to warn of the consequences. Lord Howard was more brutal even than Theresa May and John Major as he asked Richard Keen, the Scottish advocate general, who was speaking for the government, about comments in the Commons by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, who conceded on Tuesday that the new Brexit plans would break international law in a “very specific and limited way”. “Does my noble and learned friend simply not understand the damage done to our reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law by those five words uttered by his ministerial colleague, in another place, on Tuesday – words that I never thought I would hear from a British minister, far less a Conservative minister?” Howard said. “How can we reproach Russia, China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards, when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?” The Lords debate was brief, but no peers spoke in favour of the government’s plans. It was sought by Charles Falconer, the shadow attorney general, who said the “Lewis mantra” would be used as an excuse by dictators worldwide. Later another senior Tory peer, the former chancellor Norman Lamont, predicted that the bill would not pass through the Lords in its current form. “I think the government had an arguable case, but that case was destroyed the moment Brandon Lewis said the means the government were going to use to change the Northern Ireland protocol was against international law,” he told the BBC. “That is impossible to defend. I think the government are in a terrible mess and in a hole and I don’t think it is easy to justify.” Under the long-established constitutional principle known as the Salisbury convention, peers do not block or severely amend measures that were in the election manifesto of a governing party. Johnson and his ministers could certainly claim that implementing Brexit was not only a manifesto commitment but a central one. However, dissenting peers would stress that breaching international law did not form part of this, and they could return the bill to the Commons without several key clauses. For all the sway that Johnson and his lieutenants have over Tories in the Commons, especially the very Brexit-minded 2019 intake, some more seasoned MPs and peers will listen carefully to the views of Major, who said flouting international law could leave the UK having “lost something beyond price that may never be regained”. Responding to the EU’s pledge to break off talks if the UK proposals were not dropped, Michael Gove, the minister who leads on Brexit issues, said the bill’s introduction would be “an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why it’s important that we have this legislation”. It would need to be an impressive argument to change many minds."
2020-09-10T17:27:57Z,politics,Politics,Government's top legal advisers divided over move to override Brexit deal,"A behind–the–scenes rift has emerged between the government’s top legal advisers over the legality of the decision to bring legislation that overrides the EU withdrawal agreement. Legal advice contained in a three–page letter marked “official – sensitive”, seen by the Guardian, summarises the legal opinions of the government’s three law officers, whose role includes ensuring ministers act in accordance with the law. The letter appears to show that Richard Keen, the advocate general for Scotland, advised that ministers would be breaching the ministerial code if they defied international law.
The attorney general, Suella Braverman, and solicitor general, Michael Ellis, disagreed with their fellow Conservative minister, arguing the code applies only to UK law, according to the letter. The advice of all three law officers was summarised in the letter, which was sent by the attorney general’s office to a senior Whitehall official on 2 September. It states that all three law officers agreed that the UK internal market bill, which seeks to override portions of the Northern Ireland protocol in the event of there being no trade deal with the EU, would amount to a “clear breach” of the withdrawal agreement and international law. Their language appears stronger than that used by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, when he told MPs this week that the government’s legislation would break international law “in a very specific and limited way”. The government’s decision to bring legislation that would override parts of its agreement with the EU has thrown the ongoing trade talks into crisis, prompting Brussels to plan legal action that could lead to financial and trade sanctions. The EU said the UK had until the end of the month to withdraw the draft legislation, warning that it had seriously damaged trust. On Thursday, two hours after the Guardian contacted the government for comment, the Cabinet Office posted online what it described as its “legal position” on the internal market bill and Northern Ireland protocol. The document summarised some of the issues covered in the 2 September letter, but did not disclose the differences between Lord Keen and the other law officers over the ministerial code. The revelation of a backroom disagreement over the ministerial code – which stipulates an “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law” – could prove particularly damaging to Boris Johnson’s government. The legal advice is understood to have been shared with a select group of officials and cabinet ministers, meaning other government ministers were potentially unaware of the risk the legislation could pose to their compliance with the code. The letter summarises the legal opinions of all three officers, and explains where Braverman and Ellis parted company with Lord Keen, who is the Ministry of Justice’s spokesperson in the Lords. In a crucial passage, the letter states: “Whilst there is no dispute between law officers that parliamentary sovereignty embraces the power to pass legislation that is contrary to international law, they do differ on whether ministers can propose such legislation in compliance with the ministerial code. “The law officers do agree that the code itself does not carry the force of law, is not enforceable in the courts, and does not pose a legal bar to action. However, the law officers differ as to the interpretation of the underlying constitutional conventions.” It continues: “It is the opinion of the advocate general for Scotland that the terms of the ministerial code expressly reflect a constitutional convention that ministers shall act in accordance with the rule of law, which in his view includes international law. In his opinion that includes the obligation under international law to act in good faith with respect to the UK’s treaty obligations. “In contrast, the attorney general and solicitor general are confident that there is a strong legal basis, supported by authorities, which separate the rule of law into its domestic and international spheres.” Braverman and Ellis argued that the code refers only to “UK law and UK constitutional principles”. The letter adds: “On this established view it would be both lawful and constitutional for a minister to introduce legislation that was in breach of international obligations”. The letter was addressed to a senior official in the Government legal department, the head of which, Sir Jonathan Jones, resigned this week amid speculation he objected to the course of action being pursued by Downing Street. The thrust of the advice from the law officers is understood to have been relayed last week to the six members of the cabinet EU exit strategy committee, chaired by the prime minister and including Braverman and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove.
Braverman is said to have been trenchant in her support of Downing Street’s proposed legislation, telling colleagues the ministerial code was no obstacle because it was not legally enforceable and, in any event, could be unilaterally amended by the prime minister. She and Ellis are understood to have been considering these issues since late July. In mid-August they sought legal opinions over “the rule of law issues” from external counsel named in the letter as Guglielmo Verdirame QC, Richard Howell and Prof Richard Ekins. Elsewhere in the letter, the law officers agree that “legislation to remove the possibility of challenge before the domestic courts, or prevent the government from complying with the rulings of EU courts, contrary to article 4 of the withdrawal agreement would be a clear breach of the withdrawal agreement and of the UK’s international law duty to act in good faith with respect to its treaty obligations”. Explaining how such a breach could be legally justified, the letter explains: “All law officers agree that it is an established principle of international law that a state, acting through its executive government, is obliged to discharge its treaty obligations in good faith. This is, and ought to remain, the key principle in informing the UK’s approach to international relations. “However in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves, the attorney general and solicitor general consider it is important to remember that an established principle of international law is subordinate to the much more fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty.” Despite his apparent reservations about the code relayed in confidential legal advice, Keen was vocal in his defence of the government’s position when responding to questions in the Lords about the internal market bill. “We are not showing scant regard for our treaty obligations,” he said. “We are endeavouring to allow for a contingency that may arise very soon which will require us to ensure that we can discharge our obligations to Northern Ireland.” He added: “From time to time tensions do occur between domestic legal obligations and international law. It’s not unprecedented for legislation passed by this parliament to cut across obligations undertaken at the level of international law. Domestic legislation does prevail.” The three senior law officers did not provide a comment individually but their spokespeople said their response was included in the Cabinet Office statement posted online. • This article was amended on 11 September 2020 to clarify the law officers’ response to the Guardian."
2020-09-10T17:20:52Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's 'Covid marshals' plan criticised as shambolic,"Boris Johnson’s plan to set up local teams of “Covid marshals” to enforce coronavirus rules preventing large groups of people gathering in private and public spaces has been criticised as confusing and shambolic by local authorities. Councils in England, which the government said would be expected to employ teams of marshals at their own expense, said they had received no warning from government about the announcement, and had been given little detail since about what was expected of them. “Bearing in mind the government is introducing the new rules from Monday, they have given us no indication of additional resources, no staff, no powers of enforcement and no time to prepare people for the roles or carry out security checks. It is serial incompetence,” said Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council.
“We have been given no idea of how many marshals will be needed, how they will be deployed, or how incidents will be reported. Are marshals expected to knock on people’s doors or enter people’s gardens to break up gatherings of more than six people? Are marshals being asked to break up illegal dinner parties?” Forbes said there was bafflement and frustration across political lines in local government at the lack of warning and dearth of guidance accompanying the announcement. “Yet again, it is government by press release,” he said. Johnson told a press conference on Wednesday that the deployment of marshals would “boost the local enforcement capacity” as part of an announcement of new rules designed to slow the spread of coronavirus by cracking down on gatherings of more than six people. People breaching the new restrictions could be fined £100, which will double with every subsequent offence up to £3,200, although it is not clear whether Covid marshals would be able to issue a criminal fine, which would normally be a police responsibility. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said councils could draw on existing staff or volunteers to fill the roles. The marshals would wear hi-vis jackets to support members of the public in one-way systems, prevent mixing between groups, and clean touch points in public places. An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are encouraging the introduction of Covid-secure marshals to help support our high streets and public spaces, making sure that people feel safe to enjoy them. Some areas of the country have already introduced marshals to support the public in following the guidelines in a friendly way and we will be working with local authorities to see where else they are needed.”
The ministry said that further details would be published “in due course”, although it added that councils were best placed to “determine the model of deployment and responsibilities of marshals in their areas”. It suggested that versions of Covid marshals already operated in Leeds and in various towns in Cornwall. Leeds city council said its initiative, which involved the deployment in the city centre of 12 city ambassadors and six night marshals for a four-week period in July, when lockdown restrictions were eased, was very different in scope and intention to what the government appeared to envisage for Covid marshals. Many councils have been deploying environmental health and trading standards staff to informally advise the public and businesses about social distancing rules in shops, markets and in parks. But there is a national shortage of such workers, and environmental health departments have experienced some of the worst cuts under austerity. “The challenge of starting this policy from scratch, at a few days’ notice, with no money and no guidance, is not something it is possible for councils to do,” said Richard Watts, leader of Islington borough council in London.
Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: “Councils have gone above and beyond to protect communities during the pandemic, but they are being continually hung out to dry by an incompetent government, chasing headlines. “Yet again this is government by press release, with ministers giving no guidance about how this will be delivered or funded. The British people are paying the price for the government’s failures. It needs to get a grip and work constructively with councils if we are to get through this crisis.”"
2020-09-10T17:15:13Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: EU threatens legal action against UK unless it rewrites internal market bill – as it happened,"Brussels has given Boris Johnson three weeks to drop plans to break international law or the UK will face financial or trade sanctions, as EU lawyers ruled that Britain has already breached the withdrawal agreement by tabling the internal market bill. Michel Barnier, the EUâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, has suggested that trust between the EU and the UK has been damaged. He made the point in a tweet following the conclusion of this weekâ€™s UK-EU trade talks. In a statement he also said â€œsignificant differences remain in areas of essential interest for the EUâ€�. He went on: The UK is refusing to include indispensable guarantees of fair competition in our future agreement, while requesting free access to our market. We have taken note of the UK governmentâ€™s statement on â€œA new approach to subsidy controlâ€�. But this falls significantly short of the commitments made in the political declaration. Similarly, we are still missing important guarantees on non-regression from social, environmental, labour and climate standards.
Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the pandemic is accelerating again as she introduced a stricter version of Boris Johnsonâ€™s â€œrule of sixâ€� for gatherings in Scotland. The government could consider ways to give certain people priority access to coronavirus tests, Matt Hancock has said, as he faced criticism from fellow Conservative MPs about recent delays and disruption to the testing system. The number of people in England who tested positive for coronavirus rose by 43% in a week, according to the latest test-and-trace figures, providing further evidence of a rise in infections. Thatâ€™s all from me. But our coverage continues on the global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-09-10T17:06:40Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks on brink as UK rejects EU call to drop law-breaking plan,"The Brexit talks appear to be on the point of collapse after Britain flatly rejected an EU ultimatum over the government’s plans to break international law by reneging on key parts of the withdrawal agreement. The clash on Thursday followed an EU demand that Boris Johnson drop his plans within three weeks or face financial or trade sanctions, after the bloc’s lawyers concluded that Britain had already breached the withdrawal agreement by tabling the controversial internal market bill. In a hard-hitting statement following a meeting with Michael Gove in London, the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič had put the prime minister on notice that he needed to regain Brussels’ trust. He also raised the prospect of both a collapse in the ongoing trade and security talks and a legal battle with the bloc.
“The EU does not accept the argument that the aim of the draft [internal market] bill is to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) agreement. In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite,” the European commission said in a statement. In a sign of the plunging prospects of a deal, Germany’s ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, tweeted: “In more than 30 years as a diplomat I have not experienced such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation. If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don’t accept it.” Šefčovič had told Gove “in no uncertain terms” that the UK government must “withdraw these measures from the draft bill in the shortest time possible and in any case by the end of the month”, the statement added. “By putting forward this bill, the UK has seriously damaged trust between the EU and the UK. It is now up to the UK government to re-establish that trust.” But within two hours of the tense meeting, Gove said Downing St would not climb down. “I made it perfectly clear to the vice-president of the commission we would not be withdrawing this legislation,” said Gove. “I explained to Vice-president Šefčovič that we could not and would not do that … He understood that. Of course, he regretted it.” Gove said the UK was “absolutely serious about implementing the Northern Ireland protocol” and looked forward to setting out the justification to critics within his own party, which include the former leaders Michael Howard, Theresa May and John Major, when the bill had its second reading on Monday. The Cabinet Office minister said it was “a good meeting” in which the UK “stressed the importance of making progress” in the joint committee talks to ensure the legislation was not needed. His job, he said, was to achieve success.
David Frost, Britain’s chief negotiator, said “a number of challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant”. He said the UK remained committed to reaching an agreement by the middle of October. But with tensions high, the negotiations over the UK’s future relationship with the EU appear to be in deadlock. The bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, separately issued a statement at the end of the eighth week of negotiations on a future trade and security deal in which he complained that London had not matched the EU’s willingness to find a compromise on the key sticking points: state aid and access to UK waters for European fishing fleets. “On its side, the UK has not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests,” Barnier said. “Significant differences remain in areas of essential interest for the EU.” He did not, however, close the door on further negotiations despite noting that “to conclude a future partnership, mutual trust and confidence are and will be necessary”. According to an EU legal opinion, leaked to the Guardian, the commission believes Johnson’s government has already breached the terms of the treaty. “… by tabling the draft bill and pursuing the policy expressed therein, the UK government is in violation of the good faith obligation under the withdrawal agreement (article 5) because this bill jeopardises the attainment of the objectives of the agreement,” the commission lawyers write.
The commission has advised the 27 EU capitals that there are grounds for the bloc to take “legal remedies” through the European court of justice before the end of the transition period, potentially leading to significant fines or trade sanctions. The legal opinion goes on to say that should the legislation be adopted it would be in “clear breach of substantive provisions of the protocol” in waiving any export procedures or formalities on the trade of goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and in restricting the application of EU state aid rules in the case of Northern Ireland. “Once the bill is adopted (as proposed), the commission may initiate infringement proceedings against the UK for breach of the good faith obligations,” the EU lawyers write. “Even before the bill is adopted, it could be defendable to bring infringement proceedings on the same grounds.” They add: “Given the length of the pre-litigation phase, it is unlikely that the case against the UK can be brought to the court before the end of the year. However, infringement procedures for facts occurred before the end of the transition period can be brought to the court during four years after the end of the transition.” The paper says the EU court has the potential to “impose a lump sum or penalty payment” on the UK, or Brussels could use the dispute settlement mechanism under the withdrawal agreement, “which may ultimately also result in the imposition of financial sanctions by the arbitration panel”. “In case of non-payment or persisting non-compliance, the complaining party is entitled to suspend its obligations arising from the withdrawal agreement (with the significant exception of the provisions relating to citizens) or from the future EU/UK agreement,” the lawyers write. The prospect of legal action may present itself before the year is out after it emerged that the government was hoping to rush through the internal market bill this month. The committee stage of the bill is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday after the second reading on Monday. The prime minister’s spokesman denied the bill was being rushed through, saying it was to ensure there were “no barriers to trade within the UK” at the end of the transition period on 31 December."
2020-09-10T17:03:20Z,politics,Politics,Hancock's breakdown slides Westminster even more through the looking glass | John Crace,"In recent months, Westminster has slid so far through the looking glass that there must be a severe shortage of psychedelics on sale in SW1. Forget – just for a moment – that the government is now openly boasting about breaking international treaties in its bid to become a failed state and start to sweat the smaller stuff. On Tuesday, the health secretary gave a statement to the Commons in which he completely forgot why he was there and only revealed what he had meant to say about extending lockdown restrictions via leaks to journalists later that evening. No matter. The following day, the prime minister gave a Downing Street press conference in which he merely repeated all the things Matt Hancock had said on Twitter the night before. So there was something entirely predictable about Matt returning to the Commons on Thursday to repeat all the things he had meant to say on Tuesday but were already in the public domain thanks to his own Twitter leaks and the Boris Johnson press conference. It would surprise no one if No 10 were to hold another presser tomorrow to clarify what Hancock had said today. One of the glories of Matt – the thing that makes him a near national treasure – is that he has no idea that it is the seriousness with which he now takes himself that makes him a laughing stock to the rest of us. There was a time early on in the coronavirus pandemic when Hancock was a regular kind of guy. Not the sharpest minister on the block – even with the bar so low – but a man of some decency who was clearly committed to trying to do the right thing. But over the last few months, the more mistakes he has made over late lockdowns and crap test-and-trace systems, the more he has come to believe in himself as the archetypal Nietzchean Superman. A mini-Boris. Hancock began by repeating all the stuff about the “rule of six” that he and Johnson had already told everyone several times already and, for the most part, he was heard with polite boredom. It was when he got on to Operation Moonshot that open laughter could be heard from both sides of the chamber. The idea that the government could get to a point where 10 million people could get a test result every day within 20 minutes is – even with Tigger’s natural enthusiasm – a patently absurd proposition. As is the idea that the government’s 500,000-tests-a-day target could be reached by the end of next month, given that the current test-and-trace system is delivering worse results week on week and people are being encouraged to make 700-mile round journeys just to get a stick poked in their gob. It was just as well that Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn’t in the chamber to put the health secretary right on a few details. There again, the leader of the house is in self-isolation as one of his children has displayed Covid-19 symptoms and is still waiting for his test results five days later. But for Matt, the laughter was a humiliation too far. Breaking from his script, he leapt into a bizarre rant about how the whole world was against him. How he had only tried to do his best, how the wrong people had been turning up for tests despite it being government policy for anyone who was in any doubt if they had coronavirus – including those who might be asymptomatic – to get themselves tested. All those laughing at him were just nay-sayers. They had laughed when he had set himself previous targets and they would be laughing on the other side of their face when he also failed to meet his new targets. The shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, gently pointed out that Labour actually supported the new lockdown restrictions. It was just all the other doggybollox about how well the test-and-trace system was working and the game-changing Operation Moonshot that he had a problem with. Just how much did he think it was going to cost – leaked documents suggested £100bn – and how likely was it to come into effect within the next few months? Nor was there much comfort for Tigger from his own benches as Jeremy Hunt, chair of the health select committee, inquired just how much of the required technologies for Operation Moonshot actually existed. Matt now suffered a mini-breakdown. His eyes transformed into a computer’s circle of doom. He had spent at least £500m on Operation Moonshot, he said defensively. Which just left him another £99.5bn – more than the entire defence budget – to find in the next couple of weeks. Piece of piss. Why were people so exercised about petty cash? And why so keen to rubbish what was clearly a coronavirus game-changer when new technologies were coming on stream every day? Even if they weren’t? The session ended with several opposition MPs querying what powers the new Covid space marshalls would have. Would they be issued with tasers and uniforms modelled on the seminal 1970s sci-fi series Blake’s 7? Would they be allowed to bust into homes and search for illegal relatives trying to bunker down in cupboards for Christmas? Matt choked a little – people should show a little more respect for the UK’s newest crimebusters – before saying this was all still very much on a need-to-know basis. What he didn’t say was that it was abundantly clear that Hancock himself wasn’t included on the need-to-know list and was just making it up as he went along. Still, it could have been worse. He could have been the attorney general, Suella Braverman, having to display her total ignorance of the law as she tried to explain to the EU that rogue states were entitled to do what they wanted. Matt might have embarrassed himself today, but on nothing like the scale of Braverman. She took uselessness to a completely new level. She probably wasn’t even capable of writing a legally binding letter of resignation."
2020-09-10T15:04:25Z,politics,Politics,"'Depressing, frustrating and shocking': European press on UK Brexit move","Aghast European media have accused Boris Johnson of “denying reality”, “justifying the unjustifiable” and “trashing his country’s reputation” after the government unveiled Brexit plans that the EU believes breach international law. “A contract is a contract? Not for Boris Johnson,” wrote Germany’s Der Spiegel of the UK’s internal market bill, which would give ministers sweeping powers to “disapply” parts of the withdrawal agreement the prime minister signed in January. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, may call for more realism from the EU, the magazine said. “That’s funny. Because on the EU side, we have long been wondering how to stay realistic in the face of a negotiating partner who adjusts reality weekly.” The latest British proposal to disregard parts of the Northern Ireland protocol was “depressing, frustrating and shocking – but not really surprising, because when it comes to Northern Ireland, Boris Johnson is a repeat offender”, it said. Having rejected the backstop agreed by his predecessor then hailed as a triumph what was in fact a major concession to the EU, the prime minister promised Northern Irish business it had nothing to fear – despite a binding international agreement.
“With his latest U-turn, Johnson shows again that he simply makes the world as he likes it,” Der Spiegel concluded. “But he should consider one thing: denial of reality may be a renewable resource, especially worldwide. Patience and trust are not.” Die Welt said Johnson’s plans to use national legislation to undermine the withdrawal agreement, while insisting he would rather fail to reach an agreement than compromise with the EU, marked a new level of provocation. “Breaking an international treaty would take Johnson’s well-known bulldozer mentality to new heights,” the paper said, suggesting he was caving in to Tory hardliners and counting on Covid-19 to cover the economic damage of no deal. In France, Libération said it was now official: “The democratic government of a country respected throughout the world for its legal rigour has proposed to include in its national legislation non-compliance with international law.” The paper noted the absurdity of the government’s claim the withdrawal agreement had been “negotiated in haste”, pointing out that it had been signed three and a half years after the referendum and formed the basis of Johnson’s election campaign. “But what is his strategy?” it asked. “Does he want to push the EU to abandon negotiations on a trade agreement and then be able to blame it for the talks’ failure? Or does he think this shocking move will push Brussels to more compromise?” Either way, it was only to be expected from a prime minister who barely a year ago “tried to justify the unjustifiable when he illegally suspended parliament”. He has “repeatedly shown that his reputation, and that of his country, do not bother him”. Le Monde, too, wondered whether the government’s latest move was “an attempt to pressure the Europeans to secure a favourable deal before the year-end, or a deliberate move aimed at provoking the breakdown of the talks”. Brexit was reaching its endgame, the paper said, and for London, negotiating a deal meant limiting the negative consequences of Britain’s decision. It preferred to put its head in the sand, “even if that means trashing the reputation of the United Kingdom”. The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the internal market bill was “clearly in breach of the agreements he made less than a year ago with the EU”. After firing Tory MPs who disagreed with him and illegally suspending parliament, violating an international treaty is, it seems, another dodgy tool in the PM’s box that he “considers necessary to finally settle Brexit and remain in power”. It is all part of his “beloved chaos theory”, aimed at creating “maximum pressure and maximum commotion” and eventually giving him what he wants – whatever that is. Spain’s El País said no one could yet say whether Johnson’s bid to allow the UK to unilaterally modify the agreement was “just another barbaric negotiating ploy”. The government may insist that it is “acting in good faith” and aims only to “connect the dots and avoid legal loopholes”. But Johnson is plainly not backing down from his decision, “which has poisoned the already tense climate of the talks … Everything suggests that this time, he has gone too far.”"
2020-09-10T13:18:38Z,politics,Politics,"Covid test seekers may be ranked by priority, says Matt Hancock","The government could consider ways to give certain people priority access to coronavirus tests, Matt Hancock has said, as he faced criticism from fellow Conservative MPs about recent delays and disruption to the testing system. Responding to a statement by Hancock in the Commons, the former minister Greg Clark told the health secretary he needed to get a “personal grip” on testing before winter, after some of Clark’s Kent constituents were sent to Cornwall and Scotland for tests. Hancock claimed the system was working well but said too many people without coronavirus symptoms were still seeking tests. To better channel demand, a new system of ranking people by priority could be introduced, he said. He was asked by another Tory MP, Laura Farris, whether testing to keep schools open could be based on “an order of priority”, for example reserving the first tests for working parents and teachers. Hancock said this was “a very good point”, adding: “The question is how to enforce the prioritisation without putting in place barriers that slow down access to tests for people that need them. And that’s something that we’re looking at now.” Elsewhere in the exchanges, Hancock faced some scepticism over his insistence that the testing system was working well, and over the government’s “moonshot” proposal for mass-scale, near-instant tests to allow more normal living for those who are shown to be negative. At one point, opposition MPs burst into laughter as Hancock explained how the system could work, prompting him to condemn what he called “naysayers”. But after days of reports about people being unable to access tests or being sent hundreds of miles for one, several Tory MPs impressed on Hancock the need to improve the system. Clark, who now chairs the Commons science committee, said Hancock “must admit that there is a problem”. He said: “This is in a mild September, before the autumn and winter when people have coughs and colds that may look like symptoms of Covid. It’s no good blaming people who are asymptomatic. “I think this needs his personal grip. This is an urgent matter. It needs a grip before the autumn and winder bites.” Another Conservative MP, Lucy Allan, complained to Hancock that there had been gridlock on the roads in her Telford constituency this week after hundreds of people were sent to the local testing centre from around the country. She said: “Tests quickly ran out, roads were blocked, people who had travelled from as far away as Cornwall, Stockport and London were turned away, and my constituents were no longer able to access tests in the area.” In his opening statement, Hancock accepted that the new social distancing measures coming into force from Monday, which limit almost all gatherings to no more than six people, would have a significant impact on the public. “These are not measures that we take lightly,” he said. “I understand that for many they will mean changing long-awaited plans, or missing out on precious moments with loved ones. But this sacrifice is vital to control the virus for the long term and save lives.” On testing, he urged people without symptoms not to seek tests. “As capacity has increased, we’ve seen an ever faster rise in demand, including a significant increase from people who do not have symptoms, and are not eligible for a test. This takes tests away from people who need them.”
The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said that while he supported the idea of mass testing, he was sceptical that it could be delivered given the current problems with far lower numbers. “We are all fed up of big, undelivered promises and ‘world beaters’, he said. “Mass testing is too important to become another failed project. It’s all well and good talking about moonshots and the prime minister telling us all we’ll be tested every morning. Even better would be simply delivering the extra testing needed now, not just headline figures.”"
2020-09-10T05:00:34Z,politics,Politics,"Test-and-trace will fail without rise in sick pay, says TUC","The UK’s coronavirus test-and-trace system will not function unless ministers boost statutory sick pay (SSP) to ensure that workers can afford to stay at home, the head of the TUC has said. Speaking shortly before the union movement’s first virtual annual congress, Frances O’Grady said that 4 in 10 workers would be plunged into financial hardship if forced to self-isolate for two weeks, according to a survey. Millions of low-paid workers either do not qualify for the statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week or cannot afford to live on the allowance, leaving them unable to pay bills if they have to quarantine due to coronavirus. Boris Johnson was accused of incompetence by Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday after hundreds of Britons reported that they could not access tests for the virus. The survey – carried out for the TUC by BritainThinks – shows that two-fifths (43%) of workers would be unable to pay their bills if they have to survive on the statutory minimum SSP. O’Grady said: “Asking workers to self-isolate on £96 a week is not viable – especially when many don’t have savings to fall back on. “We can’t have a situation where people are forced to choose between their health and paying their bills. “Unless ministers fix this gaping hole in our safety net Britain will be ill-prepared for a second wave of infections or more local lockdowns.” O’Grady spoke to the Guardian as TUC officials prepared for an online annual Congress for the UK’s unions, which will take place on 14 and 15 September, broadcast from the TUC’s central London headquarters. It will take place with a backdrop of mounting job losses following the coronavirus outbreak, a possible further downturn if there is a no-deal Brexit and with some of the bigger unions facing internal issues including divisive elections. O’Grady said she was “sad and angry” about the institutional sexism and sexual harassment uncovered by an independent report into GMB after the general secretary, Tim Roache, stood down this year following anonymous allegations of misconduct. The inquiry by Karon Monaghan QC concluded that “bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment are endemic within the GMB”. O’Grady said: “When I was in my 20s this was a battle as an activist I was involved in, was a campaign against sexual harassment. And we were always fighting on two fronts, in the workplace, and in our own movement. “The idea that we’re still fighting that same battle makes me sad and angry. I draw some heart from the fact that it was the GMB that commissioned this independent report and took the decision to publish it.”. O’Grady criticised the government’s threats to break the law over the agreement, saying that Boris Johnson is playing a game with the livelihoods of millions of people. She said Johnson should follow the example of union negotiators who know that they have to keep their word or discover that others will lose all trust. “Stop posturing and do what the government promised it would do, which was get us an oven ready deal that was good for the working people in Britain too. Get on with it. And deliver a deal, because the prospect of further unemployment when we’re already struggling through a pandemic is frankly unconscionable,” she said."
2020-09-09T18:53:36Z,politics,Politics,Covid testing: local authorities in England demand more control,"Local public health leaders in England are demanding greater control over the Covid-19 testing system after circulating a list of complaints about the way it is running and accusing ministers of giving mixed messages about tests’ availability. The complaints, seen by the Guardian, have been prompted by fears that a capacity shortage is hindering attempts to quell local outbreaks. The directors of public health want local testing units to be dedicated to local people rather than being made available nationally, in some cases to people who live hundreds of miles away. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Wednesday appeared to partly blame the public for test shortages, saying some people were using them in a way that was “inappropriate”. He said the centralised system – which often suggests the nearest testing centre is more than 100 miles away – was being overwhelmed by people trying to book tests when they did not have symptoms, which he said was contrary to the government’s advice. He said about 25% of the people who come forward were in fact not eligible for a test. “I’ve even heard stories of people saying: ‘I’m going on holiday next week, therefore I’m going to get a test,’” he said. “No, that is not what the testing system is there for. We’ve got to be firmer, I’m afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing.” The shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, accused ministers of “seeking to blame people for simply doing what they were advised”. On 21 July, Hancock had said: “If you have any doubt, get a coronavirus test,” and that “anyone who needs a test can get a test”. Ashworth said: “With children returning to school and thousands returning to the office, it’s obvious extra testing capacity would be needed. The fact ministers failed to plan is yet more staggering incompetence.”
Extraordinary examples of delays and anecdotes about people being directed to test centres far away from their homes continued to emerge. On Wednesday morning, people logging on to the NHS Test and Trace website were again confronted with the message: “This service is currently very busy. More tests should be available later.” There were many more complaints from the public about the shortage of tests. The family of one five-year-old boy with symptoms was told there were no test appointments available until 17 September and no home testing kits left, the boy’s grandfather told the Guardian. They have been told the whole household must self-isolate and the boy cannot go to school for 14 days. In Walthamstow, east London, residents were being offered tests in Newport, south Wales – a 320-mile round trip. The daily scramble for community tests has also raised concerns in the NHS about additional pressures on its services, with many callers giving up on the dedicated 119 helpline number for getting a test and calling the general 111 NHS number instead. In other instances people have been going to their GPs. There is also evidence that some testing stations may have been providing tests to people who were asymptomatic. One east London father reported taking his symptomatic son to a drive-through test site and the site staff strongly urged him and his other child, who was also in the car, to take a test even though they had no symptoms. Sarah-Jane Marsh, the director of testing at NHS Test and Trace, apologised on Tuesday for the situation, saying laboratory processing was “the critical pinch-point”. But frustration is running high among local health officials. “I am not interested in an apology,” said one senior director of public health. “I want them to pull their finger out and sort this mess out or hand it over to us and get out of the way. The problem of testing capacity was entirely avoidable. Hancock was the one who said go and get tested, there’s lots of tests. It is getting more and more shambolic.”
Ian Ashworth, the director of public health for Cheshire West and Chester, told the Guardian he had been contacted this week by a symptomatic resident who had been offered a test in either Telford or London in five days. There is a walk-through testing centre in Chester city centre but because it is on the national booking system, the slots are available to people everywhere. “We can’t manage outbreaks like that,” he said. “It’s like having one hand tied behind your back. We have been asked to develop outbreak plans and testing plans go with that. But if our local testing capacity is being used up by the national system there is no way we can control local outbreaks.” Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said: “It is crucial not only that the quantity of tests is sufficient, but that that testing capacity is targeted and used in such a way that those with symptoms can access tests near to where they live and receive their result back promptly. Clear and concise communication from the government on who is eligible for testing is vital.”"
2020-09-09T18:32:39Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson lets rip another demented monologue in Commons | John Crace,"You could sense the impatience in Boris Johnson’s voice. He had come to prime minister’s questions prepared to take Keir Starmer on over the government’s new willingness to break international treaties. But the Labour leader was one step ahead. There was no need for Labour to get involved at this stage, when the EU and large sections of the Tory party were already up in arms at the prospect of the UK acting like a rogue, failed state. Let others do the dirty work for him. Instead Starmer chose to direct all six of his questions to what was on many people’s minds: the ongoing mystery of why the government’s world-beating track-and-trace system was sending people on a 700-mile round trip on the off chance they will be able to get a coronavirus test whose results will probably be lost. Who was responsible for this mess? “Of course I take responsibility,” Johnson said, before quickly seeking to allocate blame elsewhere. The real problem was that the scheme was just too successful: thousands of people who had been encouraged to get tested had done just that and now there wasn’t the capacity in the system even though there were 75,000 unused tests each day. It was time to go back to the old days when fewer people were tested and all those contact tracers could get back to making just one or two calls a week. To be fair to the prime minister, he was a little less rubbish at PMQs than the week before. But not by much. It’s almost as if Boris is wilfully coming to the Commons unprepared as a point of principle. With no answers to any of Starmer’s questions, all Johnson could do was demand to know why he was being criticised. Not for the first time, Keir tried to talk Boris through the basic format. He got to ask the questions and the prime minister was obliged to answer them. Or not. “The government can’t even manage a basic level of incompetence,” Starmer said. Johnson assumed the Labour leader had made a slip of the tongue and had meant to say “a basic level of competence”. But Starmer had it right first time. Just a basic level of incompetence would be a vast improvement on what the government was currently delivering.
But still it niggled Boris that Starmer had not mentioned his plans to rewrite the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol. So he just let rip in a demented monologue. The fact was that when he had said the deal was oven ready, what he had meant was that it was ready for total incineration. The deal that he had negotiated, forced through the Commons with less than three days debate and on which he had fought and won a landslide election victory had actually been a very bad deal. A complete turkey. Rather than protecting the Good Friday agreement, it had undermined it. So it had always been understood by him – if by no one else – that it would have to be renegotiated before 1 January. It was one of the more bizarre outbursts in a session that is becoming more surreal by the week. It can’t be long before the prime minister is required to take a 700 mile weekly drugs test. For performance diminishing drugs. MPs from both sides of the house could only look on in bewilderment. There wasn’t a great deal more sense on offer at the Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon, when the prime minister announced the new lockdown measures that Matt Hancock had failed to mention in his statement the day before and had released to the media in the evening instead. In theory, the message should have been straightforward. Social gatherings were to be reduced to groups of six, unless you happened to be on a bus or in the pub in which case different rules applied. But Boris being Boris just couldn’t help screwing things up. He announced the creation of a new vigilante squad of Covid marshals – presumably recruited from the track and tracers who had spent the last few months sitting next to a silent phone – who would be ready at a moment’s notice to burst in to people’s homes and arrest any stray grannies or grandads that had broken “The Rule of Six”. And yes it was going to be tricky for him too, as it would mean he couldn’t see all of his kids at the same time either. Even assuming they wanted to see him too. So what you’re basically saying is that Christmas is cancelled, several journalists observed. Boris looked panicked. Only in July he’d said everything would be back to normal by Christmas and he hates to be the bearer of bad news. So he just started making things up. Forget the failed app and all the other broken promises, he said. Forget that he had once dismissed mass testing as a waste of time. Now he was going for broke with Operation Moonshot. By Christmas everyone would be able to give themselves a daily test and then people could do what they wanted. Think of it like a pregnancy test, Boris said. Though hopefully with fewer positives than he usually got. Hell, theatres could even do tests on the whole audience and just allow in those who were negative. It was a completely bonkers piece of pantomime. It took Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance to add a touch of realism. We were a long way off either a vaccine or mass testing. The coming autumn and winter months were going to be hard. Future lockdowns might be needed. Yet again, on a day when the country had been crying out for leadership and direction, Boris had gone missing in action."
2020-09-09T17:54:30Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: PM confirms 'rule of six' to apply in England from Monday; Whitty warns of rapid case rise â€“ as it happened,"In March, shortly before he announced the full lockdown, Boris Johnson said that he thought that within the next 12 weeks the UK could â€œturn the tide of this diseaseâ€�. It sounded a bit rash, but three months later deaths and infection rates were falling sharply, and the prospect of the lockdown being eased lay ahead. But tides turn, and then turn again, and today it felt as if the clock was going backwards. Johnson, whose entire political persona seems at times to be founded on supercharged optimism, did not look happy. Here are the main points. Johnson said that from Monday a new â€œrule of sixâ€� was being enforced in England, tightening the rules on where people can meet up significantly. He explained: It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you donâ€™t live with, even if they are close friends or family. So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of six. You must not meet socially in groups of more than six - and if you do, you will be breaking the law. This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub. The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police - anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested. As PA Media reports, he also announced: - Venues where people meet socially, such as pubs and restaurants, will be legally required to request contact details of every member of a party and retain the information for 21 days. Fines of Â£1,000 could be levied against hospitality venues if they fail to comply. - Passengers travelling to the UK will need to fill out a simplified form with their contact details before they depart, while the Border Force will step up enforcement efforts to ensure compliance with quarantine rules. - Plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month will be revised, and the government is reviewing its intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. - Opening hours of some venues could be restricted in some local areas. It comes after hospitality venues in Bolton were required to close between 10pm and 5am. - â€œCovid-secure marshalsâ€� will be introduced to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres in a bid to improve the enforcement capacity of local authorities. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, signalled that the new restrictions could be in force for months rather than weeks. He said: I think in terms of the existing restrictions, people should see this as the next block of time that may not last for many months, but it is very unlikely to be over in just two or three weeks. Johnson said that he was â€œhopefulâ€� that by next spring it would be easy for people to use simple, quick tests to show that they were Covid-free, allowing them to attend theatres and sports venues etc. He described these at one point as â€œpassportsâ€�, and said they could be the â€œmoonshotâ€� allowing life to return to normal. He said: Our plan â€“ this moonshot that I am describing â€“ will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more. Work is under way â€“ and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock. We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas. At a press conference in July, Johnson said he hoped Britons would be able to start abandoning social distancing from November. At the time that sounded optimistic, and today it looks fanciful and naive, but Johnsonâ€™s â€œmoonshotâ€� comment suggest he is unwilling to let go of the dream of a return to some sort of normality by Christmas. Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, sounded much more cautious about the prospect of mass testing providing Covid-free passports for events. Whitty said you would need a â€œhugeâ€� increase in testing for this to happen. He said: My own view is that I think it is likely that we will have tests of this sort at some point in the not too distant future, but that not too distant future covers quite a wide time range. And Vallance said: There are prototypes which look as though they have some effect, but theyâ€™ve got to be tested properly and so there are, as always with technologies, unknowns and we would be completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk that can definitely happen. I think this needs to be tested carefully. The governmentâ€™s Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies has expressed some reservations about the plan too. (See 5.40pm.) Johnson said the government had to impose restrictions because people were not aware of the risk they posed to others. He said: The trouble is, people who think that they can take responsibility for their own health and their own risk are, Iâ€™m afraid, misunderstanding the situation. Itâ€™s not just the risk to yourself, alas, but at any age you can be a vehicle, a vector for the disease. So young people now are overwhelmingly getting it. But they are more than capable of transmitting it to the much more vulnerable older generation. This is a change of tone from Johnson, who used to stress how much he trusted people to use their common sense. â€œOur principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks,â€� he told MPs in a statement on his coronavirus policy in June. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog."
2020-09-09T17:20:09Z,politics,Politics,Internal market bill: what it says and the UK hopes to achieve,"The internal market bill is designed, according to the government, to “protect jobs and trade” within the UK after the end of this year’s transition period for leaving the EU. The legislation will, the government declared, “enable the UK government to provide financial assistance to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland with new powers to spend taxpayers’ money previously administered by the EU”. One of its main aims is to empower ministers to pass regulations, specifically on trade and state aid, even if they are contrary to the withdrawal agreement previously reached with the EU under what is known as the Northern Ireland protocol. The 58-page text of the bill does not disguise its intention. Section 45, for example, is quite blunt, stating that powers contained in the bill “have effect notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent …” It continues: “Regulations … [of the bill] are not to be regarded as unlawful on the grounds of any incompatibility or inconsistency with relevant international or domestic law …” The legislation adds: “Any other provision or rule of domestic law that is relevant international or domestic law ceases to have effect so far and for as long as it is incompatible or inconsistent with a provision mentioned [elsewhere in the bill].” The bill also states that the “international and domestic law” to be disregarded includes “any provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol [and] any other provision of the EU withdrawal agreement …” Ministers can make regulations which ignore “any other legislation, convention or rule of international or domestic law whatsoever, including any order, judgment or decision of the European court or of any other court or tribunal”. Lawyers expressed amazement at the explicit manner in which the bill overrides the UK’s international treaty obligations. “This is rather remarkable stuff,” Catherine Barnard, professor of European Union law at Cambridge University, tweeted. It contains, she said, “express provisions” not to comply with the Northern Ireland protocol, which is part of the withdrawal agreement from the EU. “This is the legislative drafting equivalent of a President Trump tweet,” remarked Adam Wagner, a barrister at Doughty Street chambers specialising in human rights. Lord Sumption, the former supreme court justice, told BBC radio: “There may be a political justification … but there’s no way in which this can be consistent with the legal obligations of the government under treaty. And the government has cheerfully admitted that.” Michael Dougan, professor of European Law at Liverpool University, tweeted: “First reading of UK internal market bill: for devolution, it’s as bad as many had feared, if not a bit worse; for the Northern Ireland Protocol, and the UK’s reputation in the rules-based international order, it’s as scandalous as recent reports suggested.” Eirik Bjorge, professor of law at Bristol University, said: “A state that is bound by an agreement is not in a position subsequently to say that it intended only to subscribe to something that might later be clarified, even clarified unilaterally.” Even before the bill was published, lawyers were signalling concern over the government’s intention to ignore treaty laws. Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council which represents barristers in England and Wales, warned: “It should not need to be said that this country is built on, and subject to, the rule of law. “Undermining this vital principle will fatally puncture people’s faith in our justice system, both at home and internationally. Someone committing a crime in a ‘specific and limited way’ nonetheless commits a crime and an admitted breach of international law in a ‘specific and limited way’ is nonetheless a breach.” The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was challenged on Wednesday by Labour to “protect the rule of law from attack from inside [his] own government”. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, wrote to Buckland, pointing out that: “Maintaining the sanctity of the rule of law has been central to [the lord chancellor’s] position for more than 400 years … What steps do you plan to take to protect the rule of law from attack from inside your own government? “If you fail to prevent the government from breaking the rule of law, will you stand by your oath to respect the rule of law by breaking cabinet responsibility on this matter?” The Ministry of Justice said the lord chancellor would reply to Lammy “in due course”. Defending the bill, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: “Without this vital piece of legislation businesses across the UK would face unprecedented barriers and costs. “A Welsh lamb farmer would be unable to easily sell lamb in Scotland as they can do now. A Scotch whisky producer could lose total access to English barley. And a car built in England would be more expensive to buy in Northern Ireland.” If the UK internal market bill emerges from parliament unchanged, it is likely to face an immediate challenge in the courts that will raise fundamental constitutional issues."
2020-09-09T17:08:58Z,politics,Politics,Brexit bill criticised as 'eye-watering' breach of international law,"The government has unveiled plans to give ministers sweeping powers to “disapply” part of the Brexit deal that Boris Johnson signed in January, in a move that has shocked Brussels, threatens to provoke a rebellion by Conservative MPs and caused Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, to warn there will be “absolutely no chance” of a US-UK trade deal if it presses ahead with the move. The plans have prompted such concerns that the European commission vice president Maroš Šefčovič will travel to London on Thursday for an “extraordinary” meeting with cabinet minister Michael Gove of the joint committee set up to implement the withdrawal agreement. Cabinet ministers have admitted the bill breaks international law. But Johnson’s spokesman defended the change on Wednesday, saying it was a necessary clarification of an agreement that had been rushed through in January. “The withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol aren’t like any other treaty,” he said. “It was agreed at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances to deliver on a clear political decision by the British people and with the clear, overriding purpose of protecting the special circumstances of Northern Ireland. It contains ambiguities and in key areas there is a lack of clarity. “It was written on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached between us and the EU on the detail. And that may yet be possible and we continue to engage fully with the joint committee process. But as I said before, we cannot allow damaging default positions to kick in if we can’t agree.” The publication of the bill was met with astonishment among EU and legal experts who said it was far from the “few clarifications” that Downing Street had claimed it was seeking. The bill sets out what one legal expert described as an “eye-watering” attempt to override the Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement. The bill could yet prompt a rebellion by Conservative backbenchers. The veteran Tory MP for North Thanet, Sir Roger Gale, said he would not support the move. “Put simply, I will not vote to break the law,” he said. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he was disturbed by the plans. Asked by the BBC if he might consider voting against the legislation, he said: “Let’s see what happens. Lots of concerns were raised in the house, and the government will be conscious of that.” The former prime minister Sir John Major said breaking international law would come with a price that could never be recovered. “For generations, Britain’s word solemnly given has been accepted by friend and foe. Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct,” he said. “Over the last century, as our military strength has dwindled, our word has retained its power. If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained.” And in a statement yesterday, Pelosi said: “Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday agreement, including the stability brought by the invisible and frictionless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. “The UK must respect the Northern Ireland protocol as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border. “If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.” The bill, published on Wednesday, explicitly seeks to give powers to ministers to unilaterally disregard some of the arrangements in the Northern Ireland protocol. Another proposal is a rewriting of the state aid rules post-Brexit in Northern Ireland, removing the “direct effect” of EU law which gives any member of the public or business a right to sue in the event of a dispute under European law. And it unpicks article 10 of the protocol in relation to state aid and states that it will “not be interpreted in accordance with case law of the European court” or “in accordance with any legislative act of the EU”. One seasoned observer said: “It is an absolute assertion of ministerial rights over the courts.” Northern Ireland’s most senior judge, speaking to BBC NI in words quoted by Irish broadcaster RTÉ, said he was “disappointed” by the plans to override parts of the protocol. “An indication that you’re going to break international law … is something that may well undermine trust in the government and certainly may undermine trust in the system of the administration of justice,” Lord Chief Justice Declan Morgan added. The move now threatens Brexit talks. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, condemned the bill on Wednesday. One source said the logical conclusion was that negotiations could be suspended this week. Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said he would be registering his “complete opposition” in a phone call to Johnson. “Proper negotiations are conducted on a ‘no surprise’ basis … and to drag Northern Ireland back into this is extremely divisive - and dangerous,” he told the Dáil, Ireland’s parliament. One Irish source said: “The most despicable aspect of this is the way they have dragged Northern Ireland’s problems into their disagreements over Brexit. The way they were talking about doing it to protect peace was shameless, absolutely shameless.” Paragraphs 42, 43 and 45 of the bill were described by legal experts as a blunt rewriting of the international treaty.
“This is a remarkable piece of legislation and it expressly contravenes our international legal obligations to a point that the legislation itself says this is the intention, as did Brandon Lewis [the Northern Ireland secretary] yesterday,” said Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law at Cambridge University, who added the bill was a “really eye-watering” attempt to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol. Steve Peers, a professor of law at the University of Essex, said: “It is an obvious breach of international law.” Paragraph 42 of the bill is unambiguously headed “Power to disapply or modify export declarations and other exit procedures”, a reference to checks due to take place on goods crossing the Irish Sea.
Paragraph 42 gives the government powers to disregard article 10 of the protocol that defines the state aid rules, saying article 10 should “not to be interpreted – (i) in accordance with case law of the European court; (ii) in accordance with any legislative act of the EU, including regulations, directives and decisions.”
Barnard said that while she was surprised by the bluntness of the bill, it had to be explicit to avoid legal challenge. One observer wondered if the attempt to place the powers in Westminster was not “revenge” for the supreme court decision to rule last September that prorogation of parliament was unlawful."
2020-09-09T15:48:10Z,politics,Politics,Plan for post-Brexit UK internal market bill 'is an abomination',"The UK government’s internal market bill is “an abomination which would cripple devolution”, Nicola Sturgeon has said, escalating already fierce criticism of the proposals from across the devolved administrations. Earlier the Welsh government described Westminster’s plans for a post-Brexit UK-wide internal market as “an attack on democracy and an affront to the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland”. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, said the bill signified “the destruction of two decades of devolution”, while Scottish Labour’s Alex Rowley described it as “a farce that threatens the very foundations of the United Kingdom”. Later in the day David Melding quit the Tory frontbench in the Senedd over the proposals and launched a withering attack on Boris Johnson. Stepping down as shadow counsel general, Melding said: “The publication of the internal market bill had done nothing to lessen my anxieties about the dangers facing our 313-year-old union and indeed they have been gravely aggravated by the decisions made in the last few days by the prime minister. “I feel it is necessary to speak out against what I consider to be a lack of statecraft at this crucial time for the UK’s very survival as a multi-national state.” The internal market bill, which sets out trading arrangements across the UK after the transition period, also includes clauses which negate key aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement – and which the UK government on Tuesday conceded breaks international law. In a strongly worded statement following the publication of the draft bill at lunchtime, Sturgeon said: “The UK government are not only set to break international law – it is clear they are now set to break devolution.” Sturgeon pledged that her government would “fight tooth and nail” against proposals that include a mutual recognition regime, requiring regulatory standards in one part of the UK to be automatically accepted in others, and which she argued would mean “a race to the bottom when it comes to things like food standards and environmental protections”. She said plans would prevent the Holyrood parliament from effectively legislating in a whole range of areas and could, for example, lead to Scotland being forced to accept chlorinated chicken. Jeremy Miles, the Welsh counsel general and minister for European transition, told the Guardian the bill in its current form had “no prospect” of getting Senedd consent. “The question is if they don’t get that consent whether they will proceed regardless”, he said. Describing the proposals as “an outrageous power grab”, he reiterated that the “cavalier” bill “seriously imperils the devolution settlement”. In an indication of how the devolved administrations are cohering in opposition to the plans, Nichola Mallon, the SDLP deputy and minister for infrastructure, tweeted that she was “extremely concerned at the actions of the British government” and had discussed attempts to undermine devolved power on infrastructure with Scottish government counterpart Michael Matheson. The Welsh government also accused Westminster of failing to consult them adequately. Miles said: “We didn’t have access to the bill until late last night. Whatever your view about the merits of it, if you’re going to put forward a bill which cuts into devolution then plainly anything that is encroaching on devolved territory needs to be discussed and agreed. That has absolutely not happened”. There are also profound concerns about a proposed oversight body that would hold any new devolved bills to a “market impact test”, which the Scottish government believes would have jeopardised Scotland-only initiatives such as free university tuition. Sturgeon said: “Under this bill, the Scottish parliament would not have been able to pass its world-leading legislation on minimum unit pricing of alcohol – a fact which will deeply concern the broad coalition of Scottish civic society which backed this vital public health measure.” The Welsh and Scottish governments wrote to Michael Gove setting out their concerns in July, when the proposals first emerged, warning they would put Scotland and Wales on a collision course with Westminster. Sources at the time reported a more aggressive approach towards devolution from a new generation of Conservative politicians. But Downing Street denied the bill was a “power grab”, insisting there would be no change to the powers already held by the devolved administrations and highlighting that additional powers would be returned post-Brexit in “at least 70” policy areas. Speaking after prime minister’s questions, Johnson’s spokesman said: “What the devolved administrations will enjoy is a power surge when the transition period ends in December. “There will be no change to the powers that the devolved administrations already have and the vast majority of powers with devolved competencies returning from Brussels will go straight to Holyrood, Stormont and Cardiff Bay.”"

Within minutes of the government tabling the internal market bill, the clauses of which negate key aspects of the withdrawal agreement signed by the prime minister last year, both the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the president of the European council, Charles Michel, issued condemnatory statements. “Very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the withdrawal Agreement,” Von der Leyen tweeted. “This would break international law and undermines trust. Pacta sunt servanda = the foundation of prosperous future relations.” Michel, a former Belgian prime minister who chairs the summits of EU heads of state and government, described the decision by Downing Street as “unacceptable”, raising concerns about the future of the talks being staged in London between the UK’s negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. “The withdrawal agreement was concluded and ratified by both sides, it has to be applied in full,” Michel tweeted. “Breaking international law is not acceptable and does not create the confidence we need to build our future relationship.” France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said his government expected Downing Street to live up to its legal commitments. “Compliance with the withdrawal agreement is not negotiable. Commitments have been made, they must be implemented,” he said. “Among friends and allies, we must keep our word and respect the law. The European Union is committed to it, we expect it from the United Kingdom.” One senior EU diplomat said: “A quick reading of the relevant articles of the internal market bill suggest the UK government is launching a frontal assault on the protocol and its obligations. Well beyond what was reported in the UK press. “No effort was made to obscure the UK government’s ability to deviate from the arrangements in the Ireland protocol. It even explicitly spells out the possibility to do so. It also gives ministers the power to derogate from his own national regulations in this context. “Notwithstanding the consequences for the negotiations this must be the absolute nadir of four years of negations by a country known as the cradle of democracy and which, from the Magna Carta onwards, has fought for the development of the rule of law in the UK and, above all, beyond. It shows once again the fragility of the rule of law.” The comments from Brussels and Paris raise concerns that the row will have a direct impact on the trade and security negotiations, with just five weeks to go before Johnson has said he needs a deal to be agreed. The EU has repeatedly insisted that full implementation of the withdrawal agreement is a precondition for any agreement on a deal with the UK on the trading and security arrangements when the current transition period ends on 31 December. The publication of a thin document on the UK’s plans for state aid, setting out a timeline for consultation, only added to the pessimism in Brussels over the outcome of the trade and security negotiations. The EU had been seeking details from Downing Street on how it plans to control domestic subsidies but instead the government said it would merely launch a consultation in the “coming months”. EU sources said they had been looking for some sign that an independent regulator would be established but instead the government merely offered a pledge not to return to bailouts of the kind seen in the 1970s. “It is bad. No independent regulator, no details to speak of,” said one diplomatic source. A second senior diplomat warned: “The chances of a successful outcome are now small.” With tensions high, the commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said he had sought an extraordinary meeting of the joint committee he chairs with Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, “as soon as possible” to force the UK to respond to EU concerns over the internal market bill. He had spoken to Gove in what was said to be a tense call following an admission by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, on Tuesday that the UK would be breaching international law. Šefčovič said: “I expressed our strong concerns and sought strong assurances that the UK will fully and timely comply with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.” Gove is said to have “explained the limited and reasonable steps being introduced to create a safety net that removes any ambiguity and ensures that the government is always able to deliver on its commitments to the people of Northern Ireland”, but Šefčovič wants a face-to-face meeting to allow the UK to elaborate its position.
Gove, who has accepted the invitation, said he hoped the committee discussions would reach “a satisfactory conclusion”. The latest clash came as a row erupted over UK food standards. UK government sources claim “veiled threats” were made during recent negotiations not to licence UK food manufacturers for imports of to the EU. If the UK was not on the “third country list” of states whose food standards were high enough to be fit for import into the EU it would cause huge problems in Northern Ireland, the sources said. According to the Sun, Brussels threatened to disrupt movement of food between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as part of negotiations. It is claimed by the UK that Barnier had sought to leverage the European commission’s power to withhold approval of the UK’s regime during the trade and security talks, and that this had prompted the prime minister to look for ways to undermine the withdrawal agreement through the internal market bill. One senior MEP, Nathalie Loiseau, a former French minister for EU affairs, called the claim “fake news”. Loiseau, who sits on a committee of MEPs coordinating the European parliament’s position on trade talks with the UK, said she feared Brexiters were looking for a reason to blow up the current talks. “Do you want us to lose patience and slam the door and leave?” she asked. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Loiseau said the UK’s suggestion of threats coming from Barnier was a fresh example of “disinformation and fake news related to Brexit”.
“I’m not in Boris Johnson’s head, but what’s taking place right now is fake news. You’ll remember a few days ago, this rumour that the 27 [EU member states] would withdraw their confidence in Michel Barnier, which was completely invented. “Then you have the British prime minister saying that a no deal could be a good solution for the UK. Everybody knows it’s not real. It’s a manmade catastrophe.”"
2020-09-09T12:59:32Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock accused of blaming public for Covid test shortages,"The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been accused of blaming the public for the mounting problems with access to Covid-19 tests after he claimed that a quarter of those coming forward for checks were ineligible because they were asymptomatic. Hancock has spearheaded efforts to expand testing, urging people to get checked if they have symptoms or “have any doubt”. But with Downing Street under growing pressure over concerns that some people have had to travel long distances to access tests, Hancock suggested asymptomatic people coming forward for tests were behind the growing demand.
Hancock said there were a record number of tests available, claiming capacity was higher than ever. “However, we have seen a rise in the number of people who are not eligible for a test coming forward and getting those tests,” he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. “If you don’t have symptoms, unless you’ve been asked specifically by a clinician or a local authority to go and get a test, you’re not eligible for a test. But we want the tests to be available for people with symptoms.” When asked how many people were having a test when they did not need one, Hancock replied: “About 25% of the people who come forward, we estimate, are not eligible for a test.” On 21 July, Hancock tweeted a video of himself speaking in the Commons about the issue, adding the message: “If you have symptoms of #coronavirus, or if you have any doubt, get a coronavirus test. Anybody who needs a test can get a test, & it’s the most important thing that you can do to stop the spread of this virus.”
The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “It beggars belief that after weeks of encouraging people to have a test if feeling unwell, ministers are seeking to blame people for simply doing what they were advised. “With children returning to school and thousands returning to the office, it’s obvious extra testing capacity would be needed. The fact ministers failed to plan is yet more staggering incompetence.” The government has announced it is making it illegal in England for groups of more than six people to gather, after a sudden rise in the number of people being infected with the virus. Nearly 8,500 positive tests have been recorded in the country in the last three days. The NHS website states that anyone in the UK can get a free test if they have symptoms such as a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change in sense of smell or test. It adds: “You can get a test for someone you live with if they have these symptoms. Do not get tests for people you live with who do not have these symptoms.” On Tuesday, Hancock suggested the problems that had made it difficult for some people to access Covid-19 tests may not be resolved for a fortnight.
A senior official at NHS Test and Trace issued a “heartfelt” apology to people who could not get tests. The director of testing, Sarah-Jane Marsh, tweeted on Tuesday morning: “All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don’t look overcrowded, its [sic] our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point. We are doing all we can to expand quickly.” Asked about Marsh’s tweet and pressed on how soon the issues could be resolved, Hancock told the health and social care select committee: “In the coming weeks. We are working on it incredibly hard.” He added: “We’re doing everything that we can. We have had these operational issues that I have talked about, we have had a problem with a couple of contracts and we discussed some of that in the House of Commons. But it’s a matter of a couple of weeks until we can get all of that sorted in the short term.”"
2020-09-09T09:44:49Z,politics,Politics,Green party re-elects co-leaders SiÃ¢n Berry and Jonathan Bartley,"The Greens leadership partnership of Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley has been re-elected for a further two-year term, with the pair immediately promising to push for radical policies amid the changes brought by coronavirus. Saying Labour under Keir Starmer had “completely vacated” the political space for innovative and bold policies, Berry and Bartley said the urgent economic response to Covid had shown the possibility of rapid change, and the need for policies like universal basic income. Berry and Bartley, who took over from the previous leadership combination of Bartley and Caroline Lucas after easily winning the 2018 leadership election, took 49% of first-preference votes, the party said in a statement. The race for the leadership of the Greens in England and Wales was also contested by Rosi Sexton, a Green councillor in Solihull, who is a former mathematician and elite-level mixed martial arts fighter. She won 27% of the votes. A third candidate, Shahrar Ali, a former deputy leader of the Greens, took 24%. The party’s deputy leader, Amelia Womack, was re-elected for a fourth term. Berry and Bartley oversaw highly successful local and European elections in May last year. They also led the party to an increased share of the vote in December’s general election, though the focus on Brexit and a squeeze by the two main parties meant its 2.7% vote share remained lower than the 3.8% recorded in 2015. After their re-election, Bartley said the Covid-19 pandemic and the interventionist government response to it showed how society could be transformed at speed, with the furlough job retention scheme :”very clearly setting a precedent for a basic income and shorter working weeks”. He told the Guardian: “People were questioning, is it possible? And we’ve seen that a lot of it is possible. In the face of a crisis – and we’d say coronavirus is part of the wider climate and ecological emergency – things have to change rapidly, and we’ve seen that they can.” Berry said the need for Green policy ideas was all the greater given the current trajectory of Labour: “They’ve become managerial, top-down, there’s some worryingly authoritarian things coming from Keir Starmer. No matter how much competence there is, that’s not leadership.” Bartley added: “I struggle to think of one major intervention that he’s made. Where is it? There’s no memorable moments.” This shift by Labour, he said, meant the Greens were becoming the “political expression” of popular protest movements calling for environmental and racial justice Bartley and Berry are both councillors in London. Berry is also a member of the London assembly, and is the party’s candidate for the mayoral elections, postponed from May because of coronavirus. Lucas, the party’s sole MP and still its best-known figure, spent two years as joint leader with Bartley, but decided in 2018 to step back, in part to focus on her Brighton Pavilion constituency, but also to spread the focus to other people in the party. Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its previous system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in 2012, but returned in 2016alongside Bartley. The Greens re-elect their leader, deputy leader and those in a series of other senior posts every two years."
2020-09-09T05:00:05Z,politics,Politics,"UK plans to change Brexit rules threaten US trade deal, top Democrats say","Senior Democrats have warned that any attempt by the UK government to backtrack on the Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland would jeopardize a future US-UK free trade deal and could hobble bilateral relations across the board if Joe Biden wins the presidency. Biden, an Irish American, is a staunch defender of the Good Friday Agreement, of which the US is the guarantor, and which requires an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. “[Joe Biden] is committed to preserving the hard-earned peace & stability in Northern Ireland. As the UK and EU work out their relationship, any arrangements must protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent the return of a hard border,” Biden’s chief foreign policy adviser, Antony Blinken, said on Twitter on Tuesday night. People close to the Democratic presidential challenger said any UK move away from those parts of the EU withdrawal agreement that put the 1998 peace deal at risk would present a major impediment to a close relationship between London and Washington in the event of a Biden presidency. Richard Neal, the chair of the House ways and means committee – which would have a decisive influence on ratification of a trade deal – said he had been repeatedly assured by British officials that there was no threat to the open border between the two Irelands. “This just came out of the clear blue, nobody was talking about this 72 hours ago,” Neal told the Guardian. “Joe Biden shares my position on this issue entirely … It’ll be a very significant problem and I have also reiterated time and again to the UK government that I can’t imagine that we could develop a bilateral trade relationship if there was any return to a hard border.”
Democratic officials also said that if Boris Johnson proceeded with legislation that his own government admits would break international law, it would call into question the UK’s trustworthiness as a partner. Even if Donald Trump secured a second term, bipartisan support for the Good Friday Agreement in Congresswould probably dash any UK hopes of sealing a quick free trade deal after Brexit. “The Good Friday Agreement and the broader peace process must be protected if the UK has any hope of obtaining congressional support for a potential US-UK free trade agreement,” Eliot Engel, the chair of the House foreign affairs committee, said.
“While I deeply value the US-UK relationship, it’s outrageous that Prime Minister Johnson is reportedly considering overriding critical parts of the withdrawal agreement that give Northern Ireland special customs considerations,” Engel said in an emailed statement. “These steps are necessary to prevent a hard border on the island and throwing Northern Ireland back into the fast lane toward potential violence. I urge Prime Minister Johnson to abide by the legally binding agreements the United Kingdom agreed to and I call on the UK and the EU to continue to negotiate in good faith to seek out a smooth Brexit transition.” Diplomatic sources in the US suggested that the UK government might not have fully thought through the ramifications of its abrupt announcement and had been taken aback by the pushback in Washington. “It is mind-boggling that Johnson would even consider doing this. He is breaching the only red line Biden has when it comes to Brexit which is to protect the Good Friday Agreement,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “If he goes this route, the Irish border will dominate the first six months of the UK’s relations with a Biden administration and destroy any prospect of a much-needed reboot in the relationship.” Kim Darroch, former UK ambassador to Washington, said: “You could have a free trade deal, it could even be negotiated by a Republican president and get blocked in the House of Representatives.” Darroch told BBC Newsnight he “wasn’t surprised to see a government lawyer resign because we stick by international agreements. It is one of the things we stand for.”"
2020-09-08T23:01:01Z,politics,Politics,'Festival of Brexit' organisers launch application process,"Critics have dubbed it a “festival of Brexit” and pilloried it as a waste of £120m of public money, but the first plans for the festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – announced by Theresa May in 2018 – will officially launch on Wednesday. Using the working title Festival UK * 2022 organisers have opened applications for teams who wish to be commissioned to come up with ideas for the event. As the asterisk suggests, the event’s final title is yet to be decided, said the festival’s boss Martin Green, formerly in charge of the Olympic ceremonies and Hull’s year as UK City of Culture. “We don’t want to name and brand the festival until we know its content.” Green is the chief creative officer for an event which has been widely ridiculed since it was announced by May’s government – who made comparisons to the Festival of Britain in 1951 and the Great Exhibition of 1851 – and given the go-ahead by Boris Johnson last year. But it is not about Brexit, insisted Green. It is about bringing people together for a national celebration of creativity and innovation and surely that is a good thing, he said.
“A lot of people, and I know some of them very well, were quite alarmed about the project when it was first launched because of what people said it might be. Now people can see what the project actually is, I hope those fears will dissipate.” The title of the festival is important, with one recent report suggesting that the Scottish National party wanted the word UK dropped from the branding. “To be honest, we absolutely don’t know where that came from,” said Green. “We have been working with the UK government and the governments of the other three nations really successfully from the outset. They have all signed up to do the project … the same project in the same way.” The festival will open applications on Wednesday for individuals and organisations to create teams which will then be commissioned to come up with ideas for the event. Thirty teams, each receiving £100,000, will be chosen. “This is the phase which is usually hidden from view because most of the time people go out and directly commission,” said Green. One reason was to ensure “we are reaching out to new talent and new blood and widen the pool”. The teams can be between three and eight and could include organisations and individuals, whether artists, scientists, mathematicians or engineers. Green gave the example of “an AI company from Wales working with a biochemist from Cornwall and a visual artist from the Scotland”. Crucially they are not yet pitching ideas. “We see too much of that happening. I don’t like artists and creatives not to be paid for what they are doing. “It is possibly the most important work you will ever do on a project, yet sometimes you do see ‘tell us your idea and if we like it we’ll fund it’”. The eventual plan is for 10 ideas to be chosen which will then become the festival. “We are trying not to pre-determine things but to absolutely let the experts, the creatives, respond to a challenge and see what happens. Ultimately we are about new, exciting, very different ways of engaging with people creatively”. Green acknowledged there was still a way to go in convincing people of the festival’s worth. Before Covid-19, Green said he and his team talked to nearly 300 individuals and organisations across the UK: “Once you get the opportunity to sit down with people and say this is what we are thinking about doing, they engage with it. “There is always a journey and different people and different sets of people come on board at different times. Why would I expect everybody to come on board just because I say so? This is about us proving that this is going to be a great and valuable world-beating project.”"
2020-09-08T22:38:42Z,politics,Politics,Senior Tories urge ministers to scrap 'illegal' Brexit rule plan,"Senior Conservative MPs and a raft of legal experts have urged the government not to go ahead with plans to drive through a change to the Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland after a minister conceded it would break international law. The remarkable admission by Brandon Lewis, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, followed the resignation of the most senior legal civil servant and has raised questions over the future of justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and attorney general, Suella Braverman, both of whom have taken oaths to uphold the rule of law. Their positions were put in the spotlight after the departure of Sir Jonathan Jones, who is understood to have become exasperated that ministers intended to ignore his advice that any changes to the new internal market bill would likely be illegal. The Guardian understands the government sought independent legal advice from a leading barrister, whose advice chimed with that of Jones, but their opinions were overridden by ministers. One EU diplomat suggested the minister’s admission the UK was prepared to break international law could have an immediate impact on the current talks in London between UK chief negotiator David Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier. “If true, it would be a massive blow to the UK’s international reputation and have huge negative consequences on the current talks with the EU”, the source said. “It would be in Britain’s best interests to clarify its plans now, urgently, and assure the EU that it will continue to honour its commitments under the withdrawal agreement under all circumstances. Who would want to agree trade deals with a country that doesn’t implement international treaties? It would ultimately be a self-defeating strategy.” The Guardian has been told that Jones, the head of the UK government’s legal department, disagreed with Braverman’s initial interpretation of the legal implications of a no-deal Brexit. This raised questions about whether government plans to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement were in breach of the ministerial code, which obliged ministers to follow the law, including international law. A Whitehall source said Jones was also aware that stepping outside the law would be a breach of the civil service code, by which he is expected to abide. Jones’s departure came just hours before Lewis astonished the House of Commons. He told MPs: “Yes, this does break international law in a very specific and limited way. We’re taking the powers of this to apply the EU law concept of direct effect … in a certain very tightly defined circumstance.” The former prime minister Theresa May questioned whether Johnson was risking the UK’s international reputation. “How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreement itself,” she said in an exchange with Lewis. Furious Tory MPs have urged the government to reconsider pursuing a breach of international law, including the Conservative chairs of three select committees. Bob Neill, the chair of the justice select committee, said: “Any breach, or potential breach, of the international legal obligations we have entered into is unacceptable, regardless of whether it’s in a ‘specific’ or ‘limited way’. Adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable.” Concerns were also raised by Tom Tugendhat, foreign affairs chair, and by Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defence committee. Tugendhat said: “Our entire economy is based on the perception that people have of the UK’s adherence to the rule of law. I hope it’s clear where I stand on that.” The Welsh government’s minister for European transition, Jeremy Miles, described the bill as an “attack on democracy” and a plan to “sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations”. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the senior Brexiter and chair of the House of Commons’ liaison committee, said he was shocked by Lewis’ statement to MPs and suggested he may have made an error. “I was astonished that a minister of the Crown should say to the House of Commons that we will attempt to breach international law,” he told the Guardian. “I don’t think he has got that quite right. This is about insisting on a shared interpretation of an agreement that we have made with the EU. The EU should no more insist on their interpretation than we should insist on ours.” He said that the government can still challenge the EU over its interpretation of the withdrawal agreement without telling Parliament that the UK will ignore international legislation. “I think Brandon Lewis misspoke and got the emphasis wrong. The EU does not have a monopoly of wisdom over the meaning of the agreement,” he said. Other public critics included the veteran Tory Roger Gale who said attempts to re-write the protocol “will be regarded worldwide as an act of bad faith”. The former minister George Freeman said the supreme court would be “preparing to remind ministers that intentionally breaking the law – even in a very specific and limited way – is, well, unlawful.” Lord Falconer, the shadow attorney general, said the positions of Braverman and Buckland, as members of a government that has admitted it intended to break the law but who had taken an oath to uphold the rule of law, should now be put into question. Dinah Rose, the barrister and president of Magdalen College, Oxford, said: “If a barrister advises a client that a particular act would be unlawful, but the client insists on doing it anyway, the barrister may not continue to represent that client. The barrister is professionally embarrassed and should resign. I’m sure Robert Buckland knows this.” Government sources claimed the move would not breach the ministerial code because the obligation on ministers to comply with international law was removed from the guidance in 2015 by David Cameron, although they conceded there was some disagreement over the interpretation. However legal experts including Lord Anderson, former terror watchdog and member of the House of Lords justice committee, said the code still mandated ministers to uphold international law following a court of appeal ruling in 2018, which concluded there was an “overarching” duty of ministers to comply with international law. Trade expert David Henig, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy thinktank, said it looks like “there are issues” over the Northern Ireland protocol, while law experts suggested it was an attempt to re-write the rules on state aid in Northern Ireland. In a statement from the Northern Ireland Office, the government is promising to deliver “true unfettered access … without paperwork” for trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It also said that “while Northern Ireland will remain subject to the EU’s state aid regime for the duration of the protocol, GB will not be subject to EU rules in this area.” It is understood Lewis did not misspeak in the Commons and senior government figures had decided it was better to be honest that the plans would breach international law – rather than stonewall. Jones becomes the sixth senior Whitehall figure to resign in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald, and Jonathan Slater from the Department of Education. Sir Philip Rutnam, former permanent secretary at the Home Office, has begun legal proceedings against the department for constructive dismissal. Pro-Brexit Conservative MPs stepped up their own lobbying on Tuesday, urging Johnson to go further and to ditch the EU withdrawal agreement entirely should no trade deal be reached, claiming they were promised he would do so before they passed the bill in January. Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tory MPs, said the group of MPs who destroyed May’s deal had only voted in favour of Johnson’s because they had been assured the government would ditch the agreement if no trade deal was reached with the European Union. “We made clear, however, that this agreement was barely ‘tolerable’ and only voted for it against assurances given by government: that it was just a starting point for negotiations; that it would be superseded by a full FTA [free trade agreement]; and, if needs be, could be repudiated,” he wrote in the Diplomat magazine. A Downing Street spokesman said they “remain committed to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol” regardless of whether a deal was reached."
2020-09-08T21:49:54Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to hold regular press briefings to compete with No 10,"Keir Starmer is to launch his own series of regular press conferences, in an attempt by Labour to highlight their own priorities ahead of Downing Street’s planned televised media briefings. While the schedule and venue is yet to be determined, it is expected that Starmer’s press conferences could be held monthly, with the aim they would be open to all media. A Labour source said: “Unlike the prime minister, Keir doesn’t duck the difficult questions or hide from the press. That’s why we’re up for doing regular press conferences.” Boris Johnson and fellow cabinet ministers held daily televised press conferences during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown, from mid-March until June, often held alongside a senior medical or scientific adviser. They now only take place intermittently, usually to coincide with a significant policy change. These have a limited number of pre-chosen participants, who are often not allowed to follow up their questions. However, Downing Street is trying to recruit an experienced broadcaster to become a spokesperson and face of the government in more general daily press briefings intended to begin in the autumn. These are intended to replace one of what was, before Covid, the two daily “lobby” briefings where accredited parliamentary journalists quiz the prime minister’s spokesperson, a process which is on the record but not filmed or photographed. Since lockdown, these have been replaced by a once-daily conference phone call. Downing Street has yet to outline the format of the new event and whether, as with the lobby briefings, all parliamentary media can attend and ask as many questions as they want. It is understood that if the No 10 briefings are carried daily by broadcasters, Labour would expect the same level of coverage for Starmer’s events to guarantee fairness. What has yet to be determined by Labour is whether Starmer’s event will be in person or, as with the No 10 Covid briefings, online. The hope is for the former, but it will depend on the situation with coronavirus. Both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown used to hold monthly press conferences as prime minister, along with the daily routine of their spokespeople attending lobby briefings. David Cameron initially followed suit when he became prime minister in 2010, but dropped them relatively quickly."
2020-09-08T19:18:13Z,politics,Politics,Jonathan Jones' resignation over Brexit law-breaking met with dismay,"Friends and former colleagues of the government lawyer Sir Jonathan Jones said his resignation suggested he had been put in an intolerable position, with a cabinet minister admitting the government intended to break the law. Jones resigned on Tuesday, giving no reason in his departure email to colleagues, but Whitehall sources and former colleagues said he had clashed with the attorney general, Suella Braverman, over the government’s intention to override parts of the withdrawal agreement. It is understood external legal advice was sought, which also advised the move was against international law. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, confirmed the change “does break international law in a very specific and limited way”. Friends of Jones suggested he had felt dissatisfied for some time. They pointed to a tweet of which he referred to the lawyer David Allen Green, who had criticised the Home Office for blaming “activist lawyers” for stopping deportation flights. Green noted that “activist lawyers are only as effective as the law enables them to be … So what the home secretary means is that the law itself and the courts are frustrating the removals. And that, home secretary, is called the ‘rule of law’.” Jones’ resignation was met with dismay by lawyers and politicians alike. Charlie Falconer, the former solicitor general, said: “He is very modest, he is very clever, a cerebral lawyer but not pompous and he always saw his role to come up with pragmatic solutions to the government he served. “He backs away from the limelight, so I am absolutely amazed. He is absolutely not the sort of person to do something dramatic. He is always practical. He would never have resigned if the QC had advised a different view – he is totally lacking in self-importance.”
Philippe Sands QC, professor of laws and director of the centre on international courts and tribunals at University College, London, said he believed that for Jones, the dispute over breaking the international agreement with the EU was “the final straw”. “His going raises very serious questions for other civil servants on offering legal advice,” Sands said. “It also raises very serious questions about the UK’s commitment to rule of law. The UK abroad has been renowned for proceeding very carefully. Their respect for a country they have looked up to in its commitment to the rule of law is crumbling. Amongst those charged with giving legal advice to the government, morale is very low.” Keir Starmer said he had known Jones during his career as director of public prosecutions. “Jonathan is a first-class lawyer who has given excellent advice over the years, and I’m absolutely sure he wouldn’t have done this lightly,” the Labour leader said. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who employed Jones seven years ago, described him as a “discreet and honourable” public servant who would have come to a decision after exhausting all other options. “The attorney general should not be remaining in post. It undermines the rule of law and undercuts this country’s position,” he said. Lord Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said he would ask an urgent question in the House of Lords about the proposed illegality. He said the court of appeal had explicitly ruled in 2018 that the ministerial code applied to both domestic and international law. John Bowers, the employment QC, said it was “very worrying to see the resignation of the excellent Jonathan Jones – it feels like we are living through a constitutional coup”. Concern was also raised by the president of the Law Society, Simon Davis who said: “The rule of law is not negotiable. Our commitment to the rule of law is key to attracting international business to the UK and to maintaining faith in our justice system.” Jessica Simor QC, who sat on three of the Attorney General’s lawyers’ panels and was involved in the article 50 Brexit case, said: “Officials give impartial advice to ministers which they should follow when it comes to the law. If they are told it’s illegal then they shouldn’t do it, which is presumably why Brandon Lewis did not lie to parliament. “He has clearly been given that advice and had he said anything else he would be lying to parliament … But what is the point [for Jonathan Jones] of being a paid legal adviser if your advice is ignored?

2020-09-08T18:36:32Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer warns UK's test-and-trace system on 'verge of collapse',"Keir Starmer has warned the coronavirus test-and-trace system is “on the verge of collapse”, as ministers conceded that a lack of laboratory capacity which has prevented many people getting a test could take a fortnight to be resolved. The hold-up in processing Covid results, which has seen some people asked to travel from London to Scotland for tests, prompted alarm from council leaders who said it could be calamitous in the period that pupils and students return to education. With some care homes also warning about a lack of tests for staff and residents, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to get a grip, saying the country faced “a critical moment” in avoiding a full-scale resurgence in the virus. Addressing the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson reiterated warnings for young people to socially distance after daily infection numbers shot up to nearly 3,000 for two consecutive days. While the latest daily UK total, released later on Tuesday, fell slightly to just over 2,400, ministers announced new measures in Bolton following a surge in infections including restaurants and pubs being restricted to takeaways. But efforts to prevent the UK following countries such as Spain and France in experiencing wider growth in cases risk being scuppered by persistent problems with the test-and-trace system. After several days in which people reported being told the only available test was hundreds of miles away, or being unable to get one at all, a senior NHS official issued a “heartfelt” apology on Tuesday morning. Sarah-Jane Marsh, the director of testing, tweeted: “All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don’t look overcrowded, it’s our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point. We are doing all we can to expand quickly.” Prof Alan McNally, who helped set up the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab, one of three “megalabs” created to support the testing initiative, called on ministers to clarify the problems labs face. “If we have genuinely hit the peak of what we can handle in terms of requests for tests, then make that public and issue a call to arms to labs to help in any way they can,” he said. “Clearly we are looking at the beginning of another exponential increase in virus cases and the beginning of another large epidemic wave. Everything I’m looking at at the moment points towards that.” Sir Chris Ham, former chief executive of the Kings Fund, said something appeared to have gone “badly wrong” at the Lighthouse labs in recent days. “This is a real canary in the mine moment for us as we begin to approach autumn and winter, that the numbers are moving absolutely in the wrong direction,” he said. Answering questions from the Commons health and social care committee, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said there had been “operational issues” connected to contracts to carry out tests, adding: “It’s a matter of a couple of weeks until we can get all of that sorted in the short term.” Hancock highlighted that the government had moved to ensure that no one had to travel more than 75 miles for a test, but conceded: “I appreciate 75 miles is far longer than you’d want to go.” Starmer said that while he accepted the full return of schools would bring some risks of higher infection levels, ministers should have got the testing system properly operational beforehand. “What we’re now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse,” he told the BBC. “Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available, or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance.” In a parallel warning, Khan said the government risked squandering its “window of opportunity over the summer” to put in place an effective test-and-trace system before schools and universities returned, and questioned why ministers were still focused on encouraging workers back to offices. “To prevent this turning into a tragic second wave of Covid deaths, the government need to urgently get a grip on the test-and-trace system and level with the public about the severity of the situation,” Khan said. “Sending out confusing mixed messages and berating people into returning to the office is the wrong approach approach given the current state of the virus.” Another Labour local leader, Danny Thorpe, who heads Greenwich council in south-east London, said he was still waiting to be told by central government why many locals were first asked to go to Dundee, Leicester or Cardiff for tests, or told none were available. “Government incompetence is going to cost lives,” he said. “It’s a week where we as a council have been flat out getting kids back to school, supporting local businesses and working with local universities and colleges, and for them to be asleep on the job is unforgivable.” Teaching unions also warned that delays in testing could hamper the return of schools, with students and teachers who would test negative staying off unnecessarily. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: “The government assured us that this would be ready, but at the first sign of stress it seems to be falling over. This will put the successful and sustainable return to school at serious risk. “It is unacceptable for this to happen when schools have put so much effort into getting their part of the plan right, and when pupils have had to endure so much uncertainty and disruption already.” There are also worries that care homes in many areas are unable to have the mandated weekly testing for staff, and monthly tests for residents. Nadra Ahmed, the chair of National Care Association, which represents many care homes, said many members had been in touch over a lack of tests or delays in receiving results. “They are worried,” she said. “It does seem to be almost like a postcode lottery at the moment, which is even more alarming, because outbreaks may not be picked up. By now we were supposed to be doing daily testing by now.” Addressing the Commons on Tuesday afternoon, Hancock stressed that the government was working “flat out” to expand testing capacity. Referencing the worsening situation in Spain and France, Hancock also warned that the virus remains a threat. “This is not over. Just because we have come through one peak, it doesn’t mean we can’t see another one coming towards our shores,” he said."
2020-09-08T18:02:23Z,politics,Politics,Brandon Lewis breaks cardinal law for MPs and tells the half-truth | John Crace,"Not even his most generous friends would describe Brandon Lewis as particularly bright. He is one of parliament’s natural plodders. A born follower. A man who has unexpectedly found himself in the cabinet both by virtue of his more talented colleagues having disqualified themselves for being awkward and having no principles of his own he could possibly compromise. But there seemed little harm in Boris Johnson promoting Brandon to Northern Ireland secretary once the Brexit withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol had been agreed in parliament last year, as there was little potential for him to screw up too badly. That, though, was before the prime minister had, at the weekend, unilaterally declared that there were some bits of the Northern Ireland protocol he was unhappy with and planned to backtrack on. Which left Lewis with one of the more difficult and embarrassing hours as a minister as he struggled to answer an urgent question on the latest U-turn. By the end both he and the government were in tatters. It was something of an open goal for Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, but she gratefully accepted the opportunity with some style. Labour wanted Brexit to proceed on the terms the government had promised with the protocol intact. And given that the government’s chief legal adviser had resigned earlier that morning – civil servants have scruples about law-breaking even if politicians don’t – it rather looked as if Boris was planning to renege on his own treaty. One that he had drawn up himself, forced through parliament in under three days and on which he had successfully fought a general election last December. Now it appeared that the government had had second thoughts. That its treaty hadn’t been an “oven-ready” deal after all and that it was planning to breach the ministerial code by breaking the law. Haigh even ended by quoting Margaret Thatcher, every Conservative MP’s patron saint of conservatism. The UK did not renounce international treaties. Beads of sweat began to appear on Lewis’s forehead. He could sense he was in trouble, he just didn’t know exactly how much, as he was far too insignificant to have been included in any of the decision-making. All he had been given was a one-paragraph brief telling him just to bluff it out as best he could for the duration of the urgent question. So he began to say any old nonsense that came into his head. Yes, Boris had had a bit of a brain freeze when he had negotiated the withdrawal agreement and it was a bit shit but everyone was entitled to a bit of an off-day. The Brexit deal had never made complete sense so it was only right that the Boris should try to tie up a few loose ends by ignoring something that had been agreed both by the UK and the EU. But people shouldn’t be too quick to pre-judge the situation. Just wait until Wednesday when the government published its new get-out-of-jail internal market bill and see if the EU was still complaining then. Clue: it would be. As would almost everyone else. What followed was a near-universal pile on from both sides of the house, with only Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and Steve Baker rushing to Lewis’s defence. The kind of support Lewis could have done without as all three seemed to imply that Boris had promised them last year that he would renege on the Northern Ireland protocol, which was the only reason they had voted for it in the first place. Besides, it was vital that the UK could continue to offer state aid to tech companies, such as the one that had delivered the “world-beating” test and trace coronavirus app. By the end Lewis was all but begging them to shut up.
Theresa May was first to go on the attack. The UK had signed the protocol and it was our duty to abide by it. What would be the consequences for any other international treaties if the UK could not be trusted to keep its word? We would be no better than any of the other failed, rogue states the UK was always so quick to deplore for doing the same thing. Tory Simon Hoare made much the same point, as did a host of opposition MPs. Labour’s Hilary Benn wondered how the customs paperwork would operate under the proposed new regime. Lewis clearly didn’t have a clue. By just throwing it in the bin, he shrugged? Eventually Brandon cracked. Asked yet again, this time by Tory Bob Neill, if the government was planning to break international law, Lewis made the schoolboy error of giving an almost honest response. Yes, of course we would be breaking the law, he snapped. But we would only be doing it in a little way and not so much that anyone would notice. It would be no worse than doing a little, gentle recreational shoplifting after school. All shops priced in a bit of pilfering to their balance sheet so there would be no harm done. It wasn’t as if we were planning to nuke Brussels. Though Boris might like to keep that option on the table. With this the floodgates opened. It was normal for ministers to lie at the dispatch box. MPs expected nothing else. So if Lewis had actually told a half-truth, then the reality must be even worse than they had thought. Was all this actually just a ploy to piss off the EU so much that we ended up saying sod the Good Friday agreement and having a no-deal Brexit? Lewis opened and closed his mouth, but no words came out."
2020-09-08T17:54:04Z,politics,Politics,Government admits new Brexit bill 'will break international law',"The government has admitted that its plan to reinterpret the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland will break international law. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, astonished backbenchers when he told the House of Commons: “Yes, this does break international law in a very specific and limited way. We’re taking the powers to disapply the EU law concept of direct effect … in a certain very tightly defined circumstance.” In a new internal market bill, the government is expected to unveil plans for domestic powers to govern part of the Northern Ireland protocol, something that has threatened to torpedo Brexit talks that resumed in London on Tuesday. It reportedly led to the resignation of the UK’s top legal civil servant, Jonathan Jones, on Tuesday morning. Lewis told the House of Commons that what the UK was doing was not that unusual. “There are precedents for the UK and, indeed, other countries, needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change,” he said citing changes in the Finance Act in 2013. But the admission led to a torrent of criticism, including from the former prime minister Theresa May, who questioned whether Boris Johnson was risking the UK’s international reputation as a trustworthy nation. “How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreement itself?” she asked in an exchange with Lewis during an urgent question in the Commons on the latest developments. The Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the latest revelations were “gravely concerning”. Coveney, who was instrumental in the negotiations about the Irish border, said he could not understand why the UK was seeking to create a “safety net” given the Northern Ireland protocol was specifically “designed and empowered to work in all circumstances”. “It is surely not too much to ask for the UK to implement the withdrawal agreement which it agreed to,” he told the Dáil Éireann, Ireland’s lower house of parliament. Johnson’s move to try to override part of the Northern Ireland protocol has put Brexit talks at risk but Lewis told MPs the new legislation, which would “clarify” part of the special arrangements on Northern Ireland, was designed as “limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net” in the event that talks collapse.
The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, accused the government of using the region as a “political football”. She also questioned whether the government would be asking ministers to break the ministerial code and vote for the internal market bill, the vehicle for the Brexit changes, due to be tabled in Westminster on Wednesday. Sir Robert Neill, the Conservative MP for Bromley and Chislehurst and chair of the justice select committee, said “the rule of law is not negotiable” and an international treaty signed by the government should not be breached.
Claire Hanna, the SDLP MP for Belfast South, implored Lewis not to “use the threat of a border in Northern Ireland” as a “cat’s paw in this or any other negotiation”. The DUP North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley, accused the government of having a “tin-foil spine” in failing to stand up to its critics, while his colleague Sammy Wilson, one of the most vocal critics of the Brexit deal, said: “We still don’t know the depth and breadth” of the checks in Northern Ireland. The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Simon Davis, said: “The rule of law is not negotiable. “Our commitment to the rule of law is key to attracting international business to the UK and to maintaining faith in our justice system.” Government sources claimed the move would not breach the ministerial code because the obligation on ministers to comply with international law was removed from the guidance in 2015 by David Cameron. However legal experts, including David Anderson, a member of the House of Lords EU security and justice sub-committee, said the code still mandated that ministers uphold international law after a court of appeal ruling in 2018 concluded ministers had an “overarching” duty to do so.
Lewis urged the critics to wait until Wednesday to see what was in the bill. “I think it would be wholly wrong for the UK government not to take the approach to ensure that there is a safety net should [Brexit talks’] fail, to ensure that in January businesses and people know they’ve got the contents of a structure in place to deliver on our promises.” He said the bill was designed to deliver the government’s promise that Northern Ireland traders would have “unfettered access” to Great British markets. However he batted away a question from Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, who demanded to know if, as expected under the protocol, businesses from Great Britain would have to fill in paperwork, including entry summary declarations, if sending goods to Northern Ireland. That, said Lewis, was being discussed by the specialised EU-UK committee set up under the withdrawal agreement."
2020-09-08T17:47:18Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour rebels begin leadership challenge process,"The group of Labour rebels hoping to topple Richard Leonard as party leader in Scotland have begun the process of mounting a challenge after he refused to quit voluntarily. Two Labour MSPs, James Kelly and Daniel Johnson, told party officials in Glasgow and London that five MSPs were willing to call for a leadership contest, claiming Leonard has failed to command the support of voters and party activists. Kelly and Johnson wrote to Michael Sharpe, the Scottish Labour party’s general secretary, and the party’s governance and legal unit in London to clarify what its rules were on calling leadership elections if a leader refuses to quit. Kelly launched the rebellion last week by resigning as the party’s frontbench justice spokesman, followed several hours later by Mark Griffin, the social security spokesman. Johnson and Jenny Marra, another backbench MSP, supported their calls for Leonard to quit. Over the weekend, Leonard and his allies said there were no processes in the Scottish party’s rules that allow a leadership challenge to take place if there is someone in post; and he described the rebels as mounting an “internal war” on his leadership. Speaking on Sky on Sunday, Leonard said his critics had underestimated his resolve, and that Labour’s decline was a long-term problem he had inherited. Labour’s support has slumped to 14% under his leadership, and the party lost six of its seven Scottish seats in the 2019 Westminster election. The letter from Kelly and Johnson, passed to the Guardian, argues that the Scottish party should be bound to follow the UK party’s rules, which allow for a contested leadership ballot to take place if 20% of Labour parliamentarians support it. They claim to have passed that threshold in the Scottish parliament, and want to trigger that contest if Leonard again refuses to step down voluntarily. In a statement late on Tuesday, Sharpe said there was nothing in the Scottish party rulebook that allowed for a challenge to an incumbent leader; the UK party’s rules only applied to UK leadership posts. “This is a rule for that element of the Labour party, but it is not a ‘precedent’ for the Scottish Labour party,” Sharpe said. “A precedent might be a past action or decision of the Scottish Labour party which helps interpret our rules. However, I am not aware of any such precedent on this issue.” Johnson and Kelly hope the UK party’s legal department will agree with their argument that the UK rules should apply in the absence of any Scottish rules on a leadership challenge. In their joint letter, the MSPs wrote: “We are taking this action as we believe that Labour party democracy, underpinned by clear rules that are consistently applied, is vitally important. “We reject the implication that, once installed, the leader of the Scottish Labour party enjoys indefinite tenure. This is not democratic and goes against our party’s fundamental principles and values. “This action has been driven by sorrow, not anger, after Richard Leonard has failed to command the support of MSPs, Labour activists and most importantly, the Scottish people. “We are pleading with Richard, once again, to put our party first and to stand aside so that we can start the urgent work to regain the trust of the Scottish people ahead of next year’s election under a new leader.”"
2020-09-08T17:31:29Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Keir Starmer says test-and-trace system 'on verge of collapse' â€“ as it happened,"Sir Keir Starmer has described the governmentâ€™s testing regime as being â€œon the verge of collapseâ€�. (See 5.09pm.) He was speaking after Sarah-Jane Marsh, the testing director at NHS test and trace, the service for England, apologised for the fact that many people have been unable to get a test, or have been told to travel long distances if they want to get one. (See 11am.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told MPs it would take at least two weeks to resolve the processing problems that have led to these problems. (See 12.32pm.) Starmer has criticised Boris Johnson for not yet delivering on his promise to get a Brexit trade deal. (See 5.51pm.) A series of tougher measures have been imposed in Bolton to stem a surge in Covid-19 cases, including restaurants and pubs being restricted to takeaways, as well as late-night limits on opening hours. Downing Street is considering whether to reduce the maximum permitted size for social gatherings in England following a sudden rise in coronavirus cases, and warnings that people have â€œrelaxed too muchâ€� in their precautions. The Bank of Englandâ€™s chief economist has warned the government against extending the furlough scheme, arguing it will delay an â€œinevitableâ€� shake-out of businesses hit by the pandemic. Leaders across much of northern England have pleaded with residents to â€œdo their bitâ€� to prevent a second wave as the number of Covid-19 cases rises. The government has admitted that its plan to reinterpret the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland will break international law. Thatâ€™s all from me for today.

2020-09-08T16:33:14Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond inquiry: chief law officer offers assurances over legal papers,"Scotland’s chief law officer has said he would be “disappointed” if the Scottish government fails to release key documents to the Holyrood investigation into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The furious row over the Scottish government’s refusal to hand over significant legal papers to the specially convened cross-party committee has escalated in recent weeks, with Salmond’s own lawyer offering to go back to court to access them just as the lord advocate, James Wolffe, offered assurances that the papers would be made available “to the greatest extent possible”. Wolffe told the latest hearing of the committee on Tuesday morning that wholesale disclosure of the documents, which include papers on Salmond’s judicial review of the harassment inquiry, the Scottish government’s own legal advice and documents from the original investigation, was “not straightforward” with a “range of restrictions and matters that need to be protected”. While refusing to agree that withholding them represented an “unacceptable level of secrecy”, Wolffe said: “I will be disappointed if [this] doesn’t result in the committee being able to see relevant court documents as far as possible.” As the committee began its session, it also published a letter from Salmond’s solicitor criticising the Scottish government for providing “partial and incomplete evidence”, and stating he was willing to apply to the court of session for the release of relevant documents, but asking the committee to pick up the legal bill. Nicola Sturgeon was asked during her live coronavirus briefing at lunchtime whether her government would hand over the documents to avoid Salmond or the committee going to court to recover them. Sturgeon said she had no role in that decision-making, and would not comment. Wolffe’s undertaking on Tuesday appeared to go further than the deputy first minister, John Swinney, who wrote to the committee on Monday assuring them that the Scottish government was preparing a chronology of the judicial review process, and also “actively exploring what further steps can be taken to enable [them] to have access so far as possible to court documents”. Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, oversaw the botched inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond. He denied the allegations, and mounted a judicial review of the process, which he won in January 2019 after government lawyers admitted in court the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign. In March 2020, Salmond was acquitted of 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, following a trial which heard allegations that civil servants and close aides of Sturgeon had conspired against him, a charge the current first minister has vigorously denied. During the three-hour evidence session, Leslie Evans pushed back at suggestions of an orchestrated campaign against Salmond. She was asked about a widely reported text she sent to a colleague after conceding the judicial review, which read: “We lost the battle but we will win the war.” Evans said: “That has been misinterpreted having some kind of conspiratorial element to it. Can I clearly say that is not the case … I was not referring to any individual when I sent that text, I was referring to a long-term commitment of mine and indeed the Scottish government to ensure that equality lies at the heart of what it does.” Asked directly by the Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser if she was “at war with Alex Salmond”, she replied firmly “No”."
2020-09-08T13:50:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: why the wrangles over state aid?,"Talks on a free trade deal between the UK and the EU have resumed in London this week with state aid emerging as a key sticking point. What is state aid? Margaret Thatcher thought Europe allowed too much of it, Jeremy Corbyn believed there was not enough: but what exactly is state aid? Since the treaty of Rome in 1957, member states have been banned from giving companies or industries special help that would distort competition. Governments cannot hand out subsidies, tax rebates or take stakes in companies “unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development”. But there are many exemptions. In recent years, the EU has relaxed state aid thresholds for “innovation clusters”, broadband, culture and heritage, small and medium-sized companies and local infrastructure. During the coronavirus outbreak and 2008 financial crisis, EU state aid rules were eased to allow emergency bailouts and job-protection subsidies. As an EU member state, the British government took little advantage of flexibilities: in 2018, the UK spent 0.38% of GDP on state aid, compared with 0.79% in France, 1.45% in Germany and 1.55% in Denmark. Why is state aid a problem in Brexit talks? The EU has said it will only grant tariff-free access to the single market if the UK respects European standards on environmental protection, workers’ rights and state aid. Known as “the level playing field” the EU wants to prevent British firms undercutting their European rivals, either by tearing up environmental legislation or by showering companies with government grants or indirect aid. Boris Johnson’s government argues the level playing field defeats the whole purpose of Brexit, by tying the UK to EU rules in perpetuity. Ahead of the latest round of talks this week, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, said its position derived “from the fundamentals of being a sovereign state”. Is that all? There is more. The prime minister is also unhappy about what he agreed with the EU on state aid under the Irish protocol, as part of the broader Brexit withdrawal treaty. To avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to follow a swathe of EU rules, including state aid (the specific EU regulations on state aid are listed over seven pages in the protocol). That means the government must notify Brussels of any state aid affecting Northern Irish companies, potentially meaning any UK company with a presence in the region. No 10 sources have complained the Brexit deal “never made sense” and are planning legislation that will row back parts of the agreement, including on state aid. EU officials strongly reject the suggestion that the Irish protocol lacks clarity, while warning the government against reneging on the deal. What does the UK want? The government is thought to want a free hand to support companies, especially tech start-ups. Behind this vision is the prime minister’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who opposes the UK Competition and Markets Authority becoming a state aid regulator, akin to playing the role of the European commission in Brexit Britain. The government’s policy on state aid is yet to be published. Johnson, who once lauded the EU for pursuing “free trade and free markets” rather than “state aid and cartels”, is yet to make a detailed case for what the government wants. What does the EU want? The EU’s 27 member states set a demanding opening position for the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that proposed keeping the UK in lockstep with EU rules on state aid as they evolve. The Frenchman, however, has indicated he is ready to discuss a softer approach that would allow the UK more freedom. Rather than requiring the UK to follow EU rules to the letter, he proposed devising with the UK “a toolbox”, or common approach. With negotiations stalled, the details remain unclear, but the EU would expect the UK to set up a tough independent regulator to oversee state aid. Can the two sides agree? There is a deal to be done. The EU has signalled some appetite for compromise, but No 10 is keeping Brussels guessing about its true intentions on state aid. The prime minister has a strong economic incentive to compromise on state aid, but the risks of no deal are real. If the talks collapse over the issue, it would be a remarkable turnaround for the party of Margaret Thatcher, who once complained Europe was failing to live up to its own founding treaty, “intended as a charter for economic liberty”. But in the event of no deal, the government would not escape all state aid regulation. The UK would remain bound by World Trade Organization anti-subsidy rules, meaning the EU could impose tariffs on British goods if it believed UK subsidies were harming European industry. Even the government’s “Australia-style” agreement (in reality, no deal) comes with state-aid strings attached."
2020-09-08T13:40:42Z,politics,Politics,UK's top legal civil servant quits over Brexit deal changes,"The head of the UK government’s legal department has become the latest prominent civil servant to quit, after a significant disagreement with the attorney general over plans to override parts of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office confirmed Sir Jonathan Jones had resigned but refused to comment. On Monday, when it emerged the government was planning to table proposals on Wednesday to give ministers unilateral legal powers to oversee elements of the Northern Ireland protocol, the disclosure provoked widespread disquiet because the agreement was already legally binding. Sources confirmed to the Guardian that Jones had clashed with Suella Braverman, the attorney general for England and Wales and advocate general for Northern Ireland, over points of law on several occasions, but most recently over her interpretation of the EU agreement. Jones disagreed with Braverman’s initial interpretation of the legal implications of a no-deal Brexit, and questions were raised about whether government plans to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement were in breach of the ministerial code, which obliged ministers to follow the law, including international law, the Guardian understands. Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, admitted in the House of Commons on Tuesday that the plan “does break international law in a very specific and limited way … There are clear precedents for the UK, and indeed other countries, needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change.”
It is understood that Jones was also aware that stepping outside the law would be a breach of the civil service code, by which he is expected to abide. Downing Street accepted Braverman’s interpretation of the law after seeking external advice from a leading QC, who gave the opinion the move would breach international law, a Whitehall source confirmed. Jones has been heavily involved in many aspects of recent government policy, including Johnson’s controversial decision to prorogue parliament in September last year to avoid scrutiny of Brexit plans. The decision was overturned by the supreme court, which ruled that the prorogation was both justiciable and unlawful. On Tuesday, Jones sent a leaving email to staff in the government’s legal department that did not explain why he had stood down, but praised their work on the legal complexities of leaving the EU. Addressed to “Dear colleagues”, he wrote: “I have completed almost seven years as Treasury solicitor and over 31 as a government lawyer. I am immensely privileged to have had a fascinating and rewarding career in the civil service. I am proud of what we have done to create and build the government legal department, the hard work of you all in GLD, as well as AGO [attorney general’s office] and the wider government legal profession, and the outstanding service you have provided across all areas of government, including the unique legal and constitutional complexities of leaving the EU, and latterly the response to Covid-19.” Jones’ resignation caused unease among many prominent legal figures. Charlie Falconer, the former solicitor general said: “He is very modest, he is very clever, a cerebral lawyer but not pompous and he always saw his role to come up with pragmatic solutions to the government he served. “He backs away from the limelight so I am absolutely amazed. He is absolutely not the sort of person to do something dramatic. He is always practical. He would never have resigned if the QC had advised a different view – he is totally lacking in self-importance.”
Falconer, now shadow attorney general, said the positions of Braverman and of the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, should now be in question, as members of the government which has admitted it intended to break the law. A prominent employment QC, John Bowers, said it was “very worrying to see the resignation of the excellent Jonathan Jones. It feels like we are living through a constitutional coup.” Jessica Simor QC, who sat on three of the attorney general’s lawyers’ panels and was involved in the article 50 Brexit case, told the Guardian: “Officials give impartial advice to ministers which they should follow when it comes to the law. If they are told it’s illegal then they shouldn’t do it, which is presumably why Brandon Lewis did not lie to parliament.” Philippe Sands QC, professor of international law at University College London, said he believed that for Jones the dispute over breaking the international agreement with the EU was “the final straw” following other disputes. “His going raises very serious questions for other civil servants on offering legal advice,” Sands said. “It also raises very serious questions about the UK’s commitment to rule of law. The UK abroad has been renowned for proceeding very carefully. Their respect for a country they have looked up to in its commitment to the rule of law is crumbling. Amongst those charged with giving legal advice to the government, morale is very low.” Legal experts have said the dispute could end up in the European court of justice if it breaches the withdrawal agreement signed by Boris Johnson in January. The court can impose a heavy fine on the UK, suspend part of the withdrawal agreement, launch trade wars and impose tariffs or even sanctions on British exports. Jones becomes the sixth senior Whitehall figure to resign in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald, and the Jonathan Slater from the Department of Education. Sir Philip Rutnam, former permanent secretary at the Home Office, has begun legal proceedings against the department for constructive dismissal. Jones seems to be the latest victim of a drive by No 10 radically to reshape the civil service, a process spearheaded by Johnson’s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, who reportedly told aides that a “hard rain” was heading for uncooperative Whitehall officials. • This article was amended on 9 September 2020. An earlier version said Jessica Simor “sits” on three of the attorney general’s lawyers’ panels; she was previously on those panels before becoming a QC."
2020-09-08T13:25:29Z,politics,Politics,Covid-19 in Britain: a summer of mixed messages,"Public trust in the government’s ability to handle the coronavirus crisis has been tested by a summer of mixed messages, during which advice on the precautions people should be taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, as well as forecasts on the outlook for the UK, have often been contradictory. Here are some of examples. Return to ‘normality’ by Christmas Boris Johnson said: It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November, at the earliest, possibly in time for Christmas. Chris Whitty, chief medical adviser to the UK government, said: There are issues around distancing which have been buried, but the reality is distancing remains an important part of this mix, and how it’s interpreted in different environments has evolved, but it has not gone away. [They] need to continue for a long period of time. Face masks in schools Department for Education in July: Public Health England does not currently recommend the use of face coverings in schools as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups, and because misuse may inadvertently increase the risk of transmission. There may also be negative effects on communication and thus education. Department for Education, a month later: Nationwide, while the government is not recommending face coverings are necessary, schools will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas if they believe that is right in their particular circumstances. Local lockdown rules The rules state: It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law. You should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone’s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on BBC Breakfast: The law that we’re bringing in is that two households cannot meet in the area identified but obviously any two households who are meeting [outside the area] should follow the social distancing guidelines. Going to work in an office Johnson said: I do want people to start to go to work now if you can, but remember to follow the guidance because that is the way to save lives. I think everybody has sort of taken the ‘stay at home if you can’ – I think we should now say, well, ‘go back to work if you can’. Hancock said on Times Radio: What I care about is how effectively people work and obviously people should come back to the office if that is what they need to do their job … What I care about is that people perform and so the people I work with – some of them have been working from home, some come in sometimes, some are full-time – and what matters to me is that they deliver and, frankly, they’ve been delivering at an unbelievable rate. Wearing a mask in a takeaway Hancock said on Sky News: If there is table service, then it is not necessary to have a mask. But in any shop you do need the mask. So, if you’re going up to the counter in Pret [sandwich shop Pret a Manger] to buy a takeaway, that is a shop – that is Pret operating as a shop. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: We will be publishing the full guidance shortly but my understanding is that it wouldn’t be mandatory if you went in, for example, to a sandwich shop in order to get a takeaway to wear a face covering. It is mandatory ... [when] we are talking about supermarkets and other shops, rather than food shops."
2020-09-08T13:05:06Z,politics,Politics,Brexiter Tory MPs urge PM to ditch withdrawal agreement if no deal,"Pro-Brexit Conservative MPs have urged Boris Johnson to ditch the EU withdrawal agreement should no trade deal be reached, claiming they were promised he would do so before they passed the bill in January. Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the steering group of the European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tory MPs, said Brexit would not be done until the UK government had asserted its own interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. Writing in the Diplomat magazine, Jenkin said the group of MPs who destroyed Theresa May’s deal had only voted in favour of Johnson’s because they had been assured the government would ditch the agreement if no trade deal was reached with the European Union.
“We only have a WA [withdrawal agreement] because Eurosceptic Conservatives, such as myself, voted for it to help the nation out of a paralysing political crisis,” Jenkin wrote. “To his credit, the prime minister had ameliorated Mrs May’s agreement. “We made clear, however, that this agreement was barely ‘tolerable’ and only voted for it against assurances given by government: that it was just a starting point for negotiations; that it would be superseded by a full FTA [free trade agreement]; and, if needs be, could be repudiated.” Speaking on Tuesday as the latest round of UK-EU talks began, Jenkin said pro-Brexit Conservatives would demand Johnson renege from that legally binding agreement if no deal is reached within five weeks. “If we don’t reach a deal with the EU, Brexit is not done until the UK government succeeds in its determination to assert its own interpretation of the withdrawal agreement,” the Harwich and North Essex MP said. “If the EU is unwilling to do a deal with us, there are two options. The first is to enact domestic legislation that will largely nullify the direct effect and direct applicability of EU law. We have the mandate and majority to do this. “Second, if the EU insists on an unreasonable interpretation of the withdrawal agreement, the UK must stand ready to repudiate it. I hope it is not necessary, but if it is the only way to achieve UK prosperity and the kind of sovereign independence which is the democratic right of any nation recognised under the UN charter, then so be it. And most other nations would respect us for that.” On Monday, it emerged the government was planning to table proposals on Wednesday to give ministers unilateral legal powers to oversee elements of the Northern Ireland protocol, a disclosure which provoked widespread disquiet because the agreement is already legally binding, but which has been backed by Brexiter MPs. A Downing Street spokesman said they “remain committed to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol” regardless of whether a deal was reached. “The withdrawal agreement was written on the basis that subsequent agreements could be reached between us and the EU on the detail through this joint committee process,” the spokesman said. “That may be possible but as responsible government, we can’t allow damaging default positions to kick in if we can’t agree these as part of the joint committee process.”"
2020-09-07T21:38:23Z,politics,Politics,Leaked EU cables reveal growing mistrust of UK in Brexit talks,"Brussels’ plummeting trust in Boris Johnson has been laid bare in leaked diplomatic cables obtained by the Guardian, as the Brexit negotiations reopen in London with a warning from the European commission president that Britain must respect international law. Ursula von der Leyen made her extraordinary intervention on Monday as Downing Street struggled to control the damage from disclosures suggesting it was backtracking on agreements made last year to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “I trust the British government to implement the withdrawal agreement, an obligation under international law & prerequisite for any future partnership,” Von der Leyen posted on Twitter. “[The] protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is essential to protect peace and stability on the island & integrity of the single market.” The row over plans that could undermine the legal force of parts of the protocol on Northern Ireland came as leaked cables seen by the Guardian reveal the growing suspicion in Brussels of Britain’s motivations and strategy, said by sources to have been further damaged by the latest developments. According to cables sent to EU capitals from Brussels in recent days: Johnson is suspected of holding back on finding a compromise on the key outstanding issues of fisheries, state aid and dispute resolution until the last moment in order to achieve a last-minute “trade off”. The strategy has been described by officials in the chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s team as “concerning” given the complexity of the issues. “These points will not be easy to iron out with just a phone call between leaders,” a commission official had told EU diplomats. “It is leaving it too late.” The European commission fears the home secretary, Priti Patel, will attempt to go round Brussels and open side negotiations on internal security after inviting ministers from the five largest EU member states to a meeting in London on 22 September. Commission officials have asked the capitals to avoid agreeing to any British proposals that are made there. “We need to be clear that nothing can be decided in those fields subject to negotiation,” officials advised. The UK is accused of recently “introducing” a new “concept” in the negotiations over access to British waters for European fishing fleets under which “80% of the common stocks” have been designated as “priority stocks” on which British fishermen have the biggest claim. The commission fears Downing Street is behind a barrage of anti-EU articles in the British press, citing reports accusing Brussels of intransigence directly ahead of the last round of talks. The recent talks between Barnier and the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, were described by the commission as “disappointing”. The revelations provide the worst possible backdrop to the latest round of negotiations, which start in London on Tuesday, with Frost reiterating on Monday night the two sides “must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time”. Although Frost urged the EU to show “more realism about our status as an independent country”, the eve of the talks was dominated by the fallout from the proposals in the government’s internal market bill, due to be published on Wednesday. The former Conservative chancellor Philip Hammond and the ex-justice secretary David Gauke added their voices to growing opposition to the draft legislation, which critics claim will negate key parts of the withdrawal agreement. Gauke said the government would be “taking the most extraordinary risk” if it sought to unilaterally change the protocol through draft legislation due to be published on Wednesday. “Any attempt to backslide from the commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol would be seen as an act of bad faith by the EU and the wider world,” he said. “It would undermine trust and likely result not just in no deal, but an acrimonious no deal.” Hammond tweeted that the government should avoid an “incredibly dangerous step” that he claimed would “hugely damage our standing on the world stage”.
Business leaders also warned that a Brexit deal was essential for safeguarding Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak and avoiding higher prices in the shops for British consumers as pressure mounts on household finances. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, said: “Amid all the noise and negotiations, businesses in the UK and EU remain clear – a good deal is essential. An agreement will be the foundation for post-Covid recovery across the continent.” Furthermore, manufacturers warned that Brexit stockpiles had been depleted during the Covid lockdown and that many firms were running out of cash and time to prepare for leaving the EU. Retailers warned that the price of food and drink could rise due to border disruption, the imposition of tariffs and a weaker pound. “A no deal would be the worst outcome for consumers. It would add hundreds of millions of pounds in tariffs to the cost of the food in British supermarkets, which would lead to higher prices and disproportionally hit the poorest households,” said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. The pound fell on Monday as City investors bet on the growing likelihood of the UK leaving the Brexit transition without a deal. Sterling fell about 1% against the US dollar on Monday to trade below $1.32, and fell by a similar amount against the euro to below €1.12 on the international currency markets.
With critics accusing Downing Street of seeking to blow up the talks by looking to rewrite the hard-negotiated Northern Ireland protocol, government sources were quick to deny it was part of a negotiating strategy, in a sign of some panic at the extent of the backlash. “We have never seen it in those terms,” one senior government source said. “That idea has not come from anyone even close to this place.” UK officials on Monday morning repeatedly stressed how minor the changes will be in the three key areas. The internal market bill will give ministers the power to decide whether or not potential state subsidies need to be reported to the EU, what counts as “at risk” goods that will need to be checked when crossing the Irish Sea, and whether export summary declarations need to be filled in. If no mutual agreement can be reached by the joint committee with the EU, then ministers are likely to define those terms very narrowly, in the UK’s interests. The withdrawal agreement currently stipulates, in contrast, that all goods should be deemed at risk of tariffs in the event of a lack of agreement within the committee. “These are not changes made in good faith,” one EU official said. “But we will see what they actually do.” A UK official briefed on the new powers insisted, however, that Westminster did not believe the new powers undermined the protocol agreed in December. “The government is completely committed, as it always has been, to implementing the NI protocol in good faith,” the official said. “If we don’t take these steps, we face the prospect of legal confusion at the end of the year and potentially extremely damaging defaults, including tariffs on goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland.” A No 10 spokesman insisted that the measures were “limited and reasonable” and that the UK would remain compliant with the Northern Ireland protocol. Another official described them as “minor clarifications in an extremely specific area” – comments aimed at bringing down the temperature in Brussels and Dublin. Hardline Brexiters who initially welcomed the prospect of unpicking the agreement, a move some had been promised was possible when voting for the deal, were irritated by the Downing Street briefing that the changes were minor. “I’d like the UK to make promises it wants to keep,” one senior Brexiteer said. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said: “I would be inclined to repudiate large parts of the withdrawal agreement, because they were agreed on the basis that there would be a trade deal.” He argued that should include ripping up the financial settlement if no trade deal is reached. But Davis questioned the prime minister’s chief aide Dominic Cummings’ focus on securing control over state aid, something No 10 is keen to use to build up the UK’s tech industry, calling it “intrinsically un-conservative”."
2020-09-07T18:28:10Z,politics,Politics,Business leaders warn Boris Johnson that Brexit deal is essential,"Business leaders have warned Boris Johnson that securing a Brexit deal is essential for safeguarding Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak and avoiding higher prices in the shops for British consumers. Sounding the alarm after the prime minister said no deal would be a “good outcome” for Britain and confirmed plans that could undermine the government’s commitment to the EU withdrawal agreement, business groups said failure to compromise in talks this week would severely damage Britain’s fragile economic recovery. “Amid all the noise and negotiations, businesses in the UK and EU remain clear – a good deal is essential. An agreement will be the foundation for post-Covid recovery across the continent,” said Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, the business lobby group. “Getting a deal requires political leadership and compromise from both sides. That is needed urgently in the coming weeks.” Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said few companies would welcome the prospect of no deal. “Even among our members who want to diverge from EU rules, the majority say reaching a deal is important for the economy,” she said. At the outset of a tense week of negotiations between London and Brussels, reports that the UK government could backslide on the EU withdrawal agreement signed in January sent the pound tumbling on the international currency markets. In a shift that could push up the cost of imports to Britain if the sell-off is sustained, sterling fell about 1% against the dollar on Monday to trade below $1.32, and fell by a similar amount against the euro to below €1.12. “The Brexit heat is back on and sterling is, in our view, unprepared,” said Petr Krpata, a currency analyst at the Dutch bank ING, warning that the pound could reach parity with the euro within weeks if the Brexit talks deteriorate further. Raising the temperature in the talks, Johnson issued an ultimatum to negotiators on Monday, saying an agreement must be reached by 15 October or Britain will walk away. However, business leaders warned that British companies were ill-equipped to cope with a no-deal departure from the transition period with the economy in the deepest recession since modern records began. Should a deal fail to be reached in time, business leaders said consumers could face higher prices in the shops as a result of border disruption, tariffs and a weaker pound driving up the cost of imports. “A no deal would be the worst outcome for consumers,” said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. He said hundreds of millions of pounds in tariffs would be added to the cost of food in UK supermarkets after a no-deal departure, disproportionally hitting the poorest households. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said: “While shoppers have rightly come to expect a wide range of products on shop shelves and menus, a no-deal Brexit scenario would result in significant changes to availability, quality and value.” Manufacturers’ groups warned that Brexit stockpiles had been depleted during the Covid lockdown amid widespread disruption to businesses, and that many firms were running out of cash and time to prepare for leaving the EU. Paul Everitt, chief executive of UK aerospace lobby group ADS, said manufacturers relied on complex pan-European supply chains. Calling on both sides to take a more pragmatic approach to minimise disruption, he said: “The economic impact of the pandemic makes the cost of failure in negotiations especially severe. No deal would bring new costs and delays that harm our ability to compete in international markets.”
City investment analysts said the latest developments could be an attempt by the UK to apply maximum pressure on the EU at the onset of talks, before both sides come to a compromise at a later date. Krpata said: “After all, we saw similar fireworks this time last year, only for a deal to materialise weeks later.” However, investors said Johnson could take a tougher Brexit stance because his reputation with backbench Tory MPs has been damaged by his handling of Covid-19. Gilles Moëc, the group chief economist at Axa Investment Managers, said: “Getting Brexit done by year-end with a minimum of concessions to the EU is probably now a matter of political survival for Boris Johnson. “So, the probability of a no-deal Brexit continues to increase, unfortunately.”"
2020-09-07T16:40:22Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: nearly 3,000 new cases for second day; seven Greek islands to join England quarantine list - as it happened","The UK has seen almost 3,000 recorded cases of Covid-19 for a second consecutive day, raising fears of a resurgence in the virus, as Matt Hancock urged young people in particular to stick to social distancing rules. Seven Greek islands are being removed from Englandâ€™s list of locations exempt from 14-day Covid quarantine, in a significant shift in the governmentâ€™s travel corridor policy. Dozens of schools across England and Wales have reported coronavirus outbreaks, prompting some to shut their doors while others have sent staff and pupils home to self-isolate. Fatigue, headache and fever are the most common symptoms of coronavirus in children, with few developing a cough or losing their sense of taste or smell, researchers have found, adding to calls for age-specific symptom checklists. Downing Street has defended plans to give British ministers unilateral powers over Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, putting them on a collision course with the EU and Irish leaders in a week of crunch negotiations. The pound has slumped as investors bet on the growing likelihood of the UK leaving the Brexit transition period at the end of December without a deal, amid reports that Boris Johnsonâ€™s government is preparing to override the EU withdrawal agreement signed with Brussels in January.

2020-09-07T16:35:55Z,politics,Politics,"EU has powers to punish UK if it breaches Brexit treaty, experts warn","The latest Brexit dispute could end up in the European court of justice if it breaches the withdrawal agreement signed by Boris Johnson in January, legal experts have warned. A dispute would trigger a specific legal process ending in the Luxembourg court – and if the UK was found to have breached the international treaty it signed in January, the EU has powers to punish the country. The court can impose a heavy fine on the UK, suspend part of the withdrawal agreement, launch trade wars and impose tariffs or even sanctions on British exports. “Because the agreement is an international treaty, the EU could bring proceedings against the UK, under the dispute resolution mechanism of the agreement,” said Catherine Barnard, a European law professor at Cambridge University. The Brexit process was thrown into jeopardy on Monday when it emerged the government was planning to table proposals on Wednesday to give unilateral legal power to ministers to oversee elements of the Northern Ireland protocol. The disclosure provoked widespread disquiet because the agreement is already legally binding due to the so-called “direct effect” of EU law in the specific parts of the settlement relating to just two areas – Northern Ireland and citizens’ rights.
In the event of a dispute a process would be triggered involving an initial three-month arbitration to try to resolve the matter. “If the arbitration raises issues of EU law, which this absolutely seems to do, then it’s up to the court of justice,” said Barnard. A UK official close to the Brexit talks played down the significance of the move, claiming it was necessary to give ministers these powers to ensure the Good Friday agreement was upheld in the event of no deal. But the official said the internal market bill to be unveiled on Wednesday was designed to uphold the promise that traders in Northern Ireland would have unfettered access to the UK market. “I think this is politics over law,” said Barnard. “I think they are trying to make it clear to the EU that they need to make some movement in the talks and they are using something as sensitive as the Northern Ireland protocol in order to precipitate that. But it is a very high-stakes gamble.” At the heart of the issue is article 5 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which means tariffs are payable on goods entering the Republic of Ireland from another part of the UK via Northern Ireland.
The UK has been arguing that goods that remain in Northern Ireland – for example, food going from Tesco distribution centres in the Midlands to Belfast – should not be liable to duties. It wants ministers in London to draw up the list of the goods “at risk” of going on to the republic, thus minimising the disruption in the internal British market. Sources say the EU’s working assumption is that all goods are at risk of going into the republic – even goods on Tesco shelves – because the region is so small. Lord Ricketts, the chair of the EU security and justice sub-committee, believes this is the real reason behind the new legislation, and accused the government of trying to opt out of parts of the agreement it does not now like. “They signed a treaty containing such checks, then denied it, and now plans to breach the treaty,” he tweeted.

2020-09-07T16:24:36Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock goes haywire taking a spin with Ferrari | John Crace,"It came billed as the first in a series of Call the Cabinet with Nick Ferrari on LBC radio. But just how many weeks it will last is anyone’s guess as most ministers can barely be trusted to complete a coherent sentence let alone go head to head with one of the sharpest presenters on radio. Thirty minutes with Gavin Williamson or Priti Patel? I just can’t see anyone in Downing Street imagining that would be a good idea. First up, though, was Matt Hancock. Of course it was. Matt isn’t just about the closest thing No 10 has to a safe pair of hands apart from Rishi Sunak (and there was no way the chancellor was going to appear; Boris would veto him on the grounds he might be too good) and he is also pathologically hot-wired to be unable to refuse. Put a microphone in front of Tigger, his natural enthusiasm gets the better of him and he just can’t say no. Even after all the beatings he has taken over the past few months. Last week, Hancock had broken with tradition by turning up for an interview in a brand new powder-blue tie, but for LBC he had reverted to his tired and trusted lucky pink number. Just as well as Ferrari immediately had the health secretary on the back foot by pointing out that the UK had just registered its highest number of coronavirus cases for months. Poor Matt was torn between wanting to play down the situation – most of the ill were from the younger demographic – and stick to the government’s preferred message that it was about time people started to go back to work to buy some sandwiches from Pret a Manger and acknowledging that it was indeed a bit of a worry as the same thing had happened in France and Spain a couple of weeks ago and their rates of hospital admission were now increasing rapidly. In the end, Tigger did what Tigger so often does. He hedged his bets. “Have you lost control?” Yeah but no but yeah but no. Ferrari then went to his first caller, a Francis from Twickenham who had been shielding and was worried about his daughter going back to school. “How old is your daughter?” Hancock asked. “Fourteen,” said Francis. Tigger visibly relaxed. There was little risk from 14-year-olds as it was mainly the 17 to 21-year-olds who weren’t obeying the social distancing guidelines, he said. Francis didn’t seem wholly convinced Hancock had understood that not only might his daughter bump into the odd 17-year-old at school or on public transport and might catch the virus that way but that she might pass it on to him. But he had to make do with assurances that everything would probably be OK. Then came the Brexit question that Hancock had been dreading. Terry from Birmingham worked for a medical devices company and wanted to be certain that the recent “no deal” noises coming out of Downing Street weren’t going to have a detrimental effect both on his job and on the nation’s health. “Well, the good news, Terry, is that we have a deal already,” said Matt, “and so, even if we have no further deal, we made an agreement for the actual exit from the EU at the end of January this year.” Um ... yes. Except it’s a deal that Boris Johnson now appears to be keen on unilaterally ripping up. And binning the Northern Ireland protocol in the process. It turned out that when the prime minister had been caught on camera telling a Northern Ireland trade delegation that they could just throw away any customs declarations that came their way he wasn’t joking after all. It was actually government policy. Under Boris, any international treaty the UK had signed could be binned whenever it became an inconvenience. Which didn’t exactly fill anyone with confidence that he could be trusted on any future free trade agreements. But this was all way above Matt’s pay grade. He started stammering, repeating himself and generally lapsing into total incoherence. There was still a good chance of the UK signing a Canada-style deal – something that had taken the EU the best part of seven years – from a standing start in the next month or so, providing the rest of the EU were stupid enough to take us at our word. But if we couldn’t pull this off, then we had a fully prepared alternative in an Australian deal. As in no deal at all. Though with any luck we wouldn’t notice just how bad that would be as the economy would be tanking from the coronavirus crisis anyway.
After questions on care homes and the travel industry that Tigger was also unable to answer sensibly, Nick from Nottingham called to ask how come the world-beating track and trace had advised him to go to Dundee as his nearest coronavirus testing centre. Er ... Scotland was lovely at this time of year and the adviser had obviously thought that the 700-mile round journey might cheer him up a bit. But if Nick didn’t fancy that Matt would try to guarantee that no one had to go more than 150 miles there and back to get a test. And taking the train wouldn’t be a problem as most were barely 25% full. The interview ended in pantomime. Literally, with Hancock all but promising a vaccine in the next two months and a full season of Christmas fun. Oh no it won’t, Ferrari muttered. “Oh yes it will,” said Hancock, not entirely convincingly. “Cheer up,” said his special adviser on the way out. “At least you weren’t eviscerated by Nick Robinson on the Today programme like George Eustice. Poor old Useless was left trying to explain how a 40% tariff on agricultural products would be a good outcome in a no-deal Brexit. Not even you could have talked your way optimistically out of that.”"
2020-09-07T15:35:10Z,politics,Politics,Brexit withdrawal deal: what is No 10 playing at?,"Conservative supporters received an email message from Boris Johnson on Monday, with the subject line: “I will not back down” – echoing the promise of his chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, that “we won’t blink”. Even before the revelation that the government plans to repudiate aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol through domestic legislation – leaked to the Financial Times – the background music to this week’s Brexit negotiations was bombastic. Team Johnson has always believed one of the mistakes Theresa May made in the drawn-out saga of Brexit negotiations was that despite repeatedly insisting, “No deal is better than a bad deal”, she never convinced the EU27 that she was willing to walk away, because, ultimately, she wasn’t.
Johnson has always set out to show that he is. Last year, that meant proroguing parliament and purging his party of moderates. Ultimately, of course, he went on to negotiate a tweaked withdrawal agreement, that involved significant concessions over the status of Northern Ireland. And it is the practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland protocol with which Johnson replaced May’s “backstop” that now appear to be giving at least some in government pause. “There’s a sense that the details of the protocol are mind-boggling – there are many competing interpretations,” said one source with knowledge of the government’s Brexit preparations. As analysts have pointed out from the beginning, the protocol certainly doesn’t seem to accord with Johnson’s repeated assertions that there would be “no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind” on goods crossing the Irish Sea. And there is a nagging fear among Tory backbenchers that the protocol effectively smuggles in Brussels oversight of much of the UK’s state aid regime. So part of what the government appears to be doing in the internal markets bill is legislating for its own preferred reading of the deal. Steve Baker, one of the most vociferous pro-Brexit critics of May’s deal, has previously said he was promised by Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove that the Brexiters could vote for the withdrawal agreement with the confidence the government could change it – a promise that it may yet seek to deliver . This week’s developments are unlikely to be anything to do with the influence of Baker and others in the pro-Brexit group he previously chaired, the European Research Group, because relations are poor, and Baker himself called for Cummings to resign over his trip to Durham in May. And No 10 was keen to insist on Monday that ministers are not, in effect, planning to use domestic legislation to tear up the withdrawal agreement; merely ensuring that the UK is prepared for the situation in which no free trade agreement is reached. But the move is likely to be read in Brussels (and among Johnson’s own MPs) as part of the broader context – which is a government ready to play hardball. There are at least some good reasons to think this is partly theatre. One is domestic politics: Johnson is already irked at Keir Starmer’s framing of his government as “incompetent”. Failing to secure a trade deal would give the Labour leader another front on which the prime minister’s promises could be compared unfavourably to reality. Moreover, the added disruption to trade from a no-deal outcome would come at an extremely challenging time, when the economy remains severely disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. But it’s also true that there is something at stake here that Johnson and his team believe is important. The prime minister and his gang of Vote Leave veterans have always placed heavy weight on the necessity for “divergence” – not least on state aid, one of the knotty issues the EU has insisted on resolving up front. Gove, Johnson and Gisela Stuart – since ennobled – lined up at an election campaign event to tell ex-Labour voters that the ability to swiftly bail out struggling firms would be one of the advantages of leaving the EU. Yet Brussels-watchers say there is some flexibility in the EU’s stance on state aid, which is there to be exploited, if only the UK would publish its own proposals. So there are hefty issues at stake in the negotiations, which matter to Johnson, Cummings and their idea of what Brexit means. But it is too early to declare the prospects of an agreement dead. As last year’s Brexit drama showed, like his great admirer across the Atlantic, Johnson also likes to show that he understands the art of the deal."
2020-09-07T14:56:34Z,politics,Politics,Alarm in Dublin and Belfast over Boris Johnson's Brexit threat,"As Ireland, north and south, grappled with Boris Johnson’s reported threat to renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, there was consternation, anxiety, dread – and the hope that it is a bluff. In Dublin, the Irish government attempted to project a sense of concern rather than panic while in Belfast political parties sounded the alarm over the revived prospect of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. All sides – diplomats and politicians, nationalists and unionists – tried to determine whether Downing Street was posturing or serious about unpicking legally binding special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said media reports that London was planning legislation to override parts of the withdrawal agreement would, if confirmed, damage 11th-hour trade talks with the EU. “It would fundamentally undermine trust between the two parties,” he told RTE. Coveney said Dublin did not know if the threat, first reported by the FT, was a false report, political gamesmanship or a real prospect. “We’ll have to wait and see.” There is grave concern in Dublin that a hard border on the island of Ireland and severe economic disruption from a no-deal Brexit – its nightmare scenario – will materialise. Coveney’s earlier warning that unravelling the withdrawal agreement would be “unwise” showed mastery of the supposedly British art of understatement, said Bobby McDonagh, a former Irish ambassador. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is to unveil an updated Brexit readiness plan on Wednesday amid a dire economic backdrop and Covid-19 resurgence. Billy Kelleher, an MEP from the ruling Fianna Fáil party, said he initially dismissed rumours that Britain may bypass the Northern Ireland protocol as a “wind-up” given its impact on Britain’s credibility. “This is an incredibly worrying time for Ireland, the rest of the EU and indeed the UK. No good can come from this level of brinkmanship. People’s livelihoods are being bartered away by the Tories in a way reminiscent of the 18th or 19th century and not of the modern era.” Kelleher said he believed the threat was a ploy and urged Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, to stand firm. In Northern Ireland, nationalist parties warned that rowing back on legally binding commitments would undermine the 1998 Good Friday agreement and destabilise the region. “The impact will be negative, and the only safeguards we have to mitigate the damage is the protocol,” said Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minister and Sinn Féin’s deputy leader. “This would be a betrayal of what has already been agreed and would inflict irreversible harm on our economy and the Good Friday agreement.” O’Neill said Sinn Féin would seek to rally support in Northern Ireland’s Stormont assembly as well as Dublin, Brussels and Washington to defend the “foundation stones” of the peace process. Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said it was astonishing and reckless that the British government would shred its own credibility and undermine the Good Friday agreement. “They’d be risking a hard border in our country and they’d be threatening the peace and security that we’ve built up over decades,” he told the BBC. “If they try to do this at the same time as trying to convince people in Scotland and Northern Ireland about the future of their union, well they may as well forget about that as well.” The Alliance party also voiced concern at potential damage to the Good Friday agreement. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), which opposed special arrangements for Northern Ireland, made no immediate official response. On Friday its leader, Arlene Foster, said she recognised the protocol was law and that the challenge was to mitigate its impact, only to have the rug pulled from under her by Downing Street’s announcement. Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesperson, said the party would not accept the withdrawal agreement – a flat contradiction of his leader that was not issued through the party’s press office."
2020-09-07T12:48:51Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street defends Brexit plans for Northern Ireland,"Downing Street has defended plans to give British ministers unilateral powers over Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, putting them on a collision course with the EU and Irish leaders in a week of crunch negotiations. A No 10 spokesman said the measures were “limited and reasonable” and insisted the UK would remain compliant with the Northern Ireland protocol – despite anger from Brussels and Dublin at the plans leaked overnight. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, warned Boris Johnson not to break international law and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, also reiterated that the EU “demand[s] quite simply, and calmly, and until the end, that the political commitments in the text agreed by Johnson be legally translated into this treaty”. Johnson’s spokesman said the peace process or the UK’s internal market could “inadvertently be compromised by unintended consequences of the protocol”. He said the steps taken in two forthcoming bills would “clarify specific elements of the Northern Ireland protocol in domestic law to remove any ambiguity” and said it would deliver on a manifesto commitment to ensure Northern Ireland’s businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the UK. Government sources said they needed legislation to give ministers powers to fully implement the protocol after Brexit, something that has astonished the Irish government, which is 100% happy that the protocol is legally watertight. A UK official admitted this would set Britain on a collision course with the EU with “some debate in the EU legal profession who will want clarity on how it will work vis a vis direct effect”. This is a reference to the EU laws that allow individuals or companies to sue, which will disappear in the UK after Brexit but will continue to apply in Northern Ireland under the special Brexit protocol. Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law at Cambridge University, said: “This is politics over law. I think they are trying to make it clear to the EU that they need to make some movement in the talks and they are using something as sensitive as the Northern Ireland protocol in order to precipitate that. But it is a very high-stakes gamble.” A UK official briefed on the new powers, which will be set out in the internal market bill and the finance bill over the coming weeks, said Westminster did not believe the new powers undermined the NI protocol agreed in December – a statement likely to be hotly contested in Brussels. “The government is completely committed, as it always has been, to implementing the NI protocol in good faith,” a UK official said. “If we don’t take these steps we face the prospect of legal confusion at the end of the year and potentially extremely damaging defaults, including tariffs on goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland. “We are making minor clarifications in extremely specific areas to ensure that, as we implement the protocol, we are doing so in a way that allows ministers to always uphold and protect the Good Friday peace agreement.” It is understood officials have advised that these powers must be introduced in the internal market bill and the finance bill, before negotiations conclude, in order to complete the legislation before the transition period finishes at the end of the year. Under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will stay in the EU’s single market regardless of whether there is a new deal with the EU on trade and security by the end of the year, including its rules on state subsidies for businesses, known as state aid. The bloc’s customs code will also be implemented in full on goods coming into the province from the rest of the UK, requiring checks. However, the legislation planned by the UK government seeks to very narrowly define the obligation to notify Brussels of subsidy decisions for it to approve. Clauses in the bill could also dispense with the requirement for local businesses to file customs paperwork when sending goods into the rest of the UK. A Downing Street spokesman said the UK was committed to the protocol regardless of achieving a deal and that Johnson had been consistent about how he would proceed. “The PM has always been publicly clear about what our interpretation of both the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol was, he publicly set out there would be no export summary declarations on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and he also ruled out tariffs on goods moving from GB to NI on several occasions,” the spokesman said. “He set out those positions in advance of the EU signing agreement.”"
2020-09-07T09:13:46Z,politics,Politics,Von der Leyen warns UK against breaking international law over Brexit deal,"Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, has warned Boris Johnson not to break international law as her Brexit negotiator said he would seek answers over claims that Downing Street is planning to negate parts of the withdrawal agreement. “I trust the British government to implement the withdrawal agreement, an obligation under international law & prerequisite for any future partnership,” Von der Leyen tweeted. “Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is essential to protect peace and stability on the island & integrity of the single market.” The commission president was responding to reports that the government is planning legislation to override parts of the withdrawal agreement struck last year that seek to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Ahead of the start on Tuesday of the latest round of trade and security negotiations with the British government, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, also reiterated that the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal deal was a “prerequisite for peace since the end of the conflict ... and it’s the prerequisite for a united and coherent economy for the entire island, and also to respect the single market”. “Everything that has been signed must be respected,” Barnier told France Inter radio. “We demand quite simply, and calmly, and until the end, that the political commitments in the text agreed by Boris Johnson be legally translated into this treaty. “The important thing for me is what the prime minister says and does, and what the British government itself says and does,” he said. Whether there is a new deal with the EU on trade and security or not by the end of the year, under the withdrawal agreement Northern Ireland will stay in the EU’s single market from 2021 including its rules on subsidies, known as state aid. The bloc’s customs code will also be implemented in full on goods coming into the province from the rest of the UK, requiring checks.
The Financial Times reported that the government was, however, seeking to very narrowly define the obligation to notify Brussels of subsidy decisions for it to approve. Clauses in the bill could also dispense with the requirement for local businesses to file customs paperwork when sending goods into the rest of the UK. The options are reported to be contained within the internal market bill due to be published on Wednesday. Fallback legislation will be necessary anyway should the Northern Ireland assembly vote to reject the withdrawal agreement’s protocol during periodic votes, as is permitted under the treaty, and the full details of the upcoming legislation are yet to be spelled out. But the suggestion that the UK might be seeking to renege on its deal with Brussels in the event of the troubled trade and security negotiations breaking down brought swift denunciations on Monday. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, who helped broker the original Brexit settlement, tweeted that unravelling the withdrawal agreement would be “a very unwise way to proceed”. The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and vice- president of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill, said on social media: “As the Brexit negotiations between the EU and British government enter their eighth round this week in London, any threats of a rollback on the Irish protocol would represent a treacherous betrayal which would inflict irreversible harm on the all-Ireland economy, and [Good Friday agreement].” The UK’s chief negotiator David Frost and Barnier will re-engage in negotiations in London on Tuesday with expectations low for any progress. The two sides are at loggerheads on future access to British waters for European fishing fleet and the UK’s plans for its domestic subsidy regime from next year. The EU is pushing for a linkage between its rule book any future UK system for controlling the level of domestic subsidies to ensure there is fair competition between British and European businesses. Downing Street has insisted there is no precedent for such a linkage between subsidy rules in free trade deals. With common ground proving difficult to find, Johnson has issued a statement effectively setting a five-week deadline for agreement to be found. Downing Street has been concerned that the EU planned to stretch talks deep into October, prolonging uncertainty. The prime minister said: “There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European council on 15 October if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year. So there is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point. If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free-trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.” In response, Germany’s ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, called for calm and dismissed claims that the EU’s negotiating aims involved surrendering British sovereignty. He tweeted: “After the Brexit remarks of PM I wonder if can still claim being an independent country. Is party to hundreds of international treaties. Underlying compromises have certainly not eroded our sovereignty. Same would hold true of a Brexit deal. Let’s get on with it!” In Brussels, EU diplomats were weary of what is being seen as further posturing by Downing Street. “We all remember what happened the last time when someone wanted ‘to put a tiger in a tank and ‘add a bit of oomph in the negotiations”, one said. “Message spinning and posturing is all fine, but it doesn’t really bring us an inch closer to a solution. There has been absolutely no movement from the British side in the talks yet. If this approach doesn’t change quickly, we will be on a road to no-deal with all its negative economic consequences.” The diplomatic source added: ““More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government. “If No. 10 really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff edge for ideological reasons, there would be absolutely no way for the EU to stop this. If, on the other hand, the UK’s approach became more pragmatic and realistic, there would probably be a good chance to save the negotiations and agree on a deal in October.”"
2020-09-07T08:47:49Z,politics,Politics,Why is the UK seeking to unpick the EU withdrawal agreement?,"Brexit talks have been thrown into jeopardy after revelations that the UK government is to table legislation that will unpick some of the withdrawal agreement that Boris Johnson signed with the EU in January. It is one of the most startling turns in the four-year Brexit saga. Opinion is divided as to whether this is sabre-rattling that will force the EU into a trade deal, or whether it will ultimately torpedo the talks. What is this legislation? The internal market bill is due to be published on Wednesday and will include elements that are expected to “eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement”. The government is seeking to override the Northern Ireland protocol that requires checks on goods, animals and food crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain into Ireland and rules on state aid for British firms. It is effectively giving the UK unilateral powers at ministerial level to decide what goods will go through the full panoply of checks and tariffs and which goods will not. In July a white paper was published on the internal market, which is designed to ensure trading rules are the same in all four nations of the UK. The internal market legislation has already proved unpopular with the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland because of proposals for bodies that will ensure trading standards are uniform across the four nations. What is the government saying? Details are not known yet but government sources have confirmed the Financial Times report describing it as a “sensible fallback” in case the ongoing Brexit trade talks collapse and the UK leaves the single market and the customs union without a deal when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said the government was “committed” to the withdrawal agreement, and the Northern Ireland deal had always included “loose ends” that needed to be tidied up, including “the type of administrative customs processes” that will be implemented on goods crossing the Irish Sea. What is the reaction in Ireland? The plans have astonished the Irish government. Simon Coveney, the foreign affairs minister, who was central to the negotiations that led to the withdrawal agreement, has said it was a “very unwise” move. Neale Richmond, an MP from the same party, who also takes a keen interest in Brexit, described the reports as “extremely worrying”. Richmond said: “The withdrawal agreement is an international treaty with obligations to international law. It cannot simply be overridden with domestic legislation. No doubt our negotiator, Michel Barnier, will approach this in a calm and patient manner as ever, but one must wonder: if the British government seriously intend to proceed along this path in order to sate domestic difficulty then why would anyone sign any treaty with them in the future?” Can the UK break the withdrawal agreement? The withdrawal agreement is an international treaty and legally binding. This is why the Irish, with the full backing of the EU, were so keen to get the arrangements for the Irish border nailed down in the withdrawal agreement. They knew the UK could not subsequently wriggle out of the deal without risking its international reputation as a trustworthy nation that stands by its legal commitments. Practically, however, the government can do what it likes as it has an 80-strong majority. A UK official acknowledged the move would cause some “debate” with the EU. Others have said the move could be seen to be a draconian manoeuvre aimed at opting out of the full commitments on Northern Ireland. Is the timing significant? The revelations emerged on the eve of the resumption of talks on trade and the UK’s future relationship with the EU. The eighth round of negotiations are to start on Tuesday and the outlook is bleak. Downing Street is saying the legislation had to be tabled in order to get it on to the statue books by 1 January. Others say the government knew how sensitive the Northern Ireland protocol was and deliberately chose it to force the EU to compromise on other elements in the talks. What is the mood? Nobody expects progress in the talks this week. Multiple sources say a leader-level political summit is now the only way to break the impasse. What is on the agenda?
There are 11 “tables” of themed negotiations, including fair trade, governance, nuclear energy and mobility of social security rights for British and EU citizens affected by Brexit. What are the stumbling blocks in talks? The main two stumbling blocks are state aid and fisheries. The EU is concerned that after Brexit the UK will start pumping money into businesses, giving it a competitive advantage over EU member state factories and services. Downing Street wants the freedom to do just that as part of its levelling up programme and as part of a strategic effort to boost tech industries in the UK. UK officials say the EU has nothing to be concerned about as the UK has repeatedly made it clear it “will not be a high subsidy regime”. Neither, they say, will Boris Johnson be taking orders from Brussels to share plans on state aid. Although it represents less than 0.1% of GDP, fisheries remains a totemic issue for Brexit-supporting communities, and therefore of political value. Again, the EU protests that the UK has yet to put forward a legal text for line-by-line discussion about a deal."
2020-09-07T07:32:30Z,politics,Politics,"Reneging on Brexit deal would strengthen case for breaking up UK, government told","Reneging on any obligations under the Brexit withdrawal agreement would make the case for breaking up the UK stronger, the government has been warned, as a minister defended the plan as simply addressing “a few minor loose ends”. After it emerged Boris Johnson is drawing up legislation that will override the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland, threatening the collapse of talks with the EU, the SNP said leaving without a deal would cause “lasting damage to Scottish jobs and the economy in the middle of a pandemic”. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader, said “By threatening to undermine the UK’s international treaty obligations and impose a catastrophic no-deal Brexit on Scotland against our will, the prime minister is proving he cannot be trusted and is underlining the need for Scotland to become an independent country.” Johnson is to put an ultimatum to negotiators this week, saying the UK and Europe must agree a post-Brexit trade deal by 15 October or Britain will walk away for good. Ahead of his comments, the Financial Times reported that the UK could row back parts of the UK’s agreement with the EU on state aid and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is understood the UK government believes the original protocol is drafted ambiguously enough to allow for a change of interpretation, something likely to be bitterly disputed in Brussels. A UK government source told the Guardian the plan was part of the preparation for a no-deal exit that would present a number of new barriers to trade from Northern Ireland. Asked about the proposals, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said such a move would merely tackle “a few minor loose ends”, adding: “We’re not moving the goalposts.”
Eustice confirmed that any changes to the withdrawal agreement, hailed by Johnson before December’s general election as forming an “oven-ready” deal with the EU, would be connected to trade between businesses in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. He told Sky News that while it was accepted that “some checks on some goods” would be needed, for example for agri-foods, some areas were not pinned down by the withdrawal agreement. “The point about all this is, there’s been this conundrum about the negotiations on leaving the European Union around how we handle that very special relationship with Ireland,” he said. “The news this morning can exaggerate certain things. The point is that the Northern Ireland protocol is agreed, we’re working with that in good faith. But it was always recognised there were a few minor technical issues that still needed to be resolved through a joint committee process. Where there are legal ambiguities at the end of that, on things like exit declarations and things like that, we need to provide businesses with the certainty they need.” However, the idea of the UK government seeking to rewrite an international agreement it signed up to only months ago is likely to be seen in a very different light by others. Labour said the prime minister was “threatening to renege on the UK’s legal obligations” and called it “an act of immense bad faith: one that would be viewed dimly by future trading partners and allies around the world”. The news was condemned by Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, who helped broker the original Brexit settlement. He said any change would be “very unwise”. On Monday, the prime minister will set a firm deadline of 15 October – the date of the European council – for a deal to be signed, with the mood bleak as formal talks resume this week between the UK’s lead negotiator, David Frost, and the EU’s Michel Barnier. If no agreement is reached before the deadline, the UK will “move on” and accept that a deal cannot be struck, Johnson will say, adding that no deal would be a “good outcome”. The prime minister will strike a belligerent tone, suggesting there will be no movement from the deadline and claiming the UK is ready to trade on World Trade Organization terms from January. “There is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point,” he will say. “If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.” Johnson and his allies have repeatedly said they did not believe earlier negotiations made the threat of no deal tangible enough. EU officials had previously said the deadline would be the end of October. Sources close to the talks have suggested fresh faces and interventions by member states are now needed to break the impasse after days of recriminations."
2020-09-07T07:08:10Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Boris Johnson to override EU withdrawal agreement,"Boris Johnson is drawing up legislation that will override the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland, a move that threatens the collapse of crunch talks which the prime minister has said must be completed within five weeks. Johnson will put an ultimatum to negotiators this week, saying the UK and Europe must agree a post-Brexit trade deal by 15 October or Britain will walk away for good. But progress on the already fragile talks will be threatened by plans revealed on Sunday for the UK government to publish a controversial section of the internal market bill on Wednesday that will intentionally try to unpick parts of the withdrawal agreement signed in January. It will include elements of the special arrangements for Northern Ireland that are legally binding. A UK government source told the Guardian the plan was part of the preparation for a no-deal exit that would present a number of new barriers to trade from Northern Ireland – and accepted that the move was likely to blow up at the negotiations this week. Labour said the prime minister was “threatening to renege on the UK’s legal obligations” and called it “an act of immense bad faith: one that would be viewed dimly by future trading partners and allies around the world”. The news was condemned by Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, who helped broker the original Brexit settlement. He said any change would be “very unwise”.
The move, first reported by the Financial Times, would row back parts of the UK’s agreement with the EU on state aid and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is understood that the UK government believes the original protocol is drafted ambiguously enough to allow for a change of interpretation – a view likely to be fiercely contested by Brussels. A government spokesperson said it was hopeful that a deal could still be reached. “As a responsible government, we are considering fall-back options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected.” Key figures close to the negotiations have already warned that EU leaders and heads of state must intervene before the end of the month to save the talks from collapse. On Monday, the prime minister will set a firm deadline of 15 October – the date of the European council – for a deal to be signed, with the mood bleak as formal talks resume this week between the UK’s lead negotiator, David Frost, and the EU’s Michel Barnier. If no agreement is reached before the deadline, the UK will “move on” and accept that a deal cannot be struck, Johnson will say, adding that no deal would be a “good outcome”. The prime minister will strike a belligerent tone, suggesting there will be no movement from the deadline and claiming the UK is ready to trade on World Trade Organization terms from January. “There is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point,” he will say. “If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.” Johnson and his allies have repeatedly said they did not believe earlier negotiations made the threat of no deal tangible enough. EU officials had previously said the deadline would be the end of October. Sources close to the talks have suggested fresh faces and interventions by member states are now needed to break the impasse after days of recriminations. Raoul Ruparel, one of the leading advisers in Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating team, suggested the dynamics needed to change. “It is just Frost and Barnier and the same teams in talks; you’ve got two immovable objects sitting down again and you are not going to see great movement coming from that,” he said. “There needs to be some change, some sort of fresh input, political input … If we come to the end of the year and we don’t have a deal between two close allies, that would look ridiculous, but with the two sides entrenched, where the mechanism is for unlocking the talks is not obvious.” Johnson will characterise the result of no deal as a “a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s”, saying the UK would have full control of its laws and fishing waters and would “prosper mightily as a result”. He will say the UK would find “sensible accommodations on practical issues such as flights, lorry transport, or scientific cooperation, if the EU wants to do that.” Industry leaders have previously said no deal would spell disaster for the country, with tariffs imposed on goods sending costs for industry and consumers soaring. Last week an LSE economics professor, Thomas Sampson, said no deal could cost more than the economic shock of Covid, causing a £3.3tn decline in the value of the UK’s output. Johnson will say negotiators will continue to work hard to try to close a deal. “Even at this late stage, if the EU are ready to rethink their current positions and agree this, I will be delighted. But we cannot and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country to get it.” There are worries that European leaders, preoccupied with the Covid-19 recovery plan and foreign policy crises in Belarus and the eastern Mediterranean, appear to have no appetite to intervene in Brexit talks for now. There remain three stumbling blocks: state aid, fisheries and governance. The EU has protested that the UK is refusing to put forward proposals, while the UK is accusing Barnier of trying to force it to cut a deal on the “difficult” areas first and failing to engage on easier challenges such as fishing rights. While some national capitals favour a tougher negotiating stance than the one being pursued by Barnier, they appear content to leave the talks in his hands, fuelling fears that there will be no deal if back channels are not created to test new ideas in confidence. One UK government source said member state engagement had been minimal, but more direct approaches with EU leaders could be imminent. “Our broad view has been that will come in the next few weeks,” the source said. “The nature of these negotiations is that bigger players will start to get involved when we reach the final stages.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the Brexit negotiations were approaching a “moment of reckoning” and that a deal was “there for the taking”. UK officials are keen to start technical work on the bulk of the trade agreement on goods and services, for example on service schedules. “If we can’t start talking about legal texts this week, it is going to be difficult to get all the work done in the time available,” a UK official said. A last-minute political intervention would be high-risk, say EU sources. “Ursula von der Leyen isn’t as interested in Brexit as [Jean-Claude] Juncker was,” the source said, referring to the European commission president and her predecessor. “You get the impression she just wants to move on and the same for any member states.” Fears that talks were on the verge of collapse were heightened in the last 24 hours after Frost said the government was not “scared” of walking away. His remarks in the Mail on Sunday led to recriminations, with May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell saying Frost had a “brass neck”."
2020-09-07T06:00:46Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan faces calls from Labour to scrap Silvertown road tunnel,"The shadow minister for climate change has called on the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to abandon his plans for a new four-lane road tunnel under the Thames. Matthew Pennycook, who is also a local MP, said there was still time for the Labour mayor to reverse the plans for the £1.2bn Silvertown tunnel project, which is opposed by environmentalists, climate scientists and many local residents. “There is time to think again,” said Pennycook. “Serious works have not started and the financial situation at TfL [Transport for London] may lead to a reassessment of the project’s viability.” Opponents of the scheme say it will be environmentally destructive, undermining efforts to clean up the capital’s polluted air as well as the mayor’s wider green targets – with dire consequences for some of London’s most vulnerable citizens. Pennycook was appointed by Keir Starmer to the climate change role and is MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, the location of the tunnel’s southern entrance. Along with another local MP, Lyn Brown, he has written to Khan outlining their objections and urging the mayor to review the project.
“Green transport must be the future for our city,” they state in the letter. “That means a focus not on road-building but on large-scale investment in adapted public transport, ensuring more frequent and reliable bus and rail services; and measures to significantly boost walking and cycling.” They add that the “perilous state” of Transport for London finances “is reason enough to review the case for embarking on a major capital project of this scale, particularly given that the future health and prosperity of our city is more and more dependent on us reducing our reliance on cars”. In June, a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found the Silvertown tunnel was incompatible with the Greater London Authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. Campaigners insist the plans are fatally flawed and will be environmentally destructive, bringing no economic benefit. In a sign of the growing opposition to the scheme, Extinction Rebellion activists staged an anti-Silvertown tunnel protest last week, carrying posters demanding: “Community not cars,” and vowing to make the plans a key issue during next year’s mayoral elections. A spokesperson for Khan defended the scheme, saying it was essential to improve river crossings in east London. “A new tunnel at Silvertown is important because the existing infrastructure is both antiquated and worn out, and it will be funded by a toll, not TfL cash. “Crucially, the tunnel will provide a public-transport-focused river crossing with improved bus links across the Thames.” They added that the combination of introducing tolls on both the existing Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown, as well as the extension of the ultra-low emission zone from 2021, would “play a crucial role in tackling congestion and improving air quality”."
2020-09-07T05:00:44Z,politics,Politics,"'Economic peanuts, political dynamite': how fishing rights could sink a UK-EU trade deal","Fishing has always been one of the biggest hurdles to a post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK. Now it is becoming one of the most bitter. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week accused the government of treating European fishermen and women as “a bargaining chip”, while vowing that there would be no trade deal without a “fair and sustainable” agreement on fishing. Hitting back at Barnier’s speech, which also covered trade, a UK source said it was “a deliberate and misleading caricature of our proposals aimed at deflecting scrutiny from the EU’s own positions, which are wholly unrealistic and unprecedented”. The acrimony of the debate has some echoes with the British entry negotiations to join the European Community 50 years ago, when the government was presented with a fait accompli on fishing. Only eight hours after accession talks had begun on 30 June 1970, the British got an unwelcome surprise: the six EC members had agreed to have a common fisheries policy (CFP), hammering out a speedy deal that had eluded them for 12 years just as fish-rich Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway were knocking at the door. “I think they knew quite well they had pulled a sharp one,” Sir Richard Packer, a former British official involved in entry negotiations in 1971-2, told the Guardian. Fishing became one of the most poisonous issues of entry talks, leading British officials to doubt whether they would get enough votes in parliament to join the common market. (Norway rejected EC entry over fishing.) “The question of fisheries was economic peanuts, but political dynamite,” wrote the late Sir Con O’Neill, the UK chief negotiator, in his account of the talks from 1972. Half a century later, the 100 shared stocks that swim in UK and EU waters are once again proving politically explosive. And British negotiators are finding that history is in the negotiating room, as well as politics and geography. But the EU sees the past differently. Mogens Schou, who spent 32 years as a fisheries official for Denmark’s government from 1981, disagrees with the idea that the British got a bad deal when the details of the CFP were finally worked out in the early 1980s. “I don’t remember strong dissatisfaction from the UK with regard to quota sharing. I think this is underlined by [UK] minister Peter Walker’s smile, when he in 1983 described the agreement as a ‘superb agreement for British fishermen’,” said Schou, citing an article he kept from Fishing News. “Superb is way over the top,” said Packer, who was the UK’s lead CFP negotiator and later the top official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. “But that’s the way politicians always claim these things, don’t they – but we did quite well to get where we did,” he said, citing concessions that increased UK catch quotas, with the aim of protecting small fishing communities, mostly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. But it wasn’t easy, he added. “We were labouring uphill to get any change.” The UK is once again labouring uphill to convince the EU to drop the tough negotiating mandate member states have written for Barnier on fish. Led by eight member states that fish in British waters, the EU’s opening position was that the UK should accept the status quo, meaning European boats can continue to fish a rich harvest in British waters. More than half (58%) the fish and shellfish landed from the UK’s 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone by EU boats was caught by non-UK boats, according to a 2016 report from the University of the Highlands and Islands. For Boris Johnson’s government, Brexit means the status quo must go. British negotiators want bigger catches, based on where fish live, rather than the historical claims of foreign fishermen. Even Barnier, a former French fisheries minister, has described both EU and UK positions as “maximalist”. Speaking to the House of Lords in June, Barnier said he was willing to negotiate something “between those two extreme positions” [of the EU and UK] that “would take account” of the UK’s preferred “zonal attachment” model. But the UK must compromise too, Barnier said, citing EU fishing claims that date back centuries, as well as coastal towns and villages dependent on the industry. EU negotiators think a deal can be done on fisheries, but after a fruitless summer of talks, Barnier lamented last week that “the UK has not shown any willingness to seek compromises”. Packer thinks the EU will have “to cave in”, saying: “If everything should carry on in relation to fishing, why should it not carry on in relation to financial markets?” However, Schou wants his government to defend Denmark’s “strong interest” in access to fisheries. Schou says: “If I was a Danish official, my advice would be to stick to the mandate that Michel Barnier has got. To me it is not a question of rights, but about negotiating a package on mutual interests in fishing, in trade relations and banking, and what you can put on the table.” For now, EU member states are sticking to this line. “The mandate stays,” one senior EU diplomat told the Guardian, claiming historical rights dating back to the 14th century. But other member states think the EU is out on a limb. “If the French play harder and harder and put Britain in the corner, it makes it harder for Berlin to defend,” said another senior diplomat. “I think we need a compromise on our side.” The two retired officials suggest the final compromise may not be a million nautical miles from one feature of the status quo – annual ministerial haggling over catch quotas in airless rooms. Packer points to precedent – the current system within the EU, where total allowable catches [TACs] are agreed each year, based on a formula for sharing the stocks. “We are not asking for any more than the EU demands in relation to its negotiations with Norway.” Schou points out that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea obliges the UK and EU to cooperate on shared stocks. He thinks the final result could be compared to the internal policy of the EU, “where we have heated discussions on TACs and technical rules, but no discussions on allocation”, meaning the formula to divide catches between the EU and UK must be agreed in current negotiations. British ministers could be sparring in Brussels on cod and sprat quotas for years to come."
2020-09-06T16:13:24Z,politics,Politics,Tony Abbott is the last person Britain needs,"UK citizens are right to raise concerns about the appointment of the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as an official trade adviser (Report, 4 September). Boris Johnson notes that Abbott was elected by the “great liberal democratic nation of Australia”, but he fails to note that Abbott broke almost every election promise he made, except his promise to remove the carbon tax that was actually working to reduce Australia’s CO2 emissions. Abbott is renowned for making claims that appeal to his supporters, such as that the science behind climate change is “absolute crap”, but seems to rarely base his actions on evidence. It is likely that Abbott’s climate stance contributed to the Australian government ignoring pleas from fire chiefs for more resources to combat what was predicted to be a disastrous fire season in 2019, resulting in Australia’s worst fires in living memory, a consequence of climate change. It was even more galling that Abbott was given Australia’s top honours for his work with indigenous communities, given that he axed half a billion dollars from activities aimed at helping our First Nations people. To take Australia’s top job on a litany of lies was an arrogant abuse of the democratic process, and it was unsurprising that he was deposed in an internal coup less than two years later. Given China’s economic retaliation against Australia for expressing concern about their political motives, Australia is keen for new trade deals. Anyone could do this job. Tony Abbott is the last person you need. Dr Tim Davis Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia • As an Australian who has had to endure Tony Abbott’s contributions to politics for 25 years, I’m astounded to read that someone in the UK – the health secretary, Matt Hancock – suggested he was an “expert in trade”. His ministerial roles were in the Howard government, all domestic portfolios: minister for employment services; minister for employment, workplace relations and small business; and minister for health and ageing. He then spent time in opposition, ultimately becoming the Liberal party leader, which led to him becoming prime minister when the Coalition won government in the 2013 election. Aside from two years as PM, he has never held an international ministerial portfolio or trade role, and I can’t recall any international trade deals being negotiated while he was PM. So what’s made people think he’s an expert on trade? Don Dryley Greensborough, Victoria, Australia • In light of his diminished standing in his own party and the country, perhaps it’s not Tony Abbott’s experience of trade negotiations that Boris Johnson is hoping to learn from, but rather his experience of being ditched as prime minister and party leader in his first term in office. David Wall Northampton • Connoisseurs of the wit and wisdom of Tony Abbott still cherish the speech he gave a few years ago in which he said: “No one, however smart … is the suppository of all wisdom.” Now, thanks to YouTube, we can all share this penetrating insight. Fundamentally, his finest hour. Michael Zagor London • Is anyone else wondering why Tony Abbott would cross the world to take up an unpaid position as a trade adviser for our government?

2020-09-06T10:46:10Z,politics,Politics,"UK's chief Brexit negotiator has 'brass neck', says former May aide","Theresa May’s former chief of staff has accused the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, of having a “brass neck” after he said the UK government had “blinked first” in negotiations. Gavin Barwell, a key member of the former prime minister’s negotiating team, said Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement was “95% the work of his predecessors” and a deal had only been secured by conceding to the EU’s demand for some customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, which May’s team had not agreed to. Lord Frost, who will host another crunch round of negotiations in London this week with the EU’s Michel Barnier, told the Mail on Sunday that the UK would leave at the end of the transition period in December “come what may” and would not agree to being a “client state.” Informal talks between the pair have not yielded any breakthrough in what one EU diplomat said was “a wasted summer”. Barwell was angered by comments by Frost in the interview in which he said:“We came in after a government and negotiating team that had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments and the EU had learned not to take our word seriously. “So a lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously.” Barwell tweeted that it had in fact been Johnson’s team, including Frost, who had blinked. “Given the Withdrawal Agreement & Political Declaration David Frost negotiated last autumn were 95% the work of his predecessors – and the 5% that was new involved giving in to the EU’s key demand (for some customs processes when goods move GB to NI) - that quote’s some brass neck,” he said. Two key differences remain between the UK and the EU: fishing rights and state aid, the level of taxpayer support the government can give to UK businesses. Speaking on Sunday, the foreign secretary Dominic Raab said a deal was “there for the taking”. “I think this week is an important moment for the EU to really effectively recognise that those two point of principles are not something we can just haggle away – they are the very reasons we are leaving the EU – but we want a positive relationship and the arm of friendship and goodwill is extended,” he said. “It is up to the EU to decide whether they want to reciprocate.” In his interview on Sunday, Frost ruled out accepting level-playing-field terms that “lock us into the way the EU do things”. He said Downing Street had created a “transition hub”led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove to prepare for a no-deal Brexit from January 2021, something government officials have termed an “Australia-like arrangement”. “Obviously, lots of preparation was done last year. We are ramping up again, and have been for some time under Michael Gove’s authority,” Frost said. “I don’t think that we are scared of this at all. We want to get back the powers to control our borders and that is the most important thing. If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that.”"
2020-09-06T06:46:17Z,politics,Politics,Red wall voters are sticking with Boris Johnson (for now),"Like many, I was sceptical on hearing that the Tories had the “red wall” – dozens of long-held Labour constituencies stretching through the Midlands up to the north – in their sights. Perceptions of the Tory brand had changed little in decades of listening to voters. A typical Tory was “upper class”. He – and yes, it almost certainly was a “he”, even when the Conservative prime minister was a woman – worked in finance, read the Times and wore a pinstripe suit. I had asked focus groups to imagine his Come Dine with Me signature dish. It was the poshest food they could dream up: quail or pheasant washed down by a costly vintage wine. How could working-class voters from those run-down, post-industrial towns ever bring themselves to vote Tory? It seemed unimaginable, and yet, on 12 December 2019, seat after seat fell in Labour’s red wall. I set out to find out why. The interviews and focus groups for my book, Beyond the Red Wall, were held in early 2020 in Hyndburn, Stoke, and Darlington. They confirmed a settled and negative view of the Tory brand. “I always thought the Tories were snobby,” pronounced Tracy, a carer, from Accrington. “Snobbish, corporate and arrogant,” agreed retired mechanic Andy. “Self-centred, rich and privileged,” declared Jean, a healthcare worker from Stoke. Yet, these voters, typically poorly paid manual workers, had all turned up to tell me why they had voted Tory for the first time. Longstanding disillusionment with Labour was part of their story, as was Brexit (a majority of red wallers voted Leave). But the single most important determinant was, as it always is, the party leader. As one voter put it: “Boris has de-snobbified the Tories.” Johnson had given her a licence to vote Conservative for the first time.
He had stood out as different: “focused and determined” to resolve the “Brexit mess”. “Get Brexit done” had a clarity that appealed even to Remain-voting red wallers who, it seemed, now simply wanted it all to be over. This, they believed, demonstrated how well he understood what they wanted. Still unpersuaded, I pressed them: “Could an Old Etonian ever really relate to people from such different backgrounds?” The answer was clear: his warmth and positivity told them he “liked people” (oddly unusual for a politician). His somewhat chaotic spontaneity signalled that, even if born posh, he was authentic and down-to-earth. Most of all, though, it was his optimistic patriotism that shone through. “He’s like a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Sue, a shopworker from Darlington. “He believes in Britain and that makes you want to believe in him.” When the unexpected – in the shape of Covid-19 – happened, initially Johnson’s ratings sky-rocketed. The nation came together with wartime spirit, but then came a rocky few weeks of PPE shortages, testing mishaps and Dominic Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle. I recontacted some of my interviewees to see if their views had changed. Their first response was always defensive: “They’ve done as good a job as they could in difficult circumstances,” Yvonne, from Darlington told me, while Michelle, who runs a sandwich shop in Accrington, was just relieved she didn’t have to do the PM’s job. However, as discussions dug deeper, the disappointment was palpable. Karen from Stoke said: “I loved that he was very clear. Firm and assertive. But he’s lost it over this – we’ve got wishy-washy back.” Colin, a builder, agreed. “My opinion of him has definitely gone down. It’s the way he comes across. Stumbles quite a bit when he needs to look like he’s in charge … waffle when we need clarity.” “Might this mean they’d change their vote?” I wondered. Most knew that Labour had a new leader, and quite liked what they saw, but most were also clear that, at this stage, they knew far too little about the direction of Keir Starmer’s party. Despite everything, many were still willing Johnson to succeed. Although the early euphoria had dissipated, they were unlikely to switch votes soon. Ian, a plumber from Accrington, summed it up: “I don’t know what he [Starmer] is about yet. Meanwhile I see Boris clearly. For all his flaws, I get him. I genuinely believe that he is an old-fashioned patriot. He believes in Britain, he’s not ashamed of the empire. He’s positive and optimistic. And for the time being that’s good enough for me.”"
2020-09-06T06:12:16Z,politics,Politics,Tony Abbott board of trade appointment raises concern in Australia,"The former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been accused of a conflict of interest after he accepted a post as a trade adviser to the UK government, amid continuing criticism of his appointment. Several fellow members of the board of trade of which Abbott will be a member signalled unease over his inclusion. It comes after remarks that have led to his being accused of sexism and homophobia. Political figures in Australia have now raised concerns over his appointment as an adviser to the UK as it seeks post-Brexit trade deals around the world. One Australian senator even suggested he should be forced to register as a foreign agent. Opposition and Tory MPs were among those to express public concerns when Abbott’s appointment was confirmed by the Department for International Trade on Friday. His period in office included opposition to climate emergency measures, opposition to gay marriage and controversial immigration plans. He has also been criticised for describing abortion as “the easy way out” and suggesting that men were better equipped for leadership roles than women. He was also attacked by then-Australian PM Julia Gillard for the views he had expressed. The entrepreneur Anne Boden, a fellow member of the newly appointed board of trade, tweeted that it was “important that we have challenging voices”. However, she also said she supported “diversity and so did this woman”, linking to a video of Gillard’s 2012 speech accusing Abbott of misogyny. His appointment has now caused debate in Australia over a potential conflict of interest. Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general in Australia’s Labor party, said the Australian government should explain “how a former Liberal PM can now work for a foreign power advising on matters potentially in direct conflict with Australia’s commercial interest … and how conflicts arising from Mr Abbott’s intimate knowledge of Australia’s trading interests and strategies, gained during his years as minister and prime minister, will be managed.”
Other Australian parliamentarians went further. Rex Patrick, an independent senator from South Australia, labelled Abbott’s appointment a “disgrace” and called for the former prime minister to be forced to register as a foreign agent under Australia’s foreign influence transparency scheme. He said Abbott should be stripped of “most” of his travel and office allowance. “Australian taxpayers shouldn’t subsidise a foreign agent,” he said. However, Australia’s attorney general Christian Porter, congratulated Abbott. “Mr Abbott will no doubt be aware of the routine requirements for former cabinet ministers under the foreign influence transparency scheme,” he said. “In the first instance, it is up to each individual to determine whether or not their circumstances meet the registration requirements.” In a statement released on Friday, Abbott said he was “only too keen” to help the UK. “A UK-Australia trade deal, maximising the movement of goods, services and people, is clearly in the best interests of both our countries,” he said. “My government finalised trade deals between Australia and China, Japan and Korea. I’m looking forward to bringing that expertise to bear as Britain works towards mutually beneficial improvements with its major trading partners.” Boris Johnson has defended the appointment, which is an unpaid position. “I obviously don’t agree with those sentiments at all but then I don’t agree with everyone who serves the government,” he said on Friday. “What I would say about Tony Abbott is this is a guy who was elected by the great liberal democratic nation of Australia.” However, shadow trade secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the move. “He’s never been involved in detailed trade negotiations, he thinks that issues like climate change and workers’ rights are just not important, and during the two years that he was prime minister of Australia he was personally responsible for killing off Australia’s car industry,” she told Times Radio."
2020-09-06T06:00:16Z,politics,Politics,The useful idiots of Brexit only make us less secure,"When Brexit happens, “the EU will no longer exist”. So said Nigel Farage to Michel Barnier, who was to become the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, a few days after the 2016 referendum. Barnier revealed this recently at the end of an interview with the French journalist Marion van Renterghem, about which she writes in the current issue of the New European. Farage could hardly have been more wrong, but it was typical of that mountebank and his Brexit gang. The Brexiters assured the innocents who were naive enough to believe them that dealing with our partners in the rest of the EU would be a cakewalk, and that during their negotiations about a post-Brexit “deal” the UK would be able to have that cake they were walking towards and eat it. Yes, fantasists such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the dreaded “Eyetest” Cummings fooled people – possibly including themselves – that they could “take back control” while retaining all the advantages of the single market – the single market that was one of their heroine Margaret Thatcher’s proudest achievements. But that was just convenient lying propaganda. As the impasse in the so-called Brexit “negotiations” demonstrates, if you renege on your referendum campaign promises and insist on leaving the customs union and the single market – hey presto, you lose the advantages of membership. Throughout these fruitless talks, the Brexiters have complained about the “unreasonable” attitude of the rest of the EU. They somehow thought they would have formidable bargaining power even though, if you are resigning from a club, you are in a pathetically weak position about your future relationship.
As for those extreme Brexiters like Farage, who wanted the EU to break up, they have found that, on the contrary, the prospect of Brexit has brought the rest of the EU closer together. As Barnier said: “We need to stay together to defend our interests in the world, without shame. Neither the Chinese, nor the Russians, nor the Americans have shame when defending theirs.” For Brexit is not only about a once-proud nation volunteering to suffer wholly needless and avoidable economic self-harm; it is also about weakening your country in a world where the geopolitical rivalry between the US, Russia and China is becoming ever more menacing. As Barnier says: “The single market is one of the rare reasons why President Trump and Xi Jinping respect us. It is an ecosystem that we have been building for 60 years – with the British.” (My italics.) It follows that it is no surprise that the world leaders who are the main non-British cheerleaders for Brexit are, you have guessed it, Putin (especially), Trump and Xi. They are already trying hard enough to disrupt European power and unity. They can hardly believe their luck when the Brexiters – the enemy within – join in to help them. What was that phrase in Soviet times? Yes: useful idiots. But back to the economy. It is a time for black humour. We find that, in the Brexit-voting area of Kent – Dover, Ashford and environs – they suddenly find that contingency plans for guaranteed lorry hold-ups in the event of the impending end-year Brexit, and guaranteed much bigger hold-ups in the event of a no-deal as well, are disrupting the local landscape so that parking space can be provided for held-up lorries. I love the quote in the New York Times from Douglas Bannister, chief executive of the port of Dover: “I am very, very confident that there will be no disruption on January 1st, primarily because it’s a bank holiday. But January 2nd may be a different question.” And this is being imposed on an economy that will still be struggling with the repercussions of lockdown and, God help us, the possibility of a second wave of the virus. In which context, I am not sure that Chancellor Sunak is wise to talk up the need for tax increases when the economic recovery is far from well-based. Has he learned nothing from the folly of George “Austerity” Osborne’s clampdown on the fragile economic recovery he inherited from prime minister Brown and chancellor Darling in 2010? And another thing: can Sunak really still be a Brexiter? Has he not been listening to those wise Treasury officials who know a disaster when they see one?"
2020-09-06T05:52:16Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson at bay, Starmer on the rise … and Sunak waiting in the wings","As Tory MPs headed into the Covid-secure Commons for prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, all they wanted was reassurance after some very worrying weeks. Over the summer break, Boris Johnson’s administration had performed U-turn after U-turn in a chaotic period of serial blundering that had culminated in arguably the worst mess of all – the exams fiasco. Out in their constituencies, MPs had struggled to defend what had been going on to their bemused and angry local electorates. Labour had drawn level with the Tories in a poll last weekend for the Observer, having been 26 points behind Johnson’s party in March. “Let’s hope he can cheer us all up today,” said one Conservative. It was not to be. In fact, Johnson’s performance inspired only more gloom. Under predictable fire from Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, over the A-levels and GCSEs disasters, the prime minister seemed ill-prepared and at sea, thrashing around for defensive lines and veering wildly off the subject as he did so. At one point, Johnson seemed to suggest that the man holding him to account for his ministers’ mishandling of exams was an IRA sympathiser on the grounds that Starmer had served under Jeremy Corbyn. MPs on both sides of the chamber sat in disbelief.
Incredulous and furious in equal measure, Starmer pointed out that he had in fact spent five years of his legal career prosecuting IRA terrorists and working closely with the intelligence services to track them down. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, suggested the prime minister might like to withdraw the comments but Johnson would not do so. “I thought it was as bad a performance as I have seen from a prime minister in that environment,” a former Tory cabinet minister said. “He has a problem, which is, fundamentally, that he doesn’t have the qualities to do the job properly. He doesn’t work hard enough, he is not on top of the detail, he doesn’t have a clear vision and sense of direction on most issues, and he is being found out.” While this was on the harsh end of the spectrum, such assessments of the prime minister and his government are not uncommon these days inside the party. As for Johnson himself, he too seems to have realised that Starmer won hands down at PMQs. But he was not blaming himself. In fact, the reverse.
The Observer has been told that after leaving parliament, Johnson tore into his Downing Street team and staff from Conservative Campaign Headquarters, who he felt had not prepared him adequately. “He was furious,” said a well-placed source. “He told his team and people at CCHQ that he wanted them to go after Starmer’s legal record and double down on the attacks on him.” Rather than try to engage with the issues, the plan seemed to be to mount more and more assaults on Starmer’s past career, during which he took on numerous human rights cases, often pro bono, and ended up as director of public prosecutions. As word of Johnson’s anger spread within Westminster, more questions were being asked by Tories about what on earth was going wrong. Another very senior Conservative who had served in the cabinet with Johnson, and who has been mainly loyal to him, said: “There is quite a lot of bemusement about why he is not performing better. People [in the party] want to give him the benefit of the doubt but there is a widespread feeling that the preparation is not being done as it should be, and, yes, there is some concern.” The same ex-minister said there were some doubts about whether Johnson had ever fully recovered from his serious bout of Covid-19. “I thought he looked well but now the doubts are back a bit.” The prime minister and Rishi Sunak, his chancellor, spent much of the rest of Wednesday trying to reassure backbenchers in a series of private meetings that the ship of state was still on course, and that weekend briefings about impending tax increases for the wealthy to pay the bills for Covid-19 were over the top.
Johnson and Sunak’s charm offensive was intended to show a united front ahead of an autumn budget and a spending review that aims to chart a slow way back to stable finances. However, the latest survey for ConservativeHome, the website for party members, shows Johnson has suffered a dramatic fall in his standing among Tory activists. In December 2019, shortly after the general election, he topped the net satisfaction rating among cabinet members with a score of plus-92.5% while Sunak was fourth on plus-78.5%. Now Johnson has slumped down into the bottom third with a rating of plus-24.6% and Sunak is way out in front on plus-82.5% Plenty of Conservatives see Sunak, who has impressed MPs with his handling of the economy, not so much as a chancellor who can help Johnson and his government recover its poise, but as a serious threat to the PM. Increasingly, he is mentioned as the one who could counter Starmer in years to come. “Our problem is that Starmer’s appeal is his competence,” one Tory MP said. “The only one in the cabinet who has looked vaguely competent in the pandemic is Rishi Sunak. Boris and No 10 will be beginning to worry about him.”
For Sunak, it is very early days. Even if the worst of Covid-19 is already over (which is highly questionable), paying the bills for the pandemic will be painful, and it will be the chancellor who will have to inflict the financial suffering. “So far, he has been handing out the money and all those cut-price meals. That is the easy part. At some point we all have to pay for that,” a member of the Treasury select committee said. With Brexit still unresolved, Sunak, like Johnson, will take the blame if a No Deal compounds the already severe economic problems. But some MPs and commentators believe Sunak is already getting into the prime minister’s head, and worrying him. Johnson is used to being the pretender to the crown, not the one threatened by a new star on the up. The chancellor’s branding is clever and slick, and it appears he is already mounting something of an operation. He recently posted a photograph on Instagram of himself at the Globe theatre, waiting in the wings, ready to take the stage. “If that didn’t send a message I don’t know what will,” says a former No 10 adviser. Some think No 10 is already marshalling its forces to stop Sunak. Such is the gathering sense of unhappiness and ebbing confidence about Johnson in the Tory party, that there have been suggestions that newspaper stories last weekend about planned tax rises on the better-off were planted not by the Treasury to prepare the public (the normal softening-up exercise) but by No 10 to damage Sunak and stop his advance, by painting him as an enemy of well-off Tory voters. If that was the aim, it had some success as the Tory tabloids reacted furiously on Monday and fired warning shots at the man leading the Treasury. “The chancellor’s latest proposals – which include raising corporation tax – fill us with dread,” said the Sun. Meanwhile, Johnson and his team plough on unconvincingly as the jobless totals grow, the number of Covid-19 cases rise again, and arguments rage around the appointment of the controversial former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, as an adviser on post-Brexit trade negotiations. As the government’s problems mount, the optimism that Johnson created around himself only a few months ago is shot. Perhaps most worryingly of all for Johnson, a successor is being talked about. Another ex-cabinet minister, when asked about the prime minister’s prospects said: “I think he will still be leading the party in a year’s time.” Given that this prime minister delivered his party election glory as recently as last December, it is a measure of how far his fortunes have sunk that there is any doubt at all about who will lead the Tories into the next one."
2020-09-05T21:00:05Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard defies new moves to oust him,"A grassroots campaign demanding the resignation of Labour’s leader in Scotland, as well as an explosive no-confidence vote by its ruling body, are both being drawn up by party insiders attempting to topple him ahead of crucial elections next year. The last-ditch measures are being considered after a series of resignations and calls for his departure last week failed to remove Richard Leonard. He reiterated his refusal to quit in a defiant statement on Sunday, saying the attempts to topple him “only served to strengthen my own resolve”. It comes with Labour still languishing in third place in the polls ahead of Holyrood elections next May, with the SNP currently on course to win more than half of all votes. Labour is set to lose several MSPs, while polling has also suggested that Leonard is still largely unknown to many voters. A group of MSPs called on him to go last week. Anas Sarwar, the former deputy Scottish Labour leader, is seen as the most likely replacement, possibly with fellow MSP Jackie Baillie as an interim leader for May’s election.
Some of those pushing for Leonard’s departure believe the attempt to oust him will fail unless Labour’s MSPs launch a formal leadership challenge against him this week. Others want to foster a grassroots campaign from Labour members and councillors calling for his departure as the next move. Holding a no-confidence vote in his leadership within Scottish Labour’s ruling executive committee is seen as the last-ditch move. It is also highly unpredictable, as feelings over Leonard’s leadership within the committee are finely balanced. A vote of the executive committee was used to remove Jim Murphy from the job in 2015. Murphy narrowly won the vote, but subsequently resigned anyway. The view of trade unions, which have several seats on the committee, would be crucial. While some unions have come out in support of Leonard, others - including his own GMB union - have remained silent on the question of his future. A meeting of the GMB’s executive on Friday ended without any public statement of support. However, a refusal by unions to vote in any confidence vote could ultimately ensure Leonard survives. “The only way to get a change is if it comes from within either the Labour group of MSPs or the Scottish executive of the party,” said one senior figure. “My understanding is that [his opponents] don’t have a majority within either yet.” Leonard said on Sunday: “The events of the last week have only served to strengthen my own resolve and bolstered the confidence of party members in Scotland that we cannot go back, that we have to go forward together in the fight of our lives for every vote and every seat in next year’s election.” Without any further developments in the coming days, those pushing for Leonard’s departure fear the attempt to replace him will fizzle out. Senior figures across Scottish Labour are torn over the current impasse. While few believe Leonard has performed well in the job, there is division over whether another change at the top would simply mask the much larger political problems. Most trace Labour’s incredible decline in Scotland back to the SNP’s victory more than a decade ago in the 2007 Holyrood elections. Most believe Labour has found itself swamped by the debate over independence. Its backing for further devolution as a solution has seen it lose ground to the SNP and the fervently unionist Scottish Tories. Figures across the party also lamented a lack of political talent. As former Labour first minister Henry McLeish put it last week: “We keep changing the manager but nothing changes on the pitch.” Another senior Scottish Labour figure said: “If you don’t have a vision for the country, you can do all the negative campaigning you want. You can have all the charisma you want. But you need to lay out what you stand for and give people a little bit of hope. The Scottish Labour party’s problems are deeper than one individual.”"
2020-09-05T18:50:02Z,politics,Politics,Desperate Boris Johnson to step up personal attacks on Keir Starmer,"An increasingly desperate Boris Johnson has ordered his staff to step up personal attacks on the Labour leader Keir Starmer and his record as a lawyer, as confidence in the prime minister’s leadership collapses among Tory party members.
The Observer has been told that Johnson was so furious after last Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions – where he was asked to withdraw comments he made about the Labour leader and the IRA by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle – that he turned on his staff for leaving him under-prepared, and asked them to come up with more attack lines on the Labour leader’s career as a lawyer. “He was furious,” said a well-placed source. “He told his team and people at CCHQ [Conservative campaign headquarters] that he wanted them to go after Starmer’s legal record and double down on the attacks on him.” Last week’s Commons row erupted after Starmer pressed Johnson at PMQs over the recent exams fiasco and his party’s succession of policy U-turns. Johnson attempted to turn the tables, suddenly suggesting the Labour leader had somehow been sympathetic to the IRA because he had worked under Jeremy Corbyn. “This is a leader of the opposition who supported an IRA-condoning politician,” said Johnson, to the bemusement of MPs on all sides of the house.
An angry Starmer pointed out he had in fact spent five years of his legal career prosecuting IRA terrorists and working with the intelligence services to bring terrorists to justice. Despite Hoyle’s request for Johnson to apologise he refused to do so. A Labour source said: “If Boris Johnson wants to have a debate with Keir about past careers then bring it on. While Keir was a human rights lawyer or director of public prosecutions Johnson was being sacked for lying.”
Last night Downing Street claimed it was “not true” that Johnson had blamed his staff for his performance at PMQs or that he had said to anyone that he wanted to prepare more attacks on Starmer over his time as a lawyer. But increasingly his and the government’s performances are causing alarm among Tory MPs, and disquiet in Whitehall. Some senior Conservatives are beginning to worry that Starmer is regularly outperforming the prime minister at the weekly confrontation on Wednesdays. A senior Tory MP said: “It is the issue of competence that we worry about against Starmer.” As the country faces a possible Covid-19 second wave and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit, there is evidence that the wider Tory party is losing faith in Johnson’s ability to lead them against Starmer – and signs that the chancellor Rishi Sunak has become the new favourite of the Conservative grassroots. According to the latest survey of Tory members by ConservativeHome, the website for party activists, Johnson is now in the bottom third of cabinet ministers in the satisfaction ratings – having been the runaway leader nine months ago. In December 2019, shortly after the last general election, Johnson topped the net satisfaction ratings with a score of plus 92.5%, while Sunak was fourth on plus 78.5%.
Now Johnson has slumped to 19th place, below Baroness Evans, the leader of the House of Lords, with a rating of plus 24.6%. Sunak meanwhile is out in front on plus 82.5%. Patrick Stevens, a former colleague of Starmer at the crown prosecution service who was head of its international division, said the Labour leader’s legal career was beyond reproach. “I worked with Keir Starmer at close quarters for five years. His work with the CPS’s world-class counter-terrorism division – the most serious and sensitive the service faced – was unwavering. “He was equally committed to the CPS playing its part internationally in the UK government’s national security strategies, leading the CPS to engage in some of the most difficult jurisdictions around the world. “His efforts went way beyond just doing the job; personally I haven’t met anyone more committed to the rights of victims and witnesses and the protection of the public.” On Saturday ministers were facing new difficulties in persuading civil servants to “get back to work” as soon as possible. The government says it wants 80% of civil servants to be able to attend their usual workplaces at least once a week by the end of the month. But unions have described the government’s attitude as outdated."
2020-09-05T12:34:32Z,politics,Politics,Civil servants' union will consider strike action over back-to-office plans,"A public sector union has said it will consider strike action over cabinet-driven plans for the vast majority of civil servants to return to the office by the end of the month. The outgoing head of the civil service has written to department permanent secretaries calling on them to reduce the numbers of staff working from home. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, said he wanted 80% of workers back at their desks at least once a week by the end of September. In the letter, sent to the highest officials in government departments, Sedwill and Alex Chisholm, the chief operating officer of the civil service, said that “getting more people back into work in a Covid-secure way will improve the public services we deliver”. However, the Public and Commercial Services union said its members had “kept the country running during the pandemic while working from home” and it did not believe it was safe to return to workplaces while infection rates remained high and there was a risk of a second wave. The general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “If the government or any employer starts forcing people back to work and we believe that it is not safe to do so, we will firstly consider our legal options, secondly give individual legal advice, and thirdly consider whether a collective response is required. “As a last resort, if you have no other option and people’s health and safety is at risk, of course we would be prepared to consider industrial action.” Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, which represents managers and professionals in public service, said the reported target, designed to encourage more civil servants back to their workplaces, was about “virtue signalling” to the private sector. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “It is quite clear from the letter that has been sent out, this is really about virtue signalling to the private sector that has already moved on. “You’re not telling me that the big financial houses in the City of London would be having their staff working remotely if it wasn’t working effectively for them.” Asked about productivity levels during the lockdown, Penman added: “Clearly, there are many areas of work you would say it is impractical to do that from home – that doesn’t work for everyone. “But there is no evidence to suggest that people are working inefficiently – people are spending less time commuting, they’re finding it works for them.” He said the civil service had dealt with increased demand in universal credit and started the furlough programme from the ground up since the start of the pandemic, all with staff being 95% home-based. In the letter, which applies only to staff in England, Sedwill said a rota system would be able to bring as much as 80% of civil service staff back to their offices each week. He said: “Departments which are still below their departmental constraints should now move quickly to seek to bring more staff back into the office in a Covid-secure way, and take advantage of the return to schools this month and increased public transport availability. “Further, we are now strongly encouraging an increased workplace attendance through staff rota systems, with our aim by the end of September to enable 80% of staff to attend their usual workplace each week, for example, 20% for five days, 30% for three days and 30% for two days, with the balance attending only occasionally for now.” On Wednesday, a senior Bank of England official said it was impossible for large numbers of staff to return to central London and other big cities while risks from Covid-19 remained. Pouring cold water on the government campaign, Alex Brazier, the Bank’s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, said it was “not possible” for a mass return to city centre offices this autumn due to Covid guidelines, concerns over the health risks, and transport capacity problems. Analysis of mobile phone data last month suggested only 17% of UK workers had returned to the office, despite the push by the government for people to stop working from home."
2020-09-04T17:24:23Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: close to 2,000 new Covid cases recorded - highest daily total since May â€“ as it happened","The UK has recorded 1,940 new cases of coronavirus, which is the highest daily total since 30 May (2,445). (See 4.42pm.) To a large extent the rise in the number of new cases being recorded since early July is explained by the increase in the number of people being tested, particularly in at-risk areas, and the Office for National Statistics said today that, on the basis of its weekly infection survey, the evidence suggests “the incidence rate for England remains unchanged”. (See 12.40pm.) But the Government Office for Science said its estimate for the growth rate in the UK was between -1% and +_2%, meaning “the number of new infections is somewhere between shrinking by 1% and growing by 2% every day”. (See 2.40pm.) Leeds has been added to Public Health England’s weekly watch list of areas of concern for Covid-19, the city council said. It said: The latest seven-day infection figures show Leeds as having a rate of 32.4 cases per 100,000 people and a positivity rate on testing of 3.5%. The latest data suggests that a lot of the cases are in different areas of the city, meaning they may be linked to social interaction and leisure activities. The spread is broad and changeable across wards and cases have also been increasingly detected in younger people aged 18-34, with some concern over activities like house parties and gatherings. Coronavirus tests are running out in parts of north-east England despite cases rising to the highest level in months, political leaders have said amid growing concern over the government’s rationing of tests. Fresh action will be needed to support Britain’s economy as it emerges from a temporary sweet spot caused by massive government financial support and the lifting of lockdown restrictions, a Bank of England policymaker has said. The transport secretary has accused Scotland of “jumping the gun” by imposing quarantine restrictions on arrivals from Greece, and admitted the different rules around the UK create confusion for holidaymakers. Tony Abbott has been appointed as a UK trade adviser despite widespread concerns that misogynistic and homophobic comments and denial of the climate crisis have made him unfit to represent the country to the rest of the world. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-09-04T16:44:22Z,politics,Politics,Brussels rules out summit intervention in troubled Brexit talks,"Boris Johnson’s hopes of a Brexit deal have been dealt a fresh blow as Brussels ruled out EU leaders intervening in the troubled negotiations at a summit this month. According to EU diplomats, both the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Downing Street have lobbied for 27 heads of state and government to seize control of the talks given the current impasse. Despite the parlous state of the talks, the former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, who now chairs the leaders’ meetings as president of the European council, has decided to focus on the bloc’s recovery from the coronavirus and relations with China at the summit on 25 September. EU sources said expectations were “extremely low” for the next round of negotiations, which start on Tuesday, after a disappointing meeting between Barnier and the UK’s negotiator David Frost in London this week. “From those discussions there is no basis to believe that there will be any progress at all next week,” said one EU source. “There was nothing new in what London was saying and there is no reason to think that this coming week will offer any progress.” The major obstacle to a deal remains the issue of the UK’s plans for its domestic subsidy regime from 1 January 2021 when the country leaves the EU’s single market and customs union. In a tweet on Friday, Frost acknowledged the low expectations for progress in the coming week. He tweeted: “We will negotiate constructively but the EU’s stance may, realistically, limit the progress we can make next week.”
Asked about growing concerns of a no deal exit, however, the prime minister insisted that the UK would “prosper mightily” even if it does not strike a trade deal with the EU. During a visit to Solihull, where he was inspecting a HS2 construction site, Johnson told reporters: “We’re ready for any eventuality, of course. But we must make sure that people understand that at the end of the year, whatever happens, we are using the EU. “We will get through this. It’s vital that our partners understand that the UK is going to do what we need to do. “If we need to have an Australia-style deal, an Australia-style solution, then that is what we will achieve and we will prosper mightily one way or the other. “They could be sensible and give us a Canada-style solution, which after all they’ve given Canada, and I very much hope they will, but we’re ready for either eventuality.” In the face of British opposition, the EU has moved from its opening position that EU rules on so-called state aid should be incorporated into UK law to ensure that neither side can unfairly prop up their major businesses. But EU officials said the bloc was unable to work on an alternative solution until Downing Street publishes its plans for controlling the level of subsidies. “The problem is that they said in January and February that they needed time for a democratic debate on this subject but that we still haven’t had a trace of what they are going to do,” said a diplomatic source. The UK’s negotiators have insisted domestic subsidy policy is irrelevant to a free trade deal and point out that the EU has leant on World Trade Organization provisions in previous deals.
In the EU’s trade deal with Canada there is no requirement for either side to seek approval for subsidies from the other but the issue of trade distortions can be an issue for consultation. EU sources said there was a “misjudgment on the British side if they think that this can be left to the last minute”. One source said: “We have not been told when the domestic subsidy regime will be published, but what happens when it lands late September and it fails to offers the EU side any assurances over the future? It will be too late.” A UK government spokesman said: “There is still a lot more work to do, but it remains our goal to reach an agreement and we’ll continue to work hard to do so. We need more realism from the EU and for them to show that they understand the fundamentals of our position as an independent and sovereign country.” The cabinet is said to be divided over whether to establish hard rules on state subsidies and an independent regulator or allow the government more leeway. “We cannot do anything until the UK decides what it wants,” said an EU official. The UK is due to leave the single market and customs union on 31 December 2020. A deal needs to be negotiated by the end of October or the first week of November to allow time for parliamentary ratification."
2020-09-04T16:31:31Z,politics,Politics,Former Australian PM Tony Abbott confirmed as UK trade adviser,"Boris Johnson has appointed Tony Abbott as an official UK trade adviser, defying widespread condemnation of the former Australian prime minister’s record of misogyny and homophobia and his views on the climate emergency. Abbott, whose consideration for the role prompted criticism from opposition parties, charities and LGBT and environmental activists, is among nine external advisers appointed to the Board of Trade. The board, revived by Theresa May, is intended to help shape post-Brexit trade policy. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, who declined to defend Abbott’s views when asked about them in a TV interview last week, said the advisers were “a diverse group of people who share Britain’s belief in free enterprise, democracy and high standards and rules-based trade”. Other external unpaid advisers to the board include the former Conservative MEP and fervent Brexiter Daniel Hannan, and the former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt. But it is the choice of Abbott, a controversial and often unpopular prime minister of Australia from 2013 until he was ousted by Liberal party colleagues in 2015, that has attracted anger and concern. Abbott, who once described abortion as “the easy way out” and has suggested men are better adapted than women to exercise authority, gained a reputation for epitomising what many in Australia saw as an overly macho approach to politics. His views reached international prominence in 2012 when Australia’s then prime minister, Julia Gillard, used a widely shared speech in parliament to castigate his opinions. A prior opponent of equal marriage, Abbott has also suggested climate change is “probably doing good”, and likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. The suggestion that he could become a trade adviser brought condemnation from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said he had “real concerns” about his suitability and wouldn’t appoint Abbott if he were prime minister. Following news of the appointment, Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, said: “First, his history of offensive statements is so long and repetitive that it speaks to serious defects in his character, which is not one I think should be representing Britain on the world stage. “And second, the fact that he has no experience of detailed trade negotiations, no understanding of Brexit, no belief in climate change, no concern for workers’ rights, and no compunction about killing off Australia’s car industry mean, to my mind, that he has no credentials for this role. “Tony Abbott is therefore the wrong appointment on every level.” Equality and environmental activists including the actor Sir Ian McKellen and the Doctor Who screenwriter Russell T Davies had previously signed a letter urging the government not to appoint Abbott to the board. “This is a man who described abortion as ‘the easy way out’ and suggested that men may be ‘by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command’,” the letter said.
Caroline Nokes, the Tory chair of the women and equalities select committee, told the BBC: “I just don’t think this is a man who should be anywhere near our Board of Trade.” Describing his expected appointment as “awful”, she added: “Is he the sort of man I want to be representing us globally? No.” The Scottish National party’s deputy leader in Westminster, Kirsten Oswald, said the appointment was “beyond indefensible”. “If holding misogynistic, homophobic, Trump-backing, climate change-denying views, as well as saying that some elderly people with Covid-19 should be allowed to die, is what qualifies you for a role with this Tory government in promoting the UK internationally then it is not so much Global Britain as it is Little Britain,” she added.
Late on Friday night Abbott released a statement saying he was “pleased to have been announced as an adviser to the reconstituted UK Board of Trade”, adding: “It’s important for the wider world that Britain makes the most of its post-Brexit opportunities and I am proud to be playing a part.” Following several days of interviews in which several of Johnson’s ministers seemed wary of endorsing Abbott, No 10 insisted earlier on Friday that no decision had been made, indicating a possible U-turn. On Thursday, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, appeared to express disquiet over the move in a TV interview, declining to agree that Abbott was a “fit and proper” person to take on an official UK role. But during a visit to Solihill on Friday, Johnson defended Abbott, calling him “a guy who was elected by the people of the great liberal democratic nation of Australia”, while also stressing that he did not “agree with everyone who serves the government in an unpaid capacity on hundreds of boards across the country”. Johnson said that while he did not share some of Abbott’s views, he believed Abbott’s spell as Australian prime minister made him suitable for the job.
Johnson has repeatedly refused to back down under intense criticism of appointments, as also shown over crises involving Dominic Cummings and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick. Downing Street is likely to have calculated that concerns about Abbott’s views will be balanced by voters who may applaud a refusal to bow to criticism – a sign of a wider cultural war on progressive values that Johnson’s advisers are increasingly keen to fight. It is not a risk-free move, however, with Abbott tending to be outspoken on many issues. In a speech and Q&A on Tuesday, Abbott railed against what he called Covid “health dictatorships”, saying the economic cost of lockdowns meant families should be allowed to consider letting elderly relatives with the coronavirus die. He said not enough politicians were “thinking like health economists trained to pose uncomfortable questions about the level of deaths we might have to live with”."
2020-09-04T15:19:13Z,politics,Politics,Former GMB union head says he was treated unfairly in sexism report,"A former head of one of the UK’s biggest unions has challenged one of the key findings of an independent report that said the organisation was “institutionally sexist”. Sir Paul Kenny, general secretary of GMB between 2005 and 2015, said Karon Monaghan’s inquiry had unfairly criticised his actions after he had suggested giving a £30,000 payoff to a member of staff under investigation for gross misconduct. His comments, which question a conclusion of one of the UK’s foremost experts in equality and human rights law, will reignite a battle within the union over the treatment of women. Monaghan was appointed this year to conduct an independent inquiry after the sudden resignation of Tim Roache as general secretary amid allegations of misconduct, which he has denied. In a report released on Wednesday, Monaghan wrote that “a senior man within GMB intervened in an investigation process into ‘a serious incident of sexual harassment’”. The senior man wrote to the union’s human resources section and suggested that the accused, who was a male staff member, should be relocated to a new job and given a £30,000 payoff. “Such a course of action would remove the need for the women who lodged the complaint to be cross-examined,” the senior man wrote. Monaghan concluded: “There was no reasonable basis for bringing an end to the disciplinary process, or for that person to intervene in the process at all. I am satisfied that the interference in the process was wholly inappropriate.” Speaking to the Guardian, Kenny acknowledged that he was the senior man identified in the report and that he had been interviewed by Monaghan, but claimed she could not reach a fair conclusion because she had not spoken to the accuser and the accused. “That is an opinion based on a lack of knowledge. They never had the file, they never interviewed the people concerned, that is a judgment that someone might make who had no knowledge of the incident or of the evidence. None at all,” he said. “She may well be a barrister, but that doesn’t mean she is a brain surgeon. You make assumptions without interviewing the various people concerned.” Kenny said he had personally interviewed both the accused member of staff and the accuser soon after the alleged incident, and questioned Monaghan’s statement in the report stating that there had been a serious incident of sexual harassment. “It is just not true. It just wasn’t the case and is not played out by any of the facts at all. The police were called and decided not to pursue the case.” Kenny said the accused man had not received any payoff and had left the union with his notice and holiday pay. “I didn’t do anything underhand. I put all my actions on record,” he said. Monaghan made a list of 27 recommendations to the union, including taking steps to increase the representation of women at all levels and introducing a bespoke complaints procedure for sexual harassment and an annual equalities audit. The report concludes that sexual harassment is common in the union, which has more than 600,000 members. A GMB spokesperson said the union stood fully behind the report. “Karon Monaghan QC is an eminently respected lawyer and an A-panel member of the Equality and Human Rights Commission panel of preferred counsel. “GMB fully accepts her report and its findings, and we’re committed to the fundamental change that is needed to take the union forward. Misogyny will not be tolerated in any form. We fully stand by the integrity and thoroughness of her investigation.” Monaghan declined to comment."
2020-09-04T14:53:46Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson defends Tony Abbott in UK trade envoy row,"Boris Johnson has defended proposals to appoint Tony Abbott as a UK trade envoy despite claims that his misogynistic and homophobic comments, as well as his denial of the climate crisis, make him unfit to represent the UK on the world stage. The prime minister addressed the issue on Friday after days of mounting pressure to drop the planned appointment. He dismissed the concerns of a wide range of campaigners who have insisted there are better candidates than the former Australian prime minister for the Board of Trade role. “I don’t, obviously, don’t agree with those sentiments at all. But then I don’t agree with everyone who serves the government in an unpaid capacity on hundreds of boards across the country – and I can’t be expected to do so,” said the prime minister during a visit to Solihull. “What I would say about Tony Abbott is this is a guy who was elected by the people of the great liberal democratic nation of Australia. It’s an amazing country, it’s a freedom-loving country, it’s a liberal country. There you go, I think that speaks for itself.”
Campaigners have suggested Abbott’s appointment would send out a damaging message to the world about the UK’s position on various issues. They have also claimed his views meant that in any trade deals he struck, Abbot would be unlikely to secure safeguards to protect the people he has disparaged. An open letter, signed by the actor Sir Ian McKellen, the Doctor Who screenwriter Russell T Davies and almost two dozen others, said on Friday that ministers should not appoint Abbott to the board. “This is a man who described abortion as ‘the easy way out’, and suggested that men may be ‘by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command’,” the letter says. “This is a man who described himself as ‘threatened by homosexuality’, and vigorously campaigned against the ultimately successful referendum in Australia to allow same-sex couples to marry. This is a man who has suggested that climate change is ‘probably doing good’, and who downplayed the link between extreme weather and bushfires at the height of this year’s Australian bushfire crisis.” While Abbott’s appointment had previously been assumed to be imminent, Downing Street insisted on Thursday that “no decisions” had been made, prompting speculation about another U-turn.
Asked about the issue on Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, stressed Abbott did not yet have a confirmed role. “I hate to bring us back to reality but he hasn’t been appointed to anything and as far as I know there haven’t been any appointments made,” he told Sky News. “There are lots of people with whom their comments I vehemently disagree but I’m not into defending people who are not actually carrying out any role for the British government.” The hints of a change of mind come after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, raised serious concerns about Abbott’s suitability for the role, misgivings echoed by the human rights groups Amnesty International and Liberty, the Trades Union Congress, the Fawcett Society for women’s equality, and the environmental group Greenpeace. The Board of Trade is a historical body revived by Theresa May’s government to advise on Britain’s post-Brexit trade policy around the world. It is understood Abbott’s name was on a list of potential candidates approved by No 10 several weeks ago, but a final announcement has since been delayed. The post is unpaid.
The shadow women and equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, has written to her government counterpart, Liz Truss, who is also the international trade secretary, to express her alarm at Abbott’s “offensive and outdated views”. De Cordova said she was “disappointed” at Truss’s own refusal in parliament on Thursday to answer questions about Abbott’s views, action for which Truss was reprimanded by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. Separately, the Guardian has learned that Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, also wrote to Truss. In a letter copied to the cabinet secretary, Thornberry asked 25 questions, including whether the post was advertised in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, and whether the job was discussed when Truss appeared alongside Abbott at recent public events."
2020-09-04T13:32:35Z,politics,Politics,Home Office U-turns leave British baby stuck in India,"An eight-month-old British baby has been stranded abroad since birth, and his family split between two continents and his mother unable to take up a job tackling coronavirus, because of repeated delays and U-turns by the Home Office in processing his passport application. Some passport applicants are required to attend face-to-face interviews but these have been suspended during the pandemic. The family were repeatedly told that although a face-to-face interview was required it could take place via Skype instead. However, officials then backtracked and said this would not be possible. Briton Richard Hamilton and his Indian wife, Priya Jacob, have two children, Joy, aged three, and Jacob, eight months. The couple, who live in Hampshire, are senior humanitarian aid workers and travel to postings around the world. Priya Jacob has been offered a job as regional project director for Asia for the Danish Refugee Council. Her role, which will be based in Myanmar, includes managing the Covid response in Rohingya refugee camps and overseeing a de-mining project. The couple applied for Jacob’s passport in February. After seven months, 67 emails, 16 calls to the passport helpline, five letters to Hamilton’s MP, Damian Hinds, and two to the home secretary, Priti Patel, the matter has still not been resolved. Joy’s passport was processed in weeks even though the family were based abroad at the time. Priya Jacob is in India, where Jacob was born, with both children. Hamilton returned to the UK a few months ago to support his mother during cancer treatment and to await the Home Office interview to secure Jacob’s passport. The baby cannot leave India because the Home Office has so far failed to provide him with a passport so the family is unable to relocate to Myanmar.
Despite undergoing an initial interview in February and submitting more than 30 supporting documents requested by the Home Office, including a pregnancy scan and hospital antenatal notes, the matter remains unresolved. The couple are worried that the delays could lead to Priya Jacobs’ job offer being withdrawn. In an email on 7 August officials said Hamilton had been given the wrong information that a Skype interview would be possible and that no online interview could take place. Hamilton also received three separate apologies from Home Office officials. “I cannot apologise enough for the varied and conflicting advice you have received. It appears there has been a misunderstanding in how your application can proceed,” said one. He has since been told that a Skype interview can take place. Hamilton said they were getting increasingly desperate about not having a passport for Jacob: “The baby can’t travel, I’m in the UK, Priya and the children are in India and this has prevented us from reuniting as a family. It has become a really most distressing situation.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “During this unprecedented global public health emergency we have prioritised urgent and compassionate cases and are now working hard to get back to full capacity at our normal processing sites as soon as we are able to, in line with public health guidance. Throughout this time we have, where possible, explored alternative means to allow customers to complete their applications, but these are not always applicable to every case.”"
2020-09-04T11:00:23Z,politics,Politics,Rachel Reeves: 'Covid-19 has revealed we need to be more resilient',"Britain must learn to stand on its own two feet again, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, has said, outlining an emerging Labour plan for building a stronger country after the pandemic. A key theme will be fostering resilience in families, communities and public services, to protect people from shocks in their personal or national life. Reeves is struck that, despite being the sixth richest country in the world and having a proud manufacturing history, the UK couldn’t even muster enough protective clothing for its own key people in a pandemic. “I want us to be a more resilient country. I want us to build up our capacity to be able to stand on our own two feet, to build our manufacturing and productive capacity again so we’re not having to go cap in hand to China to get whatever masks they might be able to spare,” says Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, arguing that overseas production of such key resources could return onshore. “The first duty of government is to keep our citizens safe.” Her new brief from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is to focus on “what sort of country and society we want to be after the crisis”, generating ideas for the next manifesto. She will explore ways of building on the “small acts of kindness” between neighbours during the pandemic, integrating health and social care, building more family homes with gardens, and tackling precarious working practices that some fear are hampering the battle against Covid-19. “I don’t think it’s a massive surprise that Serco [the company running the national contact-tracing system] is struggling to get through to so many people,” says Reeves, who suspects some precariously employed people are avoiding contact tracers for fear of losing earnings if they have to self-isolate. “People don’t want to know they’re positive, and they don’t want to tell on others. People want to do the right thing, but what’s the right thing? Putting food on the table, being able to pay rent, not being evicted – that’s very difficult if you’re not getting any money coming in.” Covid-19 has illuminated hidden strengths in society but also weakness, she argued. “We need change, we need big change. I knew that before this pandemic, but I do think it’s revealed something.” So what, exactly, does Labour intend to do about it?
Reeves is nothing if not diligent. The daughter of two teachers, she went from a south London comprehensive to Oxford before joining the Bank of England as an economist. Elected in 2010, she was the shadow chief secretary by 2011. Asked if she has ever broken any rules, the worst she can remember is fights at primary school. “I’m a cautious person. I worry about saying the wrong thing and making mistakes,” she confesses over a mug of tea in her Leeds West constituency. Such caution is in keeping with a Starmer strategy that’s all about steady competence. An Opinium poll last week had Labour level-pegging with the Tories, having been 23 points behind when Starmer took charge. With Joe Biden also leading Donald Trump in the race for the White House, could the mood be turning against the rule-breakers and risk-takers dominating recent politics? “I hope so. I hope Joe Biden wins in the US, and I hope people put their trust in Keir Starmer, because he’s a man of huge decency and principle and integrity, and I think he really cares,” says Reeves. “He’s quite cautious and sensible and he wants to make sure he’s seen all the information. Sometimes that’s the tendency I’ve got as well: quite cautious, don’t want to rush in or be burdened by making a decision that, when you’ve got more information, turns out to be wrong. “But actually I think it’s quite a good way to govern the country. This government is always about campaigning, not about governing.” She credits Starmer with helping force Boris Johnson into several humiliating U-turns. “I think Keir’s encouraging people to take a second look at Labour, and people are interested in where Labour are going,” she says. The ultimate destination, however, remains somewhat mysterious. Is there any such thing as Starmerism? She pauses. “I don’t think Keir would want to create his own ‘ism’,” she says. He is focused on getting things done. “If you say you’re going to do something, he expects you to get it delivered; he expects you to treat people with respect and integrity, because that’s how he treats people.”
Five months in, she says it’s too early for a party that’s still learning the lessons of defeat to set out its entire stall. “If we had all the answers, we wouldn’t have lost four elections.” But she says resilience will be at its heart. For families, she thinks that means building affordable homes with outside space to play. “I walk down Victoria Street to parliament and you see [signs for] a new ‘living quarter’ in Westminster – that’s not a living quarter, that’s second homes and buy-to-let properties for overseas investors. We need social housing, and the council should be free to borrow to build.” Exploring how to integrate social care with the NHS is a priority, too, after care workers have risked their lives in the pandemic for low wages and little job security. “The basis is those people who were doing the most important jobs should be properly rewarded for them. There’s no status attached to working in care, there’s no professional development,” she says, noting that in Germany care workers are trained to the level of a district nurse. Should care workers still be on zero-hours contracts? “I don’t want to see zero-hour contracts anywhere in our economy.” Brexit is also in her in-tray, since she shadows the chief no-deal planner Michael Gove. But when asked if Labour would fight a no-deal Brexit, she fires back: “What does fight mean? We’ll oppose it, we do oppose it, but what’s the …” She tails off. “That election we had last December has changed everything in parliament.” With a majority of more than 80, Johnson has his mandate and Labour a mountain to climb. Having spent the Corbyn years on the backbenches, Reeves wasn’t necessarily expecting a comeback. But she fits naturally into a strategy for wooing back lost seats that mixes robust messages on defence or welfare (she famously once called Labour the party of working people, “not the party to represent those who are out of work”) and with attacks on low pay and crony capitalism. Chairing the Commons business select committee’s inquiry into the collapse of the outsourcing giant Carillion, which was winning contracts to deliver public services right up until it went bust thanks to a near monopoly market, profoundly changed her own view of capitalism. “I was so angry about what I saw,” she says. “All these blokes who earn a hell of a lot of money and had clearly had media training, they’d come in and say: ‘The first thing I want to say is sorry …’,” Yet Carillion bosses clung to their bonuses, she notes, even as small contractors went bust around them. It’s why she attacked the awarding of test-and-trace contracts to companies such as Serco and Deloitte, arguing that local councils would have done better. But the experience may also explain why this eternally cautious economist now rejects a return to a pre-Covid status quo. “My children say: ‘I just want things to be like they were before, I just want things to be normal’ and I understand that,” says Reeves, whose daughters are five and seven. “But I don’t want to go back to the way we were before. I want this to have jolted us into creating something better.”"
2020-09-04T09:08:48Z,politics,Politics,UK businesses demand urgent talks over fears of Brexit border chaos,"Businesses trading with the EU are demanding an urgent meeting with government ministers over concerns there are significant gaps in the UK’s Brexit border preparations. Eight logistics organisations have written to say they fear the supply chain that keeps supermarket shelves stocked daily will be severely disrupted next year if issues are not resolved before Brexit. They have expressed concern that some of the IT systems have not yet been tested and with four months to go there is not enough time to educate and train companies in the new systems, fuelling concerns of Brexit border chaos in January.
“If these issues are not addressed … UK business and the supply chain that we all rely so heavily on will be severely disrupted,” said a letter to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, from the Road Haulage Association, Logistics UK, UK Warehousing Association and others. Logistics UK, which represents freight owners, says companies that currently trade seamlessly with the EU are being asked to deal with eight different IT systems to trade with the biggest partners in the bloc. The group are demanding a roundtable meeting with Gove, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. Four of the IT systems are being rolled out by UK authorities, but hauliers are then faced with four other systems when they arrive in France, Belgium, the Netherlands or Ireland. One new IT system, known as the “Smart Freight” traffic light system, is designed to ensure drivers who do not have the correct paperwork for export to the EU will be barred from going into Kent and therefore adding to congestion on local roads and the port of Dover. They have been told they face fines of £300 if they drive into Kent without the right documentation for international transit. Logistics UK says the system will not go into beta phase testing until the autumn. “We are concerned that mass user testing of the software will not be possible until October – or maybe even November. This is far too late for the thousands of companies and tens of thousands of people who build our complex supply chains to redesign their own processes and contractual relations,” said Sarah Laouadi, the European policy manager at Logistics UK. Delays in rolling out the IT system have fuelled fears of congestion and chaos, with queues developing in lorry parks in Kent and new sites set to be commandeered for holding lorries across the country. “There is nothing the lorry driver can do, if the paperwork is wrong, the paperwork is wrong and the truck will have to stay where it is until the paperwork is right, which could mean hours or even days in a lorry park,” said another source at Logistics UK. According to a Cabinet Office memo, seen by Bloomberg, the government is aware of the potential dangers and mentions two further IT systems on top of the eight the logistics sector is aware of. “There are up to 10 new systems that haulage firms and freight forwarders will have to navigate from Jan 1, including at least three being designed now,” the memo said. “This is completely unnecessary and unmanageable with duplication and overlap.” Shapps said he would meet haulage bosses. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday he had “very, very regular contact” with “people like the Road Haulage Association”. A government spokesperson said they had received the letter and would respond, adding the border operating model published earlier this summer detailed its approach. “We worked closely with industry in its development and will continue to do so as we move towards the end of the transition period. “In addition to the border operating model, we are also investing £705m in jobs, infrastructure and technology at the border and have announced a new £50m support package to boost the capacity of the customs intermediary sector ensuring we are ready for the changes and opportunities ahead,” the spokesperson said."
2020-09-04T05:00:16Z,politics,Politics,"Government secrecy hindered Brexit plans, watchdog says","Excessive secrecy about the government’s Brexit negotiating objectives and a failure to get to grips with the scale of the challenge hindered preparations for the UK’s exit from the EU, according to Whitehall’s spending watchdog. Departments issued non-disclosure agreements when discussing plans that were meant to inform the public and the business community, the National Audit Office said. More than 22,000 workers were deployed across Whitehall departments on the preparations, which cost £4.4bn. The findings have emerged in a study that drew up lessons to be learned from the government’s attempts to ready the country for Brexit following the 2016 referendum. The 23-page report said the secrecy maintained by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), which was disbanded after the UK left the trade bloc on 31 January and entered a transition period, did not aid cross-government working. “DExEU kept a tight hold on communications, keeping secret anything which might pertain to the UK’s negotiating position,” the report said. “This instinct for secrecy in government can get in the way of effective coordination, collaboration and a sense of urgency in progressing towards a common goal.” Both the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport asked third parties to sign non-disclosure agreements when discussing technical notices that were designed to inform businesses and stakeholders about steps they may need to take in the event of a no-deal scenario. “The non-disclosure agreements undermined transparency and hampered the spread of information to the business community at large,” the report said. Staffing proved a particular issue for a political and economic event that impacted almost every strand of government, auditors found. “Staff turnover in EU exit roles, and particularly in DExEU itself, was higher than for the civil service in general. The problem was particularly acute at more senior grades. In its less than four years in existence, DExEU had three permanent secretaries. “Other departments most affected by (the) EU exit have also seen changes at permanent secretary level, including Defra and HMRC.”
Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Preparing for EU exit continues to be a highly complex and challenging task for government and stakeholders. “Government can draw on this learning in preparing for the end of the transition period and beyond, and in managing other cross-government challenges including its response to Covid-19 and net zero.” Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said ministers must ensure such mistakes were not repeated. “The government took too long to get to grips with the challenge it was facing. “It didn’t collect enough information about the people and money it was committing to Brexit preparations, and couldn’t assess whether it was striking the right balance between its priorities. “It must not make these mistakes again when weighing up how best to allocate resources between the pandemic response, Brexit and its other priorities,” she said."
2020-09-03T18:36:53Z,politics,Politics,NHS leaders raise concerns over test and trace as Covid cases rise,"Ministers have set out plans to ramp up testing for coronavirus, as NHS leaders expressed deep concern about problems in the test-and-trace system. With figures showing a steady rise in the number of new infections, the government announced a new laboratory in Loughborough that it said would be able to process 50,000 tests a day by the end of the year. It also revealed two new pilot projects for saliva tests as a part of a £500m investment in what it called the “next generation” of testing. One of the pilots in Salford will investigate the possibility of mass screening whole populations, which could if successful be used in schools, care homes or communities where outbreaks have occurred. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said mass testing was a key tool against the virus before a vaccine is developed. “In fact, if you had population testing there’s no reason why you theoretically would need to have social distancing,” he told ITV. “You could pretty much carry on life as normal because you’d just know that everyone you’d mix with had been tested very, very recently.” NHS sources played down the idea that mass testing could be a “silver bullet”, however, pointing out that the basics of hand-washing, social distancing and covering the face where necessary would still be required and that a high-functioning test-and-trace system would still be vital.
The latest figures from the NHS test-and-trace programme showed that 80% of people who tested positive in England in the week to 26 August were contacted by tracing teams and asked to self-isolate. But almost a third (30.6%) of their contacts – the people with whom they had been mixing prior to the test – went unreached. The number of people testing positive for Covid in England was up 6% on the previous week at 6,372, equating to an average of 961 cases a day, the highest for any week since May. On Thursday 1,735 new cases were reported across whole of the UK, compared with 1,522 on Thursday last week. NHS leaders expressed concern at the data. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “It is deeply worrying to see more people test positive for Covid-19 this week, with the number of positive cases in England now the highest since May. It is also concerning that infrastructure problems may still be delaying some cases being transferred to the test-and-trace system. “We are also continuing to see a mixed picture within the system. Of those cases that were transferred, a higher proportion of positive cases were reached, and a higher number of close contacts were identified, but a lower proportion of the close contacts were reached. “The turnaround times for swab testing within the community also remains below what we would like to see, despite small improvements this week. It is vital improvements are made quickly as we move towards the winter months.” Dr Layla McCay, a director at the NHS Confederation, said: “The government is making progress on test and trace, with increases in capacity and numbers being reached, but these improvements are small steps when its own aspirations are for giant leaps. The new funding for trials to scale up testing capacity can’t come soon enough because we know that alongside effective tracing, testing is vital to reduce the transmission of coronavirus.”
The saliva sampling, or “spit test”, that will be offered in Salford gives results in 20 minutes. It has the advantage of being non-invasive and more comfortable than swab tests. It has been trialled already in Southampton, where it is said to have proved fairly accurate, but not enough people were infected there to make the data conclusive. The government is also investing in other kinds of rapid tests using nasal swabs, which – if they work well enough – will overcome the issue of sometimes long turnaround times for the swab tests that have to go to labs. The government’s target is to have all tests reported within 24 hours, so that contacts of people who are infected can be reached quickly to reduce the risk that they may spread the virus. The median times for getting a result from home tests and from satellite testing centres was 86 and 76 hours respectively in the week 20-26 August, while regional and mobile test units achieved median times of 24 and 22 hours. Dr Joshua Moon, of the science policy research unit of the University of Sussex Business School, said: “Rapid tests are a good thing in general and, if they have the same reliability and accuracy as the PCR test, have the potential to be of real benefit to the response. The key, however, is to remember that these tests exist within a whole system of response rather than being the sole component. “Having a rapid test is useless if positive cases can’t or won’t isolate because support and enforcement is absent or if contacts can’t be identified because the tracing system is overwhelmed. As such, while a rapid test is a useful thing to have, it needs to be supported by a whole system of policies and strategies around contact tracing, case and contact isolation, support for those self-isolating, and evaluation of the system itself to ensure better functioning as the pandemic continues.”"
2020-09-03T17:44:29Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: highest daily cases since 4 June; Portugal added to Wales quarantine list but not England's – as it happened,"Mainland Portugal has been added to the Welsh governmentâ€™s quarantine list, but not Englandâ€™s. This means holidaymakers returning to Wales after 4am tomorrow from mainland Portugal - as well as from Gibraltar, French Polynesia and the Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete, which are also being added to the Welsh list - will have to self-isolate for 14 days. (See 5.42pm.) The Welsh government said it was acting following â€œclear advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) ... that travel from [these countries] constitutes a public health riskâ€�. But the UK government (for these purposes, the English government), which also receives the same advice, said it was making no changes to its quarantine list today. (See 5.12pm.) The number of close contacts of people who tested positive for Covid-19 being reached through Englandâ€™s NHS Test and Trace is at its lowest since the system was launched, new figures have been revealed. (See 2.49pm.) The statistics were published only hours after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said Englandâ€™s test-and-trace system and other responses to coronavirus were now so good that the country could avoid a major resurgence in cases of the virus, as seen in countries such as France and Spain. The UK has recorded 1,735 new cases of coronavirus - the highest daily total since 4 June (1,805). (See 5.29pm.) Scotlandâ€™s national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, has said he does not think the mass roll-out of a 20-minute coronavirus test will prove feasible in the near future. (See 4.26pm.) He was speaking hours after Hancock said that it could be widely available in the coming months. Heathrow has told long-serving frontline staff they must take a pay cut of 15-20% or face job losses, with the aviation sectorâ€™s hopes of a quick summer recovery from the pandemic dashed. Costa Coffee is to cut up to 1,650 jobs in its cafes â€“ more than one in 10 of its workforce, as it said trading remained challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. The human rights watchdog for England and Wales has backed a grieving daughterâ€™s court action against the health secretary, Matt Hancock, over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in care homes. The EU has rejected a British proposal for a system to reunite children seeking asylum with their families in the UK or Europe, prompting warnings that more young people will risk their lives in dangerous Channel crossings.

2020-09-03T13:44:42Z,politics,Politics,Tiggerish Hancock deflates at having to big up joker Tony Abbott | John Crace,"It was an excitable Matt Hancock who headed out on the morning media round. New start, new tie. Out had gone the stained pink polyester job that he had been wearing round the clock for the past six months and in its place was a brand new powder blue number. It was time to reset the dial. The prime minister was incapable, there had been too much doom and gloom about government U-turns and exam results chaos, so someone needed to step up to give the nation hope. And who better than Tigger? To his disappointmentment, his studio tour hadn’t been a total success. For some reason his efforts to big up “Operation Moon Shot” – the new James Bond nerve centre headed up by Classic Dom in No 10 who had come up with that one on day one! – wasn’t being greeted with the shock and awe that he had hoped. Rather than focus on the new game-changing saliva tests that would allow nearly everyone to be tested for coronavirus once a week, presenters had responded with a bemused scepticism. Wasn’t it pushing things a bit to be bigging up a technology that didn’t yet exist – and might not do so before the end of the year at the earliest – especially given the government’s current iffy test-and-trace system, long-forgotten phone apps and the UK’s unwanted record for having one of the highest number of coronavirus deaths per head of population in the world? Might it not be better to try to concentrate on technologies that enabled as many people as possible to function relatively normally rather than obsess with something world-beating? Just trust me, the health secretary had pleaded tetchily. Only no one did. But it was during his interview with Kay Burley on Sky News that things nosedived badly. Having spent about eight minutes letting Hancock try to pitch the TV rights to Operation Moon Shot, she changed the subject to Boris Johnson’s pick to head up the board of trade alongside Liz Truss. Here Burley was at her most polite. She could have pointed out that the former Australian prime minister was well known for his racism, his climate change denial and for reckoning that most people who had died of the coronavirus had probably deserved what they got. Now was as good a time as any to weed out the weak and the sick. Instead, Burley chose just to point out that Tony Abbott was a homophobe and a misogynist. Did that make him the right person to be negotiating trade deals on behalf of the UK government? At first Hancock merely chose to suggest that Burley might have misunderstood that Abbott was really a bit of a joker – a bit like Boris with his watermelon smiles and letter-box burqas – but the Sky presenter didn’t give up. She merely repeated that she had read some of Abbott’s choicest clips and the evidence was clear. He was a homophobe and a misogynist.
Now Tigger began to visibly panic. Even his normal L’Oréal skin showed signs of furrows on his forehead. “Um … he’s also an expert in trade,” he said. An answer that was wrong on so many levels. The first was the word “also”. As if being a misogynist and a homophobe might be an acceptable tradeoff for his other qualities. Who knows? It could be handy to have someone on the same wavelength as other world leaders who were also homophobes and misogynists. In the same way that Harold Shipman may have been a serial killer but you couldn’t deny his expertise in palliative end-of-life care. What was also open to question was whether Abbott has any expertise in trade deals. If he does then it’s a mystery to many Australians who can’t remember him having made a worthwhile contribution to any trade deal. Indeed one Australian reader got in touch with me to point out that Abbott is both anti-free trade and opposed to many of the treaties Australia already has in place. “Most Asian countries think he’s a dickhead,” he wrote. Realising his mistake, Hancock tried to distance himself from Abbott somewhat – recruitment via LinkedIn did have its teething problems – but by then the damage was done. Little more than an hour later, the House of Commons was sitting for international trade questions with many MPs looking quite subdued. What with the coronavirus and exams, most MPs had rather forgotten that there was the minor matter of Brexit to resolve and that the person in charge of agreeing trade deals outside the EU was the intellectually challenged Liz Truss. And needless to say, in between insisting there was no need to preserve food standards in law because we had no intention of changing the rules on chlorinated chicken to secure a US deal, she and her departmental team were also quick to defend the yet-to-be-confirmed appointment of the former Australian prime minister. First the junior minister Greg Hands welcomed Abbott’s willingness to come to Blighty’s rescue in its hour of need and assured the house that his climate change denial would have no impact on our negotiations on environmental standards. Indeed it was positively dialectically useful to have someone on board negotiating the exact opposite of what he believed. Then during topical questions from Labour’s Ruth Cadbury and Christian Matheson, when directly challenged on Abbott’s suitability, Truss refused to give a direct answer and just went on the attack. John McDonnell had been a misogynist so why wasn’t it OK for Tony and Boris? Sooner or later the Conservatives are going to have to realise Labour has been under new management for the best part of six months. Besides, homophobia, racism, misogyny, climate change denial and lack of expertise were just virtue-signalling from Labour. Sometimes the right person for the job was the one who was the least well qualified. Yet more twisted dialectics. But one thing was unarguable. Between them Hancock and Truss had put forward the ideal show-reels in the BBC’s search for rightwing comedians. Even if they weren’t that funny. Johnson has repeatedly called for the UK to stop being so embarrassed about itself. Something that would be much easier were we not to have such embarrassments in government."
2020-09-03T13:21:14Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson is not hiring Tony Abbott for his trade expertise | Larry Elliott,"It is often said, in a phrase once attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that there are three categories of mistruths: lies, damned lies and statistics. By the same token there are three types of geeks: geeks, super-geeks and trade negotiators. Trade negotiators know the difference between the bound and applied tariff on imports of cars into Brazil. They know the quota for frozen lamb that can imported into the EU from New Zealand. They know their way around all 22,500 pages of commitments made by different countries at the end of the Uruguay round of trade talks in 1993. These people are experts and, despite what the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said, Tony Abbott is not one of them. Expertise, though, is not why the UK government is thinking about hiring the former Australian prime minister as a trade envoy. He is not being lined up as a details man, but because he is an evangelist for free trade and his government signed deals with three of Asia’s biggest economies: China, Japan and South Korea. All these agreements had been worked on for years but Abbott got them over the line.
There are two phases to any trade deal: the technical phase where officials haggle over what should and shouldn’t be protected, and a delivery phase where the politicians are called in to settle the outstanding issues. The government has already hired a vastly experienced trade technician in Crawford Falconer, the former New Zealand ambassador to the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Falconer is a tough and wily negotiator, although by all accounts an under-used resource.
Abbott doesn’t claim to have Falconer’s grasp of the nitty-gritty, but that wouldn’t be his role. His job would be give log-jammed negotiations a political push and so get free trade deals over the line. Or as he put it to the Policy Exchange thinktank this week: “Look, obviously as prime minister you are not dealing with the minutiae of trade deals. You are dealing with things at the very highest of levels. “You are reassuring heads of other governments that you would like to bring about a deal that is a win-win situation as soon as as possible, and you are encouraging senior officials not to be held up by things that are not all that important and not to be distracted by things that are not really issues of trade but might, forargument’s sake, be issues of the environment.” Whether the former Liberal party prime minister will have the chance to prove his worth remains to be seen. Despite plenty of speculation, the government has yet to confirm his appointment and might decide that Abbott’s reputation for misogyny and homophobia means he will be more trouble than he is worth."
2020-09-03T12:01:28Z,politics,Politics,Tory peer accused of breaching ministerial code with Uganda deals,"A Conservative peer has been accused of breaching the ministerial code after her family firm signed multimillion-pound deals to supply Uganda’s government with solar power equipment. Sandip Verma’s company, Nexus Green, has signed two deals worth more than £88m after meetings with the sub-Saharan country’s notoriously homophobic president, Yoweri Museveni. Lady Verma appears to have broken ministerial rules after joining the company as chair and director without informing the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba). She was present when Nexus Green signed an £8m deal to provide the Ugandan military with solar power, eight months after leaving her job as a junior development minister. According to rules to ensure transparency, ministers are supposed to declare all roles and jobs for up to two years after leaving office. The deals have surprised other suppliers in the African solar power market. Verma and her son Rikki are the only directors, they have no previous experience in the industry, and the company does not have a website. The Ugandan government also signed an agreement with the firm last September to build a factory to make solar equipment. According to the agreement, most of it would be financed by applying for a loan worth more than £80m from UK Export Finance (UKEF), which is an export credit agency and a government department. Preet Kaur Gill, the shadow development secretary, called for Boris Johnson to launch an inquiry, saying: “The guidance on accepting an appointment after leaving ministerial office is clear. “The prime minister must immediately instigate a full investigation to confirm whether Baroness Verma broke the high standards expected of ministers by both the ministerial code and the public. “Ministers cannot be allowed to abuse their position for personal gain and if she is found to have broken the code then the prime minister must act to reassure the public that he will not tolerate such violations.” Verma, 61, a former parliamentary candidate who was made a life peer in 2006, was a junior minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, and then for International Development (DfID) from May 2015 to July 2016. She stood last year to become mayor of her home city of Leicester, many of whose residents were forced to leave Uganda in the 1970s. Contacted by the Guardian, Verma said she believed she did not break the rules on declarations of interest because Nexus Green was an energy firm and not connected to her last role in DfID. “If it relates to a ministerial position then you have got to declare it. “I did not have to declare this because I had left energy many years earlier,” she said. Museveni, Uganda’s leader since 1986, has been internationally condemned for refusing to relinquish power, intimidating, torturing and jailing political opponents and for introducing anti-LGBT laws that punish gay sex with long prison sentences. The former soldier, who was involved in toppling previous leaders Idi Amin and Milton Obote, has met Verma, on at least three occasions. In an hour-long New Year’s Day speech in 2018 he mentioned Nexus Green’s plans to supply solar equipment. Verma, whose Twitter account displays a rainbow flag flying above parliament and describes herself as an “activist for equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion”, said she did not raise Uganda’s anti-LGBT legislation when she met Museveni. “I go there for whatever purposes I am going for and I am not raising that issue [of gay rights] at this moment in time,” she said. Verma met Ugandan government officials on at least one occasion while she was a minister – on 12 September 2015 in London, at a convention to discuss investment opportunities in sectors such as energy. The following month Rikki became director of Nexus Green, a company based in a building in Leicester jointly owned by his parents. Rikki, who sometimes uses the title “honourable” because he is the son of a peer, has been described as the chief executive of the company, while his mother is the chair. The £8m agreement with the Ugandan government to provide its military facilities with off-the-grid solar energy infrastructure was signed in February 2017 and was witnessed by Museveni and Verma. In January this year, as part of a push to strike deals outside the EU, DfIT announced 27 deals across Africa, including Nexus Green’s plan to export £80m of solar-powered water pumping systems for irrigation in Uganda. The Ugandan parliament’s national economy committee has written (pdf) that Nexus Green plans to establish a factory in Uganda to make solar-powered irrigation equipment and install the systems. Last September, the committee signed off a proposal to try to borrow up to £90m from UKEF for the development of solar-powered irrigation. It is understood that an application for a loan has been received but has not been approved. A UKEF spokeswoman said she could not comment on speculation about potential transactions for reasons of commercial confidentiality. “UKEF undertakes rigorous due diligence including checks against financial crime, bribery and corruption, prior to any support being provided.” A spokesperson on behalf of Verma said there had been no impropriety in the activities of Nexus Green. “Baroness Verma has never lobbied the UK government on their behalf and has never sought to inappropriately use her ministerial career for the company’s benefit. Any suggestion Baroness Verma has is farcical, not least because when in office her ministerial brief did not cover Uganda,” she said."
2020-09-03T10:45:32Z,politics,Politics,Labour urges UK government not to hire Tony Abbott as trade envoy,"The UK government is facing increased pressure over its proposed appointment of Tony Abbott as a trade envoy because of his views about women, equal marriage and climate change, with Labour calling for the idea to be scrapped. “I have real concerns about Tony Abbott and don’t think he’s the right person for the job,” Keir Starmer said in a TV clip. “And if I was prime minister I wouldn’t appoint him.” The Labour leader’s comments come after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, expressed some apparent discomfort at the appointment, declining to endorse the former Australian prime minister’s views. Later, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, was chastised in the Commons by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for refusing twice to engage with questions from Labour about Abbott’s suitability. The government has yet to confirm that Abbott is to be appointed to the Board of Trade to help with post-Brexit trade deals, but has also not denied this will happen. Abbott’s attitudes to women, including describing abortion as “the easy way out” and suggesting men are better adapted than women to exercise authority, made international headlines in 2012 when the then-Australian PM, Julia Gillard, used a widely shared speech in parliament to castigate his views. He has also suggested climate change is “probably doing good”, and likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. Asked about the criticisms of Abbott’s views, Boris Johnson’s spokesman declined to comment, saying: “No decisions on the Board of Trade have been made.” Answering trade questions in the Commons, Truss, who is also the minister for women and equalities, refused to answer questions from two Labour MPs on Abbott’s views. Asked by Ruth Cadbury about his apparent misogyny, Truss instead talked about Labour’s “absolute hypocrisy” given previous comment by Labour MPs and the fact it had never had a female leader, saying the party would “rather virtue signal and indulge in tokenism rather than take real action to improve the lives of women”. When Christian Matheson asked whether Abbott’s climate change scepticism meant this would not be a focus for future trade deals, Truss again evaded the question, instead calling those on the left “intolerant of anyone who doesn’t agree with them, but are prepared to defend anything from their own friends”. This brought a reprimand from Hoyle, who told Truss: “I think we’ve got to remember we actually answer questions rather than keep asking them.” Questioned earlier on Abbott’s views during a TV interview, Hancock stressed the former PM’s “huge amount of expertise” in international trade but repeatedly cited his own contrasting opinions on areas like equal marriage. Asked whether he believed Abbott was a “fit and proper” person to take on an official UK role, Hancock declined to concur. He told Sky News: “I think the best thing to say is that I am totally focused on the coronavirus crisis and the future of the NHS and social care. That is my area. I do know that Mr Abbott is very good and very experienced in trade.”
At one point Hancock did disagree with the idea that Abbott was a “homophobic misogynist”, saying: “I don’t think that’s true.” But when some of the former PM’s views were put to him, Hancock added: “He’s also an expert in trade.” Hancock argued that the main issue in appointing Abbott was his experience in trade: “As far as I understand it, the proposal is that Mr Abbott supports the UK on trade policy, which is an area in which he has a huge amount of expertise. I bow to nobody in my support of everybody to love who they love, whoever that is.
“But we need to have the best experts in the world, working in their field, and as the former prime minister of Australia, obviously Mr Abbott has got a huge amount of experience.” Asked if his trade expertise negated his views, Hancock said: “What I’m saying is that we need experts in different areas, and the former prime minister of Australia is, obviously, an enormous expert in the field of trade. It doesn’t change my views.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Abbott’s coronavirus views were “deeply offensive and wrong” and he was not fit to be a trade envoy. “But Tony Abbott, before these comments, is a misogynist, he’s a sexist, he’s a climate-change denier,” she told Sky News."
2020-09-03T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,"GMB union institutionally sexist, inquiry finds","One of Britain’s biggest trade unions has been described as “institutionally sexist” in a highly critical independent report. The GMB union, whose general secretary, Tim Roache, stood down this year following anonymous allegations of misconduct, needs “fundamental change”, the inquiry by the barrister Karon Monaghan QC concludes. “Bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment are endemic within the GMB,” the report says. “The culture in the GMB is one of heavy drinking and late-night socialising, salacious gossip and a lack of professionalism.” The report covers the last decade, 2010 to 2020, and Monaghan interviewed three former general secretaries of the union, the third biggest in the UK with 620,000 members. Monaghan said women were “underrepresented throughout the GMB’s ranks”, with branches “often organised in a way that deters women members’ participation”. She said regional secretaries, “who are, and always have been, men,” held “disproportionate power” in the union. “Many use that power to bully and manipulate members of the GMB’s lay bodies.” She added: “Fundamental change is required if the GMB is to meet its promise to women in the GMB and to women in society more widely.” She made a list of 27 recommendations to the union, including taking steps to increase the representation of women at all levels and introducing a bespoke complaints procedure for sexual harassment and an annual equalities audit. The report concludes that sexual harassment is common in the union. “Examples of sexual harassment I heard about included touching hair, leering, commenting on body shape and clothes, placing hands around a woman’s waist, staring at a woman’s breasts or ‘tits’, propositioning young women, ‘sloppy kisses’, ‘lip kisses’, ‘sticking a tongue’ in a woman’s ear, touching of knees, bottoms and hips, hugs, and slapping of a backside,” it says. Sometimes sexual harassment has been used as a form of bullying, the report says, with examples of men in the union deliberately sexually harassing women in public to humiliate and embarrass them. “I have also heard of more serious sexual assaults. I was told by one witness that ‘it is simply expected that you’ll have to suffer from being groped at events’,” Monaghan wrote. Barbara Plant, the union’s national president, said: “On behalf of GMB, I apologise to all those who have experienced sexual harassment or bullying within the union. It’s clear that real and lasting change is needed for us to become a safe and inclusive place for all.” She said the union would now act on the report’s recommendations: “We are committed to achieving this transformational change.” The union began an independent investigation into sexual harassment in May after announcing it had received an anonymous letter containing claims about Roache’s conduct. The letter accused him of “sexist and aggressive” behaviour. Roache called the allegations against him “defamatory lies” and a “politically motivated smear, deliberately timed to take advantage of my poor health”. When he stepped down, GMB said Roache had chronic fatigue syndrome and that medical professionals had advised him to refrain from work."
2020-09-02T21:00:20Z,politics,Politics,Mass weekly Covid-19 testing of population to be trialled in England,"The UK government is to trial routine weekly Covid testing of the population as part of preparations to head off a possible winter second wave, as the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for such tests to become the norm. Matt Hancock said the government was committing an extra £500m to scale up testing capacity and launch community pilots trialling the effectiveness of repeat testing in schools and colleges, as well as in the population as a whole. It will also ramp up the trials of a new test kit that it is claimed can provide results within 20 minutes. The boldest measure will be a new community-wide trial in Salford, launching imminently, to assess the benefits of repeat population testing. Initially, the pilot will focus on a specific high-footfall location in the city with retail, public services, transport and faith spaces. Hunt, who now chairs the health select committee, said the UK should embrace mass population testing. “I would really want to expand the whole testing programme so we can almost get to a point where we are testing the whole population every week,” he said. “As an intermediate step I’d want to have expanded it by now so that we’re at least testing all NHS staff and all teachers every week, so people can be absolutely confident when they’re using hospitals, when they’re sending their kids to school, that they are coronavirus-free zones,” he said. “I think this mass testing could potentially be linked to an app on your phone so that you could show people on your phone the last time you got tested.” Hunt said mass testing was the key tool against the virus before a vaccine was developed. “In fact, if you had population testing there’s no reason why you, theoretically, would need to have social distancing: you could pretty much carry on life as normal because you’d just know that everyone you’d mix with had been tested very, very recently,” he told ITV’s Acting Prime Minister podcast. The government is also expanding other testing trials, including a pilot of the rapid 20-minute test in Hampshire as part of mobile testing in different settings. In Southampton, the second phase of the pilot will trial the weekly testing at the University of Southampton and four Southampton schools. More than 2,100 pupils and staff across four schools will be invited to have a test. Hancock said testing was “a vital line of defence” and the government had to keep innovating to tackle the pandemic. “We need to use every new innovation at our disposal to expand the use of testing, and build the mass testing capability that can help suppress the virus and enable more of the things that make life worth living,” he said. Almost 10,000 people took part in the first phase of the Southampton pilot, where GP staff, other essential key workers, university employees and members of their households were sent tests to their home or place of work and completed them by putting saliva in a pot. The Department of Health and Social Care said the pilot showed the at-home saliva sampling kit was reliable for large-scale, regular testing. The government has previously rejected calls for routine testing to become the norm in schools, including from Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, said last month there were no plans to test pupils and teachers without symptoms. “The advice that we have is that it’s better to test when people actually show symptoms,” he said."
2020-09-02T19:09:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson tries to calm Tory mutiny with vow to keep taxes low,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have vowed to keep taxes low, in a coordinated attempt to calm mutinous Conservative MPs angered and unsettled by the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. In a series of briefings with so-called “red wall” Tories, the prime minister and the chancellor sought to play down suggestions that the autumn budget would include extensive tax increases to reduce the budget deficit. But they also said the government must be “honest” about tough choices ahead, and hinted that future tax rises could not be ruled out. Speaking at a private meeting with Tory MPs newly elected last year, many of whom won seats in Labour heartlands on the promise of public investment, Sunak stressed a belief in a “dynamic low-tax economy” – a phrase probably designed to counters rumours that the Treasury is planning significant hikes in corporation tax, fuel duty, capital gains tax or self-employed national insurance contributions, all likely to be opposed by different wings of the party. Sunak, who was earlier photographed leaving Downing Street carrying his preparatory notes, told MPs there would not be “a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight”. However, he warned the Treasury would “need to do some difficult things … but I promise you, if we trust one another we will be able to overcome the short-term challenges”.
Johnson made a tacit acknowledgement of the number of the government’s U-turns, which have angered so many MPs over the summer, on issues from A-level grading to local lockdowns and masks. One MP summing up the mood said:“Everyone is very grumpy coming back, it feels like there is no coherent strategy, and this a charm offensive to win back some morale.” Johnson told MPs they were likely to face a challenging winter. “I know it’s been tough,” he said. “I’ve got to warn you going it’s about to get tougher. The waters are about to get choppier. But we are going to deal with it.” He stressed the importance of the “red wall” intake in his speech to the new MPs, saying the government would prioritise the needs of their voters – a move that could alarm some traditional Tories. “We owe you, the country owes you, and above all we owe your constituents. We are going to deliver for your constituents in what they continue to call the red wall, but it’s the blue wall,” he said. The government has borrowed £150bn in the first four months of the 2020-21 financial year and is on course to borrow more than £300bn by the year’s end. The Treasury is braced for the phasing out of its furlough scheme by the end of October to lead to higher unemployment, and Whitehall sources said the chancellor’s immediate focus was on a £2bn jobs package to help unemployed 16- to 24-year-olds into work.
One source said the chancellor’s message was a mixture of reassurance and tough love. “Down the line they will need to make sure the public finances are in good shape, but that’s not today’s issue,” the source said. With the national debt rising above £2tn for the first time, Sunak told MPs that the spending would eventually have to stop. He said the party had to retain its reputation for fiscal credibility after a splurge of spending to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic, and said the government had to show the public how it planned to “correct our public finances”. Sunak stressed economic competence was the party’s key advantage over Labour, a nod to how the party has been losing ground to Keir Starmer’s party in the polls. He told the MPs, many of whom have slim majorities in the traditionally Labour areas, that there would be a clear difference on tax between the Conservatives and Labour. “We cannot, will not and must not surrender our position as the party of economic competence and sound finance. If we argue instead that there is no limit to what we can spend, that we can simply borrow our way out of any hole, then what is the difference between us and Labour?” he said. Earlier Thérèse Coffey became the first cabinet minister to publicly warn against a move towards higher taxes. The work and pensions secretary said that while she would not comment directly on Treasury plans, reductions in tax would be more likely to bring in an increased amount of money. “In the past, when some people might assume the only way to get tax up is to increase tax rates, actually we have shown in our economic history the opposite,” she told Times Radio. The budget poses a challenge for Sunak to please both sides of the new-look Conservative party after the last election. New-intake Tories from northern England have made clear their opposition to tax rises seen to hit working families, including any rise in fuel duty or in national insurance contributions for the self-employed. Shire Tories have made their feelings clear on any potential increase to capital gains tax, which they believe will alienate middle-income voters. “That is just absolutely toxic for us, I’ve already had emails saying ‘don’t you dare’,” one frontbencher said. A government source said there would be “increasing engagement” with MPs as more returned to Westminster – a tacit acknowledgment that the government has spent a significant amount of its political capital over the summer, leading to vociferous public criticism from some senior Tories including Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, and Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the liaison committee. During a sometimes bruising prime minister’s questions for Johnson on Wednesday he was reprimanded by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for repeatedly ignoring questions from Keir Starmer and for refusing to apologise for accusing the Labour leader of complicity in tolerance for the IRA. The row erupted after Johnson evaded one question by instead referring to Starmer’s tenure as shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, saying he was “a leader of the opposition who supported an IRA-condoning politician”. A clearly angry Starmer pointed to his work combating Northern Ireland terrorism as the director of public prosecutions and demanded Johnson “do the decent thing” and withdraw the comment, which the prime minister refused to do. Johnson’s performance seemed to rile some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman, the chair of the transport select committee, said the prime minister needed to “mug up” when facing Starmer. “The theatrical approach just doesn’t work,” he told Sky News.
The PM later addressed his first post-recess gathering of the 1922 Committee, with around 50 or so MPs gathering in a committee room despite signs outside giving a socially distanced capacity of 29. While No 10 had in billed the PM’s appearance in advance as “a pop-in”, he spoke for almost 15 minutes, described by one MP as “less a barnstorming performance than a fairly standard rallying speech”, much of which he had delivered earlier to the 2019 intake of Tories, something the PM joked about. At the meeting, Johnson also called for a return to workplaces, saying this was key to any economic recovery. “An ounce of confidence is worth a tonne of Rishi’s money,” he said, adding that he hoped for a return to near normality by Christmas. The prime minister then dashed out after just one question, saying he had to make his audience with the Queen."
2020-09-02T18:47:21Z,politics,Politics,Could the line between UK aid and defence spending become blurred?,"David Cameron was long committed to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid as a way of demonstrating in the early part of the decade that the Conservatives had changed, although the pledge was not always popular across the party. It is a target that has been hit every year since 2013, enduring throughout the premiership of the first of Cameron’s successors. But a recent series of briefings suggested the £12.9bn budget is coming under more severe pressure, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tries to tackle the £30bn-plus cost of helping Britain through the coronavirus crisis in the run-up to the November spending round. Over the past few days it has been suggested that any new defence spending, such as on drones or cyberwarfare, would have to be funded from the aid budget – and even that the 0.7% target, enshrined in law, could be under threat. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was quick to defend the 0.7% target as the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office began work on Wednesday, and dismissed rumours of a switch from aid to military spending as “tittle-tattle”. Defence insiders were similarly sceptical. “We are not getting money from the aid budget,” said one source, who said there was no diktat from the Treasury that new defence spending would have to be paid for from aid. Conservative commitments mean defence is particularly well funded. The party’s election manifesto promised not just to hit the longstanding target of 2% of GDP but to increase spending by 0.5% above inflation, a commitment the Ministry of Defence is still working towards. That means that while the overseas aid budget has already been cut by £2.9bn in July – with a massive knock-on impact on the aid sector – the defence budget is relatively stable, and is expected, if the pledge is met, to be a little over £42bn in 2021-22. Yet for all the financial stability, the MoD is struggling financially. It has a shortfall of £13bn in its 10-year equipment budget, which officials are trying to close amid a debate about Britain’s post-Brexit role in the world. A defence and foreign policy review has restarted after being stalled because of coronavirus. Last week it emerged that the military was giving consideration to mothballing the army’s ageing Challenger 2 tank fleet, which is at the point of obsolescence. Experts say ministers needs to be clear about what the definition of the UK’s national security is. Britain has become embroiled in wars that it started in Iraq and Afghanistan, but its involvement in combat operations in the last of those ended in 2010, and expensive conventional wars using costly kit appear unlikely in the future. Prof Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said: “It’s not clear the UK needs to have a division-size force on standby for deployment in three months’ time in a foreign war; what’s needed is the ability to put a few hundred in a crisis zone in a few days.” Simply repurposing aid spending on drones or cyberwarfare to bail out the MoD would appear impossible to achieve, as the UK adheres to international definitions on aid spending that rule out spending on military equipment, services or counter-terrorism spending. But a more subtle blending of aid and defence spending is already under way. The £1.26bn Conflict and Stability Fund, launched in 2015, runs programmes in Lebanon, Colombia and Pakistan, part of a previous attempt to placate critics of the size of the aid budget. And there are some examples where it could make good sense: effectively tackling the migrant crisis in west Africa at source in countries such as Mali, Niger and Chad could justify additional integrated spend on aid, policing and reconnaissance capability. Old Whitehall hands say they detect the beginnings of a familiar game. “It’s like a judo bout, where everybody is trying to get a grip as the negotiations with the Treasury begin,” said one. “Leaks are starting, partly to see what the other side will wear. It’s not over yet.”"
2020-09-02T17:31:07Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: cases jump by 1,508 in a day; government U-turns on Bolton and Trafford lockdown - as it happened","Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has warned Conservative MPs that some tax rises may be needed to â€œcorrectâ€� the public finances after the coronavirus crisis. But he also said he was not proposing â€œa horror show of tax rises with no end in sightâ€�. (See 3.01pm.) He spoke out after days of media speculation about what will be in his autumn budget, with some reports claiming that the tax burden may have to rise by Â£30bn. The crisis has pushed the national debt above Â£2tn for the first time, and in July the Office for Budget Responsibility put the budget deficit (the annual shortfall, rather than the total historic debt owed by the UK) at Â£128bn. Although the budget is still many weeks away, an intense debate is already under way in the Conservative party as to what should be in it. Earlier ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, suggested Sunak should be cutting taxes, not raising them. Labour has said it does not support tax increases now. (See 1.42pm.) The government has reimposed lockdown restrictions on half a million people in Greater Manchester just 12 hours after they were lifted, after a rise in infections. Ironically, the announcement was made during PMQs, just after Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, taunted Johnson about the many coronavirus U-turns he had already performed. Labour has responded furiously after Boris Johnson accused Keir Starmer of complicity in tolerance for the IRA, pointing to the prime ministerâ€™s acceptance of the former Brexit party MEP Claire Fox as a peer despite her prior support for the IRAâ€™s Warrington bomb. Boris Johnson has doubled down on his refusal to meet a group of families bereaved by coronavirus, claiming the group are in litigation against the government to bring about an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. Ofqualâ€™s senior leadership told MPs that Ofqual should not be blamed for the fiasco that engulfed this summerâ€™s exams in England, and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of causing the weekend of chaos that followed the publication of A-level results. The EUâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he is â€œworried and disappointedâ€� over the UKâ€™s approach to the talks, fuelling fears that the UK will leave the bloc in January without a deal. A data specialist recruited to the civil service following Dominic Cummingsâ€™ call for â€œweirdos and misfitsâ€� to work for the UK government was sacked recently after posting on social media that police should use live rounds against Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the Guardian can reveal. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary in charge of the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has moved to quash reports that the government will ditch its statutory commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on aid. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, is under intense pressure to quit after senior MSPs said the party faced â€œcatastrophic defeatâ€� in next yearâ€™s Holyrood elections. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-09-02T15:57:22Z,politics,Politics,"Government will maintain commitment on aid, says Raab","Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary in charge of the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has moved to quash reports that the government will ditch its statutory commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on aid. There have been persistent reports that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – facing a need to raise taxes to plug a budget hole – wishes to scrap the law, so releasing cash earmarked for poverty reduction to the Ministry of Defence to build advanced new weapons, including drones. Asked if the 0.7% target remained, Raab told reporters: “Absolutely. It’s a manifesto commitment, it’s written into law ... and as the PM has said, we want the aid capacity, the development expertise we’ve got, to be the beating heart of this new department.” Asked if there would be any dilution of the 0.7% commitment, Raab said: “We are here, day one, we are committed to it. It is in law, it is part of our manifesto.” Later, in the Commons, asked to give an undertaking that he would resign if that manifesto commitment were broken, he declined to do so.
He said the suggestion that the Ministry of Defence wanted to grab some of the FCDO budget was colourful tittle-tattle, and did not reflect any conversations he had had across government. But he did not deny that further budgetary discussions lay ahead as part of the spending review and the integrated foreign defence and security review. On 22 July Raab wrote to the foreign affairs select committee to say the projected 9% overall fall in GNI this year, caused by a coronavirus-led recession, meant the government would slash £2.9bn from the £15.8bn overseas aid budget in 2020. Over the past three years, the Foreign Office, the business department and the defence ministry have got their hands on larger parts of the aid budget, and Raab seemed to suggest there was still scope for the aid budget to be redistributed.
Sunak is said to believe the limits are being reached in the ways in which the definitions of aid can be broadened to include security without breaching the statutory definition of aid set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the body that classifies official development assistance. The speculation about the aid budget hardly helped the Foreign Office’s efforts to describe the new department on its first day as “a force for good”. Many senior diplomats had tweeted that the commitment to 0.7% was a central part of the newly formed department, so Sunak clearly has a struggle on his hands, including among some Conservative backbenchers and the former prime minister, David Cameron, to ditch the commitment. Such a move would require primary legislation.
The former international development secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan was given no place in the newly formed department when the ranks of the remaining eight ministers were announced. Raab nevertheless described her as a dedicated colleague. Raab also revealed that he would maintain the aid watchdog, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, and, following advice from the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, Raab has decided to expand its mandate to offer positive policy recommendations, rather than simple critiques of programmes. Nick Dyer, acting permanent secretary at the Department for International Development, has been appointed special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian affairs, Raab revealed. He has also appointed the former DFID chief economist, Stefan Dercon, as his adviser on aid. Raab has already appointed Sir Philip Barton, the former High Commissioner to Pakistan, as the new permanent secretary for the department and Sir Tim Barrow, the former UK ambassador to the EU and an expert on Russia, as the new political director. Raab promised the revised departmental budget would remain focused on poverty reduction for the “bottom billion”, as well as tackling climate change and reversing biodiversity loss, championing girls’ education, UK leadership in the global response to Covid-19, and campaigning on issues such as media freedom and freedom of religious belief. He has been less explicit about the location of the £2.9bn cuts to this year’s aid budget."
2020-09-02T15:38:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris left flailing as his limitations become clear for all to see | John Crace,"Boris Johnson’s complete lack of shame has long been one of his defining narcissistic traits. His willingness to betray family, friends and colleagues for short-term personal gain is common knowledge. In much the same way, his lack of competence – his inability to grasp basic details – has also been priced in to the equation, as no one on the Tory benches much cared. It was just Boris being Boris. But something has changed over the course of the summer. Johnson is no longer seen as a man with the winning touch. Quite the reverse, in fact. Many Conservatives are slowly waking up to the fact that he may be a liability. Many prime ministers have discovered that being in the top job requires a different skill and mindset to that of getting the top job. The difference with Boris is that he shows no signs of being willing to learn how to adapt to the change. Rather, he appears to be getting worse and worse at being prime minister. Limitations that are increasingly being exposed in laziness, short-temperedness and forgetfulness. Prime minister’s questions are often dismissed as a piece of performance theatre. Something only of interest to those inside the Westminster bubble. And there is some truth in that. But they also offer a window into a leader’s soul, revealing qualities such as empathy, wit, intelligence and humility. And on all counts Boris is failing miserably: his inability to gauge not just the mood of the House of Commons but the nation also is borderline sociopathic. It is as if he is holed up in a bunker, surrounded by yes men – there are almost no women in Boris’s inner circle – telling him only the things he wants to hear. By contrast, Keir Starmer is learning fast. His early outings at PMQs were never less than competent, but there was an awkwardness to them. As if he were working out how to play the role of a man who had been elected leader of the Labour party. But now we’re beginning to see the real man. His questions are just as focused, but there’s now an ability to think on his feet and to respond to the prime minister’s lies and disinformation with genuine incredulity, anger and – when needed – humour. At PMQs there’s only one person who looks fit to run the country and it’s not Boris. Then it’s not as if the Labour leader hasn’t been spoiled for lines of attack on the prime minister, and predictably Starmer chose to go in on the exams chaos. Either Boris knew about the problem and chose to do nothing, or he didn’t know about it when he should have done. Simple question: which one was it? Just as predictably, Boris resorted to bullshit and bluster. Labour had never wanted children to go back to school in the first place. An outright lie, as Starmer had unequivocally given his support to students returning on several occasions in May and June. After that, Johnson had a full-on meltdown. Even the few Tories in the chamber had the grace to look embarrassed. First Boris accused Keir of being anti-Brexit – as if having been a remainer meant you automatically wanted tens of thousands of people to die from the coronavirus and for the less well-off students to be downgraded in their A-level results. He then went on to accuse Starmer of being an IRA supporter.
This was too much both for the Labour leader and the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. In the past Hoyle has been reluctant to challenge Johnson when he goes off on a tangential mega-rant, but this time he was quick to rein him in. Starmer looked understandably furious and reminded Boris that as director of public prosecutions he had pressed charges against many terrorists. He could also have pointed out that it hadn’t been him who had recently offered a peerage to Claire Fox, who defended the 1993 Warrington bombing when she was a member of the Revolutionary Communist party. “If he was a decent man, he would apologise,” Starmer said. But Boris isn’t a decent man, so he didn’t. Instead he continued to rush on his run. There would be no extension to the furlough scheme because it would merely encourage people to hang around at home doing nothing. As if the prospect of being made unemployed was a lifestyle choice for millions of workers. Starmer ended by asking why Johnson was now refusing to meet the families of those who had been bereaved by Covid-19, having promised to do so on TV just days earlier. Remind me, was this the 12th or 13th U-turn in the past six weeks? Now was the time for Boris’s sad face. Or failing that, serious face. But he can’t do either, so he just smirked a little. The reason he wasn’t going to see the bereaved wasn’t because he cared too little but because he cared too much. Their stories might make him unhappy. And besides, it would be inappropriate as the bereaved were in litigation with the government. They weren’t, but what’s one more lie among so many? The meltdown precipitated by Starmer continued for the rest of PMQs. Boris seemed to have no idea there were a huge number of industries such as aviation, tourism and hospitality that weren’t going to return to normal anytime soon. Nor did he know that Matt Hancock had just extended some local lockdowns at the very moment he was saying more people should be going back to work. One day, it might occur to Boris that some companies might not want to take a punt on their employees’ health by forcing them back before the workplace is properly secure. But today wasn’t that day. Rather, it was the day for Boris’s carers to try to get him out the Commons before he did any more damage to either the country or the Tory party. It was also a day for those watching PMQs to ask themselves what they had done to deserve a leader who is visibly falling apart week on week. There was never anything very clever about Boris: now there isn’t even anything funny. Of all the coronavirus joints, in all the towns in the world, he walks into ours."
2020-09-02T15:00:14Z,politics,Politics,Cummings recruit sacked after suggesting police use 'live rounds' on BLM protesters,"A data specialist recruited to the civil service following Dominic Cummings’ call for “weirdos and misfits” to work for the UK government was sacked recently after posting on social media that police should use live rounds against Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the Guardian can reveal. The data architect appointed to a senior role in the Cabinet Office after applying through a scheme unveiled by Boris Johnson’s chief adviser was dismissed in July after colleagues discovered his Twitter post and reported it to senior managers.
It is the second known departure of a government recruit hired under the project set up by Cummings, to tempt an “unusual set of people” into senior government roles. Both departures involved recruits who publicly expressed sentiments viewed as racist. In February, Andrew Sabisky, who described himself as a “superforecaster”, stepped down from a role at Downing Street after it emerged that in some of his previous writings on genetics he had suggested that black people on average had lower IQs than white people. After Sabisky resigned, suggesting he had been selectively quoted, No 10 refused to answer questions about how he had been recruited and whether he had been properly vetted. Will O’Shea, 57, posted the comment about Black Lives Matters protests on 5 July, at the time marches were being organised across Britain following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in the US. Responding to one person’s tweet suggesting that Metropolitan police officers had been chased out of a housing estate in London by demonstrators, and another that called the police cowards, O’Shea replied: “Time to get out the live rounds.” At the time, the Government Digital Service (GDS), the Cabinet Office department where O’Shea was working, had already been beset by complaints from some black, Asian and minority ethnic staff that they had been subjected to systemic racism and bullying at work. Contacted by an undercover Guardian reporter posing as a recruitment agent, O’Shea confirmed he had applied for a job in government through the Cummings recruitment advert, which was posted on his personal blog on 2 January. O’Shea said he was interviewed in person by Ben Warner, another aide to the prime minister who works closely with Cummings. In subsequent emails, O’Shea initially said “I was let go because of my tweet” but then said he was never given a reason for the abrupt termination of his Cabinet Office job. He accepted that former colleagues found his tweet was racist, incendiary, and offensive, and took him to mean that the police should shoot black people in London who were demonstrating. “I can see how it was taken that way, and I am sorry for that,” O’Shea said. While he regretted sending the tweet, which he said was “wrong”, O’Shea stressed he did not mean it seriously. He added: “I didn’t say ‘shoot blacks’ and that was not what I meant or wished.” O’Shea subsequently deleted his personal Twitter account, which he said was to “get rid of any of the things I had said”. Cummings’ blogpost in January calling for “weirdos and misfits” focused on some of his key obsessions: harnessing of digital data by government, forecasting, and accusations of “profound problems” in civil service decision-making. It was headlined: “Two hands are a lot – we’re hiring data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos…” The areas of work for the “unusual set of people” the prime minister’s adviser said he wanted to recruit included “the frontiers of the science of prediction”, “data science, Alternative Intelligence and cognitive technologies” and “decision-making institutions at the apex of government”. In an apparently parallel process to normal civil service recruitment, aspiring recruits were invited to apply by sending in a CV and maximum one-page letter to a dedicated email address. O’Shea did not meet Cummings, but said he was interviewed at Downing Street by Warner, a data scientist who is known to be close to the prime minister’s chief adviser. He worked closely with Cummings on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. After reportedly working on the 2019 Conservative election campaign, Warner was recruited by Cummings in December last year to work alongside him in No 10. O’Shea said Warner interviewed him in the large room Downing Street where the daily televised Covid-19 press conferences were subsequently held. He said he was later approved to work on a No 10 project to reshape the government’s use of data, which would involve breaking free of controls each departments has. “So basically they wanted to see how they could break governance rules,” he said. The project was suspended when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, O’Shea said, and Warner then told him he could get him a job in the Government Digital Service. He told the undercover reporter: “Ben Warner said … ‘we can’t hire you right now, but I’ve got some friends in the Cabinet Office. They’re looking for a similar set of skills, but it’s not as long term.’” In April, O’Shea joined the GDS, the Cabinet Office department responsible for digital output, working on policy documents setting out standards for how other government departments can operate digitally. He is understood to have first caused concerns among black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues with contributions he made to internal discussions about race, including one following an article published by the Daily Mirror on 5 July about alleged racial discrimination in Whitehall, which was headlined: “White people 15 times more likely than black candidates to get civil service jobs.” O’Shea emphasised to the Guardian that he had not been racist in those discussions and had been asking white staff members not to criticise another white colleague too severely for their intervention. But he accepted that his contributions prompted some of his colleagues to look at his social media accounts. On his Twitter account, they were shocked and distressed to see his tweet of 5 July about the police and BLM demonstrators: “Time to get out the live rounds.” In a statement to the Guardian, a government spokesperson said: “Will O’Shea was … employed by the Cabinet Office as an external contractor for the Government Digital Service on coronavirus. All standard vetting processes were carried out for a contractor role through a commercial framework.”"
2020-09-02T15:00:13Z,politics,Politics,How civil servants' concerns about racism led them to Cummings recruit's tweet,"It was one shocking tweet that led to a data specialist being sacked from the Cabinet Office, just three months after he was recruited following Dominic Cummings’ call for “weirdos and misfits” to work for the government. Yet packed into that single episode were the fault lines of Britain’s traumatic summer: racial division, Covid-19, and the assault by Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, on the way the civil service works. The tweet, posted on 5 July by Will O’Shea, 57, a data architecture designer in the Government Digital Service (GDS), a department of the Cabinet Office, appeared to call for the Metropolitan police to shoot Black Lives Matter demonstrators. O’Shea was recruited in April through a process set up by Cummings and advertised in a notorious blogpost on 2 January, in which he held forth about the civil service’s “profound problems” and his plan to reshape it by hiring “an unusual set of people”. O’Shea was one of those attracted to Cummings’ call for a range of experts including, famously, “weirdos and misfits with odd skills”. In the same blog, Cummings derided the prevailing approach to encouraging diversity in the civil service. “People in SW1 talk a lot about ‘diversity’ but they rarely mean ‘true cognitive diversity’,” he wrote. “They are usually babbling about gender identity diversity blah blah [sic]. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about ‘identity’ and ‘diversity’ from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.” The first known recruit to Cummings’ diversity project was Andrew Sabisky, a writer and blogger who described himself as a “superforecaster”, and was brought in as a Downing Street adviser. In February, he was forced to resign after some of his earlier writings were highlighted in the media, including that there were “very real racial differences in intelligence”. When Cummings published his blog, O’Shea tweeted a link to the post. He also “liked” his own tweet. He then applied under the process set out by Cummings, who asked for a one-page letter and CV to a dedicated email address. O’Shea said he was interviewed by Ben Warner, another Downing Street adviser known to be close to Cummings. He told an undercover Guardian reporter he was initially offered a senior role on a major government project, reorganising the use of data across departments to enable more rapid internal communication. That project was put on hold, he said, because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, O’Shea said, Warner told him he had “some friends in the Cabinet Office” who needed similar skills, and he was found a position in the GDS. ‘Rebels and pirates’ Before O’Shea arrived at the GDS, some of the black, Asian and minority ethnic civil servant had made sustained complaints about racism and discrimination within the department. As recently as last month, several staff are understood to have reported in an internal forum that they had suffered racist abuse and felt anxious or depressed as a result, with five saying they had lost trust in the GDS. These concerns had intensified after the killing of George Floyd by police in the US city of Minneapolis, which spurred Black Lives Matter protests. On 25 June, Cummings held a video meeting with GDS staff, appearing alongside Ben Warner and Alex Chisholm, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary. The Cabinet Office told the Guardian the meeting was intended to thank and congratulate GDS staff for their work on rapid-turnaround digital projects during the pandemic. Cummings approvingly told staff that he saw them as the “rebels” and “pirates” of Whitehall.
Several employees took the opportunity to ask questions about discrimination and the lack of diversity in the civil service. Cummings’ responses left some staff underwhelmed and prompted formal complaints about the language he had used. Asked how he believed more women could attain senior positions, Cummings is said to have replied that there were already young “thirty–something” women working effectively as private secretaries, so they needed to “bang” these women into more senior roles. At another point, Cummings used the phrase “tits up”, which stunned some staff . Those who asked questions about alleged systemic racism and discrimination within the GDS were not satisfied with the answers given. A Cabinet Office spokesperson insisted it was made clear to staff in the meeting that “we have a zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and discrimination and have a range of measures in place to make sure that inappropriate behaviour is stamped out”. After the meeting, some people on the staff forum commented that Cummings needed to learn about inclusive communications and how to talk to a diverse group of people, and asked senior managers that those concerns be relayed to him. The then acting director-general of the GDS, Alison Pritchard, was understood to have told staff that another civil servant was going to talk privately to Cummings. Pritchard told staff she would write to Chisholm’s office to let him know the strength of feeling. The Cabinet Office and Downing Street declined to say if this conversation had taken place. ‘Get out the live rounds’ It is not known if O’Shea took part in the June staff meeting with Cummings. But 10 days later, with BLM demonstrations continuing and conversation about racial diversity in Britain intensifying, O’Shea contributed to discussions on the GDS internal staff forum. The conversation was about a recent article in the Mirror, which reported that white applicants to the civil service were 15 times more likely to get jobs than black people. Shortly after, another internal discussion was held in which GDS staff were encouraged openly to discuss their experiences of racism. O’Shea’s contributions to both of these conversations raised concerns among some colleagues, leading them to find his personal Twitter account. They discovered that after Floyd’s murder, O’Shea had tweeted frequently about BLM, mostly focusing on incidents of violence. On 7 June he tweeted a video by the hard-right US commentator Candace Owens, who said that while Floyd’s killing was wrong, there was something “ugly and broken” about America’s black community, whom she said made martyrs of criminals such as Floyd. Linking to the video, O’Shea tweeted: “Here is an alternative point of view.” Responding to questions from the Guardian, O’Shea said he did not know who Owens was. “I thought it was a view of a black [person] on BLM,” he said. “I did not endorse it or agree with it. I put it there for people to see and make their own judgment.” On 5 July, O’Shea replied to a tweet by somebody saying the Metropolitan police were being chased out of a London estate by BLM demonstrators, and a reply calling the police cowards. O’Shea tweeted: “Time to get out the live rounds.” That was met with revulsion by O’Shea’s colleagues at the GDS, who brought it to the attention of senior managers. On 10 July, O’Shea’s contract was terminated. O’Shea initially told the Guardian he was “let go because of my tweet” but then said that he was never given a reason for the termination. He acknowledged that, taken overall, his tweets could be considered racist and offensive, and understood why his colleagues at the GDS took him to mean that police should shoot black people on demonstrations in London. But he said he had not meant it seriously, and now regrets the tweet. A government spokesperson said “all standard vetting processes” were carried out when hiring O’Shea to the Cabinet Office as an external contractor. After a final tweet on 8 July, O’Shea deleted his Twitter account. He told the Guardian he did so “to get rid of any of the things I had said”. He has since registered a new Twitter account, with the bio, “End the Cancel Culture”."
2020-09-02T14:49:29Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer condemns Johnson for accusing him of IRA tolerance,"Labour has responded furiously after Boris Johnson accused Keir Starmer of complicity in tolerance for the IRA, pointing to the prime minister’s acceptance of the former Brexit party MEP Claire Fox as a peer despite her prior support for the IRA’s Warrington bomb. The row erupted after a notably bad-tempered prime minister’s questions where Johnson criticised the Labour leader for his tenure as shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, but was himself reprimanded by the Speaker for repeatedly dodging questions. Johnson said: “This is a leader of the opposition who supported an IRA-condoning politician who wanted to get out of Nato, and now says absolutely nothing about it.” A clearly angry Starmer pointed to his work combating Northern Ireland terrorism as the director of public prosecutions and demanded Johnson “do the decent thing” and withdraw the comment, which the prime minister refused to do. After PMQs, Starmer’s spokesman said Johnson should refrain from making such remarks and instead block the peerage of Fox, who defended the 1993 Warrington bombing when she was a member of the Revolutionary Communist party (RCP). “One thing we would remind the prime minister is that he has the power to block Claire Fox being nominated as a member of the House of Lords. So if he wants to take any action on this issue we suggest he does that,” he said. Colin Parry, the peace campaigner whose 12-year-old son, Tim, was one of two children killed in the blast, has condemned the decision to make Fox a non-aligned peer in nominations announced at the end of July. Fox has said she does not condone violence, but has not disowned her comment, made in an RCP newsletter after the attack, defending “the right of the Irish people to take whatever measures necessary in their struggle for freedom”. In the Commons, Starmer angrily rejected Johnson’s comments about his work under Corbyn and the IRA: “I want him to take it back. I worked for five years with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as director of public prosecutions, prosecuting serious terrorism, working with the intelligence and security services, and the police. Can the prime minister have the decency to withdraw that comment?”
Johnson at first ignored the question. Then, when prompted by the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, instead repeated the assertion. Starmer replied: “When the prime minister has worked with the security and intelligence forces, prosecuting criminals and terrorists, he can lecture me. I asked him to do the decent thing, but doing the decent thing and this prime minister don’t go together.” Johnson had by then already been reprimanded by Hoyle after he ignored Starmer’s questions on when he had first known about issues with the algorithm for giving A-level students results in the absence of exams.
Twice Johnson failed to respond to Starmer’s request for “a straight answer to a straight question”, instead asking the Labour leader to congratulate pupils on their hard work, and then condemning Starmer for “going around undermining confidence, spreading doubts”. When Johnson ignored a further question, about Tory MPs’ criticisms of the government’s problems over the summer, and made his comments about the IRA, Hoyle made an intervention – rare during PMQs – to tell him to be less evasive. “I think there are questions being asked,” the Speaker told him. “We do need to answer the question being put to the prime minister. It would be helpful to those watching to know the answers.” Johnson resumed: “Mr Speaker, I think it would be helpful for those watching to know …” Hoyle cut him off abruptly, saying: “Prime minister, I think I’ll make the decisions today.” Asked about Labour’s comments on Fox, a Downing Street source repeated a statement made when she was announced as a peer: “Claire Fox has addressed her historic comments about the Troubles, and acknowledged the pain that the families of the victims of terrorism have faced. “She is not a Conservative peer, and her political views will differ from those of the Conservative government.”"
2020-09-02T14:39:27Z,politics,Politics,Michel Barnier 'worried and disappointed' over Brexit talks impasse,"The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he is “worried and disappointed” over the UK’s approach to the talks, fuelling fears that the UK will leave the bloc in January without a deal. He said there was no breakthrough at a meeting on Tuesday with the UK’s negotiator, David Frost. “We didn’t see any change in the position of the UK, which is why I expressed publicly what I say, that I am worried and I am disappointed because, frankly speaking, we have moved, [and] shown in many issues real openness in the past months,” Barnier told the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin. He said the EU had recognised the UK’s red lines on fair competition, fisheries and governance, including the European court of justice, and was willing to compromise, but the UK was refusing to put proposals on the table on state aid or fisheries. “On all these issues, the UK sides continue to disappoint,” he said. Talks about 11 subject areas that will determine post-Brexit trade and the UK’s future relationship with the EU have been going on since March. Last week EU insiders described the talks as a “whole summer completely wasted”. Barnier said he was more a realist than an optimist and was convinced Boris Johnson would not allow the UK to crash out. “I continue to think, despite the current difficulties, that Boris Johnson wants an agreement with the EU,” he said. But he added more than once that this would not be at any cost. “The EU will not sacrifice its principles for the sole benefit of the UK.” He said the UK wanted a zero tariff and zero quota trade deal, but “they will have to move” to achieve that as the EU would not strike a deal that would be to the “detriment of the EU and the single market”. Barnier said sometimes he heard people in the UK talking about no deal and he thought: good luck. “There will be a huge difference between a deal and a no deal. I still think, even if it is very difficult, that a deal is possible.” He said the UK’s insistence that it simply wanted a deal like Canada or Japan was not based on reality. The proximity of the UK made it different to other trading partners as it automatically brought higher volumes and breadth of commerce. “This shows clearly why we need these economic and commercial fair play and critical mechanisms to avoid trade distortions and unfair competitive advantages,” he said. “This is particularly important in the state aid, where the potential to distort competition using subsidies is clearly significant.” Barnier warned that the UK and the EU faced serious Brexit consequences on 1 January, the end of the transition period, deal or no deal, with customs declarations, health checks and friction for banks and car manufacturers. Johnson’s spokesman said Frost and Barnier had a “useful review” of the agenda for next week but “major difficulties remain”. He said “the EU’s insistence on progress on state aid and fisheries is an obstacle to making progress overall”."
2020-09-02T14:21:48Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson reiterates refusal to meet Covid bereaved,"Boris Johnson has doubled down on his refusal to meet a group of families bereaved by coronavirus, claiming the group are in litigation against the government to bring about an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents 1,600 families, is campaigning for a rapid public inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic and is sending pre-action letters to No 10 to try to force one. The group denies this amounts to legal action and says it has sought a meeting to prevent such action. Deborah Doyle, a member of the group, said she felt hurt and angered by the prime minister’s response. “If he’d meet with us, it doesn’t need to go to court. We wrote to Boris back in early June asking him to meet us with our concerns and we’re five letters later and now he’s responded.” She added that she was upset by the words used by Johnson. “We’ve had a lot of trolling in the past … [they say] ‘you’re after compensation, you want to take the government to court, it’s going to cost a fortune’ … We don’t want to go through that process. We’re bereaved families. The last thing I want to be doing is standing talking to the media because I want to grieve for my mum and I don’t want other people to have to go through this at a later date.” Doyle’s mother, Sylvia Griffiths, died at a care home on 16 April. She believes there are lessons to be learned. “It’s what we’re passionate about. We’re not political. It’s not an attack on the government. We’re asking them to assist us with this process.”
Jo Goodman, a co-founder of the group, stressed it was not in litigation against the government. She said the legal action had never started. “So how’s Monday for you, prime minister?” Goodman said she felt the families had been categorised as “the wrong kind of bereaved people – like the prime minister only wants to meet with bereaved people who won’t ask difficult questions”. She said the group had experience of serious issues of the handling of the pandemic that she wanted to share, “from deaths in care homes to inadequate protective equipment – that can help him learn crucial lessons and save lives.” The prime minister had originally agreed to meet the group after he was challenged live on Sky News last week about repeated requests for a face-to-face meeting. The prime minister said he was “not aware” of their letters asking to meet him to discuss their concerns, adding “of course” he would meet them. However, in a letter seen by the Guardian on Tuesday, Johnson declined to meet the group’s representatives, saying it was “regrettably not possible”. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, asked Johnson to reconsider. “I had the privilege of meeting the families on the 15th of July. They gave me incredibly moving accounts of how Covid-19 had taken their families from them,” he said. “The prime minister will understand the frustration and hurt that he said one thing to the camera and another to them. I urge the prime minister to do the right thing to find time to meet these grieving families.” Johnson said it was “typical” of Starmer to frame his letter as a refusal to meet bereaved families, but said he would only meet the group once there were no more legal challenges to the government.
“I’m happy to meet with families of the bereaved and I sympathise deeply with all those who have lost loved ones throughout this pandemic and we all feel their pain and grief,” he said. “But it turns out this particular group are currently in litigation against the government and I will certainly meet them when this litigation is concluded.” The group has called for an immediate public inquiry with a quick-reporting first phase, similar to the Lord Justice Taylor review set up after the Hillsborough disaster, where the first phase reported back in 11 weeks to allow for fast changes to be rolled out in other football stadiums. Johnson has committed in principle to an independent inquiry but has previously said “now was not the right moment to devote huge amounts of official time to an inquiry”."
2020-09-02T12:56:35Z,politics,Politics,Covid fears grow after reports of crowding among arrivals at UK airports,"Concerns over arrivals to the UK are growing as reports have emerged of passengers being crowded on to shuttle trains at airports, a lack of information about quarantine, and confusion around test-and-trace forms. Prof Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, a government advisory group, told the Guardian that a family member who returned from Nice on Saturday evening was shocked at the conditions at Stansted airport. “You just wouldn’t know there was a pandemic,” Michie said. On disembarking, passengers from up to five planes arriving from different countries were crowded on to shuttle trains. “There were massive great queues to get on the shuttle, so everyone was pressed in against each other trying to get to passport control,” said Michie. She added that her relative received no information about the need to complete a passenger locator form. Such forms are supposed to be filled out online before arrival in the UK to help the authorities check that people are quarantining if necessary, and to support test and trace. Failure to provide details could result in a fine of up to £100.
On Friday the Guardian revealed that the UK Border Force was planning to spot-check only 30% of arrivals for passenger locator forms. Passengers can produce either a paper or digital copy. “You can’t spot-check something that hasn’t happened because you haven’t been told to do it,” said Michie, adding that her relative found there was also no information given to passengers at the airport about quarantine or testing. Carol Gardner, 61, from Kent, said she landed at Gatwick on Sunday having spent six weeks in Spain. While she had completed her form, she was not asked to show it. “No information at all about quarantine was given,” she said. Another passenger, who recently returned to the UK from Limoges, France, told the Guardian she had been sent a link to the online passenger locator form by her airline, but no checks appeared to be taking place at Stansted. The woman, in her 30s, who asked not to be named, said the only apparent notice about quarantine was a sign stating that France was now on the UK’s quarantine list, displayed at the gate as she boarded her flight back to the UK. “It looked like a boring letter so I doubt people read it,” she said. What’s more, she added, the plane for the return flight did not appear to have been cleaned, with sweets littering the floor.
Travellers returning from countries on the UK’s quarantine list, which include France, Spain, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, must self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to do so could risk a fine of up to £1,000. Andrew Brittle, 56, a project manager for a charity, has just completed his fortnight of quarantine after returning from Barcelona, Spain, but said nobody contacted him to ensure he was self-isolating. “As we were going through passport control at Stansted, someone was chatting to the border officers asking: ‘What do I do with my form?’ and they said: ‘We don’t really know.’ No one seemed to have any idea of what to do.” Brittle, from south London, said he passed through the airport in less than a minute as it was deserted, without facing any questions or being asked to submit the form. While the UK Border Force has said only 10% of passengers checked had not completed their forms, the latest revelations add to growing concern over a lack of checks and information among arrivals. Teresa Luckhurst, 64, a school secretary from East Sussex, said the vigilance of the Egyptian authorities at Sharm-el-Sheikh airport stood in stark contrast to her experience at Heathrow. “When we registered online there was a QR code and we naturally thought people would scan it when we arrived but it was business as usual,” she said. “We have a friend who is returning to the UK from Egypt shortly and has told us he will just ignore the quarantine rules and return to work. He will be putting everyone in his office at risk. Why is this being allowed?” Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said a key concern as winter approached was infection being brought in. “The tests are not yet sensitive enough to correctly diagnose infections in the early stage, which limits the value of airport testing. Therefore, interventions such as quarantines, infection control on the aeroplanes, and testing after return will be crucial,” he said. “This will help to reduce community cases of Covid-19, particularly onward transmission into vulnerable groups who are more likely to be hospitalised or have high mortality rates.” But Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said there were bigger concerns than a few cases being imported from abroad, adding that most people quarantined would not have Covid-19. “We have 30,000 active infections in the community in England alone. That is the real problem,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “Airlines and other carriers are required to provide a reminder to travellers at the point of purchase, check-in and during travel about the need to complete the contact form and, where necessary, adhere to self-isolation measures. “The latest guidance can be found on gov.uk and passengers should make sure they are familiar with it before travelling. Both Border Force and Public Health England carry out random spot-checks to ensure that people understand the requirements and are abiding by them.”"
2020-09-02T11:30:04Z,politics,Politics,Minister warns Rishi Sunak against tax hikes to cover Covid shortfall,"A cabinet minister has warned the Treasury against increasing taxes to tackle a gap in public finances hit by coronavirus, bringing into the open apparent tension within government over the issue before this autumn’s budget. After several days of reports about apparent plans to raise more money from corporation tax, pension relief, fuel duty and other levies generating an angry response from some Conservative MPs, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, called instead for tax cuts.
While saying she could not comment directly on the plans of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Coffey told Times Radio that reductions in tax would be more likely to bring in an increased amount of money. “In the past, when we have actually cut tax rates, we have seen taxes increase,” she said. “Tax rates are a very dynamic situation, and we need to make sure the chancellor has the best opportunities when he announces to the country. “In the past, when some people might assume the only way to get tax up is to increase tax rates, actually, we have shown in our economic history the opposite.” The comments show the scale of the task facing the Treasury if it does not raise any taxes to make up for a shortfall caused by the economic slump during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the government publicly committed to maintaining spending levels and a heavy programme of investment in infrastructure. The Sunday Telegraph cited Treasury sources, reporting that capital gains tax could be increased to align with income tax, as well as possible changes to pension tax relief and inheritance tax. According to a report in the Sunday Times, another move could be to increase corporation tax from its current level of 19%, which is one of the lowest among leading economies, to 24%. This provoked immediate concern from business groups. Subsequently, the Sun reported that another measure could be to add 5p to fuel duty, bringing condemnation from Tory MPs, a number of whom support campaigns that agitate against any increase in petrol prices. It remains unclear who has been briefing on the plans, with Treasury sources insisting much of the reporting is incorrect. This has prompted speculation that opponents of Sunak, who has emerged from the Covid crisis as a mooted future rival to Boris Johnson, have been trying to undermine his position. Coffey’s intervention underlines the political jeopardy facing the chancellor as he tries to established some order over the public finances, with the government having borrowed more than £150bn in the first four months of the current financial year. Sunak’s options are further limited by the 2019 Conservative manifesto, which guaranteed no increases in the rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT for the whole of this parliament."
2020-09-02T10:01:21Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leader resists pressure to quit amid growing rebellion,"The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, is resisting intense pressure to quit after senior MSPs said the party faced “catastrophic defeat” in next year’s Holyrood elections. Two Labour frontbenchers, James Kelly, its justice spokesman, and Mark Griffin, its social security spokesman, resigned their posts on Wednesday as a rebellion over his refusal to stand down escalated.
Two other MSPs, Jenny Marra and Daniel Johnson, joined Kelly and Griffin by calling on Leonard to resign, citing Scottish Labour’s dire poll ratings and Leonard’s very low public profile seven months before the Holyrood elections. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning, Kelly said: “I’m not prepared to sit back and look at a catastrophic defeat. “It’s totally unacceptable: we’re at 14% in the polls and more than half the public don’t have a view on the party leader. He has a negative rating among our own supporters. You can’t ignore those facts.” Leonard accused his critics of mounting “an internal war” against him and suggested many could face deselection for showing disloyalty, insisting that he would fight any challenge for the leadership. Speaking to STV, he said: “I think we need to see some new blood in here. One of the things the last few days have taught me is we need to see an injection of new voices, a more diverse profile of people. “We want some new candidates coming through so that the Scottish Labour party is represented by people who understand just what a privilege it is to be a Labour member of the Scottish parliament. “Party members will have to make a decision about whether they want to return people who have got some faith in the party’s ability to win votes and win seats next year, or whether they want to see people returned who perhaps don’t share that view.” Johnson denied trying to undermine Leonard. “We have to change leadership,” he said. “Frankly, we’re looking at a complete calamity for the Scottish Labour party.” Johnson said a significant number of MSPs agreed. After watching the SNP’s poll ratings soar to 55% over the summer, Kelly led a delegation of MSPs to see Leonard two weeks ago to urge him to stand down. Those polls led the Scottish Conservatives to suddenly replace Jackson Carlaw as leader. Leonard’s critics fear the Tories will rebound, turning next May’s election into a two-horse race between the SNP and the Tories. The rebels decided to go public, several sources said, after Leonard was ridiculed by Nicola Sturgeon during last week’s first minister’s questions, when she accused him of “aping the Tories”. During first minister’s questions on Wednesday, Sturgeon teased Leonard by questioning whether he would still be in post in January. With the Highlands MSP, Rhoda Grant, also supporting Leonard, Hilton tweeted that “every single Scottish Labour representative should be 100% focused on fighting the SNP and Tories, not each other”. Kelly and Johnson said they had wanted him to succeed, but after three years in charge he had failed to revive the party’s fortunes. His critics say he repeatedly failed to take their advice or suggestions for new policies. One source said their concerns were shared by the UK party, but Sir Keir Starmer, the UK leader, felt unable to involve himself in an internal matter for the Scottish party. To intervene would be seen as a sign that the party was controlled by London, thus playing into Sturgeon’s hands."
2020-09-02T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,"Whitehall chief likely to resist politicisation of civil service, say allies","Simon Case, Boris Johnson’s surprise choice to become the UK’s most senior mandarin, could well resist attempts to politicise the civil service, according to his allies. Those close to the new cabinet secretary said that the 41-year-old has been “imprinted” with the values of public service, and has the skills to protect senior civil servants as well as win over the prime minister’s most zealous advisers such as Dominic Cummings. Case’s difficulty may be winning over mandarins who have so far survived a Whitehall cull during which five permanent secretaries have resigned. Some remain suspicious of his youth and inexperience; he has never run a big-spending department. Case, the youngest appointee to the job since 1916, won over Johnson when he was drafted into Downing Street to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. He was promoted to permanent secretary at No 10, after a stint as private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge. He has previously held several senior roles, including principal private secretary to David Cameron and Theresa May, and director of strategy at the government’s intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ. Among those who expect the new cabinet secretary to thrive is the celebrated Whitehall historian Lord Hennessy, who supervised Case’s PhD on the functioning of the joint intelligence committee during the early cold war. “I am one of those who is increasingly worried about the increasing politicisation of the senior civil service, or at least the dangers of it. This [appointment] is a beacon of hope because he is a public service man through and through. “He believes in speaking truth unto power and all the great virtues of the grand tradition. It goes through to his last fibre,” Hennessy said. Hennessy said that it was obvious while supervising Case that he was destined for high office. “He had a muscularity of intellect and masses of intellectual curiosity, plus precise organisational gifts which you don’t usually see in students. “There is nothing flash or histrionic. He is one of those people you find every now and again in professional life who are so capable that you don’t mess around with them because they are a level above,” he said. Hennessy said Case had the knowledge of history and the intellect to take on the task to rebuild the economy and public services following the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic. “His focus will be to steer our country through the greatest challenge we have faced since the second world war, and secondly to make sure that the reconstruction that comes out of it is not just back to business as usual with political recriminations,” Hennessy said. Hennessy’s trust in Case has been challenged by some who are concerned that he has been promoted at such a rate that he lacks experience of how to run unwieldy Whitehall departments such health, education or the Treasury. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Case would have to win over staff bruised by the Johnson government’s recent changes. “I wish him well; he is clearly a capable person and has worked at the centre of government for some time and has the confidence of the PM. But he has less experience on operations than many. He hasn’t run a major department and he will have to think about how he connects with those who have run big operations,” he said. Others wonder whether Case could have done more to stop the sacking of Jonathan Slater last week as permanent secretary at the Department for Education following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. Case’s rapid rise within the civil service began in 2006 at the Ministry of Defence. Over the next eight years he held roles in the Cabinet Office and the Northern Ireland Office, where he coordinated intelligence, before moving on to GCHQ. According to the Spectator, Case is also suspected of writing a piece by a senior GCHQ officer named “Peter”, in which the author defended GCHQ’s work at the height of the crisis triggered by the revelations of Edward Snowden in the Guardian and elsewhere. “We do not expect to persuade everyone to support what we do, but GCHQ certainly does bear a responsibility to make sure the discussion about us is based in reality,” Peter wrote in 2015, as he argued why mass data collection was, in the agencies view, necessary in the struggle against terrorism. Case, known for working long hours, first caught the eye of Johnson, the then foreign secretary, when working for Cameron as a principal private secretary, sources said. He was part of the team involved in the Brexit talks but left in 2018 to become Prince William’s private secretary – a job which left him negotiating with the office of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, as they sought to step back from life as senior royals. A running and cycling enthusiast who has a family home near Cheltenham and occasionally watches West Ham, he will arrive in the office next week. “Do not expect him to leave his desk in a hurry – he tends to stick around and make his mark,” said a former colleague."
2020-09-02T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,Health leaders warn Boris Johnson over axing of Public Health England,"The abolition of Public Health England will damage the fight against obesity, smoking and alcohol misuse, the UK’s doctors and public health experts have told the prime minister. More than 70 health organisations have written to Boris Johnson outlining their fears about last month’s controversial axing of PHE, which prompted claims it was an attempt by ministers to deflect attention from their own failings over the coronavirus crisis. Signatories include the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the UK’s 240,000 doctors, the UK Faculty of Public Health and the Richmond Group of health and care charities. In it they say they are “deeply concerned that the government’s plans for the reorganisation of health protection in the UK currently pay insufficient attention to the vital health improvement and other wider functions of Public Health England”. PHE will be axed at the end of March and much but not all of its work is being subsumed into a new body, the National Institute for Health Protection, alongside two other bodies which have played a key role in the fight against Covid-19, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Track and Trace. However, while the institute’s remit will extend to infectious diseases and possible future pandemics, the government has admitted it does not yet know who will take forward PHE’s health improvement functions, such as tackling bad diet and stopping smoking. The statement points out that illnesses linked to unhealthy lifestyles – which include diabetes, cancer and heart disease – kill more people than anything else in the UK, including Covid. “Chronic non-communicable diseases are still, and will remain, responsible for the overwhelming burden of preventable death and disease in this country”, say the signatories, which also include the British Medical Association, Association of Directors of Public Health and Action on Smoking and Health. Voicing unease about such areas being sidelined amid the ongoing battle against Covid, they add: “It is a false choice to neglect vital health improvement measures, such as those that target smoking, obesity, alcohol and mental health, in order to fight Covid-19.” Their letter is published in today’s BMJ. They also point out that the pandemic has had the worst impact on people who are already suffering from stark inequalities in health – another key area of PHE’s work. In the Commons on Tuesday Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, warned that abolishing PHE, which is an executive agency of Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care, “will sap morale, sap focus and should wait until the end of the pandemic”. Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: “Reorganisation of Public Health England brings with it a real risk that some of the critical functions of PHE will be ignored.” Alex Norris, Labour’s shadow public health minister, said: “The structural reorganisation of PHE is a desperate attempt to shift the blame after years of cutting public health budgets, when the real shift we need in the fight against this virus is towards an effective local test and trace system that delivers mass testing and case finding. “We still have no answer on what will happen to other vital areas of public health like addiction, obesity and sexual health.”
Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, said axing PHE was “nonsensical”. The Twickenham MP said: “Ministers are attempting to deflect responsibility from their own mistakes with a top-down reorganisation. Now is not the time to rearrange the deckchairs. Now is the time to listen to the experts who rightly fear the damage caused by these nonsensical plans.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are committed to helping everyone live longer, healthier and happier lives as part of our prevention agenda and delivering the prime minister’s priority of tackling obesity, reducing health inequalities and lowering the demand on the NHS.” The DHSC has set up a stakeholder advisory group to help it decide who should become responsible for health improvement. It meets for the first time on Wednesday."
