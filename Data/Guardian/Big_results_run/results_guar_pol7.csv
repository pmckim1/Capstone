2015-01-04T22:00:03Z,politics,Politics,"Ed Miliband: Labour election campaign will be one of hope, not falsehood","Ed Miliband will on Monday declare day one of Labour’s general election battle as he promises to run a campaign of “hope, not falsehood” that will see him holding weekly question-time sessions with voters. The Labour leader will list three priorities for government as putting working people first, dealing with the deficit and protecting the NHS at a rally in Manchester, where he will challenge activists to engage 4 million voters in conversation between now and May. He will also mock David Cameron’s first Tory campaign advertisement, saying the poster depicts a “road to nowhere” and a prime minister who wants everything to carry on as usual. “We have a government that will say ‘stick to their plan’. They really think this is as good as it gets. They’re the pessimists about what is achievable for Britain and the British people. Between now and the election, they will tell you that change isn’t possible, just as the pessimists have always done down the years,” he will say. Miliband’s strategy of getting activists to speak directly to voters is designed to address people’s cynicism and anger towards politics that has seen many turn to the UK Independence party (Ukip). He will say Labour intends to “fight for victory on streets and doorsteps – not speak over people’s heads with thousands of expensive billboard posters” like the Conservatives. Miliband will also claim Labour values “matter more than the millions of pounds being poured into Tory coffers by hedge funds”. Labour has a stubborn, though narrow, lead in the vast majority of surveys but both Cameron and Miliband concede the election is going to be an extremely close fight. With Cameron fighting to win back Tory voters who have defected to Ukip, the prime minister hinted on Sunday that his party could be open to holding an earlier European Union referendum and twice refused to speculate on the possibility of a deal with Nigel Farage’s party after the election. A senior Tory source later played down this idea, saying the difficulty of negotiations would mean it could probably only be done a few months early. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg will also attempt to add his voice to the political fray this morning with a press conference in which he will claim voters need to back his party if they want another coalition. Presenting the Lib Dems as the occupants of the “centre ground”, he will say Conservatives are like mobile phone salesmen who signed you up to a contract then cut the number of calls you could make, while Labour is like an ex-boyfriend leaving late night voicemails asking for one more chance. Ukip will also begin to flesh out its policies in more detail soon, with its leader Nigel Farage promising a series of speeches on areas outside his usual topics of the EU and immigration. In an interview with the Sky News Murnaghan programme, Farage said a key Ukip policy in health was getting rid of doctors with poor English from the NHS – even though they are already required to pass a language test."
2015-01-04T12:21:11Z,politics,Politics,"Cameron hints at early referendum on Britain’s EU membership
","David Cameron has hinted that a Conservative government could hold an early referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union after getting “proper, full-on treaty change”. The prime minister has promised he would hold an in/out referendum before the end of 2017 if he were still in power, but he said on Sunday that he would be “delighted” to bring that forward. He told the BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “The referendum must take place before the end of 2017. If we could do that earlier, I would be delighted. The sooner I can deliver on this commitment of a renegotiation and a referendum – the sooner I can deliver on that the better.” Cameron also signalled he would expect cabinet ministers to keep to the government position on Britain’s membership, rather than allowing them to follow their consciences with a free vote. This is likely to cause some discord if Cameron were to lead the next government, as several senior Tories have been making it clear they would want to campaign for the UK to leave. “There are Conservative members of parliament who want to leave the European Union come what may. But if you’re part of the government then clearly you’re part of the team that is aiming for the renegotiation referendum,” he said. Before holding a poll, Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the terms of the UK membership with other member states. This would probably have to take place earlier rather than later because France and Germany are likely to be preoccupied by elections in 2017. Cameron is holding talks with Angela Merkel when the German chancellor visits London this week and is likely to raise the prospect of reducing EU immigration by clamping down on benefits for migrants. At one point, Downing Street floated the idea of a cap on EU migrants but this has been squashed by Germany. Asked about proposed changes, he said: “They do involve … proper, full-on treaty change. We need to get out of ever-closer union. That is something that shouldn’t apply to the United Kingdom. We need parliaments to be able to combine to block regulations. I think that is very important. We need guarantees that as the single currency gets more countries in it, the single market which Britain remains in is properly protected. Crucially, on the question of immigration we need these very big changes that I’m putting forward to the welfare system that will require treaty change.” He added: “I think that everyone can understand that under the proposals I have that if someone comes to Britain from Europe looking for a job they don’t get unemployment benefit; if they don’t have a job within six months they have to go home; they have to work for four years before they can claim things like tax credits. Crucially you don’t get child benefit with respect to children that you leave at home with your family in other countries. Those four changes are hugely important.” Pat McFadden, Labour’s shadow minister for Europe, said it was extraordinary that Cameron would not say how he planned to vote in his own referendum."
2015-01-03T00:13:00Z,politics,Politics,"Conservatives would cap redundancy payouts for NHS, BBC and civil service","The Conservatives would stop public sector workers in the NHS, BBC and civil service getting six-figure redundancy packages if they win the election, the party will say on Saturday. In a new manifesto pledge, the Tories will commit to capping payouts at less than £95,000. The party said it would legislate against big redundancy payments as one of the first acts of a Tory government, as payouts in recent years have included packages worth more than £450,000 in the civil service, £500,000 in the NHS and more than £1m in the BBC. Treasury minister Priti Patel said it was not right that taxpayers on low salaries have to “fund huge payouts when well-paid people get made redundant”. “We’re going to do something that’s long overdue and that will bring some fairness back to the system – we’re going to introduce a new public sector redundancy pay cap,” she said. “This goes to the heart of our long-term economic plan for Britain – it’s about backing hardworking taxpayers and making sure the economy is tilted in their favour. And it’s about saving money so we help bring down our deficit and make our economy more financially secure.” Those earning less than £27,000 will be exempt to protect the very small number of low earning, long-serving public servants who might have been caught by the cap. Labour said the move was too little, too late as many huge payouts to NHS executives have already been made during the government’s reorganisation of the health service. Jamie Reed, the shadow health minister, said: “David Cameron can’t get away from the fact that this horse has already bolted. He wasted £1.6bn on redundancy payouts to NHS managers as part of his reckless reorganisation. “Frontline NHS staff found it galling that 4,000 managers who received payoffs are now back in NHS jobs. “The government wasted billions on its reorganisation while patients are waiting hours on end in A&E and longer for cancer treatment too – proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.”"
2015-01-02T19:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Tories to outspend Labour by 3 to 1 in general election,"Labour is likely to be outspent by the Conservatives by a factor of three to one in the general election, the party’s election boss has admitted, but insists it can still win the tightest battle in generations through an intensive ground war built around local party activism. The message comes before a rally in Manchester on Monday where Ed Miliband, the party leader, is due to mount a ferocious assault on Tory plans for the health service. The rally is seen as the starting point of a campaign that will see Labour facing hostility in large sections of the national media and heavily outspent by the Conservatives, and so highly reliant on its superior organisation on the ground to bring out its vote in key marginals. Douglas Alexander, Labour’s election coordinator, writes for the Guardian: “The air war still has its place but it is on the ground where this election will be won or lost. Anyone who, like me, spent last summer in church halls and village halls, high streets and doorsteps across Scotland will understand this demand for dialogue. “The Tories may be able to outspend us by as much as three to one, but on the ground, in the key seats, we aim to outnumber their diminished and demoralised activists by the same margin as we fight this election conversation by conversation.” His article comes after David Cameron on Friday unveiled the Conservatives’ first election campaign poster on a visit to Yorkshire with the slogan “Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy”. The prime minister said: “I say that we should stay on this road because I’m absolutely clear about what the destination should be, about what more we can do for our country over the coming five years.” The alternatives were “frankly … disastrous”, he said. A claim on the poster that the coalition had “halved the deficit” drew attacks from Labour, and critics said it was only true if measured as a proportion of national income. In cash terms, it has only been reduced by about a third. Alexander, writing for the Guardian’s Comment is free, also discloses that the Labour election campaign is expected to be built round a spine of five pledges. The first two, already announced, cover the deficit and curbing immigration – two natural Tory subjects. He reveals that the remaining three will be based on more familiar Labour issues: the future of the NHS, living standards, and the future for young people. The whole campaign theme is constructed around an economic argument that since the crash the Conservatives have failed to reform the economy so that it tackles inequality and delivers for working people. Alexander’s claim that Labour will be outspent by three to one is based on estimates of how much party candidates will spend locally as well as national election spending. In the 2010 election campaign the parties spent £31.1m, with the Conservatives accounting for 53% of this total (£16.6m). Labour spent 25% (£8m) and the Liberal Democrats 15% (£4.8m). But the Tories have raised £78m over the past four years, making the imbalance in incomes larger than 2010. Alexander admits that with little more than four months to go the election is wide open. Setting out the big challenges facing the Labour campaign, he writes that the established parties face an electorate that, as is the case in the rest of Europe, is no longer apathetic but angry. He warns: “The crowd may not be leaving the stadium, but they may be turning towards other teams who are playing a new and dangerous game.” Alexander writes that in spite of what he describes as “the rise of the rest in 2014”, the battle for Downing Street in 2015 “remains a binary choice between the change we need and can deliver with a Labour government – or more of the same failure that we have suffered under this Tory-led government”. Labour believes a shift in local activism from “no campaigning” to “average campaign intensity” leads to an identifiable increase in the party’s share of the vote. Its research shows that if Labour managed to contact 30% of voters in a seat in 2010, its share of the vote rose by over 5%. By mid-November, in its key seats, Labour had contacted over 15,000 voters per constituency, 21% on average. It hopes to have pushed that figure to 25% by the end of the year, and take it higher in the months before polling day on 7 May. Faced by voter anger, Alexander maintains that the answer does not lie in making outlandish pledges but instead promising clear and credible change. His remarks come a day after Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, argued that George Osborne’s autumn statement had given Labour the chance to become the party of the centre ground, resisting extremist and ideological plans to reduce spending on public services to the level of the 1930s. Balls has been helped in that attack by the surprisingly virulent criticism of the chancellor mounted by two of the Liberal Democrats’ leading centre-right politicians, David Laws and Danny Alexander. In what is likely to be the first battle of the long election campaign, Osborne remains confident that he has made the right call and voters are more worried by the deficit than the size of the state. He argues that if Balls is to vote for the fiscal rules set out in Osborne’s new code on fiscal stability, the shadow chancellor will have to give details of the big tax increases he will have to impose to get the current account into balance. The average of polls shows Labour with a three-point lead, sufficient to secure an overall majority of 30, but these figures do not take into account specific factors, notably the surge in support for the Scottish National party – now on course to win anything between 25 and 40 seats."
2015-01-02T17:45:12Z,politics,Politics,Tories position their election message in the middle of the road,"On first evidence, the key message of the Conservative party in its general election campaign is that voters should stick with the safe and familiar path. The Tories’ first billboard poster in the fight for No 10 shows a long straight road amid bucolic English countryside under a tranquil blue sky. It reads: “Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy.” The approach is in stark contrast to the attacking, infamous 1997 poster that featured Tony Blair with devilish eyes, and the slogan “New Labour, New Danger”. With the road cutting the image in two, David Cameron is pitching his tent firmly in the middle, just as the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, this week moved to seize the centre ground for the Labour party in a comment piece for the Guardian. This approach is in some ways reminiscent of Angela Merkel’s “Die Mitte” – the middle – slogan. When a country is divided, don’t sway to the hysterics of the right or the left, go with the middle. Amid divisiveness and in times of uncertainty, incumbent parties tend to remind voters of the need to place their trust in a safe pair of hands. But while Cameron is more popular than the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, he is no Merkel when it comes to trust among voters. The final Ipsos Mori poll of 2014 showed that 36% of voters are satisfied with the PM. Trust in the German chancellor averaged 69.5% last year, and even hit a record high 74% due to her handling of relations with Russia. The Tory poster makes it clear that Cameron will be keen to keep the economy uppermost in voters’ minds, something the prime minister has been clearly planning to do since warning in November that “red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy”. Voters trust different parties to handle different issues. Labour is most trusted in managing the health service, Ukip is viewed as being most sensitive to voters’ worries on immigration, while the Tories are seen as best at dealing with the economy. That leaves parties with a difficult balancing act. They need to have a position on the topics voters feel are most important. But they also need to make the issues where they’re most trusted the more salient ones. Simply put, Cameron needs voters to feel that the economy is the most pressing issue. But here too he faces a challenge as the economy has been falling away as an issue worrying voters since 2010. Immigration is now the issue of most concern – and by some margin. 42% of respondents in December’s Ipsos Mori poll cited immigration as the most important issue facing Britain today, up five points on November. Only 33% mentioned the economy, unchanged from the previous month, and significantly down on the 70% the issue was registering five years ago. In 1980, trailing in the polls a week before an election, Ronald Reagan looked into the camera during a presidential debate, and told voters: “Ask yourself: are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter and became the 40th president of the United States. The election in May though will be more complex than simply asking voters if they’re better off than they were in 2010. Although the roles of Labour and the Conservatives are reversed, we are likely to see more of the fearful warnings of returning to the past and calls for change that have characterised previous campaigns. The problem for both Labour and the Conservatives is that so much has changed over the past five years. Debates over the union with Scotland and Britain’s place in Europe remain divisive. Combined support for the two main parties is at record lows – and this same lack of trust has led to the current fragmentation among the British electorate. According to research by King’s College London and Ipsos Mori, this particular trend is unlikely to change any time soon. By 2025, only 24% of Britons will identify as supporters of a political party. In 1985, 51% did. Just above 30% would never trust a British government – of any party – to place the country’s needs above party interests, a threefold increase since 1985."
2015-01-02T15:56:11Z,politics,Politics,Tweeters ride roughshod over Tory road poster,"David Cameron unveiled a new Conservative poster today showing a long, bumpy road stretching away into the countryside. “Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy,” it implored the voters, who will have to decide whether to remain on the Tories’ stretch of tarmac or switch to someone else’s at the general election on 7 May.
Cruel commentators on Twitter were quick to claim that this was a “road to nowhere”:
Or indeed the road to Mordor ...
Other tweeters felt its message could be improved:
Or decided that a bullet-train speeding through made it a better poster:
Others merged it with the Balustrade Layard meme:
The poster did not win much accolade from advertising industry experts either. The perfect image of the straight road through gently rolling green countryside was described as looking “a bit French” by one advertising expert. Philip Hesketh told the Daily Mail: The irony is, when you look at it a bit closer, the scene looks a bit French. It’s very unusual to have a road that wide with no lines down the middle and stretching so far with no lampposts. A Tory source said the image was “a composite of various images of UK roads”. Some commentators pointed out that the poster’s message was actually very similar to Labour’s 2010 election broadcast “The Road Ahead”.
Others found the Tory boast of “the deficit halved” ironic:
As the election campaign gears up, there’s a long road ahead for all of us."
2015-01-02T14:21:44Z,politics,Politics,Tories go for country road to take the economic message home,"The Conservative party unveiled the first billboard poster campaign of 2015 on Friday.
Nebulous deficit halving claims aside, the Tories are going (for now) with a more tranquil approach compared to 1997’s devilish eyes.
David Cameron is pitching his tent in the middle This approach is in some ways reminiscent of Angela Merkel’s “Die Mitte” - the middle - slogan. When a country is divided, don’t sway to the hysterics of the right or the left, go with the middle.
When “red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy” , voters need to place their trust in a safe pair of hands.
The underlying thrust of this first Tory message is to push the economy up the ladder of voters’ concerns. Voters trust different parties to handle different issues. Labour is most trusted in managing the health service, Ukip are viewed as most sensitive to voters’ worries when it comes to immigration, while the Tories are seen as best at dealing with the economy. Because of this, the issue which voters are most concerned about - relative to the other issues they care about - will influence who they vote for in May. This leaves parties with a difficult balancing act. They need to have a position on the topics voters feel are most important. But, in parallel to this, they need to make the issues where they’re most trusted on, the more salient ones. Simply put, David Cameron needs the economy to be top of mind, and for voters to feel that the issue is of upmost concern. There are two main challenges to the Conservatives’ chosen lane. Firstly, while Cameron is more popular than Labour leader Ed Miliband, he is no Merkel when it comes to trust among voters.
A fundamental lack of trust makes any act that requires convincing voters to entrust the economy into a party’s hands a lot more complicated. Secondly, in terms of issues that voters feel are most important, the economy has been trending downwards since 2010.
With immigration now the issue of most concern - and by some margin.
In 1980, trailing in the polls, Ronald Reagan looked into the camera during a presidential debate, and told voters: “Ask yourself: Are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we’re as strong as we were four years ago?” On 4 November of that year, he defeated Jimmy Carter, and became the 40th President of the United States. The UK election will be more complex than simply asking voters if they’re better off than five years ago. Like in 2010, the poster campaigns will soon become far more diverse. Roles will be reversed, but as in most elections, the warnings of a return to a past to fear, alongside calls to vote for change, are both likely to feature soon.
The problem for both Labour and the Conservatives is that while they set to party like it’s 2010, a lot has in fact changed over the past five years. Debates over the union and unity, with Scotland and in Europe, remain divisive. Combined support for the two main parties is at record lows - and this same lack of trust is also what has led to the current fragmentation among the British electorate. Research by Ipsos Mori has found that this particular trend is unlikely to change any time soon.
But for now, it’s a blue sky and a country road taking the message home."
2015-01-02T00:05:09Z,politics,Politics,Nick Clegg denies harnessing his wife’s popularity for his own ambitions,"Nick Clegg has denied wishing to use the popularity of his wife Miriam González Durántez to enhance the Liberal Democrats’ electoral fortunes in the couple’s first joint interview. In an article in Red magazine, the deputy prime minister acknowledged the Spanish lawyer’s connection with the public but added that he also has a “great fan base”. Asked if her popularity was an issue, he said: “We’re husband and wife … I don’t think of Miriam as some sort of PR seesaw. It would literally never occur to me.” In November, the Liberal Democrat leader’s approval rating was just 12 points better than its -65 low in May, after the party lost all but one of its 11 MEPs in the European parliament election. During the same month, the party lost its deposit and came fifth behind the Greens in the Rochester byelection. In the article Clegg also discusses the moment when he first fell in love when they were students in Bruges: “It was total thunderbolt stuff, it really was. “[She was wearing] this dark green velvet thing. And you had what I thought were these quite funny sort of brogue-y shoes on … And I was this pimply Brit, trying to impress her.” González Durántez, a partner of international legal practice Dechert, has been widely described as an electoral asset to Clegg. She has steered clear of the stereotypical role of a politician’s wife, by refusing to trail along during lengthy campaigns. When Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron became increasingly involved in the 2010 general election campaign, González Durántez said that she would be “willing to help” but would be unable to take weeks off from her work and her family life. González Durántez was also asked by the magazine how much the fallout from Clegg’s unpopularity has affected her. She refused to be drawn, adding: “It would be much more trouble if I was unable to put it in perspective at night ... Whatever has happened, it’s not the end of the world.”"
2015-01-02T00:04:09Z,politics,Politics,Nigel Farage targets hedge funds as key to Ukip’s financial future,"Nigel Farage, who has pledged to build a “people’s army” separate from vested interests, has identified hedge funds and their owners as crucial to Ukip’s financial future. A leaked internal report shows the party’s leader argued that “the key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry” as he addressed Ukip’s executive committee in 2012. He also recounted a meeting with a billionaire businessman in Switzerland as he urged the party to capitalise on improvements in the polls. The documents will be embarrassing for members of the anti-federalist party who have been keen to argue that the Tories are underwritten by the City. In the leader’s report, dated 3 September 2012, Farage reviews the party’s recent successes and says: “It is very interesting. We are very close to the tipping point of being able to do something very very big. “The type of people we are talking to has changed. People who would have slammed the door in our face 3 years ago are inviting us. The key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry,” the minutes say. According to another leaked document, Farage delivered a brutal character assassination of one candidate on the grounds that he would not be able to impress City supporters. He said that the named party member had “no forcefulness and no passion that sticks and registers”, adding: “We could not take him to meet the large City donors.” Ukip has had many successes in wooing donors from the City since 2012. One convert is Andy Brough, the star fund manager at Schroders, who has reportedly joined Farage’s party after growing weary with the coalition government and European attacks on the City. Farage also has the support of the influential hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, whose former father-in-law is the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch. Odey is not a member of Ukip, but threw a party at his Odey Asset Management offices last spring to introduce Farage to potential supporters and donors. Christopher Mills, a co-founder of JO Hambro, a major hedge fund, gave £50,000 in his first donation to Ukip last year. He previously gave to Hastings and Rye Conservative Association and appeared in the Sunday Times Rich List with a personal fortune of £200m. The Tories remain the main beneficiaries of hedge fund firms and their owners. Sir Michael Hintze, a billionaire hedge fund manager, gave £1.5m last year – the biggest single gift to the Tories in six years. Other big Tory donors from the City include James Lupton, Lord Farmer, Lord Fink and Alexander Fraser. Insiders say Ukip’s finances are healthy as the general election approaches. The party outspent Labour for the first time in a national election last May, according to Electoral Commission data published last month. Farage’s party spent £2.96m at the European election, and now sends 24 representatives to Brussels as the biggest British party in Europe. Labour spent just over £1m. A Ukip spokeswoman said the party does not comment on leaked documents."
2015-01-01T19:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Ed Balls moves to claim political centre ground for Labour,"Ed Balls has moved to claim the centre ground in British politics, in a rebuttal to critics who claim that Labour has swung too far to the left to win this year’s general election. In a strongly worded article for the Guardian, setting out the battle lines for the coming weeks, the shadow chancellor writes that he would continue to cut the deficit if elected, but that the Tories have lurched to the right under a chancellor who is happy to move towards a shrunken, “35% state”. Balls’s use of the phrase “centre ground” comes only days after Tony Blair used the same expression in an interview with the Economist, which was widely interpreted as a criticism of Ed Miliband for moving to the left. His article will be seen as a rejection of Blair’s criticisms and other internal party critics. But it also demonstrates Balls’s conviction that Osborne has allowed himself and David Cameron to be portrayed as extremists by pressing ahead with public spending cuts. In the article, Balls writes that last month’s autumn statement was a pivotal point in the fortunes of Osborne. “There are moments in politics when, amid the fog of accusation and rebuttal, things suddenly become crystal clear. “And it’s now clear that last month’s autumn statement was another of those rare defining moments – the day Chancellor George Osborne ceded the political centre ground to Labour,” Balls writes. Osborne had an opportunity to change policies, but instead has persisted in cuts which will see tax revenues continue to contract, Balls says. He writes: “In the runup to the autumn statement we all knew the ongoing squeeze on living standards was leading to a huge shortfall in tax revenues, throwing deficit reduction plans badly off track. “What took everyone by surprise was that, in the face of forecasts that this loss of tax revenues would continue, Chancellor Osborne would choose to make up the shortfall with massively deeper spending cuts in the next parliament.” Keen to emphasise that Labour will continue to cut public spending, Balls says the party will balance the books. However, he adds that the cuts planned by the chancellor will damage the health service and are driven by ideology, not necessity. “Let me be clear, including to those who would wish it were not so: Labour will need to cut public spending in the next parliament to balance the books. But Ed Miliband and I do not believe a 35% state can be sustained year after year without causing huge damage to our National Health Service, policing, defence, local services and our economic infrastructure. ”George Osborne’s increasingly extreme and ideological approach goes far beyond the necessary task of deficit reduction. It is a risky second-term Conservative project to shrink the state – a lurch to the right which has left Labour as the centre-ground alternative,” he writes. Last month, Osborne set out dramatic plans to move Britain from the red into the black that will see public spending as a percentage of GDP fall to its lowest level since the 1930s. The plans, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), presume the loss of a further 1m public sector jobs by 2020, a renewed public sector pay squeeze and a further freeze on tax credits. The OBR, in its analysis of the autumn statement, said that cuts after 2015 would see the total level of public spending fall to 35.2% of GDP in 2019-20, its lowest level in 80 years. In the days after the autumn statement, Osborne was widely seen as having been rattled by criticisms of his plans. He accused the BBC of hyperbolic coverage and conjuring up bogus images of the 1930s depression. He was then drawn into a confrontation with Britain’s leading tax and spending experts after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said he had a duty to spell out his deficit reduction plans and warned of cuts on a “colossal” scale. Balls, who is still trailing Osborne on personal economic credibility, has been emboldened by the IFS and the OBR. Blair told the Economist earlier this week that he was “convinced the Labour party succeeds best when it is in the centre ground”. Stressing the importance of Labour “not alienating large parts of business, for one thing”, he added: “I am still very much New Labour and Ed would not describe himself in that way, so there is obviously a difference there.” He added that May’s poll could become one “in which a traditional leftwing party competes with a traditional rightwing party, with the traditional result”. Asked if this meant a Tory win, he replied: “Yes, that is what happens.” After reports claiming his words were a criticism of Miliband, Blair said he expected a Labour victory and had been misinterpreted."
2015-01-01T11:37:33Z,politics,Politics,Taxpayers now waiting twice as long on HMRC helplines,"Taxpayers are having to wait twice as long for crucial advice on government helplines for tax inquiries, child benefit and tax credits, than a year ago, according to official figures. Figures published by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that the average time people spent waiting in a phone queue to HMRC was 10 minutes and 53 seconds – more than double the wait from a year ago. The figures also showed 34.5% of calls were cut off, significantly up from the 20.5% recorded last year, and less than one in 10 calls about tax credits were answered in under two minutes – down from one in three a year ago. The average waiting time for tax inquiries rose from four minutes 42 seconds in 2013 to almost 12 minutes in September 2014. For tax credits the wait doubled from seven minutes 13 seconds in 2013 to 14 minutes 28 seconds in 2014. The figures were released by HMRC last month, and first highlighted in the Daily Mail. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour’s shadow exchequer secretary, said that the figures were “unacceptable”. “At a time when people are paying more in tax and have seen their tax credits cut, it simply isn’t good enough. “Long waits and poor service are particularly frustrating when many people are facing difficult times for the personal finances. Overall, the proportion of calls to HMRC actually handled fell from 79.5% a year ago to 65.5%. “Ministers need to get a grip on this chaos and ensure HMRC is providing a decent service for taxpayers. The government shouldn’t be leaving people hanging on the telephone,” said Mahmood.

2015-01-01T06:30:03Z,politics,Politics,"Ukip, the SNP and Greens will squeeze Labour and Conservatives hard at the 2015 election","This is the year that will probably see Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Scottish National party hero Alex Salmond stride grinning into the heart of the very Westminster establishment they profess to despise. Taking up his seat on the green benches of opposition, Ukip’s newest honourable member might even find himself squashed beside Caroline Lucas of the Greens, whose party split the Labour vote just enough to deny the new prime minister Ed Miliband a majority. And perhaps to the right of Salmond sits Boris Johnson, the newbie MP for Uxbridge and now clear favourite to win the Conservative leadership contest following the resignation of a defeated David Cameron. Nick Clegg and a couple of lonely Lib Dems loiter at the back, despondent at losing their space on the government side. That is just one fantasy parliament – among the most likely, if you believe the pollsters and the bookies – out of all the manifold combinations for the outcome of the election in just over four months’ time. Tory or Labour majority, Tory or Labour minority, Lab-Lib or Tory-Lib coalition, even Lab-SNP or Tory-Ukip coalition. Any of these are possible at a time when the previously inconceivable option of a multi-party rainbow alliance or Tory-Labour grand coalition has been mooted if Ukip pulled off a miracle. The point is that not even the most seasoned Westminster watchers feel confident enough to call the election for one side or the other.
And while clearly either Cameron or Miliband will find themselves walking into No 10 on 8 May, it may be hard to shake off the feeling that the victory for either man is one of accident rather than overwhelming popular support and ingenious political strategising. A major theme, therefore, of 2015 is going to be the weakness of the two major parties and how far the minor challengers can inflict damage on them. Both Labour and the Conservatives are going to be desperate to cast the election as a two-horse race, in which only one of their leaders gets the prize of premiership. But in reality, they are both going to be jostled all the way along a crowded electoral course by Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and even the deeply unpopular Lib Dems, who hold dozens of key marginals that could decide the outcome. It just depends which of the two key contenders is slowed down more by the other riders. It is a deeply risky situation for the two main parties that, with so short a time before polling day, this is set to be the year of their lowest popularity since the polling company Ipsos MORI began collecting records in 1978. In that year, known for its industrial disputes and the winter of discontent, 91% of people still identified with either Labour or the Conservatives. In contrast, just 66% of us today express an intention to vote for the parties of either Ed Miliband or David Cameron – the only two really feasible candidates to be the next prime minister. This is lower even than 1981, when Labour’s support was hollowed out by defectors to the newly formed Social Democratic party (SDP). With a similar turnout to last time, only around a quarter of the voting-age population will probably have backed the winning party on election day. Academics such as Dr Stephen Fisher of Oxford University still predict Labour and the Conservatives will take around 90% of the seats overall, because of the first-past-the-post system that hands victory to whoever is in the lead in each individual constituency. However, the minor parties have a huge ability to influence the final result, depending on whose vote they devour the most. Ukip is obviously causing the most high-profile squeeze on the two traditional leading parties, taking at least three times as many votes from the Conservatives as Labour. But the impact of the other challengers will also cause nail-biting in the party HQs. Labour has now identified at least 17 seats where it is at risk of failing to take the constituency because the Green party is chomping through their core leftwing support. Party strategists say Iraq – a decade on – is still an issue that is stopping leftwingers from returning to Labour. In Scotland, despite the election of a credible new national Labour leader in Jim Murphy and defeat of the yes campaign at the referendum, Miliband could be looking at the loss of more than a dozen of his MPs to the resurgent SNP. And while the Liberal Democrats’ national share of the vote has been severely hit under the coalition, the party is still clinging to the hope that it may hold on in its established strongholds. With this in mind, senior Lib Dem cabinet ministers are spending hardly any time in Whitehall, in favour of lavishing love on their constituencies. Polling by former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft shows that support for the party has actually increased in seats such as Sutton & Cheam in south London and Eastbourne on the south coast.
In an election where a small number of knife-edge seats are crucial to the overall result, the tiniest swing will make a difference. Strategists estimate a good local candidate can give a 2% boost. So prepare for the contest to get hyper-local over the next few months. Senior Tory and Labour politicians will be obsessing about pot-holes, anti-social behaviour and dog poo on the pavement as well as the macro-issues of the economy, immigration and NHS. Leaflets from the 2015 slate of candidates have begun to drop through letterboxes and there is an evident trend already. Few and far between among the Tory and Labour specimens display photos of the parliamentary candidates glad-handing voters with their dear leaders in shot. Some have only the tiniest references to their own parties. There is plenty of “normalising” of CVs to stress real-world jobs and working-class roots when in truth they should be catalogues of lives lived in Westminster. It seems the traditional parties are a liability to the parliamentary hopeful, not an asset – something of which the new crop of MPs will be only too aware. To return to that fantasy parliament, it is likely to be a boisterous one. If its members end up owing little of their success to the merits of their respective Tory and Labour leaders, the Commons is bound for five years of rebellion."
2015-01-01T00:05:05Z,politics,Politics,David Cameron and Ed Miliband turn gaze towards 7 May,"David Cameron and Ed Miliband have issued new year messages as they prepare for a flurry of general election campaigning in the first few days of 2015. With just over four months until voters go to the polls on 7 May, the leaders of the two main parties are expected to start spending much more time talking to voters around the country instead of working from Westminster. On Friday the prime minister is planning to launch his first campaign event of the year, and on Sunday he is expected to be interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The Labour leader, meanwhile, is likely to start the year with a major speech early next week. Both parties have established what they call their narratives for the election. The Conservatives intend to focus on their economic record, while Labour will promise to address the cost of living and reduce inequality. With the polls continuing to show a lead for Miliband, the Conservatives are expected to start bombarding the public with their political messages over the coming weeks. The prime minister’s new year message continued the Tories’ familiar refrain of urging people “to stick to the plan, stay on course to prosperity, and keep doing the important, long-term work of securing a better future”. Cameron claimed there was good news on employment, lower taxes and a higher state pension, but warned that the global economy remained uncertain. “Britain has a choice,” he said, “between the competence that has got us this far, or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.”
In an article for the Daily Telegraph today, he writes that the Conservatives are not just improving the economy, but “changing British values” in favour of hard work. Miliband’s message had a strongly positive tone, reflecting his intention to present his party as one of hope and change over the next few months. “This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future,” he said. “And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don’t have to tell you that all over our country today there are people working harder and harder, but standing still; families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need. “It doesn’t have to be this way. As this new year dawns, we have the chance to change direction; a chance to build a recovery for all of Britain … This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn’t about idle dreams or empty promises. It’s about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.” Jim Murphy, the new Labour leader in Scotland, and his deputy, Kezia Dugdale, also released a new year message. However, their outtakes video, which shows their human side as they mess around, giggle and forget their lines, attracted more attention."
