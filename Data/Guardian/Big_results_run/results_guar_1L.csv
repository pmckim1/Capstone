2021-02-05T19:15:02Z,politics,Politics,‘Unbearable tension’: what have key Tories said about race?,"Boris Johnson’s senior adviser on ethnic minorities, Samuel Kasumu, wrote in a leaked letter of “unbearable” tension within Downing Street. Sources claim that the divisions centre on the way the government is trying to reset the debate around equality, and comments made by several individuals who have been promoted into key positions by Johnson. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, told MPs in October: “Some schools have decided to openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group, often fully aware that they have a statutory duty to be politically impartial. “We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt. Let me be clear that any school that teaches those elements of critical race theory as fact, or that promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views, is breaking the law.” Tony Sewell, the newly appointed chair of the government’s commission on race and ethnic disparities, wrote in 2010: “What we now see in schools is children undermined by poor parenting, peer-group pressure and an inability to be responsible for their own behaviour. They are not subjects of institutional racism. They have failed their GCSEs because they did not do the homework, did not pay attention and were disrespectful to their teachers. Instead of challenging our children, we have given them the discourse of the victim – a sense that the world is against them and they cannot succeed.” Liz Truss, the minister for women and equalities, said in December that the equality debate should not be dominated by “protected characteristics” – age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. “Too often, the equality debate has been dominated by a small number of unrepresentative voices, and by those who believe people are defined by their protected characteristic and not by their individual character. “Underlying this [approach] is the soft bigotry of low expectations, where people from certain backgrounds are never expected or considered able enough to reach high standards. “This diminishes individual humanity and dignity. Because when you choose on the basis of protected characteristics, you end up excluding people.” Munira Mirza, Boris Johnson’s race adviser, wrote in 2018 about the weaponisation of victimhood: “The common denominator with all these stories is the simplistic conclusions that we are supposed to draw. Men are beasts. Whites are oppressors. Britain is bad. “There are many other incidents of mistreatment or conflict in our society that never make headlines because they don’t feed these narratives. A trivial dispute between neighbours; an act of unkindness by a shopkeeper; a sick joke by a colleague – all bad but hardly worthy of general concern. Unless there is a ‘social justice’ angle that can be divined (or manufactured), no one else gets involved.”"
2021-02-05T19:00:20Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings: Durham police reject dossier of evidence on lockdown journeys,"Durham police have rejected a 225-page dossier alleging that Dominic Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of the lockdown journeys he made in the north-east of England at the height of the pandemic. After more than three months considering the allegations, which included claims of multiple breaches of the lockdown rules by Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, the force has decided to take no further action. A former chief prosecutor for the north-west, Nazir Afzal, whose lawyers compiled the dossier, has vowed to carry on his legal fight, which includes launching a private prosecution against Cummings. “Justice takes time and I will carry on,” he said. Afzal’s dossier claimed that statements Cummings gave during a press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden on 25 May 2020 affected the course of justice, as they were made as Durham police’s investigation into his behaviour was already under way.
But the force has stood by its decision in May to take no further action after a three-day investigation. In a brief letter letter to Afzal’s lawyers, Durham’s deputy chief constable, Dave Orford, said: “We have considered all of the material provided. However, it does not change our decision from that outlined in our press release dated 28 May in respect of Mr Dominic Cummings and we take a similar view in relation to his wife Mary Wakefield.” That press release said Cummings may have breached lockdown rules by travelling to Barnard Castle on 12 April, but the force decided to take no further action and it made no finding on his decision to leave London for Durham. It also said there was “insufficient evidence” that Cummings travelled to Durham a second time on 19 April. In his rose garden statement, Cummings claimed he had evidence that proved he was in London that day. Boris Johnson told MPs that he had seen that evidence, but No 10 has refused repeated requests to release it. In August the Guardian and the Mirror revealed that four people had claimed seeing someone they believed to be Cummings in woods near Durham on the morning of 19 April. They included Dave and Clare Edwards, who gave statements to the police about the sighting at the same time Cummings was giving his rose garden statement. Afzal’s lawyers claimed the evidence they presented to the force, including new material from fresh witnesses, met the legal test for such a prosecution. Durham police disagreed. Orford’s letter said: “We do not consider the relevant tests are made out in relation to any potential offences raised within your submission. Therefore, Durham constabulary will be taking no further action.” In a statement, Afzal said Durham police’s decision was “hugely disappointing but not surprising”. He added: “It’s not clear from the letter that we received whether the views of the Crown Prosecution Service were sought at all. And you will know that we submitted a 225-page submission including new evidence, especially witness evidence, of an alleged third breach [the alleged trip on 19 April] that Mr Cummings has not previously revealed.” Discussing his options for possible broader action, Afzal said: “I am considering with my legal team what further avenues to pursue, because millions of you would want me to.” Asked if he was considering a private prosecution, Afzal said: “We shall explore all options and don’t rule out any.” He added: “We are nothing without the rule of law, and it applies to everybody or to nobody. When I learned that one of the architects of the rules that we all rightly had to comply [with] decided to ride a coach and horse through them, and that his political masters then decided to put a ring of steel around him, I had no choice but to do what I’ve done. “All the research tells us that that one act diminished public confidence in that lockdown. Justice takes time and I will carry on because you would want me to.” Cummings and Wakefield have been approached for comment."
2021-02-05T18:36:12Z,politics,Politics,"Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch must apologise or be sacked, says peer","Boris Johnson should force an equalities minister to apologise or sack her, the former head of Downing Street’s race unit has urged, amid a deepening row over “the politics of division”. Simon Woolley said the prime minister must intervene in the row over Kemi Badenoch, after a damning leaked letter sent by a No 10 adviser suggested she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a journalist on social media. The special adviser, Samuel Kasumu, also complained of unbearable tension within Downing Street over race and said he considered resigning over fears that the Conservatives were pursuing a “politics steeped in division”. Following frantic interventions from ministers and senior aides including the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, Kasumu retracted his resignation on Thursday night. Lord Woolley, who was chair of the race disparity unit in Whitehall until July, said the government must respond to Kasumu’s concerns that Badenoch may have broken ministerial rules when she publicly criticised Nadine White, a HuffPost journalist. Woolley told the Guardian: “I hope that Samuel’s bravery in calling this out provokes a true leadership response. Unless Kemi Badenoch offers a fulsome apology to Nadine White, her position appears to be untenable.” Rather than respond to a journalistic inquiry, in which White asked via email why Badenoch had not appeared in a video featuring other cross-party black MPs encouraging uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine, the minister provoked an outcry by accusing the journalist on Twitter of “sowing distrust” and “making up claims”. Woolley, who also heads Operation Black Vote, said the prime minister must act decisively to regain the trust of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and campaigners against racism. “This is a critical moment for the government,” he said. “A key black special adviser in No 10 Downing Street is deeply concerned about the politics of division. Samuel Kasumu is referring to the government’s strategy that pits poor white people against poor black people, for example, by rubbishing Black Lives Matter and arguing that class in the northern regions, a code for white working class, is a greater inequality than racism. “What Kasumu and others want is for the government to about-face and radically begin to acknowledge and deal with the deep-seated racial inequalities that have been laid bare by Covid-19, such as jobs, health and housing.” The minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, gave a speech in December detailing how she would move focus away from “fashionable” issues of race and gender and towards economic inequalities. Kasumu, an entrepreneur who has worked as a political appointee for the government since being recruited under the premiership of Theresa May, offered his resignation to Johnson on Thursday morning. The behaviour of Badenoch, who used Twitter to publish emails from the HuffPost journalist, calling them “creepy and bizarre”, had been concerning, Kasumu wrote. In his resignation letter, Kasumu wrote that “more concerning than the act, was the lack of response internally”. “It was not OK or justifiable, but somehow nothing was said. I waited, and waited, for something from the senior leadership team to even point to an expected standard, but it did not materialise.” Badenoch has previously provoked controversy by saying it was illegal for schools to teach white privilege as uncontested fact, and by accusing the family of a 12-year-old boy arrested over a toy gun for “inflaming tensions” about police behaviour. No 10 initially defended Badenoch over her HuffPost response, but the BBC reported that the Cabinet Office was now understood to be looking into whether she had broken the ministerial code. On Friday afternoon the prime minister’s spokesperson denied that claim, saying: “There is no Cabinet Office investigation ongoing. The prime minister fully supports the important work the minister is doing to improve uptake of the vaccine amongst ethnic minority communities.” Kasumu said progress made by the Conservatives under David Cameron in 2015 in appealing to minority ethnic voters had been reversed. “I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division,” he wrote, adding: “The damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered.” It is understood that tensions have been building within No 10 since Munira Mirza was asked in June to appoint members of the new government commission on racial inequalities. A key Johnson adviser, Mirza has previously cast doubt on the existence of institutional racism and condemned previous inquiries for fostering a “culture of grievance”. Tony Sewell, the commission’s chair, has in the past questioned the idea of institutional racism. He was forced to apologise in July for making homophobic comments after the former footballer Justin Fashanu disclosed he was gay in 1990. A Downing Street spokesperson said of Kasumu: “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual staff members. This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together, and is the most ethnically diverse in this country’s history. Last year we established a commission on race and ethnic disparities to examine and tackle inequality and discrimination wherever it is found. It is due to report shortly.”"
2021-02-05T17:41:20Z,politics,Politics,Plan to give enhanced maternity leave to top ministers sparks calls for wider reforms,"The government has been accused of ignoring the plight of millions of parents struggling with “inadequate” parental leave policies, while finding solutions for its own ministers. Trade unions, campaigners and business leaders have called for a “radical overhaul” of parenting policy in the UK, arguing that current parental leave provision is discriminatory and fails to help the poorest in society. The government announced plans to change the law to give cabinet ministers six months’ maternity leave on Thursday, in order to allow the attorney general, Suella Braverman, to keep her post after having her baby, but faced a backlash as it emerged that backbench MPs would be denied similar rights. On Friday Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said parents across the UK, particularly mothers, were carrying the burden of the government’s failed policies. “The UK’s parental leave system is not fit for purpose, genuine flexible working is still unavailable to millions and quality childcare is hard to find and unaffordable for many,” she said. With the UK at the point of rebuilding its economy for a post-Covid world, ministers had to urgently strengthen rights and support for working parents or women’s equality could go into reverse, she added. TUC research found that the level of paid maternity leave for employed women in the UK (six weeks at 90% of average weekly earnings, 33 weeks at £151.20) is one of the lowest in Europe, ranking 22 out of 24 among European countries. Additionally, one in four fathers don’t qualify for two weeks’ paternity leave, paid at £151.20. Mothers who are on zero-hours contracts, self-employed or unemployed receive maternity allowance of £151.20 a week for 39 weeks; there is no equivalent for their partners. Only around three in seven families are eligible for shared parental leave (a policy introduced by the coalition government in 2015) and of those only about 1% to 4% have shared any leave at all, said Ros Bragg, director of Maternity Action. “We know that many pregnant women and new mothers have lost their jobs in the recession and many more are at significant risk,” she said. “It’s particularly important that women are not compelled to take leave for the entirety of a child’s first year purely because the system is so poorly designed.” But the government’s move to protect the job of its attorney general could be positive for millions of struggling parents, said Adrienne Burgess of the Fatherhood Institute. “I think the government is holding itself hostage to fortune – if it is going to push this through, how can they argue against reforming the parental leave system?” she said. Research has shown that women bore the brunt of extra childcare during the initial coronavirus lockdown and are being disproportionately affected by the economic fallout but there has also been a narrowing of the gender care gap, and an increase in the number of hours men are spending with their children. Campaigners including the TUC, the Fawcett Society, Working Families, the Fatherhood Institute and Maternity Action have called for non-transferable parental leave for fathers, a policy that has been taken up about 90% of the time in Sweden and Iceland. Catherine Gregory from Working Families said: “If the government is serious about improving parental leave for everyone – and not just a single cabinet minister – they should take action to improve leave entitlements for fathers and partners.” Some companies are already pushing ahead. Aviva offers six months’ paid leave for all parents, while Zurich recently saw a 20% increase in the number of female candidates applying for senior roles after offering flexible working for all jobs. Real change also requires a cultural shift, said Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, who also called for “a complete overhaul” of parenting policies post Covid. “A culture that respects an employee’s home demands and allows flexible working will go a long way towards boosting both trust and productivity,” she said. Sian Elliott, women’s equality policy officer at the TUC, said the government needed to make good on its promise to make flexible working the default, and provide affordable childcare to prevent women leaving the workforce. “The rest of the country needs the exact same measures as government ministers,” she said. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said the UK’s parental leave arrangements were “generous and flexible” and more generous than the EU requirement for 14 weeks of paid leave. “Our shared parental leave provision gives parents the choice and flexibility to combine work and childcare in a way that suits them and, as set out in our manifesto, the government is committed to making it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.”"
2021-02-05T17:16:57Z,politics,Politics,UK urged to follow US in restricting arms sales to Saudi Arabia,"Britain is under increasing pressure to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia after Joe Biden said the US would no longer sell munitions that could be used in Riyadh’s “offensive operations” in Yemen. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, called on the government to “follow suit and rethink military sales”, seven months after the British government restarted them following a high-profile court defeat. Ellwood, a former defence minister, said the UK needed to work with the new US administration in developing “a fresh strategy” to help end the six-year conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 Yemenis and displaced a further 8 million. A Saudi-led coalition has been engaged in an indiscriminate bombing campaign against Houthi rebels that has led to civilian casualties and multiple allegations of violations of international humanitarian law. The world’s biggest arms importer, Saudi Arabia has been supplied principally by the US, accounting for 73% of sales, and the UK, accounting for 13% between 2015 and 2019, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute. BAE Systems, the UK’s leading arms maker, supplied £15bn in systems and services to the Gulf kingdom over a five-year period to 2020, according to figures disclosed by the company in its annual reports. Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, said Biden’s first major foreign policy speech on Thursday should prompt a rethink among British ministers. “For five years Labour has demanded the suspension of arms sales for use in Yemen and urged action to impose a ceasefire, open up humanitarian corridors and resume proper peace talks. For five years the Tories have refused. Now surely they must listen,” the MP said. However, government officials said Biden’s announcement was “a matter for the US government”. A spokesperson said the UK “takes its export responsibilities seriously and will continue to assess all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria”. One analyst said it was too early to determine whether Biden’s move would have any practical effect, but on a political level the UK was at risk of becoming increasingly isolated on arms sales to Saudi. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, noted that the US move followed a similar decision by Italy at the end of January. “All this builds up pressure on the UK to reconsider its own position, but it is unclear if will be enough to force a change in policy,” she said. In 2019 a court case brought by arms trade campaigners forced the UK government to halt sales for a year, as judges held that ministers approving arms sales – including British components for Paveway missiles – had not properly assessed the risk of civilian casualties. But Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, approved the restarting of unrestricted arms sales in July, arguing there had been only “isolated breaches” of humanitarian law by Riyadh, compliance with which was partly paid for by British taxpayers. The kingdom’s air force is accused of being responsible for many of the estimated 8,750 civilian deaths in airstrikes. While the raids have slowed during 2020 because of the pandemic, the attacks continue, according to the Yemen Data Project. Last July at least seven children and two women were believed to have been killed in a suspected Saudi-led coalition airstrike in north-west Yemen, according to the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande. Charities also urged a British rethink in the wake of the US move. Pauline Checuti, of Oxfam, said: “For the sake of the millions of Yemenis enduring the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, it is time for the UK government to follow suit.”"

2021-02-05T14:25:43Z,politics,Politics,No 10 adviser on ethnic minorities nearly quit over ‘politics of division’,"The prime minister’s senior adviser on ethnic minorities considered resigning over fears the Conservative party was pursuing a “politics steeped in division”. Samuel Kasumu reportedly retracted his resignation letter, in which he said tensions in the government were at times unbearable, after talks with the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi. In the letter to Boris Johnson, seen by the BBC, Kasumu also raised concerns about the conduct of Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, suggesting she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a black journalist on social media. But Kasumu reportedly retracted the letter on Thursday night after talks with Zahawi. He was said to have remained in government to continue with efforts to overcome vaccine hesitancy among black, Asian and minority ethnic Britons, having written of his pride at his work on battling “misinformation and mistrust” surrounding the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. According to the BBC, Kasumu’s letter said that progress made by the Conservatives under David Cameron in 2015 in appealing to minority ethnic voters had been reversed. “I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division,” he wrote, adding: “The damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered.” The behaviour of Badenoch, who used Twitter to publish emails from a HuffPost journalist, calling them “creepy and bizarre”, had been concerning, Kasumu wrote. The reporter had written to Badenoch asking for clarification as to why the minister had not appeared in a video promoting vaccine uptake. No 10 initially defended Badenoch, but the BBC reported that the Cabinet Office was now understood to be looking into whether she had broken the ministerial code. On Friday afternoon the prime minister’s spokesperson denied that claim, saying: “There is no Cabinet Office investigation ongoing. The PM fully supports the important work the minister is doing to improve uptake of the vaccine amongst ethnic minority communities.” Kasumu, in his letter, said he was concerned by the lack of response, writing: “It was not OK or justifiable, but somehow nothing was said.

2021-02-05T13:47:25Z,politics,Politics,Joanna Cherry sacking brings SNP trans rights row off Twitter and into the light,"Last Wednesday’s SNP Westminster group meeting was fraught, by all accounts, with MP after MP telling their leader, Ian Blackford, that they had had enough. Some were on the verge of tears, reporting lengthy phone calls persuading valued activists not to leave the party, while others raised angry exchanges and repeated threats to sue on social media. The context was the increasingly toxic row within the SNP over transgender law reform, and later that evening, the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon posted a video statement on Twitter in which she stated categorically that there was “zero tolerance” towards transphobia in her party. But the meeting’s focus was Joanna Cherry, admired cross-party for her legal challenges during the Brexit crisis, and who, only three years earlier, came within one vote of beating Blackford to his role. She is also an unrepentant champion of concerns around the erosion of women’s rights and one of Sturgeon’s fiercest internal critics. On Monday, Cherry was sacked from the party’s frontbench during a reshuffle that was press-released as “drawing on new talent”. But it has brought the SNP’s row over transgender matters off Twitter and into the light and risks further entrenching deep divisions within the party. A senior Westminster source insisted that Cherry’s relegation was not a direct result of her stance on transgender law reform: “She was turning out to be a really disruptive influence on the group and some folk [at the meeting] were visibly upset about her behaviour.” The Guardian understands that some form of no-confidence motion was being prepared by colleagues, and that Blackford “had to say: enough”. The reshuffle was “about a team of people who can work together”, they said. The source added that, while Cherry was valued as a highly effective Commons performer, she repeatedly clashed with colleagues and was seen as a bully. “She has a robust personality. Always quick to characterise herself as the victim, the victim of bullying. What she doesn’t see is she’s actually guilty of the same stuff herself.” A source close to Cherry suggested that the daily challenges of high-profile political life demanded a robust countenance, but insisted that accusations of bullying were “lies and classic deflection” from the “bullying, lies and smears” that she had faced from colleagues. Since her sacking, Cherry has received a torrent of abuse on social media, and on Thursday a man was charged in connection with alleged threats made against her after her sacking. Regardless of the briefings, there are plenty across the spectrum of opinion who see Cherry’s removal more plainly as the party leadership – and Nicola Sturgeon herself – neutering a political rival. “Anyone with an ounce of political knowledge can see that there was an agenda, regardless of whether you agree with the agenda or not,” said one prominent Glasgow activist who described themselves unequivocally as a Sturgeon supporter. Cherry has found herself quite unapologetically at the nexus of a series of debates that have challenged the SNP’s famed internal discipline and unity of purpose. Many Sturgeon supporters point to her interview with the Times on the eve of the SNP conference in November, in which she criticised Sturgeon’s leadership and referendum strategy, as evidence of Cherry’s repeated disloyalty. And she remains a prominent supporter of the former party leader Alex Salmond, amid intensifying allegations that officials close to Sturgeon tried to orchestrate government and police investigations into sexual misconduct allegations against him, which Sturgeon categorically denies. Indeed, one supporter this week suggested Cherry could now be in “pole position” to replace Sturgeon should those inquiries result in the first minister’s resignation. The same source close to Cherry said the sacking went well beyond a personality clash: “Ever since she challenged Blackford for Westminster leadership there has been a sustained campaign to undermine and marginalise her. This is because she won’t be quiet about women’s rights, she stuck up for Alex and she is critical on independence.” Party members who share Cherry’s stance on transgender matters pointed out that their inboxes had been similarly filled in recent days with members threatening to leave the party because of her sacking. Taken alongside Sturgeon’s video message, one prominent critic said there was “a real fear that people will use this as a tactic to wrongly smear people without evidence”. Cherry has repeatedly stressed that it is not transphobic to question the impact of self-identification (streamlining the process by which an individual can legally change gender) on women’s sex-based rights.
Another prominent activist who shares this stance said that Cherry’s removal from the frontbench would have a “chilling effect” on those who wanted to speak out: “Jo Cherry was a very loud warning.” She argued that recent overspill of the sex and gender debate into other areas of policymaking, including hate crime reform and rape victims’ access to medical examiners, was proof of growing concerns among the Holyrood group of MSPs. Some SNP MPs described a “palpable sense of relief” within the Westminster group this week, along with a degree of frustration that action had not been taken sooner. As one MP said: “The party has a hard-won reputation for being socially liberal, pro-equality, and any perception that our politicians are not has a terrible effect on younger supporters in particular, and with that comes the fear that they will go to the Greens at the next election.” The symbolism of Cherry’s removal will go some way to reassuring those concerned about transphobia, according to senior equalities activists, and represents “a green light” for action. But those activists also believe that Sturgeon’s video statement itself, while welcome, came “far too late”. James Mitchell, a professor of public policy at Edinburgh University who has studied the SNP extensively, contrasted Sturgeon’s apparent “intolerance of dissent” with a party that historically encouraged debate and participation. Acknowledging that all political parties are struggling with trans policy, Mitchell argued that the SNP leadership had failed to listen to those members who disagreed with them on policy and strategy but might be willing to accept these differences if they felt their voices had been heard. “This has created a deep, entrenched binary divide that no one is trying to bridge. The trouble is, when you create these camps other issues fall into them.”"
2021-02-04T18:14:42Z,politics,Politics,Free ports – or sleaze ports? Rishi Sunak's dream of tax-free zones about to become reality,"Five years ago a young, unknown MP wrote a pamphlet for a Thatcherite thinktank extolling the benefits of free ports. Now that Rishi Sunak is chancellor, his dream for Britain is – for good or ill – fast becoming reality. This week, alliances of port owners, businesses and local authorities must submit their bids to establish free ports, competing to set up zones exempt from normal tax and regulation. Proponents say free ports can attract investment to areas that have been left woefully short, bringing jobs and prosperity to deprived regions as part of the “levelling up” agenda, helping prioritise greener industry, and breathing new life into, say, the former Redcar steelworks site, or the Grimsby docks. But others fear the move signals the creation of “mini-tax havens” and a race to the bottom on regulation, keeping revenues from councils and the Treasury to line the pockets of business and landowners, with profits sent offshore rather than reinvested in the UK. Support is found predominantly among those who voted – and campaigned – to leave the EU; backers call it a Brexit dividend enabled by the final deal. The EU has started to clamp down on the 80-odd free zones within its jurisdiction, over tax evasion, corruption and crime concerns. Most of the big coastal ports, as well as some inland airports and accompanying industrial zones, are throwing their hats into the ring. In the north-east, the Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley combined authority, Ben Houchen, has championed a policy he says could create thousands of jobs in the region. Deprived areas will be given priority, and bids are expected from around England by Friday’s deadline – from Humberside to Liverpool and London to Bristol. The devolved governments in Wales and Scotland are expected to follow – with caveats – and invite bids at a later date.
Within designated zones, stretching up to 45km from ports, the government’s free ports prospectus describes how usual customs, planning and tax measures will not apply. Goods and components will, in effect, remain offshore, allowing, say, a new factory to be built, processing raw materials and components without customs paperwork or tariffs, to re-export as more valuable goods. For the first five to 10 years of that factory’s life, the government proposes, it would pay no stamp duty on its land or property purchase and enhanced tax breaks would be given for construction or machinery costs. Behind the zone’s fences – physical and virtual – business rates would be waived, and employers would not pay national insurance contributions for up to three years for staff members earning less than £25,000. The government says it will “ensure it has the power” to prevent access to national insurance relief for employers who abuse it, for example by dismissing staff after three years. Modelling by the consultancy Vivid Economics for a Teesside free port said the kind of package proposed could create up to 32,000 jobs and boost the regional economy by £2bn over the next 25 years, although “deadweight and displacement” – firms relocating rather than reinvesting – could cut those benefits in half. It projected that the Treasury would lose about 40% of £960m in tax and revenues due in Teesside if free port firms were subject to usual rules, although it argued that the zones would create enough investment to produce a net positive for the exchequer. However, the projection suggested that to be competitive with the likes of Singapore, the UK would need complete exemption from business rates and other taxes. Unsurprisingly, many people are alarmed. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark scheme, says: “These ‘sleaze ports’ are very much mini-tax havens domiciled within the UK. It’s going to leak out into the wider economy – it will result in a massively reduced contribution from business to the Treasury. Businesses which are rooted in communities wish to stay and play a part in society and pay fair tax – why should they be undercut by hot capital and flighty businesses that can exploit these zones?”
A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is committed to combating abusive tax practices, such as avoidance and evasion – these have been a consideration throughout the design of the free ports tax offer.” Monaghan says the zones have proved magnets for illicit financial flows and criminal activity, adding: “One of the reasons for them existing is the absence of regulations and checks – it’s a consequence of what they are.” One of the world’s biggest free zones, Dubai’s Jebel Ali, has been identified by tobacco companies as a major source of contraband cigarettes, while the US last year blacklisted two aviation businesses in the zone for trading with Iranian airlines designated as supporting terrorism or as a threat to US national security.
Its operator, DP World, which runs the London Gateway and 70 other ports worldwide, is hoping to transform it into a free port. A spokesperson for DP World said customs officers in Dubai were “praised” by HMRC for helping to stop cigarettes entering the UK black market, adding: “DP World has operations on every continent and moves 10% of the world’s container trade. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards illicit activity anywhere in the world and work closely with the customs and taxation authorities.” Labour has attacked the principles of the scheme, although some MPs in affected constituencies have broken ranks. The SNP is no longer in outright opposition, with Scotland suggesting a middle way – “green ports”, linking tax incentives to sustainable business. Britain’s main maritime union, the RMT, says it supports green job creation but fears free ports could result in workers in some of the poorest communities signing away their rights. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, says: “Without strong employment rights, automatic trade union recognition and tax laws that make sure international owners of UK ports contribute, free ports are doomed to fail the communities they are designed to help.” Ports have moved to allay fears, with a joint declaration by the biggest owning groups – including Associated British Ports, DP World, Hutchison, PD Ports and Peel Ports – that the free ports would be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable and pledging that they “are not seeking to diminish or dilute employment rights”. The Treasury said “no part of the freeport policy would explicitly or implicitly affect” workers’ rights.
The contenders The government has said it will name the chosen free ports in England, likely a maximum of eight, in the spring. These ports are expected to bid: Thames A free zone that would cover London Gateway, opened in 2013 by DP World, and the older and smaller Tilbury, owned by Forth Ports. Backers say it could create 25,000 jobs along the deprived Thames Estuary region, with green investment at Ford Dagenham and in Thurrock. DP World is owned by the state of Dubai. Its chair, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, wields extraordinary power as commercial chief and regulator. He is chair of the Ports, Customs & Free Zone Corporation, a government department that includes the Dubai customs workforce, and leader of the Jebel Ali free zone authority, where companies can incorporate and operate untaxed. DP says the chair’s roles are “regularly audited” by the UAE government. Felixstowe-Harwich The Freeport East bid joins local authorities in Essex and Suffolk with two Hutchison-owned ports: Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, and Harwich. As well as taking in major road and rail freight hubs, the free port would link to offshore wind and Cambridge University research programmes. Hutchison Ports Europe, part of the telecoms and infrastructure empire built by the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, made headlines last year by hiring the former transport secretary Chris Grayling on £100,000 a year for seven hours’ work a week. Grayling has assured parliamentary standards committees he will not be advising on “post-Brexit opportunities” and is being kept away from the bid. Liverpool Liverpool city region combined authority has been leading a bid that would combine Peel Port’s Liverpool hub and its operations Manchester and Heysham in one big free zone. Peel says it is considering bids with regional stakeholders across all of its port locations, which include Great Yarmouth and Clydeport in Scotland. Peel Group, the parent company established and part-owned by an Isle of Man resident, John Whittaker, also has a large land and property division in the north-west. The increase in land value alone could produce a huge windfall for one of Britain’s biggest landowners. Bristol The bid is being led by the West of England combined authority. Boris Johnson visited Bristol in the autumn and declared the port a “strong contender”. A number of proposed inland “free port zones” are linked by road and or rail to Bristol port. The Bristol Port company is owned by Terence Mordaunt and David Ord, who bought the port from the city council in 1991. Between them, they have donated £1.9m to the Conservatives, £25,000 to Johnson’s leadership campaign and £50,000 to Vote Leave. Mordaunt chairs the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Forum, whose trustees include the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore."
2021-02-04T17:28:35Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid live: positive cases in England fall by 29% in a week – as it happened,"Here the latest key developments at a glance: A government-backed study is being launched to determine whether people can be safely given different coronavirus vaccines for their first and second doses, with results expected “probably after the summe”, according to vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. The UK reported 915 further deaths on Thursday, as well as 20,634 new infections, slightly up from Wednesday’s 19,202 new cases. Over the past seven days, infections in the UK have declined by 25,7%. Zahawi declined to give a date for when the first nine groups in the priority list will have received their vaccine. Previously, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has said the aim is for all over-50s and those at risk to be vaccinated by the end of April. Rob Paterson, chief executive of Best Western hotels, has criticised a lack of communication from the government over its plan to quarantine certain international arrivals in hotels, and said hotel bosses “to this day simply haven’t heard anything despite multiple offers”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will lay out the “operational plan” for hotel quarantines next week. “A significant return to normality” is on the cards once the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) member professor Andrew Hayward said on Thursday, but Nadhim Zahawi told the Commons that the economny would only be reopened “very gradually”. Nadhim Zahawi told the Commons the UK government, despite having pre-purchased 300m coronavirus vaccine doses, was “nowhere near having enough supply” to send vaccines to poorer countries. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said that there cannot be a “huge splurge of reopening” in the country despite Covid-19 rates falling since before Christmas. England’s infections fell by 29% in week to 27 January, as a total of 196,257 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in that week. Case rates in England have decreased in all age groups and are currently highest in those aged 30-39 years old, according to Public Health England. Around one in 10 major hospital trusts in England had no spare adult critical care beds last week, according to NHS England figures. A mutation of coronavirus initially detected in Liverpool has been found in Preston and West Lancashire, local health officials said on Thursday.

2021-02-04T14:39:51Z,politics,Politics,"UK leaders became too close to Trump, says ex-ambassador","British prime ministers have been absent from the world stage for the past four years while becoming too close to Donald Trump and his “pie in the sky promises” of a free trade deal, a former UK ambassador to Washington has said. Sir Peter Westmacott, who was ambassador from 2012 to 2016 and got to know many of Joe Biden’s foreign policy team when they were working for Barack Obama in that period, said the start of the new US administration gave Britain a chance for a diplomatic reset, so long as ministers “bring bread to the table”. The modus operandi of British foreign policy had been hamstrung in the Trump years, Westmacott told the Guardian in an interview. “Britain’s first instinct, especially when it does not know what to do, is to ask the Americans, but that was near impossible when US policy was being made by early hour tweet,” he said. “There were also huge gaps in the Trump administration either because places never got filled, people resigned or got fired, leaving Britain with no one to deal with. An awful lot of western policymaking went by default, and that meant the gap was filled by others that were able to make hay.” In his new memoir, They Call It Diplomacy, spanning 40 years in the Foreign Office, Westmacott claims the chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US had an impact across UK foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. “Trump’s promises that after Brexit the UK would benefit immediately from a tremendous new free trade agreement with the United States were pie in the sky. But they led Theresa May and her successor, Boris Johnson, to give top priority to aligning British policy with that of the Trump administration,” he wrote. “Even before the new president had taken over, May’s government turned its back on the Middle East peace process initiatives which had been developed in close partnership with the UK […] Britain also joined the Americans at the UN security council in tabling draft language on Yemen, placing the entire responsibility for the war on Iran and its Houthi proxies without mentioning the suffering caused by the bombing of civilian targets by the Saudi and Emirati air forces.” Westmacott said a UK reset with the US would not be simple. “The impressions I got from my friends in the old Obama administration that are now being recycled in the Biden team was that there was a pretty strong sense that Brexit was a mistake, mis-sold, not in America’s interest, and that they had not forgotten some of the more colourful language used by Johnson towards some Democratic politicians. Nor had they forgotten the sucking up to Donald Trump,” he told the Guardian. “Nevertheless, whether it is due to nimble diplomacy or the nature of the beast, Biden and Johnson have got off to a pretty good start. But Britain has to put bread on the table. It has got to make a contribution on the issues that the US cares about. On the Iran nuclear deal, for instance, we have diplomats on the ground, unlike the US. Iran fundamentally cares about only one thing, its survival, so I think a deal is doable. “On Yemen, perhaps I am naive, [but] we can help. I am sure Biden cares about this issue a lot more than Trump ever did. The UN envoy is a Brit and we have a historic responsibility to the Aden protectorate. “Similarly, we can have a role in devising a multilateral approach to China. The UK is waking up, like everyone else, and realising China requires a collective approach. And on Russia, for whatever reason, Trump was in awe of Putin and not prepared to stand up to him. Biden, by contrast, sees him as a threat to democracy through cyber-attacks and suchlike, and there we have invaluable expertise. Through Nato we may be able to show that the Brits have got something serious to offer in terms of calibrating a serious security strategy.” Westmacott said it was already clear that the UK was trying to be active as president of the G7. This contrasted with the previous four years when, he said, the main refrain from friends from Europe to Asia was “where have you gone?” He cautioned Johnson not to be tempted into trying to disrupt or even goad the EU, arguing it was not the kind of UK-EU relationship that the Biden team would want and was not in the UK national interest. He believes the UK foreign and security leaders overall have recognised that their leverage will be enhanced if they cooperate with the main European players, albeit initially on ad hoc basis. “With the world as unpredictable and unstable as it is, not least because of all the unpredictability and flip-flops in the US over the past four years, it is in the UK’s interests to re-establish working relationships on foreign policy with the other principal capitals of Europe,” he said. He sees the US and the UK’s joint recent absence as coinciding not just with China’s rise but also a realisation that China’s economic strength was not leading to political and social reform. “We need to think again, and make them realise they have got to play by the same rules as us,” he said. “They have certainly got a very big interest in the survival of the western economy that they want to dominate. They have got trillions of dollars of US debt, and they don’t want to destroy the west in the way that Putin does.”"
2021-02-04T13:14:12Z,politics,Politics,"Cancer drugs discarded because of Brexit red tape, MPs hear","A Welsh pharmaceutical company has been forced to throw out hundreds of packs of vital cancer treatments for EU patients because of Brexit red tape on exports, MPs have heard. The company, which has not been named, has now moved production to Dublin. Ian Price, the director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales, said the “mountain of red tape” facing businesses because of Brexit was “terrifying” and had come as a real shock to companies. He told MPs on the Welsh affairs committee that the UK government needed to resume talks with the EU about a relaxation in the rules over medicine supplies because financial support would not help several pharma companies that are having difficulties trading with the EU. “One instance I’m aware of is that they’ve already moved the production of a particular item to Dublin – because they can’t in the time allowed continue to make it in Wales because it’s a time sensitive cancer drug that they were importing into Europe – sadly as a consequence of the arrangement of the deal. “It’s no good they’ve now got 200 or 300 consignments blocked somewhere in the system in Europe and they are having to be thrown,” he said. He was speaking as MPs on the Scottish affairs committee were told that the government had made “catastrophic decisions” on the fishing industry post-Brexit, one of which has led to a ban on live molluscs being traded. It has been “a dreadful first few weeks of trading … there’s no way of sugar coating it,” James Withers, the chief executive of Scotland Food & Drink told them. He was speaking just days after Politics Home revealed that the EU has told the UK shellfish industry that thousands of tonnes of oyster, mussel, clam, cockle and scallop exports were banned from the bloc indefinitely, spelling disaster for the Scottish fishing industry.
Elaine Whyte, executive secretary of the Clyde Fisherman’s Association, said the EU ban on live shellfish was a “massive issue” as it could mean “losing live markets entirely and permanently”. There must a “political intervention” to save UK businesses, she said. MPs on both committees heard of the fears that Brexit barriers would get worse in April when new health checks will be applied to all products of animal origin including meat, pet food, honey, milk or egg products with pre-notification of imports required by the authorities. It means more disruption to the supply chain for food and fish processing production, which relies on elements of ready meals, confectionary and processed food coming from the EU. “1 April is a concern for everybody and they haven’t yet come to terms with 1 January,” Price told MPs. Ian Davies, the head of UK Port Authorities at Stena Line, talked of the devastating impact of Brexit on British-Irish trade. Irish suppliers were bypassing the UK “landbridge” going direct to France or Belgium on new ferry routes laid on to allow truckers to avoid Dover. Although the route added €400 (£351) a load and took six hours longer, Irish suppliers had opted for “ease over cost” amid fears they could be “tripped up” by barriers in Dover. A reduction in traffic in the other direction had also hit Holyhead port where 30% of traffic to Dublin would normally be destined for Belfast. But there had been a “big deflection” with hauliers saying they are now opting to drive the length of the country to Scotland rather than face checks in Dublin port. Price said he had seen “horrific stories of transport price increases since Brexit with one firm, which moves “large capital equipment” to the EU, seeing its costs rise £250,000 in the first month."
2021-02-04T10:59:35Z,politics,Politics,Dublin and EU reject call to scrap Northern Ireland Brexit protocol,"The Brexit agreement’s Northern Ireland protocol will not be scrapped, the Irish government and the EU have said in an escalating row over the new trade barriers down the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, has called for the measure designed to keep the Irish land border open to be replaced, but Dublin is focused on easing problems with the post-Brexit trade deal that have caused disruption at Irish ports. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, told BBC Ulster “there is not going to be very dramatic change”, in the face of calls by the DUP for the protocol to be urgently axed. “We want the protocol to function in a way that works for everyone, north and south, on the island of Ireland,” he said. Foster hit back on the same programme, accusing Coveney of being “completely tone deaf to the concerns of unionism”. On Wednesday the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, said the UK and EU had a “shared commitment to the proper implementation of the protocol”. He tweeted that this had been reiterated at a meeting with Michael Gove, Foster and Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, on Wednesday night and they had agreed that “constructive solution-driven cooperation” was “essential to addressing outstanding issues”. Gove and Šefčovič will meet again next week. It is understood a specialised committee dedicated to the working out of the protocol will be established in the coming days to move those talkson, with a meeting of the UK-EU joint committee chaired by Gove and Šefčovič pencilled in for mid March. The effort to address the issues caused by the implementation of the protocol has been expedited by the aborted attempt by the EU to trigger article 16 of the protocol, which allows for the suspension of the arrangements in extreme circumstances. Boris Johnson and Gove have capitalised on the EU’s embarrassment over the move and threatened to trigger article 16 themselves in parliament and in a letter to Šefčovič on Tuesday. The UK is now demanding a two-year extension to the Brexit grace period for checks on trade but the EU made it clear last night it regarded article 16 as an ultimate on which it would not capitulate. Efforts to de-escalate the row will do little to assuage the DUP’s opposition to the protocol. Two days ago Foster, who is also Northern Ireland’s first minister, launched an official campaign to get the arrangements scrapped. At the same time she announced the party would be withdrawing from all engagements with the Irish government on matters relating to the protocol. While many have considered the move a reflection of the binary politics that often define Northern Ireland, consumers and businesses agree the protocol has caused upset across all communities. One shopper who contacted the Guardian on Wednesday said he had been unable to order goods, as he used to, from John Lewis or Currys. “It feels like we are being left behind, a victim of a Brexit we didn’t vote for in Northern Ireland. I’m not angry about any of this, I’m just worried that things are going to get harder and more expensive at a time when many people are already struggling,” he said. “I know the DUP (the people who voted for Brexit) are now upset at the outcome and are wanting to do something to ease these terrible supply issues, but it all feels a little too late.” The MLA for Belfast South, Matthew O’Toole ,of the Social Democratic and Labour party, criticised the DUP’s approach. “They are trying to amplify the issue of the Irish Sea border in a disembodied way, as if the Irish border existed in a sui generis way and could be got rid of without diplomatic consequence, political or economic consequence,” he said."
2021-02-03T22:27:54Z,politics,Politics,UK in 'constructive' talks with EU over Northern Ireland protocol,"Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovic, are to meet in London next week after a “constructive” discussion over problems with application of the Northern Ireland protocol. On Wednesday, the UK asked for a two-year transition period on the core elements to the protocol, including checks on food and delivery of online shopping entering the region from Great Britain. The timing of the request by Gove was seen as capitalising on the calamitous triggering of article 16 in the protocol by the EU last Friday as part of an attempt to block Covid vaccines getting into the UK. The move – intended to stop vaccines moving into Northern Ireland from the Republic – met with immediate criticism and was rescinded almost immediately. The virtual meeting on Wednesday evening, which was also attended by Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, and the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, appears to have restored some calm in an escalating crisis that saw border officials taken off their Brexit duties in Belfast and Larne ports on Tuesday amid fears for staff safety. In a joint statement Gove and Šefčovic said: “After a constructive discussion amongst all parties [it was] concluded that the UK and the EU would immediately work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues … [Gove and Šefčovič] will keep in close contact as this work progresses, and will meet again next week in London.” The meeting came after Boris Johnson accused the EU of appearing to “cast doubt” on the Good Friday agreement, with last week’s decision to invoke article 16. It is understood that a new specialised committee, mandated under the Brexit deal, will be quickly set up and will convene in the next two weeks to thrash out a solution. A signoff is expected at a meeting of the UK-EU joint committee, which Gove and Šefčovič pencilled in for mid-March.
Earlier, speaking at prime minister’s questions after a call with Foster, Johnson said: “It was most regrettable that the EU should seem to cast doubt on the Good Friday agreement, the principles of the peace process, by seeming to call for a border across the island of Ireland.” Johnson told MPs: “We will work to ensure that there are no such borders, we will respect the peace process and, indeed, no barriers down the Irish Sea and the principle of unfettered access across all parts of our United Kingdom is upheld.” Gove, in a strongly worded letter to Šefčovic, had demanded six major concessions to the Northern Ireland protocol including extensions on the current three-month grace period for checks on supermarket food supplies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to 1 January 2023, and a “permanent solution” on chilled meats from GB. He is also seeking extension of the current temporary arrangements for parcel post from Great Britain to Northern Ireland for the same period to allow time for a “light touch permanent solution to be codified”. This will address dismay from consumers that they can no longer get goods from high street chains such as John Lewis or Currys delivered to Northern Ireland. The UK also wants a common travel area for pets, changes on steel quotas for the region and medicine supplies to continue as normal.
Gove said the UK wanted “urgent resolution” of the problems and that lengthy technical discussions, the hallmark of Brexit negotiations, were not acceptable. “What is required is political, not technical solutions,” he said. Gove implicitly warned that the UK could invoke article 16 unless its demands are met. “If it is not possible to agree a way forward in the way we propose, then the UK will consider using all instruments at its disposal.” While Šefčovic made clear earlier that there was no question of the protocol being scrapped, he agreed in the joint statement with Gove after the talks that “avoiding disruption to the everyday lives of the people of Northern Ireland” was vital as was “protecting the gains of the peace process” and “maintaining stability” in the region. Under the protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland effectively remains in the EU’s single market. The full EU customs code is also to be enforced across the Irish Sea on goods coming from the rest of the UK but its application to the letter has caused cross-community dismay in Northern Ireland. In the Commons, DUP MP Ian Paisley urged Johnson to “be the unionist we need you to be” by legislating if necessary to make sure goods can flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Paisley said the Northern Ireland protocol had “betrayed us, and has made us feel like foreigners in our own country”, and reminded Johnson that he had told businesses in Northern Ireland they could “bin” any paperwork they were asked to fill out after Brexit. Johnson promised to do everything he could to ensure trade flows freely, “whether legislatively or indeed by invoking article 16 of the protocol”. O’Neill said it was imperative that the protocol worked and “solutions must be found to support business … to ensure smooth trading operations”. She called for the urgent establishment of a new specialised committee and working group, mandated in the Brexit trade deal to work through implementation issues over the long term."
2021-02-03T19:43:19Z,politics,Politics,Prime minister's questions for the prime minister who doesn't do questions,"Fittingly enough, the Speaker began prime minister’s questions with a one-minute silence for Captain Sir Tom Moore and all those who have died of Covid-19. If only the silence had been extended for a further 43 minutes – having started by insisting that the session return from John Bercow’s extended director’s cut to a straightforward half-hour, Lindsay Hoyle is himself showing signs of mission creep – we might all have been better off. Right now, PMQs feels increasingly redundant. Even as a piece of weekly political theatre it is failing. There was a time when Keir Starmer regularly managed to get under Boris Johnson’s skin, but Boris has long since worked out that he can get by quite easily without answering any questions, and the Labour leader has yet to find a strategy for forcing him to do so. He needs to do so quickly as we have reached a point of stalemate that suits Johnson just fine. Starmer began with three questions that came nowhere close to resolving whether or not Sage had recommended mandatory quarantine for everyone arriving in the UK. The answer appeared to depend on your definitions; Sage might have said it would be a good idea, but did that count as a proper recommendation? Johnson rather thought not, as the variant virus that everyone but Dido Harding expected much preferred travelling business-class on direct flights but, just to be safe, he chose to muddy the waters first by talking about incoming freight and then implying that almost no one would have been vaccinated if the Labour leader had been in charge. It wasn’t true, but then the truth and the shape-shifting “world king” have never been particularly close acquaintances. Abandoning the coronavirus as a lost cause for the week, Starmer moved on to all those still living in buildings with dangerous cladding. Here Boris had equally little to say other than that no one should be left with unaffordable costs. He didn’t specify at what level affordable became unaffordable, nor could he explain why his government had done so little, more than three and a half years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Rather he just waffled on, before concluding with a general tirade against Keir that the Speaker had to cut short. The SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, momentarily thought he had Boris on the ropes by quoting a story that No 10 had known there had been a coronavirus outbreak at the vaccine plant in Livingston before he had visited it last week. But Johnson merely ignored him and said he was prime minister of the UK and he would go to places where and when he chose. So there. There’s something about the SNP that always brings out the child in Johnson. The most interesting exchange came with the DUP’s Ian Paisley. Although Johnson affects to be deeply troubled by the EU having briefly invoked article 16 last week, you get the feeling that secretly he’s thrilled. Because now he has carte blanche to do whatever he likes. To the extent that he sounded as if he couldn’t wait for an excuse to abandon the Northern Ireland protocol that he himself had negotiated little more than a year ago. There again, it’s quite possible that either Boris never fully understood what he had signed up to or that he never had any intention of abiding by it. Or perhaps both. The Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon started with Johnson again paying tribute to Moore. Almost as if the prime minister was trying to create an association between himself and the late soldier in people’s minds. Perhaps the prime minister has yet to learn the difference between selflessness and selfishness. Otherwise, this was a briefing at its most meta. One that existed only as dead air to be filled, rather than because there was anything much new to impart. Boris merely repeated that the remarkable milestone of 10m vaccinations had been reached, more or less re-committed himself – with a bit of wriggle room – to giving more information on the reopening of schools in the week of 15 February and promised that Matt Hancock would be providing further details on the so far imaginary plans for hotel quarantine the following day. What was most remarkable, though, was that – for almost the first time – Boris’s natural gung-ho optimism had given way to something rather more pragmatic. That he had discovered the hard way that the coronavirus couldn’t be pushed around and forced to fit with his government’s timetable. While being cautiously hopeful that the deaths were on a downward curve, for once he didn’t want to overpromise. Maybe time spent close to Chris Whitty hasn’t all been wasted. “We all knew [the virus] could surge in the autumn and winter months,” he said. At which point, some jaws dropped. After all, Boris had been the prime minister who had said the pandemic would be over by Christmas, had ignored the advice for a circuit-breaker in September, had done his utmost to facilitate a five-day Killathon over Christmas and had introduced a raft of measures to make sure the UK had a world-beating mortality rate. Still, better late than never, I suppose."
2021-02-03T18:53:32Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: all four nations past peak of current wave, says Whitty, as 10m in Britain vaccinated - as it happened","Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, has said all four nations of the UK have passed the peak of cases, hospitalisation and deaths. (See 5.54pm.) Boris Johnson has effectively ruled out bringing forward general school reopening in England. He has already said schools will reopen from 8 March, but the Scottish government’s decision yesterday to reopen schools, mostly for some primary pupils, from 22 February, has prompted some calls for a rethink in England. But, speaking at a press conference in No 10 alongside Whitty, Johnson defended his plans. (See 5.28pm.) He went on: What we don’t want to do, now that we are making progress with the vaccine rollout and we have got a timetable for the way ahead, we don’t want to be forced into reverse. We think this is the prudent and cautious approach. I think it is much better to stick to that. Scientists have also warned that bringing forward the reopening of schools in England would “a recipe for disaster” while prevalence of the virus remains high.
Johnson has said the government will give more detail about the next phase of the vaccination programme after 15 February, which is the deadline for everyone in the top four priority groups to have been offered a first dose. And he said on Monday 22 February he would be setting out a routemap for easing lockdown, with dates and a timetable. Whitty said he thought giving every adult in the UK two doses of vaccine by the end of August was “probably beyond what is possible”. It has been reportedly that privately ministers do think this is possible. (See 11.45am.) Johnson said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will announce more details of the hotel quarantine plan in the Commons tomorrow. (See 5.23pm.) Britain needs an economic strategy for the next decade to match the ambition of the 1945 postwar recovery as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, the new head of the CBI said. Boris Johnson has defended visiting a Scottish vaccine plant despite a coronavirus outbreak at the site, saying “no one is going to stop me” visiting all parts of the UK. A parliamentary human rights committee has called on ministers to legislate against blanket bans on care home visits in England that relatives claim are causing deaths through loneliness and isolation. Britain has given a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine to more than 10 million people as public health experts called on ministers to target future vaccinations in hotspots where the disease is threatening to run out of control. MPs have called on Dido Harding, the head of NHS test and trace, to prove that the system substantially reduces the spread of coronavirus as efforts continue to contain more transmissible variants she claimed no one had seen coming. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has said she is opposed to making one-off £500 or £1,000 universal credit payments in April in lieu of retaining the £20-a-week Covid top-up, warning that it could disincentivise claimants from taking a job. The UK government has asked the EU to agree to a two-year extension of the full implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. The request was set out in a letter released as Boris Johnson told MPs that he wanted to see “no barriers down the Irish Sea and the principle of unfettered access across all parts of our United Kingdom ... upheld”. In response to a question at PMQs from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Johnson also restated his threat to invoke article 16 of the protocol - an emergency break that would allow the UK to dis-apply parts of it. Johnson said he would do everything he could to ensure trade flows freely, “whether legislatively or indeed by invoking article 16 of the protocol”. That’s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2021-02-03T18:36:09Z,politics,Politics,Johnson defends 'reckless' visit to vaccine plant despite Covid outbreak,"Keir Starmer has admitted he “made a mistake” in a response to Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions during a tense clash over Starmer’s previous comments on the European Medicines Agency. Labour rubbished claims from a Conservative MP that Starmer had challenged Johnson in the corridor after their debate in the House of Commons. Johnson has previously accused Starmer of wanting to take part in the EU’s vaccine procurement programme, a charge the Labour leader has fiercely denied, accusing the prime minister of being misleading. However, after a clash at PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer’s spokesperson issued an unusual apology from the Labour leader for a misunderstanding, though reiterating that the prime minister had previously been misleading. “On a number of occasions the prime minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU’s vaccine programme,” Starmer’s spokesperson said. “That is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue. “This afternoon during prime minister’s questions, Keir misheard the prime minister and assumed he was making the same false accusation again. Keir accepts that on this occasion the prime minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency, and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response.” She added: “It’s not Labour policy to join either the European Medicines Agency or the EU vaccine programme. We have never called for the UK to be in the EU vaccine programme. We remain committed to working with the government to ensure we can be the first in the world to roll out the vaccine.” The Conservative MP Mark Francois, who made a point of order after PMQs reading out some pre-prepared comments quoting Starmer on the EMA, later claimed he had seen Starmer angrily confront Johnson in the lobbies after their exchange. The Labour MP Chris Matheson, who was with Starmer, said the description was untrue. “It’s absolute bollocks,” he said. “There was a brief chat and then Keir and I left together. Nothing more to it than that.” A Labour source: “They had a perfectly reasonable conversation, as they often do after PMQs.” During PMQs Johnson also faced an awkward moment where he defended visiting a Scottish vaccine plant despite a coronavirus outbreak at the site, saying “no one is going to stop me” visiting all parts of the UK.
The prime minister was criticised by Scottish leaders including the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, for his trip to Scotland last week at a time when only essential travel was permitted. The Daily Record reported that Johnson’s visit to the Valneva factory took place 24 hours after a public health investigation that found 14 coronavirus cases – about one in eight of the workforce. Valneva’s chief financial officer, David Lawrence, said Downing Street had been informed before the trip. Responding to the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, in the Commons, Johnson denied any knowledge of the issue. Blackford said it was an “absolutely shocking error of judgment. Anyone can see that his campaign trip to Scotland was utterly, utterly reckless.” Blackford said No 10 had made a choice to proceed with the visit. “They knew the visit posed a risk … the prime minister put politics before public health. Why be so reckless?” Johnson said he had not been made aware of the outbreak “before or since” the visit to Valneva. “It is my job to visit every part of this country, nothing and no one is going to is going to stop me, and I am very, very proud of the record of the government in rolling out the vaccine,” he said."
2021-02-03T18:30:54Z,politics,Politics,Labour defends new strategy to focus on patriotism and union flag,"Labour has defended its renewed focus on British values and the union jack after a leaked strategy document was criticised by some within the party, saying Keir Starmer sees patriotism as wanting to improve the country. The leaked strategy document, seen by the Guardian, advised Labour to make “use of the [union] flag, veterans [and] dressing smartly” as part of a rebranding to help it win back the trust of disillusioned voters. It also reveals that voters could not describe what or who Labour stands for. The presentation suggests that displays of patriotism are needed to reinforce that the party has changed. One slide says: “Belonging needs to be reinforced through all messengers,” while another is headed “communicating Labour’s respect and commitment for the country can represent a change in the party’s body language”. The document has been criticised by a number of leftwing MPs, including former shadow cabinet ministers Clive Lewis and Richard Burgeon, who said it risked alienating young and BAME voters and lacked ambition and authenticity. However, some of the party’s former MPs defended the strategy, saying it showed the party wanted to rebuild trust. Gareth Snell, the former MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, said critics should realise how critical some of the issues were for some voters and that patriotism should not be conflated with xenophobia.
“I don’t think some of the criticism that came out last night that suggested that this is just a move towards nationalism is fair at all because there is a clear and distinct difference between patriotism and nationalism,” he said. “Clement Attlee and Denis Healey both wore uniforms and took pride in their country and no one would consider them nationalists. “But if we’re going to align ourselves with a more patriotic platform, it has to be more than skin-deep, it has to be properly understanding why is it that places like Stoke have a particular support base for the armed forces and traditional values. Why is it we care about certain things that are very different but not less relevant than the things that are cared about much more metropolitan areas? Our challenge is appealing to both of those groups, we cannot win without both.” Phil Wilson, the former MP for Sedgefield, tweeted that a Labour leader’s patriotism should be “a given, not a strategy.” A Labour spokesperson said Starmer was proud to be patriotic. “Keir wants to be prime minister of this country, because he wants to believe that a better future is possible for this country, where we can spread opportunities for everybody, we can rebuild our public services, we can create best businesses in the world, which are the envy of the world,” the spokesperson said. “You can call it whatever you want patriotism or whatever, but that’s what he stands for. The union flag represents a country that Labour wants to govern. And the country that Keir Starmer wants to be prime minister of, it is a symbol of the country we want to lead. “That is the patriotism that drives our movement. It is fighting for a better country.” Asked if Starmer agreed with views from voters in the document, prepared by the agency, his spokesperson said: “We’ve always said it is a long road to rebuild the party so we can win in 2024. We’re on that road.” Starmer’s spokesperson said the Labour leader disagreed with comments from Lewis, the former shadow defence secretary, that the party was pandering to the “nativist right”. “We don’t agree with that,” his spokesperson said. Richard Burgon, the former shadow justice secretary who is now a leading figure of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said the strategy made for “sorry reading” and said the leadership should be bolder. “It’s the biggest public health crisis for a century the biggest economic crisis in 300 years,” he said. “Reading that thing you think, is this the best of the party can do in those circumstance? I thought it looked a bit desperate and suggests a worrying paucity of ideas.” He said he was concerned that the strategy was taking votes for granted from young people and BAME communities. “This is symptomatic of a strategy which goes chasing votes from groups who already have their own party – the Conservative party,” he said. “You end up with the worst of both worlds losing the support you have already got and not gaining new supporters in sufficient numbers.”"
2021-02-02T20:16:08Z,politics,Politics,DUP launch campaign to scrap Northern Ireland Brexit protocol,"The Democratic Unionist party has launched an official and coordinated campaign to get the Northern Ireland protocol scrapped from the Brexit agreement. It marks a rapid escalation of tensions with Boris Johnson who was swept to power on the back of an “oven ready” Brexit deal that included a trade barrier down the Irish sea the DUP opposed. In a statement, the Democratic Unionists vowed to actively oppose at every opportunity any negative measures, laws or bills that continue to flow from the protocol and which undermine Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. And they put Dublin and London on notice that the party will not participate in any talks with the Irish government related to the protocol warning ominously that “north south relations will be impacted”. Using the slogan “restore our place in the UK internal market”, it said it will “work with other unionists to send a united message” to Johnson. It also vowed to “oppose any protocol related measures” in Stormont that undermine the internal market and would launch an e-petition with the ambition of securing enough signatures to force a debate on the issue in parliament.
DUP leader Arlene Foster will have a virtual meeting with the prime minister on Wednesday in addition to a conference call with the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. Up to now Foster has largely been preoccupied by the Covid crisis at home leaving the anti-protocol protests to Westminster DUP MPs including Ian Paisley. But the EU’s decision on Friday to trigger, and quickly revoke, article 16 of the protocol to as part of a vaccines trade war has united and emboldened the Westminster and domestic leadership. The DUP statement claimed that the EU’s move revealed that its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement institutions were not borne out of political opportunism. Behind the scenes briefings have also been taking place with the European Research Group with individual MPs such as Sir Bernard Jenkins expressing great interest in the cause. The launch of their Brexit battle came at the end of a day when Michael Gove vowed to work with the EU to bring an end to some of the Brexit issues that have caused upset in the wider NI community including new rules on pet transport and plant imports from English garden centres. He also said he would address the looming end to a three month grace period for checks on certain goods including chilled meats such as British sausages and large supermarket consignments. “We do need to make sure that supermarkets and other traders can continue, as they are at the moment, to be able to supply consumers with the goods that they need.” Gove admitted damage had been done but said the backtracking on Article 16 showed they had simply “mucked up”. However the DUP maintains the EU’s move has caused lasting harm and “compounded the notion that the EU is playing fast and loose with Northern Ireland, attempting on the one hand to require the UK Government to enforce its obligations whilst being prepared to waive elements of the protocol when it suits the needs of the EU”. “This is unsustainable,” it said."
2021-02-02T20:01:50Z,politics,Politics,Women criticise release of private messages about Alex Salmond inquiry,"A group of women who discussed allegations of sexual assault by Alex Salmond have attacked the Crown Office and MSPs after their private messages about the case were released to the Scottish parliament. The women, understood to be Scottish National party figures, said releasing the texts could have “grave consequences” for future victims of alleged sexual violence if people feared their private correspondence could be disclosed. The messages were released last Friday to MSPs looking into the Scottish government’s botched investigation into claims Salmond had sexually harassed two officials after Holyrood issued an unprecedented legal order demanding they were disclosed. In a statement released by Rape Crisis Scotland, the small group of women said they were “deeply disappointed” the committee had asked for the messages, and questioned the conduct of some MSPs. “We have no doubt that members of the committee knew that vulnerable witnesses were involved when they made the request,” they said. “We are also deeply disturbed that the crown has felt it appropriate to break the trust we placed in it. Having been let down by the Crown Office, we feel this unnecessary act will have done serious damage to progress made over the last few years in sexual assault cases. “We urge the crown to consider the grave consequences of their actions, and are actively considering further options.” The committee’s convener, Linda Fabiani, made it clear there were no plans to publish the messages. She said: “These communications included numerous chains of private messages between different women in what we are clear were safe spaces … We will not publish any of these messages as we are clear that we will not do anything that may cause further unnecessary distress to any women.” Salmond was tried in March 2020 on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, but acquitted of every charge after a jury trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He acknowledged having a “sleepy cuddle” with one complainant, and confirmed he apologised to her soon afterwards. He also said he had a consensual sexual encounter with another woman who accused him of attempted rape, but on a different day months earlier. Salmond has alleged that SNP officials and people close to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, were involved in a conspiracy to bolster the police investigation and had pushed complainants into giving evidence – an allegation Sturgeon has repeatedly denied. A Holyrood source said the nine MSPs on the committee had unanimously agreed on Tuesday morning that the messages were private and would not be used in their investigation. They agreed, however, to press the Crown Office further, to ensure any relevant material is released to the committee. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: “I have read the messages: there’s nothing in them which is relevant to the committee remit or anything which is suggestive of a conspiracy. They show women supporting each other through a very difficult time.”"
2021-02-02T19:56:17Z,politics,Politics,Sir Simon Robey: the accidental banker adding George Osborne to the fold,"Sir Simon Robey had his career planned out. He wanted to become a professional opera singer and his dream was to sing on stage at the Royal Opera House, but he accidentally stumbled into investment banking. It’s a decision he occasionally regrets while singing in the shower in the morning. But Robey, 60, turned out to be a pretty good banker, and has been described as the City’s “trillion dollar man” for the cumulative size of the mega-deals he has worked on, including advising the Cadbury board on the sale of the 197-year-old chocolate company to America’s Kraft in 2010. His sought-after advice has earned him at least £137m in the last seven years alone. He is spending this lockdown at Bramfield Hall, a Grade II-listed, 16th-century country estate in Suffolk, which was owned by the Rabett family for 450 years until Robey spent a chunk of his bonus on it. It was at Bramfield that Robey, a lifelong Arsenal fan, this week signed up a new recruit for his boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw. His old friend and former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne will become the only person to join the bank as a partner since Robey founded it with fellow investment banking superstars Simon Warshaw (an heir of the Molton Brown beauty empire) and Philip Apostolides in 2013. Osborne will be giving up his elective portfolio of roles, including editor-in-chief of the Evening Standard newspaper, but the new job is set to propel the former chancellor – best remembered for ushering in a decade of austerity and public spending cuts – even higher into the ranks of the top 1% of high earners. Robey Warshaw has paid out £207m in profits to partners over the last six years, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Most of the money has gone to Robey, who is understood to hold the biggest equity chunk in the partnership. The accounts show that the bank, which operates out of a townhouse on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, turned over £255m in the six years to March 2020, but has not paid any tax. Robey Warshaw said it was not liable for tax because of its structure as a limited liability partnership, and that it is “the responsibility of the individual members to settle any liability arising from their share of partnership profits”. A spokesperson for the bank declined to state how much tax the partners had paid on their share of the profits, but said: “All Robey Warshaw partners are UK registered taxpayers and pay all taxes required under UK law.” “It’s all very cosy, isn’t it?” said Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and former economic secretary to the Treasury. He sees Osborne’s move as an example of the “revolving door” in British public life between government and the financial sector. “He [Osborne] was in charge of putting the banks in order after the financial crisis, but instead he embarked on the austerity drive that transferred wealth from the majority to the top 1%,” Burgon said. “Now he has got an incredibly lucrative job as a result, it is a reminder that the political elite runs our society in the interest of the economic elite.” Robey was adopted and grew up in Cambridge. He has described himself as “an odd child”. “Anorak, glasses, listening to classical music and watching birds. It was a fairly nerdy upbringing in Cambridge,” he told the Evening Standard. He boarded at Reed’s School, an independent private school in Cobham, Surrey, before winning a choral scholarship to read English at Magdalen College, Oxford. It was while performing in a cabaret at Oxford’s Randolph Hotel that he accidentally stumbled into banking. A so-called “milk round” presentation for the investment bank Lazard was taking place next door. He wandered in on a whim, and won a place as a graduate trainee. “When I joined Lazard in 1983, it was very English, very old-fashioned and a bit like being back at boarding school. We shared one computer, had long lunches and drank champagne after work,” he wrote in an FT magazine article celebrating 30 of “the City’s most influential people”. “Lots of things were wrong with this set-up: it was a bit clubby, male and public school.” As he progressed in his career and joined Morgan Stanley, where he worked for 25 years before starting out on his own, Robey became – to his own admission – a difficult and demanding boss. His colleagues once gave him a T-shirt with “Get This Right or I’ll Kill You” printed on it, which he proudly wore at the gym. He had uttered the words “half in jest” to a colleague during a deal in 1996. He now claims to have “mellowed a lot”. Robey has worked on some of the biggest deals in British, European and worldwide business. He advised Marks & Spencer on its defence against a takeover attempt by Sir Philip Green; helped AstraZeneca’s defence against a takeover by the US’s Pfizer; and worked with the London Stock Exchange on its aborted merger with Deutsche Börse. He was also involved in Halifax Bank of Scotland’s emergency merger with Lloyds TSB during the financial crisis in a deal hammered out in a three-bedroom flat in Mayfair. And he advised the Treasury on Bradford & Bingley’s nationalisation. Osborne is not the first person from politics that Robey has brought into banking. He recruited Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, and Lord Heywood, the former cabinet secretary, during his time at Morgan Stanley. His love of opera has not left him, and he finally got to grace the Royal Opera House’s main stage when he became chairman in 2008. Soon after he took the job Robey appointed Lord Heywood’s wife, Suzanne, to the board. He stepped down himself soon after being knighted for services to music in 2016. Robey is married to Victoria, a former banker and the ex-wife of the incoming BBC chairman Richard Sharp. He has three children from a previous marriage, and is stepfather to Victoria’s three children. He still sings, but says he has to be “very drunk” to do so in public. But he did once take to the stage in a piano bar in the Swiss resort of Klosters. “He was fabulous,” a PR executive recalled. “Unfortunately the Swiss tourists didn’t realise that they were being sung to by one of the City’s best investment bankers.”"
2021-02-02T19:49:35Z,politics,Politics,Leak reveals Labour plan to focus on flag and patriotism to win back voters,"Labour must make “use of the [union] flag, veterans [and] dressing smartly” as part of a radical rebranding to help it win back the trust of disillusioned voters, according to a leaked internal strategy presentation. The presentation, which has been seen and heard by the Guardian, is aimed at what the party calls “foundation seats”, a new term for the “red wall” constituencies that handed Boris Johnson a landslide in 2019, and other seats it fears could also turn blue. It will be seen as a marker of how concerned Labour is about its electoral position. It reveals that voters could not describe what or who Labour stands for. While the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is rated by voters as the party’s biggest positive driver, concerns were voiced about him “sitting on the fence”. The strategy is yet to be shared with most MPs or staffers, and Labour party managers are understood to be preparing a redacted version because of its “sensitivity”. Some party officials who have seen the presentation are alarmed by the language, believing the leadership has not reckoned with the nationalistic sentiments it invokes. Presenting the strategy last month – including research on the party’s brand by agency Republic dating from September – the party’s head of research said voters were confused about “what we stand for, and what our purpose is, but also who we represent”. His slides featured comments from the focus groups such as: “I don’t know anything about the Labour party at the moment, they have been way too quiet” and “he [Starmer] needs to stop sitting on the fence”. Voters see this fog as deliberate and cynical, top officials have been told, proving that Starmer and his team are “not being forthright and honest … about where we want to be”. One Birmingham voter described Labour as “two different parties under one name”. An ex-Labour voter from Grimsby is quoted: “They are the voice of the students. They have left real people, taxpayers behind.” Labour’s new strategy is based on extensive focus groups from Watford to Grimsby conducted in September alongside nationwide polling. The findings are being briefed to some politicians and senior staffers now, and already appear to be shaping Labour’s communications and policy-making. The presentation suggests that displays of patriotism are needed to reinforce that the party has changed. One slide says: “Belonging needs to be reinforced through all messengers,” while another is headed “communicating Labour’s respect and commitment for the country can represent a change in the party’s body language”. Among the top recommendations is: “The use of the flag, veterans, dressing smartly at the war memorial etc give voters a sense of authentic values alignment.” Approached for a response, a senior Labour official said the language came from the agency’s research rather than their own phrasing. The bigger possible consequences of the left playing national-identity politics have concerned some staffers who have seen the presentation. One said: “I was just sat there replaying in my mind the storming of the Capitol [in Washington last month] and thinking: are you really so blind to what happens when you start pandering to the language and concerns of the right?” Clive Lewis, one of Labour’s leading ethnic-minority MPs, said: “The Tory party has absorbed Ukip and now Labour appears to be absorbing the language and symbols of the Tory party.” Lewis served as a soldier in Afghanistan but decried his party’s flag-waving. “It’s not patriotism; it’s Fatherland-ism. There’s a better way to build social cohesion than moving down the track of the nativist right.” In WhatsApp messages, sent within hours of one briefing, senior officials ordered: “Please prioritise the union jack header images, not the plain red ones.” Earlier this week Starmer presented a party-political broadcast beside a union flag and promising to “rebuild our country”. Red wall voters have also been targeted with a Facebook advert, which demands the Tories get tougher on border control, something which Labour emphasised in an opposition day debate on Monday. “Britain is locked down. But the borders are open. Any idea why?” the ad said, attracting criticism for language describing the hotel quarantine system that would more normally be used in xenophobic attacks on immigrants. The strategy warns the party to brace for a backlash from “Scots and younger remain voters”, especially ahead of the Holyrood elections in May. The strategy accepts that Labour has “excluded” and “ignored” once-core voters, which the presentation appears to blame on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, under which the party is described as a “party of protest”, expressing “unpatriotic” sentiments, with “arrogance” and “idealism”. Last year’s election inquiry by party heavyweights such as Ed Miliband described the cause somewhat differently, concluding the loss of votes was a consequence of issues of alienation stretching back decades. Staffers are also concerned at the policy ideas presented to the focus groups, including 5,000 new police officers, a fund to invest in barren high streets and protecting local bus services. A staffer who sat through another presentation said: “I couldn’t remember any of those ideas half an hour later. They were that dull.” Labour said those policies had been chosen by an agency and as examples used to test voters’ priorities. A senior Labour official said that although the phrasing had been written by an external agency, senior figures agreed on the fundamentals and said it was intended to demonstrate internally the challenges facing the party. “Different parts of the Labour party have different opinions on what was got wrong and what wasn’t – this is broadly a reality check of what the public thinks of Labour.” The strategy also suggests the party fears Boris Johnson’s lasting “relatability” could maintain his popularity with the country. Attacks will focus on “incompetence” in tackling the Covid crisis and plan to focus next on the Tories’ “waste” and the sense they are “cavalier and self-interested”. The research also concludes that voters believe Labour is the party of “spend, spend, spend”, blamed on the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The result, according to the heading on one slide, is: “No part of the brand is insulated from lack of economic credibility.” Whereas the public is said to care most about the economy, healthcare and Britain leaving the EU, in that order, it sees Labour politicians as sharing only one of those priorities – health – while the Tories are seen as caring most about Brexit and the economy. A Labour party spokesperson said the presentation consisted of conclusions reached by a third party rather than Labour officials. “This is a report by an external organisation from September 2020. It deals with pre-existing perceptions of the party. Keir [Starmer] and Angela [Rayner, deputy leader] have been very clear that Labour has a mountain to climb to win in 2024 but is on the right path.”"
2021-02-02T19:49:30Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer's patriot act risks turning off his core Labour voters,"The speaker’s tone is mild but to his audience the words are deeply alarming. It is early this January, and senior Labour officials are finding out exactly what the public thinks of them. It’s not kind. “We lack any form of identity,” says one of them. In voters’ minds, says this longstanding staffer who has devoted punishing days and nights to his cause, the party is defined by “wish-washyness”. The fog of confusion seems to reach all the way to the top. Almost a year into Keir Starmer’s leadership, this secret internal presentation suggests “his image lacks definition from other politicians”. While he scores vastly better than Jeremy Corbyn, lots of Britons find him less “relatable” than that son of Eton, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. So far the new leader’s policy of being not-Corbyn is having less success than he hoped – because Labour’s problems appear to go far deeper than just its previous leader. While Corbyn in 2019 clearly did not work, leading Labour to its biggest bulldozering since 1935, neither did Ed Miliband or Gordon Brown. All three men represented different strands of social democratic tradition. Even now, when the UK is cursed with one of the worst Covid death tolls in the developed world and economic devastation, the Conservatives still lead Labour in the polls. This is the backdrop that has led Starmer to consider wrapping himself in the union flag. It is a huge risk, make no mistake. The very people he wants to woo may see Labour’s new red, white and blue as so much spray paint. Here is Westminster’s arch-remainer now talking up the possibilities of Brexit; a human rights lawyer professing his love for the police and the army. As one staffer in Labour HQ who has seen the new strategy says: “They don’t believe any of this stuff; they’re saying whatever they think will get them votes.” In the era of authentocracy, there is no political sin more grave than being fake. Others believe Starmer’s office has got both language and symbols wrong. The North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll, may count as Labour’s most powerful politician in the north-east. He has seen the videos of his leader emoting in front of a union flag and says: “Up here, we talk about defending the north-east. Bringing up the union – well, that’s a reminder of the establishment down south, isn’t it?” The biggest risk of all, as acknowledged by the party strategists, is that Starmer’s patriot act will turn off those voters who Labour still believes it can rely on – the young and the ethnic minorities. And it may well drive away its last bastions of support in the increasingly independent-minded Scotland. One frontbencher representing a seat in the north-west says: “To get a majority in parliament Labour needs to win both Chipping Barnet and Bishop Auckland. At the moment, they’re just playing to Bishop Auckland.” A year ago, when Labour was holding its latest leadership contest, every candidate felt compelled to discuss the fragility of an electoral coalition that stretches from Walthamstow to Workington. This problem stretches back decades and since Brown’s leadership the way Labour has tried to get around it is by focusing its appeal along the lines of economics and class. Miliband had his “squeezed middle” to be won over by lower energy bills, while Corbyn tried to engender a sense of shared interests between the Uber driver and the university lecturer on a zero-hours contract. Any appeals to national identity have always looked as forced as a politician’s selfie on the doorstep. Starmer began his leadership in much the same vein, making 10 pledges to party members that were essentially continuity Corbynism. Yet he now appears to be moving away from the language of economics and policy to identity and values. “There’s no way he can do that flagwaving better than the likes of Nigel Farage,” says Driscoll. And so the biggest leftwing party in Europe could find itself in a very strange position. It could be accused of combining the electoral tactics of the right with the economics of the right, too. The party’s strategy calls for it to broadcast its “economic competence” and drop the associations with “spend, spend, spend”. This sounds like shorthand for dropping any attempt to be significantly different on tax and spend from the Tories. This may all work for Starmer and his team. Or it may be that in a choice between Coke and Diet, voters prefer the real thing – in which case it could well be jettisoned for the next new thing. But in the meantime it raises one question for all progressives in the UK: if the main party of the left seeks to walk like the right and talk like the right, then what precisely is the point of the main party of the left?"
2021-02-02T18:53:00Z,politics,Politics,Gove says rather more than intended after parliament finally unites over Europe | John Crace,"After years of division, who would have guessed that it would take the European commission to unite the entire House of Commons – not to mention the whole of Ireland – over Europe? Last Friday, the EU had what can only be described as a hallucinatory episode when it imagined that vaccine manufacturers were planning to start a major drug racketeering scam by smuggling their jabs across the border from the Republic into Northern Ireland and promptly invoked article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol. If only for a short while, as within hours that decision had been rescinded. “Trust has been eroded,” said Michael Gove, in answer to an urgent question from the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh. It’s quite something when the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has the moral high ground on matters of trust, but it was a measure of just how extreme the EU’s actions had been that no one thought to challenge Gove on his own track record of duplicity. Rather there was a general agreement from MPs of all parties that the EU had been totally out of order to unilaterally invoke article 16 before all other options had been explored. The EU had made a serious mistake, Haigh agreed, and now was the time for calm heads. Peace in Northern Ireland had been hard-won and was too important to be used as a political football. Several MPs who had been using Northern Ireland as a political football for years nodded their heads in agreement: the protocol must never again be undermined in this way. This was Gove slightly out of his element. Normally there’s nothing he likes more than telling people – usually with confected, passive-aggressive sincerity – how right they are to be on the same side of the argument as himself. Especially when they aren’t. But now he found himself obliged to be somewhat more genuine, as time and again he found himself praising MPs – both Europhiles and Eurosceptics – for their wisdom and foresight in seeing things from his point of view, while expressing his own regrets at the threats made against border control officers in Larne and Belfast. In the end, all this honest agreement rather got to Gove and he wound up saying rather more than he intended. Boris Johnson has always maintained that any difficulties with the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK had only ever been teething problems; but Gove suggested the problems were rather more intrinsic and there were issues that had been overlooked in everyone’s haste to get a deal signed off in such a short time frame. Gove even indicated that some grace periods would need to be extended: something the Northern Ireland minister, Brandon Lewis, had previously said was unthinkable. All of this was soluble, he insisted. Just leave it with him and his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, to work out. That didn’t sound wholly convincing – the EU triggering article 16 less than a month after the end of the transition period didn’t bode well for the future of the protocol – but no one had any better ideas so Gove was by and large left unchallenged. As was Matt Hancock who came to the chamber to give a coronavirus update that was pretty much a repeat of the No 10 press conference he had given the day before. I guess he wanted to make the most of 2 February being Groundhog Day. The vaccination programme was on schedule with 9.2 million jabs having been administered and urgent action was being taken to track down the contacts of the 11 cases of the South African variant that had been passed on through community transmission. Not that the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and others didn’t try to pin Hancock down on matters of detail. Such as whether Sage had recommended a more aggressive hotel quarantine policy and when the South African variant was first identified. Rather it felt as if no one was in the mood for political point scoring right now; as if even most MPs needed a break from reminding the government of how its mishandling of the pandemic over the past year had caused so many, many unnecessary deaths. Maybe also there was a touch of fear in the chamber. That Covid-19 was a trickier disease than had been first thought and the vaccine might not be the get-out-of-jail card everyone hoped. These anxieties were largely kept contained though and there was more the sense that everyone was waiting for something to happen. Only they didn’t quite know what that something was. Then nobody does. Not even Hancock. Especially Matt Hancock."

Nicola Sturgeon has announced a phased return to school for Scotlandâ€™s youngest children, with nurseries and all primary pupils from P1 to P3 back in the classroom from 22 February. She also said her government would introduce a â€œmuch more comprehensiveâ€� quarantine policy than Englandâ€™s, introducing â€œmanaged quarantineâ€� for anyone arriving in Scotland, regardless of where they have come from. (See 3.50pm.) Oxford University has released research showing that a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy rate of 76% after 22 days until 90 days. The research also suggests giving single doses of the vaccine could reduce transmission by 67%. (See 5.57pm.) Scientists have said evidence that the Kent variant of coronavirus, which is now the dominant one in the UK, is becoming more similar to the South African one is worrying. (See 12pm.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said the testing is being boosted in parts of Bristol and Liverpool after â€œmutations of concernâ€� were found in the virus circulating there. (See 1.32pm.) The number of excess deaths in the UK has gone above 100,000, cementing the countryâ€™s position as one of the developed nations worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government is to seek the lifting of unexpected Brexit controls in Northern Ireland, including checks on pets crossing the Irish Sea and a ban on British soil entering the region in potted plants from English garden suppliers.

2021-02-02T18:01:34Z,politics,Politics,To hell with Brexit and Westminster,"I enjoyed Ben Fletcher’s vivid image of Dante’s fifth circle of hell for the post-Brexit channel crossings (Report, 31 January). There’s a big difference, though: in Dante the poor souls are suffering their torment as punishment for their own sins (intemperate anger), whereas at Dover the lorry drivers are enduring their misery because of the sins of others (and one hopes the drivers’ righteous anger would therefore not be considered sinful). But I wonder in what circle of hell Dante would place those who are responsible for the chaos. Presumably somewhere in the eighth – but is it among the fraudulent counsellors, or the falsifiers, or even the treacherous to country and cause? Martina Crowther-Menn Cambridge • To claim that “the last thing Britain needs is to fall apart in a fit of absence of mind” (Editorial, 28 January) is to ignore England’s uncompromising Brexit, forced through in an absence of mind. I have changed my mind on independence. It will be difficult but worth it – worth it to be rid of Westminster. Let Scotland decide. Matt Ritchie Inverness"
2021-02-02T17:04:08Z,politics,Politics,UK to seek lifting of Brexit controls in Northern Ireland,"The UK government is to seek the lifting of unexpected Brexit controls in Northern Ireland, including checks on pets crossing the Irish Sea and a ban on British soil entering the region in potted plants from English garden suppliers. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he would be writing to the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič on Tuesday, seeking urgent action on Brexit checks that were affecting the “daily life” of people in Northern Ireland. He told parliament he would be addressing the extension of the 1 April grace period on checks on chilled meats, including British sausages, and “everything from pet transport to the provision of plants and seeds to gardens in Northern Ireland, and the daily life of our fellow citizens does need to be protected”. The EU rules on soil and pets are designed to prevent diseases from entering the Republic of Ireland. The original Brexit plan was to draw up a list of goods “at risk” of going over the border but this did not materialise because of rows between negotiators and time constraints. Gove will also meet Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, and Šefčovič on Wednesday to discuss escalating tensions over Brexit in Northern Ireland. “All of these issues and more are ways in which the protocol is having an impact on people in Northern Ireland, which is not in the interests of Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, or indeed good relations between US and the EU. Vice-president Maroš Šefčovič totally understands the need to resolve these issues. And with goodwill, I believe that we can [do so] speedily,” said Gove.
The meeting comes after all Northern Irish and EU officials were withdrawn from duties conducting physical checks on goods from Great Britain amid concerns over their safety after reports of “menacing behaviour” and graffiti threatening border officials and the former Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. The threats have been widely condemned, with Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, describing them as “sinister and ugly”. “Obviously, we will be doing everything we possibly can to assist them to defuse the situation,” he said. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said they did not believe loyalist paramilitaries were involved in threats made to workers conducting post-Brexit trade checks, but that disgruntled individuals or small groups may be responsible, rather than the organised gangs that once instigated serious violence. Assistant chief constable Mark McEwan said: “We are concerned about the actions of a number of individuals and small groups. “We don’t believe that those actions are organised. But they do give us cause for concern.” Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist party MP for East Antrim, said it appeared that one staff member may have been identified or followed home, raising deep concerns among the police and the security services. “It is not a case of just guarding the port. It is a case of real danger when they [staff] go home at night. Because it appears that that is what has been happening at present. They have been gathering intelligence about where people live etc,” he said. The outgoing Northern Ireland agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, has said the controls on the Irish Sea were “disproportionate” and had “certainly created a lot of tension in the community”. The parties in Belfast are sharply divided on EU withdrawal and the Northern Ireland protocol, which keeps the land border in Ireland open but imposes controls on the Irish Sea, and unexpected bans on soil and controls on pets have fuelled opposition in loyalist communities. The DUP MP for Belfast East, Gavin Robinson, told Gove that soil or pets from GB to NI had “zero risks” to the EU and should not have been part of the arrangements designed to stop fraud and smuggling into the Republic of Ireland. Gove pledged to redouble efforts on the workings of the protocol and urged the EU to follow suit. “The EU needs to work with us at speed, and with determination and resolve a series of outstanding issues with the protocol, he said. Gove was pressed by several MPs including Labour’s Hilary Benn and the Conservative MP Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, to seek permanent solutions. “We have to make the protocol work and work well,” said Hoare. Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: “Calm is now needed and everyone has a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric and ensure the safety of people in Northern Ireland.”"
2021-02-01T20:11:27Z,politics,Politics,Hancock as surprised as anyone to find himself bearer of good news  | John Crace,"For months now, Matt Hancock has looked a beaten man every time he is forced to front a Downing Street coronavirus press conference – someone who knows the government has made a series of catastrophic mistakes in its handling of the pandemic and is fairly sure he is liable to be made the scapegoat when the reckoning comes. But on Monday, the health secretary was almost back to his pre-Covid self. Maybe not the full-on Tigger but a long way from the Door Matt he has become over the last half year. The change was subtle but it was noticeable – particularly in his use of language. Out had gone the continuous, monotone defeatism and back had come the occasional drift into the upbeat patter of a junior account manager at a PR agency. He and the UK were “powering ahead” together.
Just for once, Hancock had some relatively good news to tell. Not only in the rates of infections falling but in nearly a million vaccinations having been given over the past weekend, bringing the total of people to have had their first jab up to 9.2 million. It was also looking more than likely that the government would actually keep its promise of immunising everyone in the top four priority groups by 15 February. No one could quite tell who was most surprised by that: Matt or the rest of the country. Up till now, the only thing the UK had been “world-beating” in was the number of deaths. Now – to everyone’s, especially Boris Johnson’s, surprise – the UK appeared to be showing the rest of the world how to run a vaccination programme. Matt was feeling so good about himself and all the vaccinations – past, present and future – the UK had been able to acquire that he didn’t even feel the need to get much of a dig in at the EU’s article 16 brain fade that had assumed that Pfizer BioNTech were going to be operating a major smuggling route along the Northern Ireland border with the Republic of Ireland. Rather he merely congratulated himself again for having taken the necessary steps to protect everyone in the UK, while reminding everyone that the fight against the pandemic was a global effort in which we were playing a leading role and we would extend our largesse as and when. The only slightly tricky moment came with the news that of the 105 people with the South African variant, 11 had acquired the infection within the community. But somehow Hancock almost managed to spin this into a good news story by observing that if it hadn’t been for the UK’s genomic sequencing capacity, there was a fair chance that the rest of the world would yet to have realised that that the mutation had taken place. So the fact that these variants were popping up in the UK was just a sign of how far ahead of the game we really were. Not everyone was as convinced by the health secretary’s chipper demeanour as Hancock himself seemed to be. The questions ranged from whether the government ought to be taking more draconian measures to clamp down on the South African variant, whether the “second shot” supplies of the Pfizer BioNTech could be guaranteed and whether the vaccine was being fairly distributed across the country. But Matt was adamantly Panglossian. All was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Yes, the pandemic had taken a terrible toll but now was not the moment to be concentrating on all the things that the UK had screwed up over the past 10 months, such as being too slow to lock down, the failure of track and trace and a failure to follow the scientific advice. Rather we should be celebrating – cautiously, he added – the fact that we had vaccinated more people than anyone else. Not least, because that we had done so had come as much as a surprise to him as it had the rest of the country. When Boris had said that the most vulnerable 15 million people would be immunised by the middle of February, Matt had quite naturally assumed that this was yet another prime ministerial promise that was bound to be broken. But now it was looking like a decent bet. As with most of Hancock’s press briefings, there were moments of confusion. At one moment he said there was more than enough vaccine to go round while minutes later he admitted the supply was bumpy. And neither he, nor the two scientists alongside him, seemed to agree on just how effective the vaccine was on the new variants or why unpaid carers were in a lower tier to paid ones. But for Matt, these were incidental details. Yes, things were still terrible, but it had felt like an age since he hadn’t had to explain yet another government fuck-up. “See you again soon,” he said breezily, as he brought the presser to a close, amazed that it had passed off so positively. Happy days, though God knows, there was bound to be more bad news coming his way before long. So he was going to enjoy this moment while he could. Call it respite care."
2021-02-01T19:41:06Z,politics,Politics,Joanna Cherry sacked from SNP frontbench at Westminster,"Joanna Cherry, one of Nicola Sturgeon’s fiercest internal critics, has been sacked from the Scottish National party’s frontbench at Westminster after a public feud with its former deputy leader last week. Cherry, an advocate and queen’s counsel, announced on Twitter that she had been sacked as the party’s spokesperson for home affairs in a reshuffle of the SNP’s Commons frontbench, and immediately hit out at her Westminster colleagues and party leadership over its strategy on independence. After implying that she would continue criticising party leaders from her new position on the party’s ruling national executive, Cherry tweeted: “Westminster is increasingly irrelevant to Scotland’s constitutional future and the SNP would do well to radically rethink our strategy.” She was elected to the national executive late last year as one of the most senior figures in a slate of SNP activists involved in the Common Weal group, many of them angry at Sturgeon’s cautious approach to staging a second referendum and critical of the first minister’s stance on transgender rights. Cherry, a supporter of “gender critical” campaigners, also has close links to the Women’s Pledge grouping of SNP activists who won seats on the national executive and other party committees. They argue that the Scottish government’s measures to strengthen the rights and protections for trans people have eroded rights for women. Cherry clashed last week with Kirsty Blackman, the SNP’s former deputy leader at Westminster, over the SNP’s policies on trans rights, in what many observers believe is a proxy war between supporters of Alex Salmond and Sturgeon loyalists. It was not the first time the two had disagreed on the subject on social media. Blackman, who quit as Commons deputy leader last year and is now an economy spokesperson, said on Twitter in December that trans people and their supporters were leaving the SNP because of Cherry’s behaviour and that of senior party figures, and said: “Things have moved on since the 80s.” Cherry responded that she had done nothing to set back the rights of trans people. The MP, herself a lesbian, accused Blackman of breaching the SNP’s code of conduct with her tweet, adding: “I’ll ignore the ageism as I wouldn’t expect a privileged young straight woman to know what it was like for lesbians in the 80s.” On Thursday night, Sturgeon broadcast a video on Twitter, in her role as SNP leader, insisting that transphobia had no place in her party. She confirmed that there had been a number of resignations by younger party members critical of the perception the Scottish government has been diluting pro-trans measures in recent legislation. Cherry was blocked last year from standing against Angus Robertson – the SNP’s former Westminster leader and a Sturgeon loyalist – to be the party’s candidate in Edinburgh Central for this May’s Holyrood elections, after the party’s then national executive passed a new rule. In a move widely seen as an attack on Cherry, it became a requirement for a sitting MP standing for Holyrood to post a £10,000 bond to cover the costs of a byelection in their vacated Westminster seat. The party also introduced a policy banning MPs sitting simultaneously as MSPs. Cherry said the bond was unaffordable, and did not stand for nomination. Internal conflict in the SNP has become far more intense after Salmond’s allegations that officials close to Sturgeon tried to orchestrate government and police investigations into sexual misconduct allegations against him. Officials working for Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the SNP, have been accused by Salmond of secretly conspiring on WhatsApp to push one potential witness against him into testifying with allegations that Sturgeon has dismissed as unfounded. Murrell has denied on oath there was any such conspiracy, but on Monday evening refused a request to testify again before the Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government’s botched investigation into two claims of sexual harassment against Salmond. Salmond has been invited to give evidence in person to the Holyrood committee on 7 February, with Sturgeon scheduled to appear the following week. The hearings are likely to have a critical bearing on the SNP’s May election campaign. On Monday night Cherry said she had contacted police after receiving “a vicious threat from a man to my personal safety”. She added: “The matter has been reported to Police Scotland and I’m somewhere safe. Thank you for all the lovely messages of support.” The MP was a prominent figure in the court battles in 2019 against the UK government’s Brexit policies, and particularly its failure to consult MPs, joining in the cross-party legal challenges orchestrated by Jolyon Maugham’s Good Law Project."
2021-02-01T19:37:26Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Portsmouth port bosses accuse government of withholding cash,"The UK’s cattle- and horse-breeding businesses could be at risk because of a government decision to cut funding for a Brexit inspection post for livestock at Portsmouth harbour, the local port, council and MP have claimed. The local authority, which owns the port, has been left with a £7m shortfall for the facility, which will be necessary if it is to continue with the export and import of live animals after 1 July, when government border health checks come into force. A council report, due to be discussed by the city council on Tuesday, said it was the only facility planned in the UK for vets to approve the import of live animals for breeding rather than slaughter, a business worth £10m a year. “The country needs Portsmouth to build this vital trading infrastructure, but this short-sighted government continues to withhold the necessary funding,” said Stephen Morgan, the local MP and shadow armed forces minister. Mike Sellers, the director of Portsmouth International Port, said it was a further £5m short of cash for the main border control post, which will conduct health checks on food and goods of animal origin, and another £2m-£3m short on related projects. It applied for £32m to build the two facilities but was allocated £17.1m after a £200m port infrastructure fund created by the government in the autumn was oversubscribed. While other ports are privately owned, Portsmouth is in public ownership and the council will not seek to raise funds through local taxation. As a result, it has scrapped the plan for the live animal inspection post, something the National Farmers’ Union says could end the animal breeding business. “We’re only doing these infrastructure projects because the government are requiring us to do so at Portsmouth,” said Morgan. Sellers said: “About 9,000 racehorses come through the port every year as well as live animals for breeding purposes. But there is no business case to borrow funds.” He said the only solution was for the government to stump up funds. Morgan is also concerned about the shortfall in funding for the traffic-easing infrastructure, as the port’s position is so constrained it is only “13 lorries away from the M275” arterial route. “It’s a densely populated city with very few routes in and out of the city, so any sort of congestion as a result of infrastructure will have a devastating impact on Portsmouth levels of congestion and traffic flow in an area with high air pollution,” said Morgan. Brexit checks came into force on 1 January in the EU but are being phased in over six months by the UK to allow businesses to adapt, with the race now on to finish all border checkpoints. A report for the Portsmouth council cabinet meeting on Tuesday cites NFU statistics showing that 30,000 breeding animals (pigs, sheep and cattle) are exported every year through Portsmouth, with a similar number imported, and without the control posts in the city a reciprocal post will not be built in Cherbourg, the corresponding port in France. This will threaten high-value exports including thoroughbred stud farming. The NFU told the council: “The absence of BCP facilities in the EU-facing port [Cherbourg] will mean that UK farmers are unable to export high-value breeding material to the EU.” The report says the government’s infrastructure fund was “substantially oversubscribed” and after a “deep-dive meeting with consultants and Cabinet Office officials, all bids were cut”, including contingencies from 40% to 10%. Sellers said the “great irony” was that Portsmouth was considered important enough to the nation to be a Brexit contingency route for medicine supplies by the Department for Transport, but not good enough for normal business by the Cabinet Office. The government said the breeding sector was not wholly dependent on Portsmouth. It said infrastructure would normally be funded by the ports themselves and Portsmouth had received £17m from the fund. “A number of border control posts will be designated for live animal imports including Dover, Sevington (Eurotunnel) and Holyhead, which are the ports with the highest volumes of animal imports from the EU,” said a government spokesman. • This article was amended on 2 February 2021. Dover is not privately owned as stated in an earlier version, it is a trust port."
2021-02-01T19:35:38Z,politics,Politics,Former chancellor George Osborne to become full-time banker,"George Osborne, the former chancellor who orchestrated the austerity drive after the financial crisis, is dropping his portfolio career to become a full-time banker. Osborne announced on Monday that he is giving up nearly all his current jobs to become a partner at the investment bank Robey Warshaw. The former Conservative MP is currently editor-in-chief of the Evening Standard and the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. He is also paid £650,000 a year for working one day a week as an adviser to the fund manager Black Rock. It is unclear how much Osborne will be paid at Robey Warshaw, which has advised on some of the largest UK takeovers since it launched in 2013. However, filings at Companies House show that the highest paid partner at Robey Warshaw collected £10m in 2020 and £27.8m in 2019. Sir Simon Robey, a former Morgan Stanley banker, is understood to be the majority-partner who has earned at least £137m since founding the boutique investment bank. Osborne, 49, will join Robey and the other founding partners Simon Warshaw and Philip Apostolides. The Mayfair-based bank, which employs 13 people, made a profit of £17.9m last year. That was a 63% decline on 2019 profits of £48.4m, which works out at £3.7m per employee. Robey Warshaw said in its latest accounts that it paid no tax last year. “The partnership is not liable for any tax due on the profits for the year. It is therefore the responsibility of the individual members to settle any liability arising from their share of partnership profits,” the bank said in its Companies House filing. In a quote given to the Financial Times, Osborne said: “Robey Warshaw is the best of the best, advising great businesses on how to grow, and I’m proud to be joining this first-rate team.” The bank, which operates from offices on Grosvenor Square, said: “We believe that George will significantly enhance the advice we give to clients. He brings differentiated experience and expertise to our team from his leading roles in global finance over the past decade.” Charles Yardley, chief executive of the Evening Standard, said Osborne would be leaving his position as the paper’s editor-in-chief in March. “We thank him for everything he has helped the Evening Standard achieve over the last four years … We wish him well in his new role.” Responding to Osborne’s appointment, the former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “The revolving door between Tory government and the City has always been extremely lucrative. This latest example is a timely reminder that finance and the City have had a profitable pandemic.” The Labour MP Jon Trickett said: “It’s an unhealthy development that you can be chancellor of the exchequer, in charge of the banks one day trying to put right what the bankers did wrong, and then later in your career you’re working as a full-time banker. It shouldn’t happen.” Osborne role is expected to involve helping the bank’s clients, including British Gas owner Centrica, Vodafone and BP, as well as using his connections to drum up fresh business. The bank recently advised the London Stock Exchange Group on its $27bn (£19.8bn) purchase of Refinitiv, a data provider, from the private equity group Blackstone. Warshaw was previously a lead banker at UBS, while Apostolides used to work at Morgan Stanley with Robey. Osborne had built up a portfolio of nine jobs since leaving government in 2016, ranging from newspaper editing, fund management, teaching and advising the government on levelling up the north of England. He was appointed editor of the Evening Standard in 2017, but stepped aside to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper last summer. Osborne was succeeded at the title, which is owned by the Russian multimillionaire Evgeny Lebedev, by Emily Sheffield, a former deputy editor at Vogue. Sheffield’s sister Samantha is married to the former prime minister David Cameron, who along with Osborne oversaw the cuts in public spending during the coalition government of 2010-2015. Osborne will remain chair of the advisory board of Exor, which manages the Italian Agnelli family’s interest in Juventus and Ferrari. Osborne extended his property empire last year by buying a £1.6m five-bedroom Grade II-listed Georgian home in Bruton, a town in Somerset that has become popular with wealthy Londoners looking for a second home in the country."
2021-02-01T19:05:20Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Hancock says 'we need to come down hard' on South African variant after 105 cases identified - as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has confirmed that intensified testing is being deployed in eight postcode areas in England in a bid to stamp out the South African variant of coronavirus. He said 105 cases have been identified in the country, of which 11 have no link to international travel. These are particularly worrying because they suggest that this variant - which, like the Kent variant, seems more transmissible than the original - is now spreading generally through the community. Hancock said that â€œwe need to come down on it hardâ€�. He said there was no evidence that it was more deadly than the original version of coronavirus. But in practice a variant that spreads more easily does pose a greater threat, and, although the current vaccines that are available are effective against it, they do not seem to counter it quite as forcefully as they do the original version and the Kent variant now dominant in the UK. (See 3.25pm.) This is from my colleague Nicola Davis on the South African variant.
Hancock has said that more than half of people in their 70s have now been vaccinated. Speaking at the No 10 press conference he said in his opening statement: Iâ€™m so proud of the team, whoâ€™ve now vaccinated 9.2 million people across the UK, that includes 931,204 vaccinations just this weekend. And to put that into context â€“ thatâ€™s one in every 60 adults in the whole United Kingdom vaccinated in one single weekend. Itâ€™s a mammoth effort ... Weâ€™ve now vaccinated almost nine in 10 of all over 80s in the UK and now, as of today, weâ€™ve vaccinated over half of all people in their 70s. And, Iâ€™m delighted that I can tell you weâ€™ve visited every eligible care home with older residents in England, and offered vaccinations to all their residents and staff. But about half of staff at the UKâ€™s largest care home provider have not yet received a Covid vaccine, it has emerged. Boris Johnson has suggested that England will not return to a localised tier system of restrictions as Covid-19 infections and hospital admissions slow, saying the infectiousness of the new variant had made the system less workable. Britain has taken â€œa lot of risksâ€� in rolling out its speedy Covid vaccination programme, Franceâ€™s Europe minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said as officials in Brussels claimed the EU had â€œnothing to envyâ€� from nations such as the UK, the US and Israel. Ryanair has warned it is heading for an annual loss of nearly â‚¬1bn (Â£880m) as the budget airline struggles through the â€œmost challengingâ€™â€� year in its 35-year history. Labour has said it is â€œextraordinaryâ€� that millions of people could potentially still be living in homes clad in dangerously flammable material, as the party launched a parliamentary push for the government to take steps to help those affected. Downing Street has defended Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, after she publicly called a journalist â€œcreepy and bizarreâ€� for asking questions about a Covid vaccines video. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-02-01T14:43:42Z,politics,Politics,No 10 defends minister who criticised HuffPost journalist on Twitter,"Downing Street has defended a government minister who publicly called a journalist “creepy and bizarre” for asking questions about a Covid vaccines video. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, accused the HuffPost journalist in a Twitter thread of “making up claims” and published screenshots of questions sent to her MP’s office and to a ministerial press office, naming the reporter, Nadine White, who then received a torrent of abuse, according to HuffPost. In her posts Badenoch said it was “creepy and bizarre to fixate on who didn’t participate in a video and demand they explain themselves”. Quizzed over Badenoch’s actions, Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson’s press secretary, said Badenoch had “been civil to Nadine White”. Stratton was unable to guarantee that other journalists who send routine emails to departments would not see them publicised via Twitter, saying only that Downing Street did not object to media questions. “You know you can always come to Downing Street and we will treat your questions and your challenges, as we are doing now, as fair, and we will always try to get back to you, and give you decent answers.” White’s emails had asked why Badenoch did not appear in the video campaign intended to encourage the take-up of the coronavirus vaccine among black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. HuffPost had not published a story connected to the questions before Badenoch tweeted to say it was because she was involved in a vaccine trial herself. Stratton added: “She felt that questions about why she wasn’t in the video were not right when she was not in the video because she was taking part in a trial. This is a case of a misunderstanding between the two parties.” Asked why Badenoch responded by publicising the journalist’s name and questions, Stratton said: “You’ll have to get comment from Kemi herself in terms of Kemi’s motive.” Saying she had not talked to Johnson about the incident, Stratton appeared to defend Badenoch’s description of White’s actions as “creepy and bizarre”, saying: “I would go to the Cabinet Office and talk to Kemi Badenoch’s team. I believe that Kemi feels that she has grounds for those words.”"
2021-02-01T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,UK government use of Henry VIII clauses to be challenged in court,"A government move to change state aid rules after Brexit without a vote in parliament is being challenged in court, with a legal campaign group warning the manoeuvre could lead to a similar lack of scrutiny in areas such as workers’ rights and environmental protections. The Good Law Project is seeking a judicial review of the decision to use so-called Henry VIII powers to get rid of EU rules on state aid, which were incorporated into UK legislation after Brexit. The powers, named after the 1539 law which allowed Henry VIII to rule by decree, permit ministers to amend or repeal laws without full scrutiny from parliament using so-called secondary legislation, primarily via something called a statutory instrument. These are normally used to tweak laws because of changing circumstances or gaps, and generally come into force without any parliamentary scrutiny or vote, unless this is specifically sought by MPs or peers. The Good Law Project is challenging the decision of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over its move, under the Brexit withdrawal act, to remove EU state aid rules from British law using a statutory instrument. The legal argument seeking judicial review, seen by the Guardian, argues that the relevant part of the withdrawal act only allows the Henry VIII powers to be used for specific and limited purposes, adding: “It does not permit wide-ranging policy change, including the wholesale abolition of retained EU law.” The 23-page argument says this lack of parliamentary scrutiny “raises an important issue of constitutional law”. The Good Law Project has warned that without proper limiting of the use of such powers, then other EU rules in areas such as employment rights or environmental protections could be removed from UK law without MPs getting a say or a vote. Jolyon Maugham, the barrister who leads the project, said: “Ministers can now rewrite the rules on everything from your rights at work to environmental protections. “It is no exaggeration to state that any area of law previously touched on by the EU is now within the purview of government. Government is wresting power from parliament and giving it carte blanche to ministers to remake almost every aspect of national life.” BEIS is set to oppose the process. In a response to an initial letter notifying the government of the planned legal action, the government legal department said it believed the powers had been used correctly, and that the legal challenge “does not have a realistic prospect of success”. A BEIS spokesperson said the department could not comment on an ongoing legal process, adding: “There will be no reduction in workers’ rights and the new business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] has reiterated this multiple times.”"
2021-01-31T15:04:12Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer urged to back radical constitutional reform for UK,"Keir Starmer has been urged to support radical reforms to devolve power in the UK, including a federal parliament, a written constitution and significant new authority for England’s regions under plans initially drawn up for Jeremy Corbyn. A lengthy report commissioned by Corbyn recommends reorganising the UK as a federal state, overseen by a new “council of the union” and replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate, alongside substantial new financial and policy powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Senior figures within Labour, including Gordon Brown, centrists close to Starmer, and Corbyn allies such as the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell believe that Brexit, the impact of the Covid crisis on English regions and growing anger over underinvestment in the north of England have fuelled a stronger appetite for significant reform and are urging the Labour leader to support the plans. Some of the report’s recommendations echo proposals being floated by Brown, the former prime minister, who is advising Starmer on setting up a new constitutional commission due to be launched by Labour in early spring. “There’s a ferment going on at the moment,” McDonnell told the Guardian. “There’s a challenge to the way the British state is constitutionally organised coming from so many fronts.” Labour feels under pressure to propose ambitious new powers for Scotland to counter demands for a second independence referendum, which are intensifying in the run-up to May’s Holyrood elections. The 234-page report for Corbyn, overseen by the Labour peer Pauline Bryan, called Remaking the British State, proposes: A UK-wide constitutional convention bolstered by citizens’ assemblies to investigate options for reform. A written constitution that would greatly reduce the monarch’s powers. Replacing the Lords with a federal senate of the nations and English regions, able to veto some legislation and ratify international treaties. Giving the Scottish parliament, Welsh Senedd and Northern Irish executive permanent constitutional independence. More borrowing and policymaking powers for Holyrood, including over postgraduate immigration, alcohol taxation, drugs policy and social security. Significant devolution of policymaking and financial powers to English regions and councils, including borrowing. Starmer was due to launch Labour’s constitutional commission in January but that timetable was disrupted by the sudden resignation of Richard Leonard as Scottish Labour leader. His departure triggered a leadership contest that will finish in late February. The commission is expected to be launched soon after the new Scottish leader takes over; it is understood Brown wants it to be driven by citizens’ assemblies across the UK, tasked with tabling specific proposals for reform. In an article for the Guardian, Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson and favourite to win the party’s leadership contest, agreed with the authors of the paper that new powers to control drugs misuse and Scotland-specific immigration rules should be considered. Senior Tories, led by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, are considering an official review of the UK’s governance, driven partly by the surge in support for independence in Scotland and the political crises in northern England exposed by the Covid crisis. For the Tories, much hinges on whether the Scottish National party (SNP) wins a Holyrood majority in May. There are reports one option includes a royal commission on the UK’s post-Brexit structures and the constitution. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has already mooted new powers for Holyrood. In Wales, Mark Drakeford, the first minister, endorsed a pamphlet by Welsh Labour members in mid-January calling for federalism “based on the simple but profoundly radical proposition that the UK is a voluntary association of four nations, where sovereignty is dispersed amongst four democratically elected legislatures”. The pressure within Labour to respond to the SNP’s surge in popularity has again led to a split over its stance on a second referendum between the two rivals in the Scottish leadership contest.
Monica Lennon, a leftwinger backed by many Corbyn supporters, has called for Labour to accept Nicola Sturgeon will have a mandate to stage a referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May, but argues Labour should campaign for a third option, of maximum devolution, to be included. In his article for the Guardian, Sarwar rejected that strategy, arguing it was “deeply irresponsible” to consider staging a referendum during a pandemic and an economic crisis. Sarwar reopened a conflict with McDonnell by revealing he would ask Starmer to guarantee Scottish Labour had control over its policies on the constitution if he became Scottish leader, attacking the former shadow chancellor’s decision in August 2019 to “unilaterally” announce Labour was open to a second independence vote. McDonnell told the Guardian he believed that was “the right thing to say at the time”. He backed Lennon’s call for a third option if a referendum were held, saying: “We’ve got to stimulate the debate in a way in which people can really engage and feel that they can contribute, and they’re part of the decision-making process.”"
2021-01-31T12:01:36Z,politics,Politics,"Road freight between Britain and EU is down by a third, data shows","Road freight between Britain and the EU is down by more than a third year on year, data shows. Figures from Transporeon, an EU logistics data platform, suggest that the volume of goods moving between Great Britain and the EU was 38% lower in the third week of 2021 compared with the same week in 2020. The data also shows that hauliers are increasingly refusing to take loads to Britain as increased border controls caused by Brexit and coronavirus checks make those journeys less profitable. The rejection rate for loads destined for Great Britain from France was more than twice the average for the third quarter of 2020.
Transporeon’s CEO, Stephan Sieber, said “rejection rates are on the rise again and higher than normal and, on some lanes, every fifth contract load got rejected” last week. Hauliers are also charging more to take goods from mainland Europe to Great Britain. The spot rate for haulage from France to Britain in the third week of 2021 was 51% higher than the average for Q3 last year.
Sieber said that while his company’s data was focused on hauliers travelling to the UK, “there is evidence that the opposite direction is also facing significant challenges. We observe very high rejection rates from Great Britain to Germany and France. “This supports the anecdotal evidence of unprepared shippers, maxed-out bank guarantees for transit documents, and carriers preferring to go back to the continent empty.” The UK’s Road Haulage Association said “between 40 to 50% of trucks going back to the EU through the Dover short straits crossing are carrying nothing but fresh air – normally that level would be 15 to 18%”. The latest data on sea freight confirmed the picture painted by hauliers. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that visits by cargo and tanker ships in the third week of January were also lower than the same time last year, by about 20%."
2021-01-31T12:00:36Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit 'teething problems' endemic and could ruin us, say UK businesses","It was billed as a deal that would secure tariff-free access to the EU, that “sunlit uplands” would follow initial disruption to trade. But one month since the Brexit trade deal came into force, businesses are warning that the “teething problems” Boris Johnson described in a visit to Scotland last week are in fact symptomatic of endemic disruption that will force many businesses to restructure and will mean the end of some British businesses altogether. “The last month has been like Dante’s fifth circle of hell” for importers and exporters unable to move supplies because of new red tape, said Ben Fletcher, the policy director of Make UK, which represents manufacturers across the UK. One internationally renowned car manufacturer had “1,000 cars sitting in their car park partially built because they could not get the parts in time,” said Fletcher. “They said this has never happened ever before.” A survey by Make UK of its members shows that 60% of companies that said there were ready for Brexit “now experience disruption” and are “also finding supply chains significantly impacted. “There is real anger and incredible frustration for people who either import or export that they are simply not able to move stuff. It is just incredibly difficult to get the paperwork right and there have been very low levels of support from government,” he added.
He was commenting as the Cabinet Office said the flow of cross-channel freight was much better than anticipated with just “2-3%” trucks turned away for not having the paperwork or Covid tests required, and no expectation now that the worst-case scenario it had modelled of 7,000 trucks queuing in Kent would be realised. But Shane Brennan, the chief executive of Cold Chain Federation, said traffic volumes were still down because of Brexit stockpiling. Warehouses were 85% full, down from 100% before Christmas, but still above the 60% usually seen in January. He urged the government to “stop using the lack of traffic on Kent roads as a metric of the success of Brexit and realise that the real test is ease of trading”. French authorities told government officials that “around 50%” of lorries crossing the channel were empty. One logistics company in Europe reports that some of its customers including one large car firm, was paying for trucks to return to the EU without cargo to ensure they were not delayed at the frontier and would therefore have time for a second or third delivery back to the UK each week. The biggest hit to business is the new rules of origin requirement, which will have a permanent impact on trade. Previously, Brexit goods coming from the EU did not need to be certified as made in Britain or made in the EU to be sold freely within the single market. But since January the provenance of all goods must be documented. A circuit board from Korea in a gadget assembled in Germany, metal from China in a bicycle made in Italy or textile from Morocco in a shirt made in Portugal could mean the difference between no tariff and a tariff that can range from 6.5% duty on plastics to 1.7% on vacuum cleaners, 12% on coats and 14% on bicycles. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) says the issue has been compounded by a lack of notice and sheer lack of experience of customs officials on both sides of the border. “One port requires every document to be individually stamped. Another wants one stamp on a dozen pages fanned out and is turning people away if they haven’t done it that way,” said Dominic Goudie, its head of international policy. FDF says some fresh food exporters are facing an existential threat. Cross-channel deliveries that used to take “a couple of days are now taking five days”, killing the shelf life of produce such as British sausage, said Goudie. “They may have to sell frozen sausages in future but the question is: will people want to buy frozen sausages?” said Goudie. Make UK says even large businesses that spent two years preparing have been scuppered by rules of origin. They complain their EU suppliers were “unprepared” for Brexit and have not been able to supply an audit trail for all goods. Large exporters had some idea of what they were facing come 1 January, but they did not have the detail until the 1,400-page deal was published on 26 December. One factory in the automotive supply chain told Fletcher it could take it “two months” just to get the rules of origin data from suppliers. “People are starting to realise how hard it will be to build rules of origin into the existing trading rules. These are teething problems, but they are moving towards a structural problem,” added Fletcher. The Federation of Small Businesses boss, Mike Cherry, called on the government to issue “direct funding in the form of transition vouchers to aid operational adjustments”, and raised concerns about courier companies that have stopped taking goods from small suppliers that need health certificates. There are also industry concerns that the scale of the problems have yet to manifest themselves completely because of stockpiling. “Nobody can be ready for a change of this magnitude. There needs to be a dynamic and continuous conversation on easements and simplifications. The trade deal is like the green base of Lego that you put additional bricks on,” said Adam Marshall, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) director general. The Cabinet Office said Michael Gove had met trade representatives on Thursday and vowed to “pull out all the stops” to help business with weekly meetings of a new Brexit taskforce. It claimed that “overall businesses have adapted well to the changes” with the latest data showing less than 5% trucks were being turned away from Dover and other ports because of absence of the correct paperwork or of Covid test results. “We have got to get past Brexit as crisis management. This is our way of trading for the next 50 years. It’s permanent. This is Brexit,” said Brennan. The BCC has called on the UK and EU leaders to resume talks to help businesses on both sides of the channel struggling with the biggest disruption to trade since the single market was formed in 1993. • This article was amended on 1 February 2021. The 1,400-page Brexit trade deal was published on 26 December, not 26 January as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-31T12:00:36Z,politics,Politics,Eight days for carrots to get to Belfast with complex Brexit checks,"It is day eight in a depot in Lymm just outside Warrington, Cheshire and a lorry carrying frozen carrots and mixed herbs is still waiting for clearance to board a ferry from Birkenhead to Belfast. Six separate customers, supermarkets and corner stores have other consignments on truck, all stuck in Lymm because the paperwork for a single pallet of carrots is missing key information. Hundreds of miles away in Lisburn in Northern Ireland, the haulage firm’s operations team have had no luck in persuading the British supplier that the carrots that were ordered on 27 December are now, in the third week in January, classed as an export and must be accompanied by a litany of documents and certificates before the trailer can be cleared to board the ferry at Birkenhead.
Another supplier on the lorry had been struggling with the documentation requiring it to supply what is known as an “inco term”, which determines who pays the duty in any tariff but also establishes a specific record as to who is the importer. But that was resolved on day seven. Then there was also the supplier who had provided a commodity code that was two digits short. A simple key stroke mistake could be difference between the lorry getting the red or the green light for entry to NI. “It took half a day yesterday for me to clear the supply chain. I’ve got one more issue to go,” says the visibly stressed operations man simultaneously dealing with a sheaf of about 30 documents for another order of mixed fish stuck in England. “It’s absolutely criminal what has been allowed to happen between these two islands that have traded with each other for so long,” says Peter Summerton, managing director of McCulla Refrigerated Transport, one of Northern Ireland’s biggest frozen and chilled food specialist haulage firms. Half a day at his yard and offices is to lift the lid on the complexities Brexit and checks down the Irish Sea have brought to many businesses in Northern Ireland. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, which was designed to obviate the need for infrastructure on the Irish border, all goods passing from GB to NI are subject to the EU customs code with sanitary and phyto sanitary (SPS) checks applied to 100% of food entering the region. But Summerton says: “The only thing the Northern Ireland protocol (NIP) protects is the single market.” Such is the dizzying array of new data that suppliers need to provide for transport across the Irish Sea that McCulla has devised its own “triage” crib sheet with a team of six new staff taking customers through a check list of 39 data fields to ensure flow of goods across the Irish Sea. Another 14 staff have been taken on to help with customs.
“Remember we are a haulage company,” says Summerton repeatedly as he talks of the regular spanners he has to remove from the haulage works. Out in the yard the issues he faces are plain to see. As drivers fill trailers with a vast array of pallets carrying everything from meatballs to vegan ready meals and halloumi cheese for supermarkets shelves, a Dutch driver rolls in with a delivery of frozen chicken. Martel Ten Dam left the Hook of Holland the day before, drove across England to Holyhead and cleared Dublin port “in five minutes” dropping off in Dundalk, Newry and Belfast before reaching McCulla’s in Lisburn. “He’s allowed in just like that because he has come from the EU to the EU, but we can’t get goods in from GB,” says Summerton. Overnight the company has been forced to turn itself into to “a data cleaning centre” as it cajoles and sometimes rows with customers to convince them of the new data they have to provide for goods going to NI. With a population of just 1.9 million, supplies are always going to be sent in mixed loads, or groupage, meaning entire lorry loads are at risk if one supplier gets one item wrong. Back at the new “customs” office Summerton has set up to deal with the protocol, the operations team have decided if they can’t get the last bit of data for the carrots the only option will be return them to the supplier, freeing the lorry to continue its journey to Belfast.
For McCulla, Brexit has been a double whammy with the Holyhead-Dublin port-Northern Ireland route also now snarled by the red tape facing all GB loads. Summerton has two lorries delayed in Dublin because of the words “drumsticks” and “eggs” appeared in the paperwork. They were given the all clear after it was clarified that the drumsticks were not chicken but Swizzels sweets and the eggs were Cadbury’s Creme Eggs. Last Wednesday Summerton spent the day before in Dublin port to see the procedures for himself with a high street supermarket boss trying to get five lorries containing dairy and other chilled and frozen food released from the port. It took from 11am to 8pm to sort it out. “I cannot be critical of anything in Dublin port. They went out of their way to help” he said, “but each conversation took about 45 minutes and you don’t get that on a helpline.” In a further complication for NI hauliers, those using Dublin port for access to Britain must also supply new paperwork for exporting, reducing the flexibility on ferry options needed for time or weather reasons. “If Ireland and the EU and the UK were serious about Northern Ireland having unfettered access to GB, then we need the same access through Dublin as through Belfast, Larne or Warrenpoint,” he says. One solution could be an “authorised drive-through point somewhere en route to Dublin on the Northern Ireland side where British officials could seal lorries certifying they were on “domestic” journeys via Dublin, he believes. Summerton is campaigning for the complexity of checks to be simplified and new easing measures have been promised by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, in the coming days. The Cabinet Office said on Sunday night new guidance has now been issued to hauliers. But Summerton has taken some flak locally after he got involved with a briefing for the European Research Group and the shadow cabinet two weeks ago. He defends his right to seek further easements in the application of the protocol. “We are in logistics, not politics,” he says. He argues the government promised to avoid “disruption to lives and livelihoods in Northern Ireland” in its command paper in December yet, along with the EU, imposed import checks designed for the likes of China without even stress testing them. “They have transposed deep water sea container regulations on a just in time supply chain,” he says. “This is how Poland relates to Russia. This is not how Scotland should relate to Northern Ireland.”"
2021-01-31T07:00:31Z,politics,Politics,"A year after Johnson’s swaggering Greenwich speech, 100,000 dead","It was announced last week, to nobody’s excitement, that Sir Kenneth Branagh will take the role of Boris Johnson in a Sky TV drama about the first weeks of the pandemic. If Branagh’s casting indicates that this is to be conceived as a Shakespearean tragedy, with Johnson in the lead, then it would seem doomed from the start. The classic tragic hero has just a single fatal character flaw that proves his undoing. With Johnson, where do you start? As an opening scene in that drama, it will, anyhow, be hard to beat the speech that the prime minister gave almost exactly a year ago – perhaps the last moment in which he fondly imagined that all the world lay before him. The speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Christopher Wren’s Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich on 3 February 2020, set out his vision for a buccaneering global Britain, high on union flags and free trade. Johnson had not long returned from his post-election beach frolics in Mustique with Carrie Symonds. Brexit had finally been “done” in Parliament Square three nights earlier. No opposition troubled his horizon. Labour was leaderless; Farage pointless. Even Michael Gove, his limp-daggered Brutus, had been co-opted to the cause.
As he barrelled on to the stage at Greenwich therefore, ruffling his hair, shuffling his notes, his first act was to ask his carefully selected business audience – strictly no Remainer “gloomsters and doomsters” allowed – to raise their eyes to the vaulted ceiling and survey the mural above their heads. Sir James Thornhill’s baroque masterpiece, The Triumph of Liberty and Peace over Tyranny, depicted William III and Mary II enthroned after their own “Glorious Revolution” and surrounded, in Johnson’s eyes, by “well-fed nymphs and cupids and what have you”. This, said Johnson, sledgehammering the symbolism, marked “the settlement of a long and divisive political question about who gets to sit on the throne”. It was a moment of “supreme national self-confidence”, he suggested, with the UK “on the slipway” of global economic dominance. “Today, if we get it right, this can be another such moment.” Hubris works in mysterious ways. That speech will be remembered not, as Johnson hoped, for its rhetoric about unleashed British swagger, but for the fact that in the midst of it, in a throwaway phrase, there lurked the seed of all of his – and our – locked-down nightmares of the past year. In the days leading up to the Greenwich speech, Johnson had been pointedly silent on the virus that had by then escaped from Wuhan. A full month after it had been identified by the Chinese authorities, the Greenwich speech marked the first time the name of the disease officially passed his lips. Inevitably, it was employed not as a cautionary note, but as an irritating niggle to his vision of swash and buckle: “Global growth is itself anaemic and the decline in global poverty is beginning to slow,” Johnson said. “When [trade] barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational, to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government, somewhere, that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange.” There was to be no doubt which government would stand stubbornly oblivious to the risks of the virus, ignore the panic, and keep the market economy open at all costs. Britain, the prime minister cried, was “ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles, leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion” of economic freedom in any stand-off with public health restriction.
We have heard from the interchangeable cast of fawning ministers in the past week that “nobody could have worked harder” than Johnson in tackling the pandemic. But when historians – those pesky professional Captain Hindsights – come to lay out the evidence, they will find plenty that disagrees with that fantasy, starting with the Greenwich speech. The second excuse that Johnson’s courtiers have been told to peddle is that no one could have predicted any of what was to come. That is also not exactly true. The week before Johnson’s free-trade speech a report in The Lancet had assessed the lethal potential of the virus, and suggested it was comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people. The concern was not confined to the experts. It is notable that on the Saturday before Johnson’s speech, the Daily Mail had devoted its front page not to the triumphalism of the previous night’s Brexit celebrations, for which it had so stridently campaigned, but to the threat to the UK posed by Covid-19: “How many more UK victims of virus?”. Johnson’s own former employer, the Daily Telegraph, counselled on 1 February that Britain must be prepared for the worst. “Pessimists might point out that the mortality for the new virus is considerably higher than for swine flu. When swine flu broke out in 2009, the NHS also had spare capacity, having enjoyed a decade of real-terms investment increases. Today, there is already a shortage of beds…” On the Thursday before Johnson’s set-piece in Greenwich, the World Health Organization had informed every nation that the virus had its highest risk rating – equivalent to that of Ebola and Sars – with 7,818 cases confirmed globally, in 19 countries. In response, on 31 January, even Donald Trump had restricted incoming flights from China. Johnson not only viewed the virus as a line in a Superman gag, but as an opportunity to prove that he was prepared for Britain to go it alone against the po-faced experts, keep the airports open with minimal screening and quarantine, not play by their rules. To prove the point, by the time of the Greenwich speech, he had already skipped the two Cobra meetings devoted to planning for any potential pandemic, leaving them to be chaired by the already hapless Matt Hancock. Over the course of the following weeks, he neglected to attend three more. Ten days after the Greenwich speech, he retreated to his grace-and-favour country retreat at Chevening for a fortnight, partly to finalise the terms of his divorce from Marina Wheeler, not long recovered from cancer, and to let his grown-up children in on the fact that he and Symonds were expecting a baby and had been secretly engaged. His aides were reportedly told to “keep briefing papers short” if they expected them to be read. It was almost March by the time Johnson re-emerged to stage-manage news of the pregnancy for the press.
It was in this context that he sat on breakfast-time sofas and vaguely floated the notion of herd immunity, before dismissing the tempting idea of “taking the virus on the chin”. On 3 March, the clear advice from Sage was that the government should “warn against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging”. Johnson, infamously, went out that day and told reporters: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.” Johnson spent late March in isolation, along with most of his cabinet, and early April in intensive care. It has been claimed that those days in hospital changed Johnson from the John Bull-ish character he had presented at Greenwich into a more chastened figure; there is not much in his subsequent rhetoric – of world-beating this and moonshot that, and briefings that he was “battling the experts to save Christmas” – to support that idea. As he has toured the country for photo opportunities in hard hats and lab coats, it is hard to shake the belief that he still sees leadership as he saw it when he stared up at Thornhill’s ceiling – as a kind of costume drama in which he gets to star, a prep-school performance of 1066 and all that. He might have been advised to pay closer attention to the “well-fed nymphs” that he waved a hand at in Greenwich. They were not, as he seemed to envision them, decorative elements of classical totty, but depictions of the four virtues that enabled good governance: prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude. As the death toll last week passed the 100,000 predicted a year ago, we were invited by the government’s favoured newspapers to see Johnson as a “deeply sorry” head-bowed figure, in screen grabs of him reading from his notes. But whatever those headlines or Kenneth Branagh’s forthcoming depiction imagine, we should always keep in mind that this is not the prime minister’s tragedy, it’s the tragedy of the families of the 105,000 who have died, of the key workers who have risked their lives day after day, the millions who have seen jobs and plans and businesses capsized. We have all been cast as walk-ons in a drama which, from the very beginning, was partly, but fundamentally, of Johnson’s making – and one which will only properly end when he and his hammy troupe of chancers finally exit, stage right, no doubt still loudly pronouncing that nobody could have done more to keep us safe. Seven lessons learned Randomised trials are lifesavers Dexamethasone is a cheap steroid drug that has saved the lives of 650,000 severely ill Covid patients. Its effectiveness was revealed through the UK Recovery study, which compared treatments with usual NHS care alone in randomised trials. “Clinicians come up with all sorts of hypotheses about drugs,” says Martin Landray, joint founder of Recovery. “But you’ve got to test these hypotheses. For that you need large, randomised trials.” New diseases are a constant threat Covid-19 has again demonstrated that wild-animal trading, where species are mixed together in appalling, stressful circumstances, promotes disease transmission between species – and on to humans. “Unless we control long-distance trading in live animals, new diseases will appear again and again. That is a key lesson from this pandemic,” says James Wood, professor of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University. Genomic surveys are crucial Britain has played a key role in tracking the progress of Covid-19 across the globe, thanks to its prowess in gene-sequencing. “UK laboratories have carried out 48% of all the world’s genome sequencing of Covid-19,” says Professor Sir Mark Caulfield, of Genomics England. “That has been invaluable in pinpointing new strains and underlines the need for a global genomics network to track and beat this disease. That would be a lifeline.” People will accept inconvenience “Stay at home and protect the NHS” was a strong government message that the public accepted. Shops closed, car travel dropped by two thirds, while people provided food for the hungry and clapped for carers. “That trust was undermined by Dominic Cummings’s trip to Durham,” says psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King’s College London. “Yet most people still followed the rules because they knew they were for a good cause.” A fast response is critical A year ago the WHO warned the new disease represented a public health emergency. Australia, above, was one of the few countries to react quickly. “Crucially, those with past experience of coronaviruses like Sars did react and now look to be in a stronger position,” says Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Discovering a new virus’s characteristics and having a clear strategy will be crucial in avoiding another pandemic.” The NHS must be properly funded Years of cuts to public health services left Britain ill-prepared for Covid-19 and were critical in allowing death rates to soar. “As the UK emerges from the pandemic it would be a tragic mistake to attempt to re-establish a status quo that was marked in England by a stagnation of health improvement that was the second-worst in Europe,” states a review led by Sir Michael Marmot of University College London. mRNA technology is here to stay Messenger RNA is used by our cells to direct protein manufacture. By learning how to hijack that process, Pfizer and Moderna made vaccines in record time. “We had been hearing about mRNA’s promise for years and suddenly it arrived,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “This could be a game changer not just for vaccines but cancer care.” Robin McKie"
2021-01-31T06:00:29Z,politics,Politics,Success of vaccine rollout pushes Tories ahead of Labour in the polls,"The Conservatives have regained the lead against Labour in the latest Opinium poll for the Observer after a week in which the total number of deaths from Covid-19 passed 100,000. The figures – showing the Tories on 41%, up four percentage points compared with two weeks ago, and Labour down three points on 38% – are a blow to Labour and will raise questions about whether the party’s progress has stalled under Keir Starmer. With the country in its third lockdown and the death toll passing such a grim milestone, Labour MPs and activists would have hoped to be surging ahead of Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. Instead it appears that Labour has hit a wall, and that Boris Johnson and the Conservatives may be beginning to gain a “vaccine dividend” as the inoculation programme gathers pace and hopes rise of an end to the period of restrictions.
In a further boost to Tory morale, Johnson has narrowly returned to the lead when voters are asked who would be the best prime minister. Some 33% now select Johnson (up three points) while 29% think Keir Starmer would make the best PM (down three). In the poll the Liberal Democrats are on 7%, the SNP 5% and Plaid Cymru on 4%. In the initial stages of the pandemic in early spring last year Johnson and the Tories pulled way ahead of Labour as the country rallied behind the government in a time of crisis. But after the Tory lead over Labour peaked at 26 points in late March, Labour gradually clawed its way back after Starmer replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader last April and Johnson and his ministers appeared to blunder in the fight to control Covid-19. By August the two main parties were neck and neck. Since then the lead has changed regularly between the two parties. While voters are still critical of the government’s overall response to the pandemic – 68% say Johnson and his ministers should have done more to stop the spread of coronavirus – the public’s view of how they have handled the vaccine rollout is far more favourable. Net approval of the government’s vaccine programme has shot up in the past fortnight: 60% now approve of its vaccine handling (up from 47% a fortnight ago), while only 15% disapprove (compared with 23% in our last poll). This raises the government’s net approval rating on the vaccine up from +24% to +45% in two weeks. Some 82% of those polled said they would take the vaccine if they were offered one, while 12% would not. Just over half (54%) backed including teachers on a list of priority occupations for the vaccine. The poll was conducted mostly before news of the row with the European Union over the supply of vaccines broke."
2021-01-30T15:20:51Z,politics,Politics,UK firms plan to shift across Channel after Brexit chaos,"Hundreds of UK companies could switch operations to countries inside the EU in what is threatening to become a dramatic exodus of investment and jobs caused by Brexit. The Observer can reveal that by 1 January this year some 500 businesses – mostly UK-owned, or UK-based with overseas owners – were already making inquiries about setting up branches, depots or warehouses in the Netherlands alone, for “Brexit-related reasons”. Since then the number of inquiries from UK companies has increased further. If companies switch all or parts of their operations to Europe it will mean the loss of jobs, economic activity and tax revenue at home. The figures have been compiled by government unit the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which said that while most of the firms were already based in the UK, a minority were new companies from the US and Asia which had investigated a UK move, but had decided against investing here because of Brexit. Lyne Biewinga, of the Netherlands British Chamber of Commerce, said she and her team had been working “night and day” on inquiries from UK companies in recent weeks. Meanwhile, in an interview with this newspaper, Austria’s economic affairs minister, Margarete Schramböck, said inquiries from UK companies about moving to her country – which had been high for several years – had increased threefold since 1 January. In 2019 and 2020, 50 UK-owned or UK-based firms established operations in Austria, according to the Austrian Business Agency. Twenty more had made inquiries in the last few weeks, when the UK left the single market and customs union for good. “We have a lot of companies approaching us to come to Austria. From the UK it is three times higher than before,” said Schramböck. “It is all different kind of companies. It is IT companies, companies interested in R&D who are searching for a location in the EU. We have a special programme to help them and that is good for us. It had already started prior to Brexit but it has increased since Brexit, especially for small- and medium-sized companies. “It is because they are not part of the European Union any more and they [now] have barriers. Even if there is a trade agreement they fear that the barriers will hinder them to do business inside the European Union. “It is always good to be close to your customer and in this case the European market is a single market, so if you want to sell to the European market you have to have an imprint there.”
The British Chamber of Commerce’s branch in Brussels said there had also been a number of inquiries from UK firms about setting up in Belgium. A leading UK manufacturer of cheddar cheese, Simon Spurrell, has announced he will be switching £1m of investment to France. Last week the Observer revealed that the Department for International Trade was advising UK businesses worried about the new burden of regulations, customs checks and added costs of transporting goods to the EU, to set up warehouses, depots or entire new operations there. Two managing directors of UK firms told the Observer they were setting up new European companies and would have to sack staff in this country and employ new staff in the EU. By moving back inside the single market, companies with large numbers of customers in the EU can transport goods in bulk, avoiding the charges on individual items that have afflicted couriers this year. They can also avoid the problem of VAT charges hitting their customers. While ministers have tried to dismiss business concerns about the new barriers to trade caused by the UK exit from the single market and customs union, the loss of jobs, investment and tax revenue is fast turning into a full-blown crisis. On Friday the leaders of Britain’s five largest business groups warned the government that firms faced “substantial difficulties” at UK ports since Brexit, with the prospect of a “significant loss of business” if the situation was allowed to continue. Biewinga added: “The number of companies searching for a base in the Netherlands has surged in recent months. We help a lot of companies to set up a separate business in the Netherlands to circumvent border issues and to get around extra charges, paperwork and additional taxes resulting from Brexit. From the Netherlands they can distribute their goods far more freely. “There are many reasons that businesses may choose to go to the Netherlands. The two countries share a 400-year-long trading relationship, are friends, political allies and North Sea neighbours. We are also geographically very close as well as fast digital connections and a good logistical infrastructure with Europe’s largest port, Rotterdam, as well as Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.” The Netherlands – like Austria – is offering a range of financial incentives to UK firms and expat workers. On Friday, in a letter to Conservative party supporters, international trade secretary Liz Truss said Brexit was going well and was a great opportunity to build global Britain. “We have taken back control of our trade to deliver jobs and prosperity across the UK,” she said. “Already seizing vast opportunities across the world with trade deals worth £885bn with 63 countries and the EU already agreed. “Having left the EU our ambitious trade strategy is at the heart of our vision for global Britain and in 2021 we are more than ready to seize our potential on the world stage.” The government said: “We are helping business seize the opportunities open to a fully independent global trading United Kingdom. Businesses across the country have adapted well to the changes to trading with the EU, and trade continues to flow smoothly, with no disruption at UK ports. “We are working closely with industry to get businesses tailored support to tackle any outstanding issues. We have set up export helplines, invested millions in the customs intermediaries market and developed the Brexit checker tool so businesses know exactly what they need to do.”"
2021-01-30T05:00:02Z,politics,Politics,"'Half-pregnant is not a concept': UK should decide who its allies are, says Macron","Emmanuel Macron has warned that Boris Johnson’s government has to decide who its allies are, insisting that “half-pregnant is not a concept”. “What politics does Great Britain wish to choose? It cannot be the best ally of the US, the best ally of the EU and the new Singapore … It has to choose a model,” the French president said, in an interview with the Guardian and a small group of other media. “But I have the impression the country’s leaders have sold all these models [to the people]. If it decides on a completely transatlantic policy then we [the EU] will need clarification, because there will be divergence on rules and access to markets.
“If it decides to be the new Singapore, which it has once suggested … well, I don’t know. It’s not for me to decide, but I would like good, peaceful relations. Our destinies are linked, our intellectual approach is linked, our researchers and industrials work together … I believe in a sovereign continent and nation states; I don’t believe in neo-nationalism. “I am for common ambition and a common destiny. I hope Boris Johnson is also on that path, because I think the British people are. We remain allies. History and geography don’t change, so I don’t think the British people have a different destiny to ours.” Asked about the cross-Channel blame game over not just vaccines, but Brexit and coronavirus controls, in which he is often personally named, Macron laughed off the personal attacks: “Whenever there’s a problem with the EU, the British just love to detest the French – and me – and say we are responsible. “I have accepted this role. Sometimes when there are tensions, I ask ‘Why me?’ – perhaps making me out to be more important than I am!” On a more serious note, he added: “I like your country a lot, but as I have already said, I think Brexit is an error. I respect the sovereignty of the people and the people voted, so it had to be done, but I think that vote was based on a lot of lies and now we see it has made things much more difficult in many ways.” Sitting in the ornate Salle des Fêtes at the Élysée Palace, under vast crystal chandeliers, Macron seemed preoccupied during the 90-minute meeting with a dozen journalists from US, Arab, European and UK media. An earlier rendezvous with the president before Christmas had been called off at the last minute after he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Élysée staff said the president and his wife, Brigitte, who also caught the coronavirus, were “fully recovered”. Macron spoke rapidly and without notes on a range of issues from French military intervention in the Sahel to conspiracy theories, France’s controversial law against religious separatism, and how France comes to terms with its colonial past. One possible reason for being distracted was that Macron is expected to make an announcement this weekend about further coronavirus restrictions in France, which is already under a 12-hour nightly curfew. He was asked if he would be announcing a third national lockdown to stop the spread of new highly contagious variants, as predicted. It was the only question he refused to answer. Macron said Europe will not block or ban exports of coronavirus vaccines but that they should be “controlled”, accusing AstraZeneca of a lack of transparency after the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company said it could not fulfil the whole of its contract with the EU. He also said the AstraZeneca vaccine, given approval by the EU regulator on Friday for use on all adults, appeared to be “quasi-ineffective” on people older than 65, though he acknowledged he had no figures or official information. The European Medicines Agency authorised the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for use in all adult age groups on Friday, after German authorities had earlier recommended that its use be limited to people under 65 due to a lack of a data about efficacy in older groups. The vaccine’s developers and regulators in the UK have strongly defended its efficacy in all groups. • This article was amended on 30 January 2021.

2021-01-29T14:06:39Z,politics,Politics,Brexit negotiator David Frost pulled away from national security role,"David Frost, who negotiated the Brexit deal on behalf of Boris Johnson, will no longer be given the plum role of national security adviser, the government has announced. Lord Frost’s appointment provoked a backlash from Conservatives including the former prime minister Theresa May because of his lack of relevant expertise. Johnson handpicked Frost to run the Brexit negotiations, replacing the career civil servant Ollie Robbins, who was regarded with suspicion by the Vote Leave veterans in Downing Street. Frost’s pugnacious style and flat rejection of anything more than a bare-bones Canada-style trade deal is regarded as crucial in shaping the eventual agreement. The prime minister gave him a peerage last year. Frost will now take on the role of Brexit and international policy representative – a job that appears to have been created for him. One Whitehall source said Frost’s new post was “the role he wants”. Johnson’s spokesperson rejected the idea that the move meant the prime minister did not trust Frost to be national security adviser, saying that Johnson had been “further considering the responsibilities” of officials following the trade deal with the EU. Labour said the switch in Frost’s role indicated “chaos and confusion” in Number 10. In his new role Frost will continue to work on foreign policy issues, the spokesperson said. He will not, however, have his role directly scrutinised by parliament. Frost is in the unusual position of being both a peer and a government special adviser, and will answer directly to Johnson. He is on leave of absence from the Lords. The prime minister said: “I am hugely grateful to Lord Frost for his herculean efforts in securing a deal with the EU, and I am thrilled that he has agreed to be my representative for Brexit and international policy as we seize the opportunities from our departure from the EU.”
Frost said: “I am delighted to take up this new role as the prime minister’s representative on Brexit and international policy. With a new agreement with the EU in place, we have huge opportunities to boost our wealth and define what we stand for as a country internationally, and I very much look forward to supporting the prime minister on this.” The key post of national security adviser will now be filled by Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Defence. Lovegrove has a background in the private sector but has also held a series of public sector roles, including chief executive of the Shareholder Executive, the body that managed taxpayers’ holdings in businesses. He was also a board member of the organising committee of the 2012 London Olympics, held when Johnson was mayor of London. Lovegrove is seen by civil service colleagues as a safe pair of hands who helped steer the Ministry of Defence through several crises over the past five years. Former colleagues said he had a strong grasp of the finances and a reliable political antenna, cancelling a personal trip to New York as it became increasingly clear that Gavin Williamson was likely to be sacked by Theresa May as defence secretary following a row about a leak from the national security council. His appointment restores the job to a civil servant – Frost was a political appointee – meaning it will be possible again for the national security director to act as the accounts officer for the £3.2bn intelligence agency budgets, a role that can only be handled by an official. As the MoD’s top official he will have “had oversight of several aspects of the secret state”, according to another former colleague, including the Trident nuclear deterrent, special forces and military intelligence. Downing St said Lovegrove was appointed without a competition. “It wasn’t required. The PM and cabinet secretary identified him as having the right skill set and experience,” a No10 source said. The national security adviser post was previously filled by Sir Mark Sedwill, who was simultaneously the cabinet secretary. When Sedwill took on the double role for May, it raised questions about whether the national security post was being taken seriously enough. May said last year when it was announced Frost would be appointed as national security adviser: “Why is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?”"
2021-01-28T19:47:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's Scotland trip proves essential to nobody | John Crace,"Nicola Sturgeon couldn’t have been more clear. If the lockdown rules prevented all but essential travel – she had banned herself from visiting a vaccination centre in Aberdeen – then it was completely out of order for the prime minister to make a day trip to Scotland to drop in on a testing laboratory in Glasgow and a vaccine production facility in Livingston. Except that secretly the Scottish first minister must have been delighted that Boris Johnson had found time in his diary to dress up in a lab coat, get in the way of a cluster of technicians as he emptied some boxes, and bump elbows with various members of the army. Not so much Captain Hindsight as General Chaos. Because every time Boris comes to Scotland, the poll ratings of the Scottish National party – or the Scottish Nationalist party, as Johnson insists on calling it – go up a few points. The last 20 opinion polls have shown a majority of Scots in favour of independence. As with Johnson’s previous trip to Scotland, this one had all been done on a need-to-know basis. There had been no itinerary released prior to his arrival, because the last thing that Boris wanted was a whole load of protesters turning up to line the route. The prime minister’s unusual mission was to go to Scotland to avoid meeting as many Scots as possible. If possible, he would go to three locations that had been pre-sanitised to make sure no one gave him a hard time, and get back to London relatively unscathed as soon as possible. And that’s more or less what he achieved. Johnson popped up for a series of pointless photo opportunities and his only moment of slight jeopardy was when he was forced to do the obligatory short interview for the TV news channels. Boris didn’t get off to the best of starts by talking about all the ways the rest of Great Britain had gone out of their way to help the Scots. But then he presumably saw one of his minders doing a throat-cutting gesture and was reminded that the reason he had come to Scotland was to highlight the mutual benefits of the union. So he then came up with something rather more placatory about how wonderful the Scots were. It didn’t sound completely convincing, but then Boris seldom does. Diplomacy and sincerity are not two of his strongest suits. Inevitably, the interview then moved on to Scottish demands for a second independence referendum. “People don’t want another referendum,” he declared, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. They were fed up with “pointless constitutional wrangling”. This from a man who had brought the UK to its knees with endless constitutional wrangling over Brexit and had taken Scotland out of the EU against the wishes of most of its inhabitants. Still, that was nothing compared with the hypocrisy of his insistence that he “believed in the power of doing things together”. At times like this you wonder whether Johnson takes everyone for fools, simply has no conscience, or no memory. Or all three. Boris has only ever believed in doing what was good for Boris. Collaboration is a one-way street for any narcissist. Johnson just had time to dodge questions on Desmond Swayne’s lockdown scepticism and “the teething problems” of his sellout of the Scottish fishing fleet before wrapping things up with a near incoherent summary of his day. I quote verbatim: “If [the vaccine is] approved by the MHRA then we will have 60m doses of it by the end of this year for the whole of the British people. And so it’s a success for Scotland. Uh, it’s a success for, uh, Britain and, uh, it’s a success for Britain because it is a success for Scotland. It’s a success for Scotland because it’s a success for Britain. “So, uh, I’m, uh, you know, it was very, very encouraging to see it. That’s, that’s … I may have done some other things as well while I have been here although I can’t immediately recollect what they are. It’s been an action-packed day and always a joy to see you.” This was the UK’s very own Cicero talking. Sturgeon must be counting down the days until Johnson makes his next essential visit to Scotland. Much more of this and indyref 2 will be in the bag."
2021-01-28T18:39:52Z,politics,Politics,UAE added to UK’s growing travel ban list in blow to influencers,"British people including social media influencers flying home from Dubai could face a mandatory 10-day quarantine stay in a hotel, as the United Arab Emirates is being added to the UK’s growing travel ban list. The UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will join the 30 locations already on the so-called “red list” from 1pm on Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced, in order to prevent the spread of the Covid variant that first emerged in South Africa. Under measures unveiled on Wednesday, those who are still able to return from countries on the travel ban list – British and Irish nationals, as well as those with UK residency rights – will be required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days on their arrival, without exception. But the hotel quarantine policy has not yet been implemented, with the government due to set out further details next week. It potentially leaves the door open for those who can return from banned countries beforehand to avoid the requirement – although they would still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days with their household. The home secretary, Priti Patel, used a statement detailing the hotel quarantine measures to the Commons on Wednesday to criticise influencers who have been posting pictures from overseas. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off about which parts of the world they are in, mainly in sunny parts of the world. Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay at home,” she said. Some influencers in Dubai who have drawn scrutiny in recent weeks have tried to indicate that their overseas travel has been a necessary part of their work, including to appear in videos and paid-for endorsements. Under current UK Covid-19 restrictions, people must stay home and not leave to travel unless they have a legally permitted reason to do so, such as work. On Wednesday the government also announced that a new requirement would be introduced for people who wish to travel abroad to make a declaration stating why they need to do so, with the reason checked by carriers before departure. Police presence will be increased at ports and airports, and people will be fined if they are in breach of the stay-at-home regulations. Patel told the Commons: “Anyone who does not have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.” On Thursday the prime minister’s official spokesperson echoed Patel’s stance on influencers. “She said yesterday that we see plenty of influencers on social media showing off where they are in the world – mainly sunny places,” he said. “Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay home. We’ve been clear that people shouldn’t be leaving the UK for the purpose of holidays. We are asking people to stay home and only travel for absolutely essential reasons.” The curbs announced on Wednesday are on top of existing restrictions, which mean international arrivals, including those from countries not on the banned list, have to self-isolate for 10 days when they reach the UK and provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken up to 72 hours before departure, although there are some exemptions for certain work-related trips. In England under the Test to Release scheme, those who have returned from countries not on the travel ban list can leave self-isolation earlier if they pay for a Covid test five full days after their arrival that returns a negative result. The UK travel ban list mainly covers countries in South America and southern Africa as well as Portugal and Cape Verde. The Department for Transport said that from 4am on Friday all arrivals from the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda would not be eligible for the Test to Release scheme and would have to self-isolate immediately with their households. There will also be a ban on direct passenger flights from UAE from 1pm on Friday. The DfT said: “British nationals currently in the UAE should make use of the commercial options available if they wish to return to the UK. Indirect commercial routes that will enable British and Irish nationals and residents to return to the UK continue to operate.”"

2021-01-28T16:19:19Z,politics,Politics,Man sentenced to community service for spitting at Jeremy Corbyn,"A man who spat in Jeremy Corbyn’s face while the former Labour leader was out cycling with his wife at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown has been sentenced to 80 hours of community service. Gerald Dore admitted assault by beating for spitting at Corbyn, and a public order offence for threatening Corbyn’s wife, Laura Alvarez. But he said the attack was not politically motivated. “I don’t know him,” Dore, 56, told Westminster magistrates court. “I didn’t dislike him, he was just in my way and I was trying to get home.” Corbyn was out cycling with Alvarez on the morning of 20 May last year when he was assaulted, the court heard. Matt Barrowcliffe, prosecuting, said the couple had stopped at the corner of Seven Sisters Road, north London, where Dore was waiting. The Islington North MP gestured at Dore to cross, but received a stream of obscenities in response. When Corbyn told him “there was no need for that sort of language”, Dore repeated the abuse. “He began shouting and swearing aggressively towards both parties before ultimately taking a step towards Mr Corbyn and spitting,” Barrowcliffe said. Dore also verbally abused Alvarez, and threatened her physically. In a statement read by Barrowcliffe, Corbyn said: “I was alarmed and distressed by the aggressive behaviour towards me, in particular spitting in my face.” Barrowcliffe said the assault was aggravated by Corbyn’s vulnerability as a person in the public eye. Dore, a former plumber, represented himself in court. He said he had chronic pain and mental health issues, and the court was told he had a lower culpability. “All I was trying to do was cross the road and he was in the way,” said Dore, who has previous convictions for assault. “I might have sprayed him,” he later added. The district judge Adrian Turner accepted that the assault was a chance encounter. He said: “To spit at someone is gross in any circumstance, but to do so at a time when the infections were running very high was very serious indeed.” Turner gave Dore an 18-month community order, which will include 80 hours of unpaid work, and ordered him to pay £250 in compensation – £150 to Corbyn and £100 to Alvarez. “This is going to hurt,” the judge said. Rob Hutchinson, a CPS prosecutor, said: “This successful prosecution should put no one in any doubt that we will take firm action against those who abuse others in this way and – in this case – our elected officials and their families, who should be able to go about their personal business without being put in fear.”"
2021-01-28T16:13:01Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: stop endless talk about new Scottish referendum,"Boris Johnson has urged Scottish nationalists to stop “talking endlessly” about another independence referendum and concentrate instead on recovering from the Covid pandemic. Speaking during a tour of Covid vaccination projects in Scotland, the prime minister said Nicola Sturgeon had promised that the 2014 referendum had been a “once-in-a-generation event” and she should be held to that. He said the first minister’s quest for a second independence referendum after May’s Scottish elections was a “diversionary tactic” to distract attention from the SNP’s poor record on domestic policies. “It is also a fact that the SNP government hasn’t been notably successful on delivering good results on education or tackling drugs,” he said. “I don’t think that the right thing to do is to talk endlessly about another referendum when I think what the people of the country and the people of Scotland want in particular is to fight this pandemic. I don’t see the advantage of getting lost in pointless constitutional wrangling when after all we had a referendum not so very long ago.”
Johnson, facing intense pressure amid growing support for Scottish independence and the Scottish National party, said the UK government-funded programmes he visited on Thursday were proof the UK was an effective and successful partnership. Those included a Lighthouse laboratory processing Covid samples in Glasgow, a new mass vaccination centre set up by the Royal Scottish Dragoon Guards in Castlemilk in the city, and the Valneva vaccines factory in Livingston, which has been contracted by the UK government to supply up to 100m doses later this year. “This is a huge national effort as a result of investment by the UK government,” he said. “I believe very, very strongly we’re better off with the current arrangements. “I think people can be very, very proud of the achievements of Scottish science, of Scottish business and of Scotland, because they’re achieving astonishing things at the moment but I think they can also be proud of what Britain is achieving.” Johnson’s visit to Scotland was criticised on Wednesday by Sturgeon, who questioned whether it was justified and met the strict criteria for essential travel during the UK-wide lockdown.
She said: “We have a duty to lead by example, and if we are going to suggest that we don’t take these rules as seriously as we should it gets harder to convince other people.” Stuart McDonald, the SNP MP whose constituency includes the community centre in Castlemilk where Johnson visited British troops, said the prime minister should have stayed at home. “The prime minister’s visit to Castlemilk – a community his party has hit hard – was wrong. It’s right to thank the armed forces who have helped in the fight against Covid, but the best way to do it is to pay them properly, improve their conditions & better support their families,” McDonald tweeted. Keith Brown MSP, the Scottish National party’s deputy leader, said: “Clearly, Boris Johnson is rattled. By branding this campaign trip as ‘essential’, this is clearly a prime minister in panic, who knows the Tories are losing the argument on independence.” However, Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, told LBC it was “perfectly legitimate” for the prime minister to tour vaccination sites and check the strategy was working. Police Scotland also rejected complaints that Johnson had broken the Covid lockdown rules. The force said it was “a working visit in his official capacity as prime minister”. “He is the prime minister of the United Kingdom,” Starmer said. “It is important that he travels to see what’s going on, on the ground. I understand he is going to see a vaccine centre, going to talk to the NHS. I would expect the prime minister to do that, frankly.” With the Scottish National party on course for a majority in May’s Holyrood elections, the polls suggest voters have welcomed Sturgeon’s confident leadership during the pandemic and have deep-seated doubts about Johnson’s competence. Her personal ratings have soared while Johnson’s have continued to remain rock-bottom, and Sturgeon’s demands for a second independence referendum will be central to the SNP’s election campaign. While support for the Scottish Tories rose in the polls during Theresa May’s leadership to 27%, it has fallen since Johnson took over, to as low as 19%."
2021-01-28T15:55:36Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon trans rights support prompts calls for reform,"Nicola Sturgeon has been challenged to include meaningful reform of gender recognition legislation in her party’s spring manifesto, after she made her strongest statement yet in support of transgender rights. Scotland’s first minister posted what she described as an unplanned and unscripted statement on Twitter late on Wednesday evening in response to reports of significant numbers of mainly younger people leaving the SNP because of the leadership’s perceived failure to tackle transphobia. Sturgeon said: “It grieves me deeply that you have reached this conclusion because you consider at this stage the SNP not to be a safe, tolerant or welcoming place for trans people. That is not acceptable to me.” Insisting that transphobia should be treated with the same “zero tolerance” that applies to racism or homophobia, Sturgeon added: “Yes we have differences of opinion on gender recognition reform, we should debate them openly and respectfully but no debate can be a cover for transphobia.” An increasingly toxic online environment has caused some younger people to question their commitment to the SNP in recent weeks, the Guardian understands. But after the posts, women’s groups that were formed to challenge transgender rights reform accused Sturgeon of failing to criticise online abuse of their own membership. A number of prominent LGBT activists told the Guardian there had been fears that the party’s commitment to gender recognition reform would be watered down in its manifesto for May’s Holyrood elections, but Sturgeon’s video message had given them some cause for optimism. Out for Independence, the official LGBT+ wing of the SNP, four of whose executive committee have resigned in protest over the past week, said the most important action to follow must be an overhaul of internal disciplinary procedures, which “have not been used to protect people where they should have been”. The Scottish Trans Alliance said: “We hope that [Sturgeon’s] words will be followed up by the meaningful actions she says she is determined they will be.” It called for those actions to include improving delivery of trans healthcare, with a priority of reducing waiting times, hate crime protection and reform of the Gender Recognition Act. Plans to allow people to officially change gender without a medical diagnosis by reforming the GRA were paused in Scotland at the beginning of the pandemic, and similar plans were dropped by the UK government last September. The Scottish proposals had attracted criticism from some feminist groups as well as from senior SNP politicians, including the finance secretary, Kate Forbes, and the MP Joanna Cherry, who has repeatedly challenged the party leadership over gender rights. Cherry won a coveted seat on the SNP’s national executive committee at the party’s conference last November. At the time, the Guardian reported on how a cohort of activists, councillors and MPs similarly critical of transgender rights policy were elected to the national executive to the shock of the SNP’s leadership. A number of prominent Sturgeon supporters believe some rebels are using the row over transgender rights to undermine her authority. While GRA reform has been paused, the row has since spilled over into other policy areas, including the reform of hate crime legislation. The Women’s Pledge Group, which was launched at the SNP’s October 2019 conference by MPs, MSPs and councillors with concerns about gender recognition reform, said they condemned abuse of all party members but added that “women have serious and valid concerns around their rights to privacy, dignity, safety and fairness”. The group said women raising such concerns had been labelled transphobic and hateful, highlighting the online abuse of Cherry, who is one of its founders. “Like the first minister, we believe debate should always be respectful, however some individuals oppose any sort of debate on these issues.”"
2021-01-28T12:53:04Z,politics,Politics,A rocky route to a Scottish independence referendum,"When the Scottish National party published its roadmap for a second independence referendum on Sunday, it confirmed what many anticipate will be a central plank of its manifesto for May’s Holyrood elections. If the party wins a majority, as polling indicates it will, and if Westminster ignores that electoral mandate and continues to refuse the necessary transfer of powers, Holyrood will legislate to hold a referendum regardless. There are three possible routes to another referendum on Scottish independence. As happened with the 2014 vote, a process previously described as the “gold standard” by Nicola Sturgeon, the UK government could grant a section 30 order under the Scotland Act, 1998, granting Holyrood the competence to legislate for it. The act, which set up the Scottish parliament, states that Holyrood can’t normally legislate on reserved matters, such as the union. But UK prime ministers, most recently Boris Johnson, have repeatedly refused this request. Another, highly unlikely, route would be a Catalan-style wild-cat vote, which Sturgeon herself has said she could not sanction and would likely result in a boycott by unionist parties with significant damage to Scotland’s international credibility at a moment when it would also be seeking to rejoin the EU. Thirdly, as the SNP proposed at the weekend, it could introduce a referendum bill to the Scottish parliament without a section 30 order, prompting an almost inevitable legal challenge to settle whether holding a referendum on the union counts as a reserved matter and is thus beyond Holyrood’s competence, likely to end up in the supreme court. This is the “Plan B” pushed by independence activists increasingly frustrated at Sturgeon’s more cautious approach. One of the first tests in this scenario is for the member in charge of the bill, who has to state in terms that the bill is within competence on introduction, putting the lord advocate, Scotland’s most senior law officer, under significant pressure to intervene. The Scottish parliament’s newly elected presiding officer would have to confirm in writing whether a bill was legally competent. A government is not obliged to withdraw or change legislation that the presiding officer declares incompetent – as happened once before with the continuity bill aimed at upholding EU laws in Scotland after Brexit, which also went to the supreme court. But a ruling of that type would be likely to bolster a legal challenge. Once a bill is passed by Holyrood, the Scottish and UK governments’ law officers have 28 days to state whether they accept or challenge it. That may put the lord advocate under more pressure. If they challenge its legality, it automatically goes to the UK supreme court for a ruling – a process invoked with the continuity bill, which was ruled unlawful on technical grounds. The job of the supreme court, then, is to test the scope of the reservation in the Scotland Act, explains Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge. “Is the Scottish parliament competent to legislate for a referendum on independence even while the union remains reserved? The structure of devolution is such that everything is devolved unless it is reserved so it follows that the court ought to interpret reservations narrowly, ” he said. While Armstrong’s instinct is that the prospects of success for the Scottish government at the supreme court are low, he adds the caveat that the breadth of reservations in the Scotland Act allow greater freedom of interpretation. A case currently at the court of session tests this precise proposition. The crowd-funded action brought by independence activist Martin Keating is seeking a declaration that the Scottish parliament does have the power to hold a legal referendum on independence. Aileen McHarg, professor of public law and human rights at the University of Durham, has been following the case with some interest, but believes there is a strong chance that the court will simply accept the procedural arguments that the action is premature and not relevant. She notes that, from an SNP perspective, the timing of this case is unhelpful. “Assuming the SNP win a majority in May they will be in a much stronger position,” she said. “But a mandate alone, though politically important, isn’t legally relevant. If a court decides that the Scottish government does have power to hold a referendum it will obviously create significant political momentum. But they would still need the UK government consent ultimately to leave the union.” She makes the crucial distinction between a legal referendum and a legally binding one. “The 2014 referendum was advisory only, as was the Brexit vote, but it was legally valid because of the section 30 order.” McHarg also highlights the gamble the SNP would be taking by pursuing their case in court: if they lost, holding a referendum would then be “a non-starter”. “You can’t force local authorities to cooperate, there would be no proper control of spending or the campaign, and a potential boycott by voters.” Indeed, pursuit of a referendum through the courts marks a significant shift for Sturgeon herself. In January 2020 she warned that such a legal challenge “might actually set us back”, and she continues to insist on the need to have a process that is “legal and legitimate”. Here lies the risk in seeking legal answers to a political question, says Prof Michael Keating, director of the Centre on Constitutional Change. “If the supreme court says you can have an advisory referendum it’s still not legally binding. So in that sense it’s not a legal question but about how it can be resolved politically and whether Westminster thinks it can hold out.”"

In a her first solo interview with the BBC, Cameron said her fashion brand, Cefinn, had been hit by “teething issues” and the extra costs involved in selling products to Europe under the government’s trade deal with EU. Speaking to Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, she said: “If you’re bringing goods into the country from outside the UK and then trying to sell them back into Europe, that currently is challenging and difficult.”
Echoing the current Brexit concerns of many small businesses about red tape and extra charges, Cameron said: “We really thought we’d done our prep and this … we weren’t expecting. So I think for bigger business, it’s fine. But if you’re small, it’s a challenge.” She said Brexit was thwarting her ambitions to expand her business into Europe. She said: “It [teething issues] does need to be looked at because otherwise we can’t grow our business. It is frustrating, the majority of our business is in the UK and we do a bit of business in America, but we did have a bit of EU business. And obviously you’d like to grow it, because it’s on your doorstep. But unless some of the expense and cost of doing that is looked at it will be challenging.” In an apparent swipe at government advisers who suggested that British businesses that export to the continent should set up separate companies inside the EU, Cameron said: “We can’t afford to have warehouses in Europe and that sort of thing.” She also urged the government to “talk to all businesses out there who are in a similar position to me”. Asked by Woman’s Hour’s new regular presenter, Emma Barnett, whether she had discussed the Brexit supply chain issues with her husband, Cameron said: “Yes definitely. Some of these things came up in the very last moments of negotiations. So you definitely deal with having this problem at work.” She also offered support to the current prime minister’s partner, Carrie Symonds, over media portrayals of her influence over Boris Johnson, following reports of an internal Downing Street feud in the autumn. Asked about claims that allies of Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings called Symonds “Princess Nut Nut”, Cameron said: “I don’t think she should have that kind of criticism laid at her door … The idea that it’s the wife somehow influencing them over and above what they think or what advice they’re getting from their team, I think it’s kind of demeaning for the prime minister.” She added: “I think that is very unfair to pick her [Symonds] out as having some kind of undue influence.” Asked for any advice she could pass on to Symonds, Cameron said: “I think you’ve got to find your own way. Do the things that you enjoy, do the things that you feel you’re good at. And be as supportive as you can to Boris.”"
2021-01-28T07:30:05Z,politics,Politics,"UK plan to build 24,000 homes faces legal challenge","A plan to build more than 20,000 homes in rural Oxfordshire, championed by secretary of state for housing Robert Jenrick, is facing a legal challenge from residents who say it is incompatible with the government’s legally binding commitments to tackle the climate emergency. Campaigners have issued a legal claim against South Oxfordshire district council’s decision to go ahead with the local plan – which sets out proposals to build 24,000 new homes in the area by 2035. Jenrick, is accused of “massive intervention” to push the scheme through after he ordered South Oxfordshire district council to go ahead with the development in March. Sue Roberts, director of Bioabundance which is taking the legal case, said: “This is the first time a local plan has ever been challenged because of our climate and ecological crisis. This pioneering action by Bioabundance is our last chance to put our environment before housebuilder profit in South Oxfordshire.” The legal challenge is the latest attempt to stop major infrastructure projects – from a new runway at Heathrow to Europe’s biggest gas fired power station – which campaigners argue fail to meet the government’s legally binding commitments to tackle the climate emergency. Both challenges have faced recent setbacks in the courts. Campaigners are challenging the Oxfordshire plan on the grounds that Jenrick’s intervention was inappropriate and that the proposed number of houses breaches the government’s legally binding commitment to hit net zero by 2050. Leigh Day solicitor Tom Short, who is representing Bioabundance, said the claimants were concerned about both “the manner in which the plan has been forced through under enormous pressure from the secretary of state, and the detrimental environmental impacts it will lead to.” “It is important that decisions of local authorities that have significant ramifications for the environment for years to come be taken in a free and fair manner, not dictated by central government as appears to have happened here,” he said. Many of the new houses would be built on the outskirts of Oxford, and there are also plans to develop an old airfield into a ‘new town’. Ian Ashley, director of Bioabundance, said: “The plan would destroy the countryside and a large part of the green belt around Oxford.” The proposals were originally developed by a Conservative led council that was replaced in May 2019 by a Lib Dem-Green coalition that had campaigned to end “over-development”. However, over a period of 21 months, the applicants say the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) put “severe pressure” on South Oxfordshire district council and threatened to withhold promised infrastructure funding for several other projects unless the local plan was adopted. Final approval was given at the South Oxfordshire district council in December. But some councillors who abstained said Jenrick’s “massive intervention” meant it was not a free vote. Roberts, who is also a local councillor, said there was no demand for new housing in the area. She argued the new developments would simply provide second homes, or international investment opportunities for the already wealthy, as well as worsening the climate crisis and “hastening the collapse of the natural world.” However, Caroline Newton, a Conservative member on South Oxfordshire district council said new homes were desperately needed. “There is a directly assessed need for houses in this area … we have got incredibly expensive house prices, first-time buyers are getting older and older and young families are being forced out of the area.” The MHCLG declined to comment. A spokesperson for South Oxfordshire district council said: “We can confirm we’ve received a challenge by Bioabundance to the council’s decision to adopt the Local Plan 2035. We will be responding accordingly but we can’t comment further at this stage as this is a legal matter.”"
2021-01-28T00:08:14Z,politics,Politics,Doctors call for better targeting of Covid vaccinations in UK,"The failure to take a more sophisticated approach to the Covid vaccination programme is leaving some of the most deprived and at-risk individuals, including ethnic minorities, unprotected, the head of the British Medical Association has warned. The UK government is aiming to offer everyone in the top four priority groups as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – everyone over the age of 70, care home residents, health and social care workers and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals – a first dose by 15 February. But Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair, said no account had been taken of accompanying JCVI advice that states the programme should pay “due attention to mitigating health inequalities, such as might occur in relation to access to healthcare and ethnicity”.
He said: “We need to be much more sophisticated in making sure the vaccine rollout reaches the people who are at highest risk, beyond the simplistic tiers [priority groups]. “One thing we know is Covid-19 has exacerbated health inequalities. So one of the aims of the vaccination programme should be that in addition to the over-80s and the over-70s etc, there should be a parallel approach of the programme rollout to target health inequalities, especially in deprived communities, and as they apply to ethnic minorities.” Office for National Statistics data from the first wave showed people living in the poorest areas of England and Wales were twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as those in less deprived areas. According to Public Health England (PHE), people from ethnic minorities were up to twice as likely as white Britons to die from Covid. Many minority ethnic groups are more likely to live in deprived areas, in overcrowded housing, and to be in lower-paid, unstable work, often with a high degree of public contact. Preliminary findings by researchers at the University of Oxford’s DataLab and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found black people and those in more deprived areas were less likely to receive the vaccine than others during the first weeks of distribution.
Nagpaul said: “Deprived communities do not sit easily in the JCVI tiers. For a start, they have fewer over-80s, because the life expectancy in the deprived communities is lower. So that means that what we’re seeing is a vaccination rollout that is vaccinating higher numbers of people in affluent areas because there are more over-80s and we’re seeing lower levels of vaccinations in deprived communities. “What we’re now finding is that, let’s say, a healthy white person of 73 years of age, who is actually not mixing with people, living in a rural area, will get their vaccine, which is fine. But a BAME [black, Asian or minority ethnic] 60-year-old who is in an overcrowded environment with other risk factors where you know that they’re at a high risk of death would not fit into that [prioritisation].” Nagpaul was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of the BMA’s national BAME forum, which he said would address “an NHS culture that works against BAME doctors”. He highlighted the fact that 28% of critical care Covid patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are BAME, according to the latest figures – twice the BAME representation in the general population in England and Wales. He said local authorities and public health teams should be able to identify their most vulnerable residents because the links between Covid, deprivation and ethnicity had long been known and in June PHE had called for action to address them. “There should already have been local plans in how to protect people who are at highest risk in deprived communities from Covid, and the vaccine rollout should have simply been part of that,” he said. Nagpaul’s intervention came as another study highlighted BAME health inequalities. The Strategy Unit, Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation analysis, published in Lancet Regional Health – Europe, of 41 major A&E units in England between 11 March and 7 April 2020, during the first lockdown, calculated an average 51% drop in attendance but it was 63.5% for black Africans, 75.3% for Bangladeshis and 71.8% for Pakistanis, prompting fears of harms to health and widening of existing inequalities. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “[The JCVI] advised the immediate priority should be to prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality, and the NHS is now working at pace to vaccinate these groups. “Under the nine priority groups advised for phase one, those over 50 years of age and all adults in a medical risk group will be eligible for vaccination. Prioritisation of people with underlying health conditions will provide for greater vaccination of BAME communities who are disproportionately affected by such health conditions.”"
2021-01-27T23:59:05Z,politics,Politics,Review of UK workers' rights post-Brexit is axed in sudden U-turn,"A controversial review into how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit is no longer going ahead, the business secretary has announced. In an interview with ITV’s Peston, Kwasi Kwarteng said: “So the review is no longer happening within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). I made it very very clear to officials in the department that we’re not interested in watering down workers’ rights.” He added: “I can’t have been more clear about this on a number of occasions. I’ve said repeatedly that Brexit gives us the opportunity to have higher standards and a higher growth economy and that’s what officials in the department are 100% focused on.” The Guardian understands the consultation on employment rights was signed off by Kwasi Kwarteng’s predecessor Alok Sharma, who left after being given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference. Initial media reports suggested the review would consider proposals including an end to the 48-hour maximum working week, changes to rules about breaks at work, removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements, and getting rid of the current requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. The proposals met fierce criticism from Labour and the unions, but Kwarteng rejected the claims, tweeting: “We are not going to lower the standards of workers’ rights … We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights not row back on them.” However, speaking to MPs last week, the business secretary confirmed that his department was going ahead with the consultation with business leaders on EU employment rules, including the working time directive. He told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee: “I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like.” After the announcement of the review, the business secretary faced a backlash from the unions and Labour. Ed Miliband, the shadow business, energy and industry secretary, wrote for the Guardian: “The government has failed to bring in the employment bill that it promised would protect and enhance workers’ rights.” He added: “We have seen some workers feel unable to ensure their own safety, scared to raise complaints and compelled to come into the office despite the government’s instruction to work from home.” Kwarteng had also come under fire for his role in Britannia Unchained, a collection of essays that came out in 2012 by then Tory backbenchers who called for reduced worker protections. However, he told the BEIS committee last week that that was “a long time ago”."
2021-01-27T19:56:12Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson hopes schools in England will reopen from 8 March,"Boris Johnson signalled that England’s strict lockdown will continue for at least another five weeks, as he warned that 8 March was the earliest date on which schoolchildren could return to the classroom. When schools were closed to most pupils earlier this month, the prime minister said it would initially be until after the February half-term. But he announced to MPs on Wednesday that only by the middle of next month would the government have a clearer idea of the impact of the vaccine on the pandemic. “The first sign of normality starting to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms,” Johnson said. Unions warned that setting a target date of 8 March for schools to return could create false hope, with Mary Bousted from the National Education Union cautioning: “The prime minister may now be immune to the embarrassment of U-turns, but school leaders, teachers and support staff, not to mention families and students, are utterly exhausted by them.” Speaking after confirming plans to require British citizens returning from high-risk countries to quarantine, the prime minister promised that in the week of 22 February the government would set out a “gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way”. “By then we will know much more about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, using data from the UK but also other nations such as Israel. We will know how successful the current restrictions have been in driving down infections,” Johnson said. “We will also know how many people are still in hospital with Covid, which we simply can’t predict with certainty today. So we will then be in a better position to chart a course out of lockdown without risking a further surge that would overwhelm the NHS.” Another 1,725 people were reported on Wednesday to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, bringing the total death toll by that measure to 101,887. 25,308 new infections were identified, down 13,597 on the same day last week. The government is expected to publish a “roadmap,” as it did during last year’s lockdown, setting out its criteria for reopening different sectors. The prime minister said the 8 March date was based on the thinking that if the NHS is successful in vaccinating the four most vulnerable groups by 15 February, these people will by then have had three weeks to develop immunity. He said he hoped “all schools will go back” on 8 March, suggesting the government may have moved away from a regional approach to lifting restrictions. “That’s the earliest we can do it, and it depends on lots of things going right,” he said. Johnson expressed sympathy “for parents and for carers who’ve spent so many months not only home schooling but meeting the myriad needs of their children from breakfast to bedtime”. He announced £300m in extra government funding for catchup teaching for children who have fallen behind, and promised families would continue to receive free school meals support until March. That is not expected to include food vouchers being issued during half-term, however. Instead, parents are expected to have to rely on the separate Covid winter grant scheme. Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “Given previous experience, the announcement of arbitrary dates for schools to reopen to all pupils can be profoundly unhelpful to parents and to those working in schools. “However, a clear plan for how schools will be fully reopened whenever the lockdown restrictions are lifted remains a key question which the government must now work urgently and openly with the profession to address.” The closure of schools across England was announced on 4 January alongside the lockdown, just a day after they had been allowed to open across most of the country. Johnson made the latest schools announcement as part of a Covid update to the House of Commons, a day after official figures confirmed that more than 100,000 people have now died with the virus in the UK.
Challenged at Wednesday’s Downing Street press conference about whether he had made mistakes in his handling of the pandemic, the prime minister said: “Of course I take full responsibility for everything.” But he added: “What I would say humbly and respectfully to those who make criticisms of what the government and what our colleagues have been trying to do is that in situations like this, where you have such very, very brutal and difficult dilemmas there are no easy answers, and very often there are no good answers at all.” He said there would be a “full inquiry” into the pandemic; but he did not believe the time was right for that now, with the country still fighting to control the virus. Chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, stressed the continued prevalence of the virus, underlining the fact that cases and hospitalisations remain extremely high. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that the best way of honouring the memory of those who had died from Covid was to “persevere against this virus with ever greater resolve”. He announced that 6.8 million people have now been vaccinated: 13% of the adult population. Johnson also set out plans for passengers from the countries already facing the toughest travel restrictions to the UK to have to quarantine in government-provided accommodation at their own expense. “They will be met at the airport and transferred into quarantine,” he said. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had earlier called for all teachers and school support staff to be vaccinated during the February half-term, to help expedite the reopening of schools.

2021-01-27T18:44:00Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson reserves right to carry on without learning anything | John Crace,"If not now, then when? With the UK having passed the unwanted “world-beating” milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths the previous day, it was inevitable that prime minister’s questions would be dominated by Keir Starmer asking what lessons Boris Johnson had learned about his government’s handling of the crisis. “I take full responsibility,” said a downbeat, almost abject Johnson. The few MPs inside the chamber did a quick double take. Boris had never previously shown any signs of taking responsibility for anything in either his private or public life, so why the personality transplant? Was it really possible that the man whose life had been devoted to the pursuit of his own hedonistic ambition might finally come clean about his own failings? Er … no. There would be a time for a reckoning but that moment had not yet come. Just as it had not come after any number of mistakes over the past 10 months. Too late to implement a first lockdown. Too timid to sack Dominic Cummings for the Durham safari. Too slow to put a working track-and-trace system in place. Too late to impose a second lockdown that had been recommended by government scientists. Too quick to send people back to work and eat out. Too slow to respond to the Covid variant. Too slow to impose tougher restrictions at Christmas. Too slow to initiate a third lockdown. The Labour leader could have gone on. Each mistake had cost lives, yet Johnson reserved the right to carry on without learning anything. Or taking responsibility for anything. Why learn lessons now when you can cram them all in together right at the end? Any inquiry could wait until after the vaccination programme had bought him some public goodwill. No matter how many more mistakes he made in the meantime; his run of bad luck had to end sooner or later. Yet again, satire had been undone by the reality. All that’s left for the sketch on days like this is a simple stenography service. This was Johnson at his most churlish and defensive. A childish refusal to even engage with the questions, let alone answer them. But then that’s the place to which he always psychologically retreats when he’s up against it. Rather than saying that Starmer’s idea of vaccinating teachers during the half-term break after the four most vulnerable groups had been inoculated was not backed up by medical advice, he bunkered down in his comfort zone of challenging Labour to say schools were safe. Which, of course, they aren’t. Otherwise they would all still be open. For a supposedly clever man, Boris can be remarkably dim. As he always does, Starmer chose to play it cool rather than go for all-out attack. One day he might surprise us all, go berserk and start yelling “I can’t take any more of this bullshit” – hell, he would only be voicing what most people watching PMQs are thinking – but he seems a long way off that yet. Rather he just makes his point and lets Johnson make a spectacle of himself. Which the prime minister duly did by accusing Starmer of playing party politics with the pandemic. As so often, he mistakes the guilt of others for his own. Johnson regards even the most gentle challenge as a life-threatening narcissistic wound. “The public just want us to come together,” Boris concluded. And in a way he was right. What the country really wants is for some Tory backbenchers to find a spine and admit that terrible mistakes have been made. That more than 100,000 dead is an unacceptable price to pay for a party leader whose entire life has just been a vanity project. Think about it. The equivalent of an entire small city wiped out and not a single ministerial resignation. Combat was resumed an hour later when Johnson gave a ministerial statement to update the Commons on the Covid pandemic. Finally there were to be some, as yet to be fully determined, hotel quarantine restrictions for arrivals from South Africa and South America – though far too late in the day for many – and, to no great surprise, schools now wouldn’t be reopening before 8 March at the earliest. He also promised a roadmap out of lockdown that no one believed for a second would work out as planned. Not least because Boris promised it would be open to revision, while still providing clarity. Go figure. In reply, Starmer rather went through the motions. All that could be said had been said long ago and he couldn’t force himself to rise to the challenge of finding new ways of getting Boris to take responsibility for his actions. So he merely repeated many of his lines from PMQs while throwing in the added observation that the prime minister’s claim to be balancing the nation’s health with the economy wasn’t working out so well. Except it was, as the scales were just about level. Along with the worst death rate in Europe, we’ve also got the worst economic figures. Something to be proud of, I suppose. Not that Johnson was that bothered. He’d got Starmer off his back for the second time in a day and he could now accept the plaudits of some of his more deluded backbenchers, such as Peter Bone, who thought that only Brexit could save the country from coronavirus. At times like these, Johnson is happy to get his kicks wherever he finds them."
2021-01-27T18:26:58Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: PM warns 8 March is earliest England's schools can go back, if it will not cause 'surge in disease' – as it happened","Boris Johnson has confirmed that schools in England will not reopen for all pupils after the February half term - but he has set Monday 8 March as the date when pupils might go back. When he announced the lockdown at the start of January, he said he hoped that if the lockdown and the vaccination programme were effective, â€œwe can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half termâ€�. Today, in a statement to MPs, he said that the planned opening date had been set back â€“ meaning millions of parents face two more weeks of home schooling beyond the time originally implied. The new target date he set, 8 March, is one already identified as a deadline by the Covid Recovery Group, which represents lockdown-sceptic Tories; the CRG has been arguing that the lockdown should start lifting from this point because it marks three weeks after all 15 million people in the top four priority groups should have had their first dose of vaccine, and should therefore be well protected. In his statement Johnson did not say what other lockdown measures might be lifted from 8 March, but he said he would publish a plan for easing the lockdown in the week starting Monday 22 February, after the half-term recess. At a subsequent press conference, Johnson did stress that schools reopening on 8 March was only an aim, and that it was not guaranteed. He said: Iâ€™m hopeful, but thatâ€™s the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right ... It also depends on us all now continuing, above all, to work together to drive down the incidents of the disease. The National Education Union has accused him of creating â€œfalse hopeâ€� about this date. (See 2.44pm.) Boris Johnson has confirmed that British citizens returning from high-risk countries must quarantine in hotels at their own expense, facing down calls from cabinet colleagues and scientists to extend the policy to all arrivals. Labour has called for the vaccine priority list to be written so that teachers and other key workers get vaccinated ahead of some over-50s. (See 12.49pm.) Johnson has said this would delay the lifting of lockdown. (See 1.50pm.) Britain is on a collision course with the EU over vaccine shortages after Brussels refused to accept that people in the UK have first claim on Oxford/AstraZeneca doses produced in local plants. Doctors have raised concerns about â€œworryingâ€� disparities in vaccine coverage in England amid signs black people and those in more deprived areas were less likely to receive the vaccine than others in the first weeks of rollout. Nicola Sturgeon has questioned whether Boris Johnsonâ€™s planned trip from London to Scotland on Thursday is â€œgenuinely essentialâ€�, suggesting his visit makes it harder to convince the public to stick to travel restrictions. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-27T18:19:54Z,politics,Politics,UK travellers to be questioned at border on reasons for going abroad,"UK travellers will be interrogated at the border on their reasons for going abroad, Boris Johnson has said, as he confirmed that British citizens returning from high-risk countries must quarantine in hotels at their own expense. The government is facing criticism from the Scottish and Welsh governments, as well as scientists, for rejecting a more comprehensive hotel quarantine system. They are warning that it could allow as yet unknown new variants to slip through the gaps. Speaking in the Commons, Johnson said no one should be travelling except for a narrow range of reasons. “I want to make clear that under the stay-at-home regulations it is illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes and we will enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel,” he said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said police would be deployed to interrogate travellers at borders and ports. “People should be staying at home, unless they have a valid reason to leave,” she said. “Going on a holiday is not a valid reason.” Patel used a statement in the Commons to criticise social media influencers who have posted pictures from Dubai. “Border Force have given me some examples where even at St Pancras people have been turning up with their skis. That is clearly not acceptable,” she said. “We see plenty of influencers on social media showing off about which parts of the world that they are in, mainly in sunny parts of the world. Going on holiday is not an exemption and it is important that people stay at home.” Johnson said the government had already banned all travel from 22 countries where there was a risk of known variants, including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations. “I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government-provided accommodation, such as hotels, for 10 days without exception,” the prime minister said. Those arrivals will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine facilities, which Johnson said would be established as quickly as possible.
Patel said a further requirement would be introduced so that anyone travelling must first make a declaration as to why they need to do so, which would be checked by carriers before departure. Those ordered to quarantine in hotels are likely to only include British citizens or permanent residents who must be allowed to enter. The policy is expected to take several weeks to implement. Patel said there would be no exceptions to the quarantine policy for those returning from high-risk countries. The Welsh government said it was concerned about the limited scope of the measures and it would examine its own options. “We have agreed on the need for a joint approach between the four nations of the UK and the Republic of Ireland to strengthen border health measures, in order to prevent the further spread of coronavirus,” a Welsh government spokesperson said. “However, we do not believe the approach as set out by the UK government goes far enough. Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible.” Joanna Cherry, of the Scottish National party, said the Scottish government was not satisfied with the policy and she hoped the UK government would “listen to their representation”.
Scientists expressed some dismay at the policy. Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said there would still be major gaps in the UK’s defences. “It has to apply to all arrivals, or no countries. We know people will just transit and connect in other airports to avoid quarantine,” she said. “The UK tried this with screening from China last February and March, but the seeding came from Spain, Italy and France. We need to learn that lesson. It would be a shame for the UK to vaccinate a bulk of the population and just reimport a strain our vaccines aren’t as effective against.” Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the policy would be “enough to damage the economy but not nearly enough to be effective against Covid”. She said the policy ran the risk of importing an as yet unidentified new variant that might evade the current vaccines. “Firstly, we just don’t know who the high-risk countries are because most countries do not have the sophisticated sequencing capabilities you need to spot, track and analyse new variants,” she said. “If we work with the Republic of Ireland, we can control our borders for Covid as island nations. We should take advantage of this to do all we can to minimise the risks of new variants just as we are rolling out vaccination across the population. And instead we just aren’t.” ADS, the trade body representing the aerospace sector, said more specific support would be needed from the Treasury, even without the blanket measures. Its chief executive, Paul Everitt, said: “These latest measures to restrict international travel will worsen the severe downturn in aviation and deepen the crisis in the UK aerospace industry. “Sector-specific support must now be urgently delivered to ensure aerospace manufacturers and our supply chains can survive until these measures are lifted and demand returns.”
The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the proposals would make little difference unless they were expanded. “Yet again the government is lurching from one crisis to another, devoid of strategy, and limiting hotel quarantining to only a limited number of countries, from which travel from non-UK residents was already banned, means that the home secretary’s proposals do not go anywhere near far enough,” he said. Thomas-Symonds said it was clear that Patel herself had privately favoured a more comprehensive approach. “The truth is the government is once again behind the curve,” he said."
2021-01-27T18:15:56Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn loses bid to force Labour to disclose documents about his suspension,"Jeremy Corbyn has lost a legal fight to force Labour to hand over documents before a possible high court challenge against his suspension from the parliamentary party. The former Labour leader’s lawyers believed the documents would help him show that an agreement to fully readmit him to the party following his suspension for downplaying antisemitism under his leadership had been reneged upon. Labour has denied in court that any such deal existed. In a ruling on Wednesday, the judge Lisa Sullivan dismissed Corbyn’s claim, saying he already had sufficient information upon which to decide whether or not to bring a case. During a hearing last week the Islington North MP’s lawyers accused his successor, Keir Starmer, of “inflammatory and disingenuous” attacks. Corbyn believes his suspension was handled unfairly and was the object of political interference. He was suspended in October after he rejected some of the damning findings of an Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour antisemitism, saying: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” The refusal to acknowledge the scale of the problem under his leadership caused a rift with Starmer, who felt his predecessor had undermined work to restore trust and confidence in Labour’s ability to tackle antisemitism. Corbyn was readmitted to the party by the national executive committee in November but Starmer ordered that the Labour whip be withheld until he apologised, which Corbyn has not done, effectively suspending him from the parliamentary party. At a hearing this month, Corbyn’s barrister Christopher Jacobs said the suspension was unlawful and in breach of contract, claiming that the MP needed “pre-action disclosure” before an “anticipated claim” against Labour. But Sullivan ruled: “Corbyn has sufficient material to make a decision on the merits of his case.” It is understood Corbyn expects to launch his main legal challenge soon, though court backlogs could mean it will be some time before the case is heard. The Guardian understands he is hoping to reach a compromise over his suspension in negotiations with Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown. Corbyn’s initial suspension was for three months and is to be reviewed in February, though it remains conditional on the apology demanded by Starmer. A Labour party spokesperson welcomed Wednesday’s decision, adding: “It is regrettable that the court’s time and our members’ money was spent on this matter. We look forward to drawing a line under this matter and uniting our party ahead of a vital set of elections.” It is understood the party will seek to recover its costs from Corbyn."
2021-01-27T18:01:02Z,politics,Politics,Key questions PM must answer on his handling of Covid crisis,"Boris Johnson has said “we truly did everything we could” to minimise loss of life from coronavirus, and insisted he takes “full responsibility” for the government’s handling of the pandemic. But when an inquiry is eventually carried out into the past 12 torrid months, the prime minister will have to face a series of difficult questions about key decisions he made. Failure to grasp the gravity of the emerging crisis As news first began to trickle out of China, triggering the government’s pandemic planning, the prime minister left the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to chair the first five meetings of the emergency Cobra committee about the virus. After carrying out a fraught reshuffle of his cabinet, Johnson decamped to the taxpayer-owned mansion of Chevening, and did not chair his first Covid Cobra meeting until 2 March, just before the first confirmed UK death from the virus. Comforted by advisers who compared the challenge to tackling seasonal flu, he tended to play down the seriousness of the pandemic in its early days, insisting it was “business as usual”. Most memorably, he told a Downing Street briefing that he “shook hands with everybody” during a hospital visit in early March.
Keeping Britain’s borders open With the support of scientific advisers, Johnson took the decision to lift border restrictions on 13 March last year after evidence emerged that the virus was already circulating in the UK, despite a strict quarantine regime for arrivals from Wuhan, in China. At the time, the harsher approach adopted early on by countries such as Singapore and New Zealand, involving flight bans and quarantine, were regarded as extreme by ministers. But many analysts now believe closing the borders was an important precaution that helped these countries and others fare much better. Delaying lockdown last March Johnson announced a full-blown lockdown on 23 March last year, with little idea at the time that it would remain in place until July, with many children kept out of the classroom until September. He had edged towards the shutdown via a series of intermediate steps, including banning mass public events and exhorting the public to avoid unnecessary social interaction and to work from home where possible. Only when modelling carried out by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London suggested there could be up to 500,000 deaths if the virus was not brought under control, and amid growing signs that the public were taking matters into their own hands, did Johnson order the public to stay at home. Some public health experts now believe an earlier shutdown could have saved many thousands of lives. Not sacking Dominic Cummings after his Barnard Castle jaunt When it emerged that his top adviser had flouted lockdown rules by driving 300-plus miles to Durham, with a day trip to a local town thrown in, Johnson stuck by him resolutely. He told the public at a Downing Street press conference that his aide had acted “responsibly and legally”, in crisscrossing the country, ostensibly to seek childcare for his young son, and then to test his eyesight, at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. His decision sparked an avalanche of angry emails to MPs and risked undermining public confidence in lockdown rules at a critical time. Outsourcing test and trace The former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding was brought in by Johnson and Matt Hancock to run the hugely costly test-and-trace system, which has relied heavily on private sector outsourcing and has not worked as effectively as hoped. Councils carrying out their own local contact-tracing operations have generally obtained better results than the call centres run by Serco and other providers, while management consultants have in some cases been paid £7,000 a day for their expertise in setting it up. Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have declined to fix holes in the social safety net – including the paucity of statutory sick pay – that have created a strong financial disincentive for many people to self-isolate. Rejecting calls from Sage for a ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown in September Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance gave the prime minister a briefing on 16 September setting out the dire risks of allowing the virus to run unchecked as cases increased into the autumn. Their colleagues on the Sage committee suggested a short “circuit-breaker” lockdown, perhaps over the October half-term. But Downing Street aides made clear at the time that Johnson considered it to be his role to weigh up scientific advice with other considerations, including the economic and social costs of a fresh lockdown. He therefore opted for a middle course, between the scientists’ proposal and the demands of many in his party to resist fresh restrictions: a beefed-up system of “tiers”, with tougher rules for the hardest-hit areas. In the event, as Whitty predicted when they were introduced, even the strictest, tier 3 rules did not do enough to restrain the virus, and a month-long lockdown was announced on 31 October. Resisting ‘cancelling Christmas’ A month before Christmas, the government agreed a plan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations that would allow up to three households to mix for a fixed five days over the festive period. Johnson then stuck resolutely by the plan, even as cases surged in London and Kent. Matt Hancock alerted the House of Commons to concerns about a new variant of the virus on 14 December, “which may be associated with the faster spread in the south-east of England”. When Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions two days later, the prime minister accused him of wanting to “cancel Christmas”. It was another three days, after being warned of the increased transmissibility of the variant, before Johnson announced a travel ban and halted Christmas mixing across London and much of the south of England: but families in many parts of England were still able to meet and mingle for a day."
2021-01-27T17:59:30Z,politics,Politics,"Labour failing to win back enough Tory voters, officials warn","Just 4% of Conservative voters are switching to Labour almost a year into Keir Starmer’s leadership, polls suggest, and Labour insiders fear the party could lose a slew of council seats in May’s local elections. Labour officials have been briefing that a “standstill” result, where the party gains no seats and minimises losses, would be a good outcome. One source said internal party projections in March 2020, in the wake of Boris Johnson’s landslide general election victory, suggested the party would lose 400 council seats and lose control of some local authorities, including Plymouth, Amber Valley, and Harlow. Elections in May 2020 were subsequently cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The party hopes it can avoid such big losses this May but it does not expect to make gains. “There are no sign in any of the polling we have seen that we are going to make any advances whatsoever,” a senior Labour source said. Of the constituencies that Labour lost to the Conservatives in 2019, 37 have council seats up for election this year. Shadow ministers have been warned that the party’s 20-point poll advance has come from cannibalising the Liberal Democrat vote, as that party languishes in single figures. “Put simply, we are winning back nowhere near enough Tory voters,” a senior source said. Strategists have also told shadow ministers that the party’s finances are in a perilous state – a situation that could worsen due to numerous court actions against the party. Starmer has been criticised by some on the left of the party for moderating some criticism of the government during the pandemic. Supporters are likely to want to see Labour make some gains at the expense of a party in government that has overseen one of the worst death tolls in Europe in the pandemic. Strategists’ internal verdict that the party is not doing enough to win back Conservative voters is likely to raise alarm among the party’s leftwingers, who have already rebelled on issues including defence. The 2021 elections are set to be the biggest in years. There are a number of key mayoral races, in London, the east Midlands, Bristol, and Tees Valley. Seats will be up for election in more than 140 county councils, district councils and unitary authorities, including 118 councils where this should have happened in 2020. There are also elections in the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. However, turnout is expected to be extremely low, given the pandemic and public uncertainty about whether the polls will even take place. Internal polling presented to the shadow cabinet two weeks ago suggested Labour will struggle to win the Tees Valley mayoral seat, now held by the Tory Ben Houchen, which had been seen as a bellwether for Labour’s resurrection in north-east England. The private research suggested the Conservatives could win with 66% of the first round of voting, a devastating result for Labour. Labour is more confident it may take the West of England mayoralty – covering parts of South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset – from the Conservatives, in a sign of how the party’s voter base may be shifting towards the southern middle classes. There is also some slim hope of the party taking the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoralty. Many of the council seats to be contested are in the areas that caused the most devastating blows for Labour in the 2019 election, when the Conservatives managed a huge sweep in the north of England in places held by Labour for many decades. Labour lost control of Bolsover district council in 2019 and the Tories also won the parliamentary seat. Labour expects the pattern to continue there. Council seats are also up for election in West Bromwich, where both parliamentary seats were taken by the Conservatives, including the seat of Labour’s former deputy leader Tom Watson. Labour expects to come third in the Scottish parliament elections, losing dozens of seats to the SNP. There are areas of deep concern in Wales too, particular in the north where Labour is defending areas that have turned Conservative in Westminster. It has to defend a number of slim majorities against Plaid Cymru."
2021-01-27T13:59:47Z,politics,Politics,"PM too slow to act throughout Covid pandemic, says Starmer","Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of being slow to implement a series of measures during the pandemic, as he piled pressure on the prime minister to explain why the UK’s official Covid-19 death toll had passed 100,000. Appearing at prime minister’s questions via video link from home, where he has been isolating, the Labour leader argued that Johnson had been slow on a number of issues throughout the crisis, including imposing lockdowns, providing PPE to frontline workers, protecting care homes, and getting test-and-trace efforts working. Starmer also pressed Johnson about plans to get children back in classrooms, calling on him to bring forward the vaccination of teachers and school staff so they can receive jabs once people in the first four priority categories have had theirs by mid-February. He said: “Yesterday we passed the tragic milestone of 100,000 Covid deaths in the United Kingdom. That’s not just a statistic. Behind every death is a grieving family, a mum, a dad, a sister, a brother, a friend, a colleague, a neighbour. “The question on everyone’s lips this morning is: why? The prime minister must have thought about that question a lot. So could he tell us why he thinks that the United Kingdom has ended up with a death toll of 100,000, the highest number in Europe?”
Johnson – who insisted his government “did everything we could” and was “deeply sorry for every life lost” when the figure was recorded on Tuesday – said he mourned “every death in this pandemic”. He said: “I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions I have taken, we’ve taken, during this pandemic to fight this disease. And, yes … there will indeed be a time when we must learn the lessons of… what has happened, reflect on them and prepare.” He added: “I don’t think that moment is now, when we are in the throes of fighting this wave of the new variant, when 37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals, and I think what the country wants is for us to come together as a parliament and … as politicians and to work to keep the virus under control… as we are, and to continue to roll out the fastest vaccination programme in Europe.” Starmer continued to press Johnson for an answer on why the UK had a Covid death toll higher than almost anywhere else in the world. He said: “The problem with the prime minister avoiding the question of ‘why?’ is that vital lessons won’t be learned.
“The reality is this: the prime minister was slow into the first lockdown last March, he was slow in getting protective equipment to the frontline, slow to protect our care homes, slow on testing and tracing, slow into the second lockdown in the autumn, slow to change the Christmas mixing rules, slow again into this third lockdown, delaying 13 days from 22 of December before implementing it. And I fear that he still hasn’t learned that lesson.” Turning his attention towards efforts to get children back in schools, Starmer said: “Everybody agrees that reopening our schools should be a national priority but that requires a plan and the prime minister hasn’t got a plan. So, as a first step, does he agree with me that once the first four categories of the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February he should bring forward the vaccination of key workers and use the window of the February half-term to vaccinate all teachers and all school staff?” The top four categories in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s priority list include all those 70 and over, the clinically extremely vulnerable, residents in care homes for older people and their carers, as well as frontline health and social care workers. Categories five to nine cover those aged 50 and over, as well as people aged 16-64 with underlying health conditions putting them at risk of serious disease. Responding to Starmer – who described the February half-term as a “fantastic opportunity” to vaccinate school teachers and staff – Johnson said all teachers in priority groups one to nine would be vaccinated “as a matter of priority”. But Starmer said he was “none the wiser” as to whether the prime minister agreed with him on the point."
2021-01-26T20:08:09Z,politics,Politics,Former Tory MP's posting as UK ambassador to Cuba raises fresh cronyism claims,"Boris Johnson’s government has been accused of fostering a culture of cronyism after the appointment of a former Conservative MP as ambassador to Cuba. George Hollingbery, the former minister and MP until 2019, was announced on Tuesday as the UK’s new “man in Havana”, a post usually taken by experienced diplomats. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) staff, said the appointment was evidence that the government is sacrificing the art of diplomacy to hand jobs to political friends.
“Sir George Hollingbery’s appointment, with little obvious relevant expertise and no competition, once again suggests that to this government, who you know is more important than what you know. “Ambassadorial posts are key to securing the UK’s interests abroad. Political appointments undermine the country’s longer-term interests, as they will almost inevitably change with a change in government,” he said. Penman said the UK should not follow the US practice of encouraging political appointments, which damage diplomatic relations. “As we’re witnessing in the United States at this moment, more than 200 key ambassadorial roles need to be filled as part of around 4,000 civil service posts that have to be appointed by the new administration,” he said. Hollingbery, a former close ally of Theresa May, was a minister in the department of trade when he stood down from parliament in 2019. After entering parliament, he was a parliamentary private secretary to May in the home office and No 10, and a lord commissioner to the Treasury. Before entering parliament, he was the deputy leader of Winchester council and developed a veterinary chain which he sold to the firm Pets at Home. Welcoming the new ambassador, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “Sir George Hollingbery brings a wealth of experience to the role, including from his time as a trade minister.” Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, which has launched legal action against the government over the handing of Covid contracts to “VIPs”, said: “Perhaps he is a good chap but he doesn’t have any obvious qualifications for the role. Treating these posts as political gifts can’t serve the national interest – and it must be pretty dispiriting for talented and hard-working Foreign Office staff.” The government has faced criticism for making major Coronavirus-related appointments without proper process. Dido Harding, whose husband is the Conservative MP John Penrose, who is close to Johnson, is now the head of test and trace. Kate Bingham, whose husband is the minister Jesse Norman, who was at Eton with Johnson, was appointed in May as the chair of the UK vaccine taskforce. She stood down from the role at the end of 2020. Retired Labour MPs were also given plum diplomatic roles under Tony Blair. Paul Boateng, the former Labour minister, was the UK’s ambassador to South Africa from 2005. Helen Liddell became the high commissioner to Australia in the same year, and was followed in the role by Valerie Amos. Under the Conservatives, Ed Llewellyn, David Cameron’s former chief of staff, was given the role of ambassador to France. A government source said: “The FDA’s criticism is nothing but pointless political posturing.” An FCDO spokesperson said: “Sir George has a wealth of international and government experience that he will bring to this role, including from his time as trade minister. It is not unusual to make political appointments in the diplomatic service.”"
2021-01-26T18:55:12Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: Johnson 'sorry for every life lost' and takes 'full responsibility' as death toll passes 100,000 – as it happened","UK government death toll surpasses 100,000 after 1,631 new fatalities reportedThe UK reported 20,089 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, compared to Mondayâ€™s 22,195. A further 1,631 deaths were reported, up from Mondayâ€™s 592. The governmentâ€™s overall death toll now stands at 100,162. Boris Johnson has insisted his government â€œdid everything we couldâ€� to limit coronavirus deaths and expressed sorrow after the total UK death toll exceeded 100,000 on nearly every metric, but refused to discuss the reasons why it might be so high. Downing Street sought to play down any potential row over the EUâ€™s threat to potentially restrict vaccine exports to the UK, saying ministers do not foresee likely disruption to UK vaccine supplies. Health minister Matt Hancock said protectionism was not the right approach after an EU proposal to restrict the exports of shots. Teachers, police and people with learning disabilities will need to be considered for the next round of Covid-19 vaccinations, said NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens. The governmentâ€™s proposed mandatory hotel quarantine measures for travellers arriving from high-risk countries could wipe out nearly Â£548m a day from the UK economy in lost travel, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The Scottish government continues to come under fire for its slow pace of vaccine rollout, as UK government sources confirm that Scotland has been supplied with nearly one million doses, yet under half a million Scots have so far received their first dose. Home secretary Priti Patel claimed in the Commons that the UK Border Force is now conducting â€œ100% compliance checksâ€� on whether people arriving in the country are following quarantine orders. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, rebuffed calls from MPs for more details on future coronavirus support packages, but said further economic help was coming The NHS England boss, Sir Simon Stevens, told the the health and social care committee that the governmentâ€™s pledge to â€œlevel upâ€� across the country should include efforts to eliminate health inequalities. There are now more than 6 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as efforts to speed up the inoculations process continue to intensify. But as more of those in the highest risk age groups get their jabs, there are growing concerns in government about the rates of vaccine hesitancy in some black and minority ethnic communities. The number of children of key workers attending school in England last week has declined slightly, according to official government statistics, after head teachers expressed safety concerns about high numbers of pupils attending during the current lockdown. More than 23,000 UK workers at supermarket Lidl are to get a Â£200 bonus in recognition of their hard work during the pandemic. Health officials are concerned the West Midlands could soon overtake London to become the region with the highest Covid-19 case rate in the country. National infection rates have fallen by 24% in the past seven days, while the West Midlands has recorded a much slower decline of just 8%. The German government has challenged reports of a lower-than-expected efficacy rate of the AstraZeneca vaccine for older people, while reiterating concerns about the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giantâ€™s data reporting. The UKâ€™s unemployment rate hit its highest in nearly five years in the three months to November.The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate rose to 5% in the three months to the end of November â€“ representing more than 1.7 million people â€“ from 4.9% in the three months to the end of October, reaching the highest level since April 2016. Unemployment was 4% in February before the pandemic struck. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the second week of January had highest Covid deaths in England and Wales since April.

2021-01-26T14:32:15Z,politics,Politics,EU citizens offered financial incentives to leave UK,"EU citizens are being offered financial incentives to leave the UK, the Guardian has learned, months before the deadline to apply for settled status. From 1 January EU citizens have quietly been added to the government’s voluntary returns scheme where financial support is offered as an encouragement to return to their country of origin. Payments can include flights and up to £2,000 resettlement money. The scheme is designed to help some migrants in the UK to leave voluntarily. People working to help vulnerable EU citizens in the UK said the offer of money to return home contradicted the government’s claim that it was doing everything it could to encourage people to register for settled status. The deadline for Europeans living in the UK to apply for the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) is 30 June.
Benjamin Morgan, who runs the EU homeless rights project at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: “It is clear from our casework that some of the most vulnerable EU citizens are yet to resolve their status. Barriers to application and delays in Home Office decision-making remain significant factors. “This mixed messaging around settled status on the one hand and voluntary returns on the other, seriously undermines the government’s claim that the rights of vulnerable Europeans will be protected after Brexit.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Some people may choose not to obtain status under EUSS and may not wish to remain in the UK after the deadline. That is why we have written to stakeholders to inform them that EEA nationals who wish to leave the UK may now be eligible for support to help them do so under the voluntary returns scheme.” The news came as research from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JWCI) warned that thousands of European key workers risked losing their legal right to remain in the UK. The report, titled When the Clapping Stops: EU Care Workers After Brexit, warns that thousands of European citizens currently fulfilling key worker roles in the care sector, as well as those working in construction, manufacturing and agriculture, are at risk of losing their legal status and face removal from the UK. Of 295 care workers surveyed by the charity, one in seven were unsure what EUSS was, one in three had not heard about it before being in touch with JCWI, and one in three did not know there was a deadline for the settlement scheme, nor when it was. Most of the surveys were conducted between January and March last year. “If even a tiny fraction of the estimated EEA+ (EU, EEA and Swiss) residents are unable to apply in time, tens of thousands will lose their status overnight,” the report states. “Without urgent action, the care sector is likely to be devastated,” it adds. The report calls for the immediate lifting of the deadline for applying to the EUSS, for European citizens to be automatically granted settled status, and for an end to “hostile environment” policies. It states that workers in industries with poor conditions, low pay and insecure contracts such as care, construction and agriculture are particularly at risk of slipping through the cracks in the scheme. Those unable to apply on time will be subject to measures including detention and removal and could be criminalised for working, renting accommodation or driving a car. Chai Patel, of JCWI, said: “Our research scares me because the people we talked to were far less vulnerable than other groups hidden in exploitative working conditions, who no one has been able to reach to ask questions. Despite warnings from us and many other experts, the Home Office is burying its head in the sand about this just like they did with Windrush and making excuses instead of finding solutions.” JCWI is not the only organisation to warn that some might slip through the net. The Migration Observatory has expressed concern that some groups are at risk of being unregistered by the 30 June deadline. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said the JCWI report presented “an incredibly misleading picture of the EU settlement scheme” as it relied on “a small survey of less than 300 people conducted a year ago”. “Since then millions of applications have been received by the scheme,” he said. “We have now had almost 4.9m applications to the hugely successful EU settlement scheme. There is now less than six months before the 30 June 2021 deadline and I would encourage all those eligible to apply now to secure their rights under UK law. A wide range of support is available online and over the telephone if you need it and we are funding 72 organisations across the UK to ensure no one gets left behind.”"
2021-01-25T20:09:53Z,politics,Politics,Thérèse Coffey's Zoom walkout leaves even Piers Morgan lost for words,"Thérèse Coffey is normally a glass half-full kind of minister. Sent out to do the media round on Monday morning, she even managed to claim to LBC’s Nick Ferrari that getting just 1,868 young people – out of a targeted 120,000 – starting roles on the government’s kickstarter scheme had “actually been a huge success”. I hate to think what a massive failure might look like. But even the work and pensions secretary struggled when she came up against Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Having first delivered the classic line that “the best way to tackle this virus is to avoid contracting it in the first place” – no shit – Coffey made the elementary error of giving a direct answer to a direct question. Other ministers have gone to great lengths to appear totally mystified and avoid saying why the UK has the highest coronavirus death rate in the world, but Coffey just jumped straight in. It was because we had an ageing population and an obesity crisis. So it was basically our own fault and we had it coming. We were living far too long and eating far too much. If only we had all died younger or half-starved to death, then all of this could have been avoided. The humanity in her response was touching. Morgan couldn’t believe his luck. So what you’re saying, he observed, was that we Brits were basically too old and too fat. Whereupon the minister completely lost it and accused Morgan of being insulting for repeating back what she had just said. Only Coffey wouldn’t have it. Apparently there was no link between an ageing population and people getting old and a population getting obese and being fat. Or maybe she was just irritated with herself for failing to mention a succession of failures in government policy that had considerably boosted the mortality rate. Whichever it was, Thérèse spent the next two minutes trying to distance herself from ever having brought up “old” and “fat”. Morgan was just trying to twist her words. What she had meant by ageing was an important boom in senior living. And by obese she had meant that under the Tories there was no longer anyone going hungry; it was just a coincidence that the poorest people tended to have the worst diets. Realising that what she had hoped would be an easy interview had turned into a car crash, Coffey just reached for the off switch on her Zoom call. It’s one way of terminating an interview, I suppose. If not one generally found in the politician’s handbook. Time’s up, got to go, she said desperately before her screen went dead. “Wow,” Morgan commented. Wow indeed. It’s not often that the TV presenter is lost for words. It had been eight months since Coffey had last been on GMB. Don’t hold your breath for another appearance in the next eight months. How Coffey must wish she was sometimes let loose in No 10 as Matt Hancock had a rather more comfortable time when fronting the Downing Street press conference. Largely because he had nothing new to say and because he was able to ignore any questions that felt remotely tricky. Rather he – along with the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, and Public Health England’s Susan Hopkins – eased their way through the 45-minute session as if it was a cosy fireside chat. A few harsh reminders that the virus was far from beaten and that people still needed to obey the rules, interspersed with the good news that more than 6.5m vaccinations had been given and that the early evidence was that the vaccine was effective against the UK variant. This was the ideal gig for the health secretary. Normally he’s sent out when there’s a crisis of some sort going on. But now we’ve got so used to every day being near enough a crisis, that when things stay more or less the same and the death and hospitalisation figures are slightly lower then it’s cause for celebration in No 10. Even though the numbers would have been considered completely terrifying if anyone had mentioned them as a possibility even a month ago. Disaster has become the new normal, so when things are no worse than they were the day before it almost feels as if a corner has been turned. And over the course of the pandemic, Door Matt has become quite accomplished at sounding reassuring yet resolute. Or maybe our expectations of him and other ministers have become so low we now mistake mediocrity for comfort. It also helps when no one actually asks any tricky questions. Had Hancock been asked the killer Coffey question of why the UK has the highest global death figures then he might have struggled. Instead he was asked when the lockdown restrictions might be lifted – though no one mentioned schools – and was quite easily able to point out that rather depended when deaths, hospitalisations, variants and vaccines co-aligned. It appears the rate of infection is no longer part of the equation. He also hinted that he was in favour of quarantine hotels for all arrivals – not just for those from areas with known variants, without having either to specify how many beds they expected to need or why the government had taken so long to come round to this idea. In fact, by the end, Door Matt even looked as if he was rather enjoying the press briefing. For the rest of us, it had been three-quarters of an hour of our lives we would never get back. Still, there are days when even Hancock gets an even break. And as Coffey will tell you, there are advantages to being dull."
2021-01-25T18:19:50Z,politics,Politics,Hancock stresses need for caution at borders; cases fall to lowest daily level for a month – as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has hinted that the government will impose tough new hotel quarantine rules for people arriving in the UK. For some days ministers have been discussing plans for people arriving in the UK to be forced to quarantine in hotels, but there has been disagreement about whether the new conditions should just apply to people visiting from countries where the Covid risk is particularly high, or whether they should apply more broadly. Asked if he favoured the hotel quarantine rules applying to all arrivals, Hancock said the â€œprecautionary principleâ€� should apply - implying he favoured stricter rather than looser rules. He said: I think it is incredibly important that we are cautious at the border ... It is important that we protect from new variants should they have vaccine evasion. And it is also reasonable to take a precautionary principle to protect this country whilst we work on the science and the analysis of the different variants that are discovered around the world. Earlier Boris Johnson also hinted that he favoured more comprehensive rather than more limited restrictions, saying the policy should provide â€œthe maximum possible protection against reinfection from abroadâ€�. (See 11.49am.) Ministers are expected to take a decision tomorrow. The UK has recorded the lowest number of new Covid cases for more than a month, although the number of people on mechanical ventilation in hospital with the illness has hit a record high. (See 4.36pm.) Schools in England are not expected to start fully reopening until at least early March, Downing Street has indicated, as Tory MPs and childrenâ€™s advocates pressurised Boris Johnson to set out a timetable for the process. Workers who are regularly exposed to coronavirus through their job, including care home workers and nurses, are more likely to die from the virus than people in other professions, according to fresh analysis. Brendan Clarke-Smith, a 40-year-old Conservative MP who received the coronavirus vaccine after spending an afternoon volunteering at a local hospital, has said this happened because there were some left-over doses, which would have otherwise gone to waste. The vaccine manufacturer Moderna has started work on a booster for its Covid jab to improve protection against a new variant of coronavirus first detected in South Africa. The Covid vaccine is failing to reach thousands of elderly people who receive care in their own homes, because they are too frail to travel to vaccination centres or fear infection if they do, a care provider has said. The UK is at risk of becoming a failed state and breaking up unless there are deep reforms of the way the country is governed, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has said his party would boycott a Scottish independence referendum set up without the approval of Westminster. The Labour partyâ€™s lawyers have written to the director of public prosecutions alleging that Shaun Bailey, the Conservative partyâ€™s candidate for London mayor, used fraud to influence upcoming elections by publishing leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."

On paper, Kwarteng already had the necessary attributes when he arrived in parliament in 2010. An Eton scholarship, a Cambridge PhD, a City career and a string of books on history and politics that brandished his rightwing and intellectual credentials. But former colleagues have said he also has a Boris Johnson-like tendency towards impulsiveness and free-thinking that occasionally gets him into trouble. The MP for Spelthorne failed to disguise his contempt for David Cameron’s touchy-feely approach, which put his career on hold while his peers flourished, and he has occasionally wooed a warlord and oil barons when others might have walked away. One former minister said it would be tough for Kwarteng, a free marketeer, to join a government in the midst of the biggest economic intervention since the war. “Kwasi has a huge and quick brain, but he is also restless. He will flourish if he can knuckle down and subdue what he really thinks. But that is a big if.” Kwarteng, 45, who is of Ghanaian heritage, was born in Waltham Forest, east London. He was sent away to boarding school by his economist father and barrister mother at the age of eight. At Eton he was seen by fellow pupils as an earnest and thoughtful boy who on occasions was seen discussing TS Eliot with fellow pupils. Although trained as a serious historian at Trinity – and part of a winning University Challenge team on television in 1995, when he famously muttered “fuck” while trying to recall an answer – in parliament he transformed into a professional politician whose eyes were firmly on government. But he faltered after falling foul of Cameron and George Osborne. In 2013 he advocated cutting the VAT rate to 15%, funded by adding the charge to children’s clothes and food, reportedly upsetting Downing Street. Then he criticised the chancellor’s Help to Buy housing scheme. One colleague said he could not help himself. “Kwasi really did not rate their politics or their intellect. And they were a little intimidated by him,” he said. In 2012, he and other Brexiters from the parliamentary newcomers – Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Chris Skidmore – published Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity, which included a passage seen as evidence he was ready to take on the unions over workers’ rights. “The British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor,” it said. He clocked up many air miles on fact-finding missions paid for by Tory donors and foreign governments. Kwarteng defended the principle of visiting foreign autocratic regimes, saying it offered a greater chance of influencing their behaviour than “shouting from the sidelines without ever setting foot in these places”. In January 2017, Kwarteng argued in favour of the UK and the US backing Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan warlord, and dropping support for the Government of National Accord (GNA), noting that Haftar controlled much of the country’s oil. “Such a move would not strictly conform to the ideals of ‘democratic state building’ but it might provide a stable government to give Libya some control of its borders,” he wrote in the Evening Standard. Three months later, Kwarteng was photographed shaking the hand of Haftar after being flown to Libya by the Conservative Middle East Forum. Haftar is now being sued in the US for $50m (£36.6m), accused of war crimes including starvation sieges that forced families to eat grass and tree bark to survive. Kwarteng accepted funds from fossil fuel investors and advisers during the last general election campaign. The Guardian has previously disclosed that these included £7,500 from IPGL, a holding company with a 40% stake in Cluff Energy Africa, a London-based company that prospects for oil in west Africa. IPGL is owned by the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer. Kwarteng also received £4,000 from Majid Jafar, the chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, a privately held company with oil and gas operations in the Middle East. Jafar was a contemporary of Kwarteng at Eton. At the time, a spokesperson for Kwarteng said there was no conflict of interest and that all donations were in line with the ministerial code. Kwarteng has built up a reputation for being good company among senior Conservatives and has dated several senior party women, including the former home secretary Amber Rudd. He married Harriet Edwards, a City solicitor, in 2019. Kwarteng lunched Brexiters at the Carlton Club, where he would reportedly enjoy a bottle of the house bordeaux. The diarist Sasha Swire, wife of the former MP Hugo Swire, described him as “essentially an academic; he is enthusiastic and bombastic, and barely draws breath.” Kwarteng consistently backed Johnson to become leader and was rewarded with a job as energy minister in 2017, and so he will already know some of the workings of his department. For clues at to what he might do in office, Britannia Unchained said that in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea “a combination of private enterprise and effective government policy has enabled economic growth rates which we can only dream about in the west.” In one of his first acts as business secretary, Kwarteng told MPs last week that he was reviewing how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit. He said the plan was to maintain “a really good high standard for workers in high employment and a high-wage economy. That’s what I’m focusing on. And so the idea that we’re trying to whittle down standards, that’s not at all plausible or true.”"
2021-01-25T14:44:54Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson’s lockdown slip-up contradicts the official line,"The news that the prime minister is looking at easing some restrictions by mid-February came as a surprise to many reporters – and to No 10. The slip by Boris Johnson went against what insiders have been briefing for many weeks: that the easing of restrictions is a long way off and that this time there will be extreme caution. “The one to four [most vulnerable] groups are going to be vaccinated by 15 February. Before then we will be looking at the potential of relaxing some measures,” he said. Aides have underlined to reporters that Johnson’s comments were misinterpreted – “looking at” only means the government will be starting to make decisions, and that nothing will change before the 15 February review point. Less generously, it was a bit of a tongue twist from Johnson. Government sources have underlined again and again that nothing will be eased until ministers are certain the vaccine programme is advanced enough to allow it. Put simply, they do not want to countenance the possibility of a fourth lockdown or to pull students back out of the classroom once they return. When England unlocks, it will be for good.
“All you will hear every day from any cabinet minister is caution,” one senior cabinet source says. “Every day journalists want to write a new story about unlocking. At the moment there is nothing to say.” Johnson’s tone has markedly changed during this lockdown, with the prime minister far more willing to see off lockdown sceptics. It is not quite true that there are no plans at all – tentative roadmaps are being drawn up in Whitehall that would begin to ease restrictions in March, perhaps some sports or non-essential shops. This time, the prime minister has made a public commitment that the first thing to reopen will be schools and he will face massive pressure from his backbenchers to make that so. It is still possible that some pupils may return in a phased way after February half-term – Johnson was emphatic that journalists should “not assume” it will be Easter. But all of those plans are very much in pencil – though it looks like this week will be critical to examine the direction of the data, as Gavin Williamson has promised schools will be given at least a fortnight’s notice. There will be more and more pressure on Johnson, who likes to please, to set out the path. Conservative MPs are starting to clamour to see that roadmap – and the clamour will become a roar as the 15 February deadline approaches. The ambition of “lockdown until there are no more lockdowns” is straightforward, but there are obvious threats. The most dangerous is that there is a new variant that is resistant to the current vaccine – either one that develops in the UK which remains a distinct possibility given the amount of virus still in circulation in the UK. Or it could be one imported from abroad.
Though scientists are confident that the current vaccines could be tweaked to provide protection against a new strain, it would significantly set back the jabs programme. The fear of a new variant abroad is the key driver for the UK to re-examine its border policy – and why cabinet ministers such as Priti Patel and Matt Hancock are pushing for a blanket strategy of quarantining all travellers. Rishi Sunak, who has been the driver behind many decisions to keep the economy as open as possible, is also in favour of a harder approach – though the chancellor wants to see a specific plan for how the hotel quarantine measures will end before he gives it his firm backing in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The vaccination programme is the UK’s most precious asset. It is in the Treasury’s interests to also make sure the strategy of “the lockdown to end all lockdowns” works. There are many who will say this strategy comes a year too late."
2021-01-25T13:45:04Z,politics,Politics,English schools not expected to start fully reopening until at least March,"Schools in England are not expected to start fully reopening until at least early March, Downing Street has indicated, as Tory MPs and children’s advocates pressurised Boris Johnson to set out a timetable for the process. The government has promised to reassess lockdown measures on 15 February, and Johnson’s spokesperson said this would be the point at which the evidence would be examined to see if any easing could take place. The spokesperson also reaffirmed Gavin Williamson’s pledge to give schools at least two weeks’ notice of reopening, meaning it would be March before the process could begin. The comments came after the prime minister said he would examine “the potential of relaxing some measures” connected to lockdown once the top four categories of vulnerable adults had had their first Covid-19 vaccination, due to happen by mid-February. “It has always been our intention to ease restrictions when we can from that point on the 15th, and schools are obviously our top priority,” Johnson’s spokesperson said. “We will undertake the review on the 15th. Then we will set out what happens post the 15th.” Asked whether the two-week notice period was confirmed, he said: “You’ve got what Gavin Williamson said yesterday about ensuring we give a two-week heads-up before we can open schools.” Earlier on Monday, the 70-strong Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of Conservative MPs said ministers must set out a timetable for the process. The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said that while she accepted that the high coronavirus infection rates made reopening schools difficult, more clarity was needed and there seemed to be a “slight sense of defeatism” over the issue. On Sunday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to commit to either mid-February, after the half-term break, or after Easter as a point for schools to reopen fully. Mark Harper, the former chief whip who now chairs the CRG, reiterated the group’s call for reopening efforts to begin three weeks after the top four priority groups for the coronavirus vaccine have received their first dose. “It seems to us [that] at that point you need to start bringing the economy back to life, and the first thing that needs to be reopened are our schools,” Harper told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “All we’re asking for at this point is for the government to set out that sort of plan, based on milestones, based on evidence, so that school leaders, parents, children, have some hope and know what to expect.” Harper said the government could expect dissent from MPs if it did not take this action. “Set that plan out, and enable us to debate that plan in parliament. I would love the government to set a plan out. I’m not trying to second-guess the government. But if the government doesn’t come forward with a plan, it can’t be surprised if other people will fill the vacuum.” Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons education select committee and has been an influential voice on the issue, said urgent action was needed. He told Times Radio: “We need to get our teachers and support staff vaccinated. That will make a big difference. But I’m hugely worried about the impact on mental health, on educational attainment, on safeguarding, the longer we keep our schools closed.” Longfield said the long and repeated closures of schools since March had brought about a huge rise in mental health issues among children, with one in six now experiencing problems, and had also widened attainment gaps. “We’re looking at children with sleep disruption, who have lost the ability to cope, who are fearful about their future,” she told Today. “This is a very serious issue for those children, and for their families.” She said families “will need hope and clarity about what comes next”, and she called for a robust Covid testing system for schools, and the possible use of vaccinations. “There is a sort of slight sense of defeatism in the air,” she said of the government’s attitude, arguing that unions and local councils meanwhile believed they could get at least some classes back before too long. “It can be done, and I think that’s what parents need to know now,” she said. “I would like a slide on every No 10 briefing to show progress back to school, to keep parents and children informed.”"
2021-01-25T13:33:17Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Tories would boycott unofficial independence referendum,"Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, has said his party would boycott a Scottish independence referendum set up without the approval of Westminster. Ross said Scottish National party proposals for Holyrood to empower itself to stage a fresh referendum if Nicola Sturgeon’s party wins a majority in May’s election should not be seen as credible or legitimate. He urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to reject any attempt by the SNP to sidestep the current legal arrangements. Under the Scotland Act 1998, Holyrood can only hold an official referendum after being granted a section 30 order by Westminster. Ross said on Monday that Sturgeon had until now promised she would only support a fresh vote on that basis; it was the process in the 2014 referendum, and one she had described as the “gold standard”. Describing any other route as a “wildcat referendum”, Ross said: “Anything that constitutes [an] unofficial referendum should be boycotted. It shouldn’t be given any credibility. It is again a divisive tactic by the SNP to split our country apart.” He added: “I would take no part in that. And I would hope anyone – not just unionist supporters – but people who support democracy, should not take part in these wildcat, unofficial referendums. “So, yes, I would make that plea to Scottish Labour, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and anyone who believes in democracy in Scotland.” Sturgeon told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that if the SNP won a majority in May’s elections, based on a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum, her party would have a clear democratic mandate. “The polls now show that a majority of people in Scotland want independence,” she said. “If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months’ time on proposition of giving the people that choice, then what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?” The SNP published a pre-election blueprint at the weekend proposing that if Westminster ignored the election result and continued to refuse a section 30 order, Holyrood would legislate to hold an indicative referendum itself. This policy, which is likely to trigger legal challenges that would end up in the UK supreme court, is expected to be central to the SNP’s May election manifesto and adds to pressure on the Tories and Labour to offer an alternative. Many Labour MSPs believe the party should support a referendum if the SNP wins a majority – a position rejected by Keir Starmer and the Scottish Labour party’s leadership. Both parties are edging towards proposing a UK-wide constitutional convention or commission but have so far failed to set out their proposals in detail. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown added to that pressure on Monday by urging Boris Johnson to set up a constitutional commission to investigate wholesale changes to the UK’s structures. Writing in the Telegraph, he said: “I believe the choice is now between a reformed state and a failed state. [It] is indeed Scotland where dissatisfaction is so deep that it threatens the end of the United Kingdom.” The dispute raises significant questions about the legality of holding a referendum without a section 30 order. Holyrood’s presiding officer would rule on whether the bill was competent; ministers could push it through without that endorsement but then would face a legal challenge in the supreme court. Using public funds to draft the legislation and stage one could also be beyond the Scottish government’s powers Rona Mackay, an SNP MSP, said Ross’s boycott calls were “Trumpian”. She said: “Opposition parties have a right to oppose independence – but they certainly do not have a right to deny the Scottish people the chance to determine their own future. “The Tories are utterly terrified of the verdict of the people, but this Trump-like attempt to deny the results of free and fair elections will not stand.”"
2021-01-25T11:49:56Z,politics,Politics,Labour writes to CPS over 'fraudulent' Tory London mayoral leaflets,"The Labour party’s lawyers have written to the director of public prosecutions alleging that Shaun Bailey, the Conservative party’s candidate for London mayor, used fraud to influence upcoming elections by publishing leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia. Bailey’s campaign last month drew cross-party condemnation for the leaflets, which said Londoners’ council taxes would rise “if you do not take action” and vote against the incumbent mayor, Sadiq Khan. The leaflets did not explicitly mention the Conservative party. Labour’s complaint called the leaflets a “fraudulent device” to gain undue influence, as described by the 1983 Representation of the People Act. Under the act, Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, is responsible for making inquiries into potential offences. The London mayoral election has been scheduled for May 2021, a year later than initially planned because of the coronavirus pandemic. Khan is the strong favourite to win. Shaun Bailey’s campaign has faced repeated criticism for its tactics during the long build-up to the mayoral election. In November the campaign published leaflets and a website labelled as “Transport for London bailout facts”, which contained attacks on Khan’s policies, before the “City Hall” leaflets. In both cases the campaign materials did not explicitly mention the Conservative party, only including the legally required reference to Shaun Bailey at the bottom, and the address of the Conservative party’s campaign headquarters. Labour’s lawyers, the London-based firm Edwards Duthie Shamash, wrote that the “City Hall” leaflets were “preventing the free exercise of the franchise of electors”. The letter, dated 21 January and seen by the Guardian, said Bailey’s leaflets were an “attempt to attract the reader’s attention with the pretence that it is issued from the headquarters of the London mayor and the Greater London Authority, such that it is an official communication from a public authority with powers of taxation”. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The Conservative party must immediately apologise for the actions of their London mayoral campaign and demonstrate that they are committed to following the law.” Labour has also written to the British Polling Council, the association of pollsters, calling for the Conservative party to publish evidence for a claim made in a separate email newsletter that “a majority of voters now believe Shaun Bailey will do a better job as mayor” than Khan. The newsletter said the claim was based on “our latest internal polling”, but most publicly available polling has shown leads of 20 points or more for Khan. Karen Buck, the Labour MP who chairs Khan’s re-election campaign, asked the council to try to identify the source of the polling. Members of the body have committed to publishing underlying polling data. Bailey’s campaign has struggled to cut through during the extended campaign. The Conservatives argue that Khan mismanaged Transport for London’s finances before it required a government bailout during the pandemic and blame him for delays to Crossrail. However, Bailey has faced criticism for comments made before he was a candidate that appeared to suggest that poorer people could not be trusted with money, and for suggesting homeless people would have enough money to save £5,000 for a house deposit. A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said: “We published our leaflet because Londoners have a right to know when their mayor is planning to hike council tax. The government have repeatedly said that Sadiq Khan does not have to raise council tax to fund TfL. So this is Sadiq Khan’s decision – and his alone.” The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it had received the letter but declined to comment further."
2021-01-25T08:57:48Z,politics,Politics,"UK at risk of becoming failed state, says Gordon Brown","The UK is at risk of becoming a failed state and breaking up unless there are deep reforms of the way the country is governed, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. “I believe the choice is now between a reformed state and a failed state,” Brown wrote in the Daily Telegraph. “It is indeed Scotland where dissatisfaction is so deep that it threatens the end of the United Kingdom.” Brown, who was chancellor of the exchequer for 10 years from 1997 and became prime minister in 2007, said many Britons were disillusioned with the way the country was governed by and in the interests of a London-centric elite. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday morning, he accused Boris Johnson and his government of being out of touch. He said: “I do think Boris Johnson has not quite understood how deep the resentment is, how the lack of trust is causing him a problem, a problem about his acceptability in different parts of the country.” On Sunday, polls carried out in the four nations of the UK showed that a majority of voters thought Scotland was likely to be independent within the next 10 years. In Scotland, the poll found that 49% of people backed independence compared with 44% opposed – a margin of 52% to 48% if undecideds are excluded. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, promised a new referendum on independence if the Scottish National party won another majority in elections to the Scottish parliament in May. Brown said Sturgeon and her party viewed the future of the country “in terms of a battle between Scotland and the rest of the UK” and claimed that Scots were more interested in action to solve social problems than independence. The coronavirus pandemic had exposed divisions between different parts of the UK, Brown said. “You’ve got not only the Scottish first minister but you’ve got the regional mayors saying they are not consulted and listened to, you’ve got the Welsh first minister saying their letters are not even replied to by Boris Johnson, you’ve got no mechanism, no forum for coordinating the regions and nations, and I think that the public are fed up.” Brown called for fundamental constitutional changes led by a “commission on democracy” that would “review the way the whole United Kingdom is governed”. He suggested setting up citizens’ assemblies in the regions of the UK, telling Today: “You can’t have the elites talking to the elites, you have got to involve the people in what you are talking about, and they have got views now on how the pandemic was dealt with, how the recession has been dealt with.” A Sunday Times poll found that 47% of people in Northern Ireland still wanted to remain in the UK, 42% were in favour of a united Ireland, and 11% were undecided. When asked if they supported a referendum on a united Ireland within the next five years, 51% said yes and 44% no. In Wales, where support for independence has been weakest, 23% backed leaving the UK and 31% supported holding a referendum. Brown wrote in the Telegraph: “No country can have national integration without political inclusion, and the commission might start by learning from the experience of countries like Australia, Canada, Germany and America where, partly because of British influence in times past, second chambers are senates of their regions, and minorities who can easily be outvoted are guaranteed a stronger voice.”"
2021-01-25T07:18:59Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus vaccine: councils to get £23m to encourage high-risk groups to have jab,"The government will provide £23m in funding to dozens of councils in England to help fight misinformation around coronavirus vaccines and to encourage uptake of the jab among more high-risk communities. Councils with plans to contact people from minority ethnic backgrounds, older people and disabled people have been chosen for the financial support, as these groups have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and are more likely to be dealing with its long-term effects. A number of experts and politicians recently called for people in high-risk minority ethnic groups to be prioritised for immunisation, and for them to be targeted by publicity campaigns aimed at tackling vaccine scepticism. There are concerns about vaccine uptake within some groups, after research showed up to 72% of black people said they were unlikely or very unlikely to have the jab. Meanwhile, a number of BAME community leaders have taken action in the fight against vaccine hesitancy, with Qari Asim, the chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, and a number of other Muslim leaders telling the Guardian they had started a campaign to encourage BAME communities to get vaccinated. Their activism has included hundreds of mosques recently using Friday prayers to spread coronavirus awareness and combat myths around vaccinations. Local councils and voluntary organisations will use a community champions schemes to communicate accurate health information, using outreach techniques such as helplines, school programmes and workplace engagement. They will also phone people in at-risk groups, as well as hosting training sessions to help people provide information and advice in an effort to expand networks of local champions. Community champions schemes are in place across various parts of England. The backing of local leaders and advocates to “communicate public health messages with credibility and impact” was one of a number of recommendations issued by the government’s Race Disparity Unit (RDU) advisory group in October.
The funding will also go towards supporting outreach campaigns working with Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said. Jenrick warned in a statement that “false information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives”, and he said the central government money would allow local authorities and community groups to build on their existing campaigns to provide people with accurate information. The vaccine deployment minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “We want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine.” He said he had been working alongside faith and community leaders to “ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine”. According to Office for National Statistics figures up to late July, the Covid death rate for black African men in England and Wales was 62 per 100,000, compared with 12 per 100,000 for white men. The rate for men from Bangladeshi backgrounds was 61 per 100,000."
2021-01-25T07:00:08Z,politics,Politics,More than 2m people could use postal votes in Scotland elections,"Scottish electoral officials believe upwards of 2 million people could use postal votes if Holyrood elections take place in May, to avoid using polling stations during the Covid pandemic. Scotland’s councils and electoral bodies have said the parliamentary election on 6 May could be held safely if the pandemic remains under control, but senior officials have told the Guardian it will present significant and costly logistical challenges. Polling by the Electoral Commission, the UK’s elections regulator, has found that up to 68% of Scotland’s 4 million voters could opt for postal votes – nearly four times the normal number, adding significantly to the cost of staging it.
Scotland’s political parties are planning to promote postal voting heavily among their supporters and target voters in the next few weeks to minimise the risk from the pandemic and mitigate the impact on turnout. It is understood the UK Labour party is considering a similar campaign for the English council, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections, borrowing the “vote early” slogan used in the recent US elections. Both the UK and Scottish governments say publicly all elections planned across England, Wales and Scotland can be held as scheduled on 6 May, but privately doubts are being voiced about whether it will be possible. Some council leaders are worried about the significant costs and health risks of staging an election, and have asked the umbrella body for the country’s 32 councils, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, to assess whether it can be safely carried out. Many council officials work from home, greatly increasing the organisational challenges of organising 2m postal votes, and those of running the election as a whole. A number of Labour politicians have called for the Holyrood elections to be postponed, arguing the uncertainties of the pandemic, the costs and logistics, and the risks that voter turnout could be heavily affected if some areas are hit by fresh Covid outbreaks. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said on Friday the election could still be safely held and pointed to the recent US elections successfully taking place. New legislation allows the Holyrood election to be held over two days, for the count to take longer or for a six-month delay, if necessary. Scotland’s rate of Covid deaths and hospitalisations during the latest wave has been the lowest of all four UK nations, but in a subtle shift of tone, Sturgeon acknowledged on Friday that changes or postponement could be necessary.
As a contingency plan, the Scottish parliament’s official dissolution has been postponed until 5 May to allow MSPs to reconvene for an emergency session if the Covid crisis means changes to the election are needed. Normally, Holyrood would be dissolved in late March. “If there’s any change made to the timing of the election or to the rules of conduct, it’s really important that those are not decisions for the government of the day alone, it would be a cross-party decision and one that involves [Holyrood’s] presiding officer as well,” Sturgeon said. Two opinion polls of Scottish voters carried out by the Electoral Commission since last August found that while 77% of voters could use polling stations if the right safety measures were in place, 23% would prefer a postal vote. That is in addition to the 18% of electors who usually vote by post. Of voters who use polling stations, 61% said they would switch to a postal ballot if they were encouraged to do so, increasing the total number who could register for an absentee vote to about 2.7 million people. It has alarmed council officials. It would mean registering 2 million extra voters for absentee ballots, checking their identities, and then printing, posting and validating their ballots. The Electoral Commission believes 3-5% of those votes could be spoilt by voters incorrectly filling out the forms, potentially invalidating up to 135,000 votes."
2021-01-25T00:01:06Z,politics,Politics,Uncertainty over 12-week Covid jab interval intensifies as UK rollout expands,"Experts have called for greater clarity about the monitoring in place to assess the 12-week dosing interval for Covid vaccines, as the UK’s vaccination programme ramps up. According to government data released on Sunday, a total of 6,353,321 people in the UK have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. A further slew of vaccination centres are due to open on Monday to speed up delivery of the jabs. These include at the Crick Institute in London, the Blackpool Winter Gardens, Lancaster town hall, Bath racecourse and the Black Country Living Museum, where scenes for the TV show Peaky Blinders were filmed. “These 33 new major vaccine centres will bolster our existing network and enable the NHS to protect as many people as possible in the coming weeks,” said the vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi. However, there is continued controversy about the government’s decision to increase the interval between the two doses of the jabs to up to 12 weeks in an effort to offer protection to as many people as possible. While there is some evidence from trials that a 12-week gap does not reduce the efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer has said it has no data on whether protection after the first dose is sustained beyond three weeks. The British Medical Association is among those voicing concerns, saying the gap between doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab should be reduced to six weeks. But others have defended the shift towards a longer interval, saying it is evidence-based and is the best option once the risks and benefits are weighed up. Prof Anthony Harnden, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the committee believed the approach was the right way forward. “Hopefully not only will this strategy get more people immunised and protect the vulnerable elderly and save thousands and thousands of lives, it may in the end give protection to the population as a whole,” he told Sky News on Sunday. Harnden added that data from the Moderna vaccine, which is based on a similar approach to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, produced 90% immunity in participants two months after receiving one dose. The comment could be a reference to a JCVI document that showed the efficacy of the Moderna jab reached 80% among almost 1,000 people followed up between one and 108 days after their first dose, and just over 90% when assessing Covid cases at least 14 days after the first jab. However, the document urged caution. “There appears to be some protection against Covid-19 disease following one dose; however, these data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose,” it stated. The British Society for Immunology (BSI) said that while it accepted the rationale for the 12-week dosing interval in the current circumstances, there needed to be greater clarity about how the potential effect of this interval was being assessed, noting that while Public Health England had published a Covid-19 vaccine surveillance strategy, details about how the immune response is to be monitored remained unclear. “We are assured studies are ongoing, but whether they are the types of studies as a body of immunologists we’d like to see there is still a question mark,” said Dr Doug Brown, the CEO of the BSI, adding that such studies were important in order to explore how best to use the vaccines now and in the future. Others have gone further, calling for large randomised control trials to be set up to explore how different dosing schedules might affect issues ranging from the long-term effect on Covid-related hospital cases to the potential impact on long Covid. While the UK’s vaccination programme continues to expand, concerns have been raised that distribution around the country is far from equal. According to figures from NHS England, the Midlands has so far delivered more than a million first doses of Covid jabs – the first region to do so – with the north-east and Yorkshire hot on its heels with 905,794 first doses administered. However, London continues to lag behind all other regions, having delivering just 586,559 first doses so far. Last week the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the Guardian that “the government’s original distribution formula meant that London missed out on its early fair share of the vaccine”. However, despite Khan saying Zahawi had promised supply and distribution would increase, the Department of Health and Social Care later cast doubt on plans to change the distribution formula. “Vaccines are being distributed fairly across the UK – including London – to ensure the most vulnerable are immunised first, and all GPs will continue to receive deliveries as planned,” it said."
2021-01-24T12:14:12Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon: SNP will hold Scottish independence vote if it wins in May,"Nicola Sturgeon has said she will hold an advisory referendum on independence if her Scottish National party wins a majority in May’s Holyrood elections, regardless of whether Westminster consents to the move. Her party is setting out an 11-point roadmap for taking forward another vote, which was to be presented to members of the SNP’s national assembly on Sunday. Scotland’s first minister told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning: “I want to have a legal referendum, that’s what I’m going to seek the authority of the Scottish people for in May and if they give me that authority that’s what I intend to do: to have a legal referendum to give people the right to choose. That’s democracy. It’s not about what I want or what Boris Johnson wants.” Signalling a new approach, which moves beyond the current impasse of Johnson’s repeated refusal to countenance a second vote, the roadmap states that if the SNP takes office after May, it will request from the UK government a section 30 order, which under the Scotland Act 1998 allows Holyrood to pass laws normally reserved to Westminster. The document states that “there could be no moral or democratic justification for denying that request” and that if the UK government did adopt such a position it would be “unsustainable both at home and abroad”. It adds that if agreement were not forthcoming from Westminster, the SNP government would introduce and pass a bill allowing a “legal referendum” to take place after the pandemic, and would “vigorously oppose” any legal challenge from the UK government. Four-nation polling for the Sunday Times has found that a majority of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland want referendums on the breakup of Britain. Sturgeon told Marr: “The polls now show that a majority of people in Scotland want independence. If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months’ time on proposition of giving the people that choice, then what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?” The plan has been welcomed by those within the SNP who have pushed for an alternative strategy on independence, rather than relying on Westminster permission to go ahead with a second vote. Some believe it would be possible for Holyrood to hold a consultative referendum without overreaching its powers. Asked by Marr about the ongoing Holyrood inquiry into her government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond, Sturgeon insisted she did not mislead the Scottish parliament as her predecessor has suggested. She said: “There are false conspiracy theories being spun about this … by Alex Salmond, by people around him, you can draw your own conclusions about that … but what is forgotten in all of that are the women who brought forward these complaints. “At the time I became aware of this I tried hard not to interfere with what was going on and not to do anything that would see these swept aside. The Scottish government made mistakes in the investigation of that and that’s part of the subject of the inquiry, but I didn’t collude with Alex Salmond and I didn’t conspire against him.” Later on Sunday, a spokeswoman for Salmond responded: “The two inquiries under way are into why Nicola Sturgeon’s government acted unlawfully. Alex has submitted his evidence as requested and the parliamentary committee is now challenging the Crown Office to produce some of the text messages which they believe are being suppressed. The evidence, if published, will speak for itself.”"
2021-01-24T11:55:25Z,politics,Politics,UK vaccine adviser says delay of Covid second dose will save lives,"A representative of the UK’s vaccine advisory committee has defended its decision to delay giving people a second dose, saying it will “save many lives”, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned lifting restrictions was “a long, long way off”. Prof Anthony Harnden, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the evidence was still in favour of delaying the dose, after a small Israeli study on people over the age of 60 suggested a first dose gave just 33% protection from coronavirus. The JCVI has suggested doses should be given 12 weeks apart in order to give the maximum number of people some protection while supplies are limited. Pfizer, which manufactures one of the vaccines being administered in the UK and is also the provider of vaccines in Israel, has said it has tested its vaccine’s full efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. Meanwhile, ministers are preparing to announce tough new border measures to stop new variants of coronavirus from abroad scuppering the advances of the UK’s vaccination programme. Reports suggest they may stop short of requiring all travellers to quarantine in government facilities. Speaking on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, Israel’s health minister, Yuli Edelstein, said there had been debates within his ministry about delaying the second dose. “I’ll be very honest, we had debates about it in the ministry. And we decided to follow the instructions given by Pfizer. There were different opinions on that in Israel too. But as we have very little information at that stage … So we decided to stick to the instructions we get from Pfizer. “We are just at the beginning of the [vaccination] campaign. We do see cases of people that after getting the first dose still get sick with the coronavirus. At the same time there are some encouraging signs of less severe diseases, less people hospitalised after the first dose, so at this stage it’s very difficult to say. We really hope that we will have better information in the near future.” Edelstein said his country would look to vaccinate “very high numbers, probably to 80%,” before the country would consider it had herd immunity and restrictions would be lifted. Harnden, the deputy chair of the JCVI, said the committee was examining the Israeli data in detail but the picture was not definitive. Speaking to Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Harnden said it had concluded in the case of the Pfizer vaccine that there was “no real evidence that a second dose gave you substantially longer and better protection … We do believe you should have a second dose but we do believe that that can be delayed.” He said of the Oxford vaccine that “it may be that the longer you leave the second dose, the better protection you have”. He added: “The Israeli data is preliminary data. It does involve PCR testing, which is of course asymptomatic cases as well as symptomatic cases. They have not followed up for more than three weeks and the statistical methods they used are not clear.” Harnden said the committee still believed a delayed second dose would “save many lives nationally”, saying the UK would begin to see a decline in hospital admissions and deaths a few weeks after the first four priority groups had been offered their first dose of the vaccine. Hancock reiterated that there was “a high degree of confidence” that delaying the second dose would save more lives. “In a situation where there is a limited supply … you want to get as many people to have as much protection as possible as quickly as possible.” Three-quarters of all those over 80 in the UK have been vaccinated, the health secretary announced.
He told Ridge the government was a “long, long, long way” from being able to lift coronavirus lockdown restrictions in England, and he refused to commit to schoolchildren being back in class by Easter. “We have got to look at the data, we have got to look at the impact of the vaccination programme,” he said. The government is expecting to meet to discuss new border measures on Monday, as fears grow about the spread of new variants. Hancock said there were 77 known cases of the South African variant in the UK, all linked to travel, and nine cases linked to one of the Brazilian variants. “The new variant I really worry about is the one that is out there that hasn’t been spotted,” he told Sky News. “There’s probably those elsewhere that simply haven’t been picked up because the country doesn’t have that genomic sequencing service.”
Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said Labour had been “pushing the government to take tougher measures at the border since last spring”. She said: “Scientists tell us that there are a number of countries where these strains are emerging that just simply do not have the capacity to map what is happening. So it’s not just countries who have identified the strains of the virus we ought to be careful about, actually what we’re likely to be seeing, even if we haven’t identified it, is strains emerging all over the world. “On Monday we’ve got this delayed announcement yet again delayed. We would fully expect the government to bring in tougher quarantine measures, we would expect them to roll out a proper testing strategy and we would expect them as well to start checking up on the people who are quarantining.”"
2021-01-24T09:15:41Z,politics,Politics,English council chiefs back postponement of May local elections,"A further postponement to this year’s local elections, in the wake of the continuing difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic, is backed by the vast majority of senior council figures across England, the Observer can reveal. Only 11% of the senior officials dealing with the forthcoming elections believe they should go ahead in May as planned, despite the government’s determination to press ahead. More than two-thirds (69%) believe the huge set of elections should now take place in the autumn, according to the most comprehensive survey of council chief executives, leaders and officers in charge of organising elections to be conducted on the issue. A further 14% called for a shorter delay to the summer and 6% backed a postponement beyond this autumn, according to the analysis by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU). Of the more than 350 officials who responded, two-thirds said they were “very concerned” about holding elections in May. Difficulty recruiting and training electoral workers, complications in ensuring safety of polling stations and concerns that voters worried about Covid-19 may be disenfranchised are among the concerns expressed by those drawing up local election plans. One Conservative council leader said: “It will be a grave error not to act early and announce a delay now.” Another Tory council leader said: “Go for the end of July or October: don’t tempt fate with May, only to have to call them off. I am really concerned about vulnerable candidates.” The postponement of 2020’s local elections in England has meant this year’s were to be the biggest in years. They include county councils, district councils, unitary authorities, mayoral races, police and crime commissioners, and the London assembly. Elections also take place for the parliaments in Scotland and Wales. Decisions over those elections are controlled by their respective devolved governments. The Scottish government has said it is still planning for elections to go ahead, but has emergency powers to delay or to hold polling over more than a day. The Welsh government has said that it intends to proceed in May, but that “significant uncertainty” around the pandemic means a delay may be needed. Boris Johnson has backed holding elections in May but has suggested he is keeping the decision under review. However, it is understood that the serious concerns among councils about the practicalities of proceeding with the poll have been made clear to Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary. Four-fifths of those surveyed by the LGIU (80%) were concerned about their ability to recruit and train electoral workers, with fewer volunteers likely to come forward. Difficulties in obtaining polling and count venues have also emerged, while the usual use of schools as polling stations is also proving contentious. Some traditional polling venues are also being used as vaccination centres. “We will not get all the staff we need and we will be lucky to get the venues for polling and/or counting,” said one electoral administrator. “You can throw as much PPE at the polls as you like, if people do not want to volunteer to work, we can’t run the elections.” Some insiders expressed concern about the democratic problems created by a further delay. After elections were delayed last May, some councillors and mayors will have exceeded their original mandate by 18 months if voting is delayed until autumn. Some local councillors have already stood down in their area because they could not serve beyond the scheduled end of their tenures last year. Jonathan Carr-West, the chief executive of the LGIU, said: “Local government is committed to democracy, but the overwhelming view from councils is that it is no longer possible to hold safe and open elections in May. The logistical challenges are formidable and there’s a real risk that we effectively disenfranchise millions of people who do not feel safe going to the polls. “The worst scenario of all would be for government to push ahead only to have to make a U-turn late in the day, when councils will already have spent a fortune in money and time preparing. Better to take a bold decision now to delay the elections and use the additional time to ensure they can be run safely. Such measures should include the vaccination of poll workers and an expansion of postal voting. Public confidence in elections is an essential foundation of our democracy – once lost, it takes years to rebuild. That risk is not worth taking.” • This article was amended on 28 January 2021 to refer to the Scottish and Welsh “parliaments”, not “assemblies” as an earlier version said."
2021-01-23T19:00:24Z,politics,Politics,"Move to EU to avoid Brexit costs, firms told","British businesses that export to the continent are being encouraged by government trade advisers to set up separate companies inside the EU in order to get around extra charges, paperwork and taxes resulting from Brexit, the Observer can reveal. In an extraordinary twist to the Brexit saga, UK small businesses are being told by advisers working for the Department for International Trade (DIT) that the best way to circumvent border issues and VAT problems that have been piling up since 1 January is to register new firms within the EU single market, from where they can distribute their goods far more freely. The heads of two UK businesses that have been beset by Brexit-related problems have told the Observer that, following advice from experts at the Department for International Trade, they have already decided to register new companies in the EU in the next few weeks, and they knew of many others in similar positions. Other companies have also said they too were advised by government officials to register operations in the EU but had not yet made decisions. Andrew Moss, who runs Horizon Retail Marketing Solutions, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, which sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in the UK and to EU customers, is registering a European company Horizon Europe in the Netherlands in the next few weeks, on the advice of a senior government adviser. This will mean laying off a small number of staff here and taking on people in the Netherlands. Referring to discussions with a senior DIT adviser on trade, Moss said: “This guy talked complete sense. What I said to him was, have I got another choice [other than to set up a company abroad]? He confirmed that he couldn’t see another way. He told me that what I was thinking of doing was the right thing, that he could see no other option. He did not see this as a teething problem. He said he had to be careful what he said, but he was very clear.” Moss said it was now clear that Brexit was not about winning back control from the EU but investing in it to survive. Geoffrey Betts, managing director of Stewart Superior Ltd, a company in Marlow, Bucks, which sells office supplies to UK and continental customers, said he had also decided to set up a company in the Netherlands for the same reasons. He had also spoken to an official at the Department for International Trade before making his decision and received the same advice. “When the government said it had secured free trade, it was obvious it was nothing of the sort,” said Betts. VAT issues, new charges on moving goods and more bureaucracy all added up to an “administrative nightmare”, he said. By moving operations into the EU and shipping out large consignments from the UK to their new European operations, the businesses can not only avoid cross-border delays and costs on every single small consignment they send, but can also defuse VAT problems that are currently hitting them and their European customers hard. The spokesperson from the Department for International Trade said: “This is not government policy, the Cabinet Office have issued clear guidance, available at gov.uk/transition, and we encourage all businesses to follow that guidance. We are ensuring all officials are properly conveying this information.” Yesterday, as the impact of leaving the single market and customs union on 1 January became ever more clear, the Financial Times reported that the cost of a £12 bottle of wine in UK shops could rise by up to £1.50 a bottle because of the extra bureaucracy and charges affecting imports.
In a further blow to the government’s idea of “global Britain” after Brexit, the chances of signing a swift UK/US trade deal also appeared to be ebbing away after President Joe Biden’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, made clear the president had other more pressing domestic economic priorities than international trade deals. Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: “Once again we see this government’s sheer incompetence and lack of planning holding British businesses back and slowing our economic recovery. “They’ve got to get a grip on this now and stop leaving our businesses out in the cold.”"
2021-01-23T19:00:24Z,politics,Politics,'A Brexit nightmare': the British businesses being pushed to breaking point,"Christophe Fricker lectures in German at the University of Bristol and adores living in England. He was born in Germany but his anglophilia became so strong after moving here that he wrote a book called 111 Gründe, England zu lieben (“111 Reasons to Love England”) in 2018. He selected the gardens of Cornwall, the National Portrait Gallery, the way the English use collective nouns for groups of animals (herds, packs, and so on) and their fascination with murder cases in his varied list of reasons for loving this country. But since 1 January, Fricker has been reminded that there are also worrying things about life in England – and being outside the EU is now chief among them. Having run short of copies of his book to distribute to friends, Fricker contacted his publishers in Berlin a few days ago to ask them to ship over some more. The company was keen to help but said that, as a result of new rules, regulations and costs resulting from Brexit, it had decided not to export any more books to the UK at all, not even 111 Reasons to Love England. For someone born in Germany but who had come to feel very much part of his adopted homeland, it was a jolt – a small but powerful demonstration of what living outside the European club of nations will really mean. “If you erect barriers, then people are going to be affected on both sides of them,” Fricker says. “The promise from those who supported Brexit was that nothing was going to change afterwards. That was obviously ludicrous. “My concern is not so much about my book, but that if there are problems with cross-border trade, it becomes more difficult for small businesses to operate – in this case to trade cultural goods – so the business will all go to huge companies like Amazon.” Less than a month after the UK finally left the European single market and customs union – amid claims from Boris Johnson that its people and its businesses were now free to live and trade as they wished – UK companies that export to the EU, and EU ones that send goods here, are beginning to realise that the reverse is true. And so are their customers. It is not just British fishing crews who now cry betrayal, as they find themselves unable to sell their fresh fish into EU markets because of delays at ports. Nor is it the famous musicians who warned in the Times last week that visa restrictions will endanger the EU touring ability and livelihoods of many performers and crews across the already hard-hit creative sector, who will suffer most. Rather, it is millions of hard-working people running, and employed in, less romantic and exotic small businesses who are feeling utterly let down and wondering if their companies will even survive. Take Andrew Moss, who is managing director of a small company called Horizon, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire. He employs 37 people and sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in this country, and also exports to the EU. His annual turnover is around £3.5m. He describes his company as part of the “engine room” of the British economy – one of the almost 6 million UK small businesses (defined as those employing less than 50 people) – that account for most of the UK’s GDP. The last three weeks, he says, have been a living nightmare. “Soft Brexit – there is no such thing. This is horrific,” he says. “We celebrated the Brexit deal with champagne over Christmas but when we woke up and realised that this car crash was happening, we thought, oh my God!”
The problems he has encountered since 1 January are many, including more forms and several extra Brexit-related charges for exporting into the EU that will eat into profit margins. For small firms, the extra costs hit proportionately harder as every small consignment attracts a charge. But over the past three weeks he – like others – has had to confront another huge, potentially existential, problem resulting from Brexit that came out of the blue, and in a dark moment made him think of shutting the company down a fortnight ago. He discovered from customers in Europe that they were being asked by couriers to pay VAT upfront on the goods he was sending to them – as a condition, in effect, of getting customs clearance – and the customers, unsurprisingly, were refusing. Previously, when the UK was in the EU and during the transition period, Moss and other small businesses did not charge VAT on customers in other EU countries. But EU rules on third countries dictate that VAT must now be paid before goods are received from the UK. Moss could not believe what was happening. Loyal customers were being told to pay around 20% extra on top of the quoted price for his goods before they could get hold of them. Of course, if this continued, they would look elsewhere for cheaper suppliers. What could he and other business managers do? Moss had three options – and none would be easy. First, he could bite the bullet and pay the VAT himself on behalf of customers in the EU. But this would mean running at a huge loss and was not possible for the long term. Second, he could stop all exports to the EU – but this would reduce the size of his business overnight and mean that years of hard work finding customers abroad had been for nothing. Or third, he could set up and register a company in the EU, ship all his goods out once a week to avoid the delays and individual Brexit-related payments, and distribute his goods from there. The European branch of his company could then pay the VAT and claim it back from the government of whichever EU member state it was based in. To Moss, this looked the best option, albeit one that would involve short-term costs and effort. As he pondered what course to take, Moss contacted his local MP, Lucy Frazer, warning her that if no help was offered he would have to “sack lots of people”. Frazer put him in touch with a civil servant in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) who knew nothing whatsoever about the VAT problem. “It was a complete surprise to him,” said Moss. But the civil servant did refer him on to a senior trade adviser in the Department for International Trade.
“This guy talked complete sense,” said Moss. “What I said to him was, have I got another choice [other than to set up a company abroad]? He confirmed that he couldn’t see another way. He told me that what I was thinking of doing was the right thing, that he could see no other option. He did not see this as a teething problem. He said he had to be careful what he said, but he was very clear.” Moss has moved fast, and in the past fortnight has settled on a two-part strategy. In the short term, to keep his customers happy, he will pay the VAT bills himself, writing big cheques every week. But as he can’t afford to do that for long, he has decided to establish his own company in the EU – Horizon Europe – in the Netherlands. He has identified a site and hopes it will be ready for use in six weeks. But he knows it will mean downsizing at home and laying people off. “If I have got to recruit two people in Holland, and let two people go here, that hurts,” he says. “I have been in touch with other companies in the last week that have exactly the same issues. It will be affecting thousands of companies.” Moss is, indeed, far from alone. Geoffrey Betts is managing director of Stewart Superior, a company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which deals in office supplies. He too has decided to set up a new company in the Netherlands, for the same reasons. “When the government said it had secured free trade it was obvious it was nothing of the sort,” says Betts. VAT problems, new charges on moving goods and more bureaucracy all added up to an “administrative nightmare” which left him with no choice. The only way to avoid the Brexit barriers was to operate inside them, to move back into the single market. “If you don’t, you are screwed in so many ways,” he says. Betts also talked to trade advisers from the Department for International Trade, who gave the same advice as they gave to Moss. “The adviser I spoke to said it was a can of worms, and he thought that would be the best move,” says Betts. “It is all going to be hugely damaging to the UK economy because if we can’t move our goods across Europe without all this palaver, a lot of companies will be in very serious trouble. Someone needs to sort this out in government – and quickly.” Others have adopted different but equally drastic ways out. Gyr King is chief executive of a company called King & McGaw based on the south coast at Newhaven. It has a turnover of £8m-£10m, selling framed fine art prints online to the public, and to big museums in the UK and abroad. Over recent days, King has decided to stop – or, as he puts it, “switch off” – all sales to the EU because of post-Brexit shipping delays, new administration charges and VAT demands. It all amounts, he says, to a “disaster”. In King’s view, there are two types of problem that Brexit has foisted on businesses. “One is that shippers’ systems are in disarray,” he says. “There is confusion about the forms they have to fill out, which leads to delays. The shippers are not delivering in anything like the timescale they were before. We have got customers waiting for packages that were shipped before Christmas, and these problems may or may not be resolved, we don’t know.
“Then there are more fundamental issues, including additional charges that exporters now face, VAT charge points, and rules of origin, where there does not seem to be an easy solution. A significant amount of what we sell at the moment will not be possible to ship because the customers will not pay for these extra costs.” There is yet another problem, he says, coming in the other direction. “We are hit both ways. We are not receiving the raw materials from the EU that we normally do because of similar problems the other side. So the whole thing has become blocked.” Everywhere, different problems are hitting different businesses. UK businesses importing from the EU are also reporting having to pay additional VAT. Last Wednesday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, appeared before a parliamentary select committee and faced questions about how trade between Northern Ireland and the UK was functioning post-Brexit.
The Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley told him that the first 20 days of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain since the Brexit deal had been an “unmitigated disaster”, and that he knew of companies in Northern Ireland which were losing £100,000 a week because of border delays and extra checks at the ports. He was speaking to the same Brandon Lewis who had tweeted on 1 January that there would be no new border checks. “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’,” Lewis said then. “As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.” During the committee hearing, Lewis again seemed partly in denial, suggesting that problems with trade to Northern Ireland had as much to do with Covid-19 as Brexit. For entrepreneurs such as Moss, this is just part of a pattern in which Tory politicians who backed Brexit never told the truth about it. As he contemplates setting up his new operation in the Netherlands – investing his money in the same single market that the government has just torn his country out of – all Moss wants is honesty. “After everything, I just want somebody to tell me [admit] that Brexit is not about making Britain great again, not about empowering us, not about giving us back our sovereignty. Brexit is about the engine room of Britain investing significantly in Europe.” • This article was amended on 24 January 2021 to correct the spelling of Christophe Fricker’s surname.

2021-01-23T13:05:06Z,politics,Politics,Welsh Tory leader quits after drinking during Covid alcohol ban,"The leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh parliament has quit after he was seen drinking in the Senedd during a pub alcohol ban. Paul Davies insisted he had not broken any rules but that the fallout from the news meant “I simply cannot continue in my post”. His colleague and chief whip, Darren Millar, also said he was stepping down. They were among politicians seen drinking four days after pubs in Wales were banned from serving alcohol. The incident triggered an investigation in the Senedd, which found that five people, four of whom were members, were involved in a possible breach of Covid regulations. In a statement, Davies said he was “truly sorry” for his actions, acknowledging that they had “damaged the trust and respect I had built up over 14 years in the Welsh parliament with my colleagues and the wider Conservative party but more importantly with the people of Wales”. He said he believed his actions were becoming a distraction from holding the Welsh government to account and he would resign with immediate effect. Davies said the group had consumed “some alcohol with a meal we heated up in a microwave, which was a couple of glasses of wine on the Tuesday and a beer on the Wednesday. I broke no actual Covid-19 regulations.” He added: “We did not have to be escorted out of the building as some reports have suggested.” He said the Conservative group in the Welsh parliament had initially resisted his decision to resign. “Yesterday I indicated to the Conservative group in the Welsh parliament that I wished to resign, but they urged me to reflect further, and we agreed to meet again on Monday,” he said. “However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.” In a statement, Millar said “social distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners” and it “simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate”. Millar, who has been the MS for Clwyd West since 2007, said that while he had been told he did not breach coronavirus regulations, he was “very sorry” for his actions, “especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring”. “For this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative group leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my frontbench role in the Welsh parliament,” he said. “I am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so.” He added that he wanted to apologise to his family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment caused from media reports of the incident. It comes as Public Health Wales announced a further 1,079 cases of coronavirus had been recorded in the country, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 186,915. The health body reported 27 further deaths, raising the country’s coronavirus death toll since the start of the pandemic to 4,486."
2021-01-23T08:28:21Z,politics,Politics,"Cheshire cheesemaker says business left with Â£250,000 'Brexit hole'","A commercial cheesemaker in Cheshire has been left with a £250,000 Brexit hole in his business as a direct result of the UK’s departure from the EU on 1 January. Simon Spurrell said he has lost 20% of his sales overnight after discovering he needed to provide a £180 health certificate on retail orders to consumers in the EU, including those buying personal gift packs of his award-winning wax-wrapped cheese worth £25 or £30. He says he had hoped to take part in the “sunny uplands” promised by the government post-Brexit but has instead seen the viability of his online retail come to a “dead stop”. “Our business had high hopes of continued growth in the EU market, after seeing the avoidance of the no-deal and announcement of a free trade deal. “What has only become clear in the last week is that our successful B2C [business to consumer] online sales to EU consumers is now impossible to operate,” he said. To save his business he will now have to switch a £1m investment he was planning to make in a new distribution centre in Macclesfield to the EU, with the loss of 20 jobs and tax revenue to the UK. “It is a real shame because that means I’m now going to invest in France, provide French employment, and then contribute to the EU tax system, which was pretty much going against the whole reason that we were meant to be leaving.” As small businesses up and down the country come to terms with the new and complex export red tape, Spurrell explained that he thought he was fully prepared for Brexit and had consulted with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the National Farmers’ Union along the way. He knew he would need customs declarations and health certificates signed off by vets to get his cheese into the EU after 1 January, and has successfully been getting pallets of the product across the Channel to wholesale customers. But what he had not anticipated was the requirement for health certificates to accompany online orders from private customers. “It’s as if someone forgot to negotiate this part of the deal, they forgot that there needed to be an exemption or allowance for the direct consumer sales. “We ship to the USA, Canada, Norway, etc, all non-EU countries; we have never had a problem with at all. It is an oversight in the agreement that does not affect EU producers at all, but is a dead stop for all UK producers selling into the EU via online sales,” he added. In an indication that neither the EU or the UK had time to translate the trade deal into practical guidance for business, Defra said it was continuing to “engage with the European commission and the EU member states to ensure that we share a common understanding of the EU’s export rules and how they should apply”. Defra said it had worked hard to ensure UK businesses were not disadvantaged by the deal and that the farming and food minister Victoria Prentis would now be in contact with Spurrell and Defra officials to discuss further. It also revealed that the number of vets or food-competent certifying officers now trained to issue the European health certificates had risen “from 600 to 1,500 and this number continues to grow”. Sabine Weyand, the director general of trade at the European commission and Michel Barnier’s former deputy in the withdrawal agreement negotiations, posted a tweet in English saying “help us to help you”, with a link to a page on the EU’s Access2Markets website explaining “how to report a trade barrier”. Spurrell’s Cheshire cheese company in Macclesfield and Hartington Creamery in Derbyshire turn over more than £4.3m a year and employ 25 people, and he planned to double staff numbers with a new fulfilment centre in March. “I would be looking to employ another 20 people on top of the 25 we have now,” he said. “So, a substantial investment which we now have to review. I am still shell shocked by what has happened.” Spurrell said he voted remain but had come to accept Brexit. “I am a positive person and always make the best of a bad situation and we thought, ‘Right, well let’s get used to this, let’s go with it. Let’s take on Europe from the UK,’ and that’s what we tried to do until 4 January when it was just every parcel was coming back,” he said. His experience is being repeated right across the country with courier companies refusing to take small packages of animal or food originated products. John Arbon Textiles in Devon was told by its courier company that its knitting wool, spun from local sheep fibres, would no longer be accepted with hauliers now trying to mitigate the risk of one package in their van or lorry causing their entire load to be delayed because they are missing a health certificate. A government spokesperson said “there is extensive advice available to support businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements” and it was “vital” that traders ensured they had the correct paperwork for exports."
2021-01-22T19:20:29Z,politics,Politics,Scottish parliament orders prosecutors to release Salmond leak evidence,"The Scottish parliament has ordered the country’s prosecution service to release key evidence in the Alex Salmond affair, in a dramatic escalation of a battle over the non-disclosure of legal papers. In an unprecedented move, Holyrood issued an enforcement notice on the Crown Office instructing it to release private messages from senior Scottish National party officials and documents about the leak of allegations that Salmond had sexually harassed two civil servants – allegations he denies. The notice, under section 23 of the Scotland Act 1998, follows months of stalemate involving the Scottish government, the Crown Office and Salmond himself and a special Holyrood committee set up to investigate the government’s botched handling of an internal inquiry into the allegations against him. The letter from Holyrood’s chief executive and clerk, David McGill, has given the Crown Office, headed by the lord advocate, James Wolffe, seven days to comply. Linda Fabiani, a Scottish National party MSP who chairs the committee, said: “This is a step that hasn’t been taken lightly, and is a first for this parliament, but which the committee felt was needed as it continues its vital work.” Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s acting leader, said: “At every turn, the SNP government has sought to hide vital material from the committee in a vain effort to leave it a toothless entity; a talking-shop without power. Enough is enough – the secrecy must end.” The documents cover WhatsApp messages sent or received by Sue Ruddick, the SNP’s chief operating officer, and ministers, officials and special advisers in the Scottish government between August 2018, when news of the government investigation into Salmond was leaked, and January 2019. That month Salmond won a judicial review ordering the government to quash the findings of its internal inquiry. However, he was then arrested and charged with 14 offences, chiefly involving alleged sexual assaults and attempted rapes. In March 2020, Salmond was acquitted of all charges, following a two-week jury trial. Leaks of messages sent by Peter Murrell, the SNP’s chief executive and Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, implied he wanted to put the police under pressure to pursue Salmond – an allegation Murrell has denied. Salmond alleges the messages involving Ruddick suggest collusion. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by the party or her officials. Salmond too has been accused by committee members of stalling. After refusing two successive requests to give evidence, citing health and legal concerns, the committee told him on Friday he must appear by 5 February. The committee has also again written to the Scottish government, asking it to finally release its legal advice on its prospects for winning the judicial review, after ministers and the lord advocate refused to comply with two Holyrood votes requesting the disclosure. Documents released to the committee disclose the government’s external counsel threatened to quit after senior civil servants suggested they would not admit defeat in the case. The government was later ordered to repay £516,000 worth of legal fees to Salmond, in addition to its own legal costs of some £60,000. Murdo Fraser, a Conservative MSP on the committee, said: “The committee has consistently been blocked from performing its remit by SNP ministers. The level of obstruction has been extraordinary.” The Crown Office said it would respond to the request “in early course” but that it had already told the committee there were potential legal constraints on releasing the material. Crown counsel “must consider whether producing [the] documents sought would be contrary to the public interest”, a spokesperson said."
2021-01-22T15:45:22Z,politics,Politics,Netherlands to supply medical cannabis until July despite Brexit ban,"The mother of a nine-year-old boy with a severe and rare form of epilepsy who was told Brexit would end the supply of a life-changing cannabis medicine that saved her son’s life has been given a six-month reprieve. Hannah Deacon said she was hugely grateful after being given the lifeline by the Dutch government, which has sanctioned continued supply of the medicines despite a Brexit ban on fulfilling prescriptions from the UK. She received a letter on Thursday from the Department of Health to inform her that the government in the Netherlands, where the medicine was created, had “confirmed that they will allow continued supply of Bedrocan oil against UK prescriptions for existing patients until 1 July 2021”. “I cried when I read it. I sat and cried. I was told online and I was quite surprised to be honest. I’ve spent the last two weeks terrified that Alfie’s seizures will recur because of the fact that we could not get any more Bedrolite [Bedrocan]. I didn’t feel that the Department of Health took it seriously enough to keep that medicine supply line safe so I was very angry about that, and very upset,” she said. Her campaign to save her son Alfie Dingley’s life in 2017 led to a change in the law enabling the medicine, which has helped him become seizure-free after years of 150 seizures a week, to be prescribed in the UK.
The life-saving breakthrough came after a meeting between Deacon and the minister for public health, Jo Churchill, was set up after publicity surrounding her case in the Guardian and the BBC. She had been given just two weeks’ notice by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) that due to the end of the transition period, “prescriptions issued in the UK can no longer be lawfully dispensed in an EU member state”, leaving her desperately frightened about her son’s future. “I spoke to this minister about three times … I do feel she is empathic and I do think she understands and I am grateful, but the fight is not over,” she said, as the Dutch decision only gives her a six-month lifeline.
There are 41 other families in the UK with children in similar conditions treated by the same medicine, and only one other has been able to get a prescription on the NHS, which costs £2,000 a month. “There is still huge problems so this is a small victory and my son is safe and that’s what matters to me, but at the same point I’m very acutely aware that there’s many other people still suffering,” she said. “Giving these families an NHS prescription would save the NHS millions of pounds if you think about how much intensive care treatment costs. “Some of them have children on palliative care before they started Bedrolite and now they are not, but these families should have the right to just enjoy their children, rather than having to worry every month where the money’s coming from,” said Deacon. She said she was determined to keep the pressure up on Churchill to find a permanent solution for everyone affected. A Department of Health spokesperson confirmed an agreement had been struck with the Dutch government “on the supply of Bedrocan oil to UK patients, which will bring relief to the families who depend on these medicines. “We are grateful to the Dutch government for working with us closely and quickly on this solution, which will last until 1 July. We are exploring more permanent solutions to ensure people who need these treatments can continue to access them.”"
2021-01-22T15:16:01Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for more customs agents to cope with Brexit red tape,"The government must quadruple the number of customs agents in the UK to ensure businesses struggling with mountains of Brexit red tape do not “buckle” under the strain, Labour has said in a letter to Michael Gove. The shadow chancellor for the duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, put it to Gove that industry figures showing that only 12,000 customs agents have been trained fell far short of the 50,000 the government accepted last February would be necessary to cope with Brexit. “Can you please … inform me what the government is doing to address this shortfall as swiftly as possible, so that businesses don’t have to deal with even more disruption?” she wrote. Reeves’ letter comes as hauliers, freight forwarders and existing customs agents say businesses are struggling with the new trading regime. Customs agents are the private operators who are contracted to do the paperwork for businesses and are separate to the army of officials recruited by HMRC to check the documents are in order. Last February, Gove told the Commons he would stand by his pledge to recruit the estimated 50,000 agents needed within six months. But in December, Bloomberg reported (£) that the £84m fund to train the agents was running dry despite the need for them at the end of the Brexit transition period. “What steps are the government taking to address this, and how will it support businesses as they grapple with huge amounts of new red tape and disruption?” Reeves wrote. “It is in the interests of us all for British business to thrive under the new UK-EU trading relationship. As hauliers and the industries they support buckle under unprecedented red tape through no fault of their own, they need a plan of practical support from the government urgently.” In the past, the government has estimated 147,000 businesses who trade internationally have no prior experience of customs because they have only sold goods to EU states. Several businesses told the Guardian they have had to wait days for a response from HMRC to customs queries. Others have told how businesses went into Brexit with little clue as to how complicated the new customs declarations, regulatory and transit certification and VAT rules would be. Colin Jeffries, a freight forwarder, said it was “absolute carnage”, with customers not knowing what they needed to do to trade and EU hauliers rejecting UK deliveries because of new requirements for financial guarantees for lorry-loads of goods. A Conservative party source said: “Rachel Reeves is being misleading, because as she knows the government made no such promise. Labour under Sir Keir Starmer spent the last four years seeking to overturn the 2016 referendum result, and trying to block Brexit, opposing our plans to take back control of our borders and arguing we were spending too much money on preparations.”"
2021-01-22T11:13:26Z,politics,Politics,Sunak has little choice but delay plans to reduce budget deficit,"It is hardly surprising that Rishi Sunak is uncomfortable about the amount of money the government is borrowing. No chancellor would be relaxed about presiding over a budget deficit that has already hit £270bn in the first nine months of the current financial year and is on course to hit £400bn – or about 20% of national output – by March. There have been years when the UK has borrowed as much as it will in 2020-21, but only in wartime. In peacetime, what has happened since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented. Sunak’s problem is that there is not much he can do about the government’s spiralling deficit – or at least not without hindering the economy’s chances of recovery once curbs on activity are eased. When it comes to deciding when and how restrictions will be eased the chancellor will be just one – albeit important – voice around the cabinet table. All the signs so far suggest that the government will be much more cautious about opening up the economy than it was last year after the first wave of the pandemic. That clearly has consequences. As the latest Office for National Statistics figures show, a tightening of the rules as December wore on resulted in a less than bumper Christmas for retailers: sales volumes rose by only 0.3% after a 4.1% drop in November. And, with the enforced closure of non-essential retail stores, the January figures are likely to be even worse. A breakdown of the public finances data shows that the big change over the past year has been the increase in public spending rather than the fall in tax revenue. The budget deficit was £28bn higher in December than it was in December 2019, of which £26bn was the result of rising central government spending. The current indefinite closure of large chunks of the economy means that the bill for the furlough scheme – just under £5bn in December – will rise.
Budget day is 3 March but Sunak will have to decide what is in his package of measures by the middle of next month, so it can be costed by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. By then it is unlikely that many – or perhaps any – of the lockdown restrictions will have been lifted, so it would be a colossal gamble to announce an immediate withdrawal of support, no matter how uncomfortable the size of the deficit makes him feel. An alternative – and much less risky – approach would be to announce plans to reduce the deficit on 3 March but delay the actual measures until 2022. Sunak would not be the first chancellor to heed the words of Saint Augustine: Lord make me chaste, but not yet."
2021-01-22T08:33:31Z,politics,Politics,Ministers consider paying £500 to everyone with Covid in England,"Ministers are considering paying £500 to everyone in England who tests positive for Covid-19, in a dramatic overhaul of the self-isolation support scheme, the Guardian can reveal. The proposed change is thought necessary because government polling found only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward to get a test, owing to fears that a positive result could stop people from working. The universal payment is the “preferred position” of Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and would cost up to £453m a week, 12 times the cost of the current system, according to an official policy paper seen by the Guardian. The 16-page document, dated 19 January and marked “Official Sensitive”, also proposes that police should be given access to health data for the first time to crack down on quarantine breaches.
Another recommendation is ending the £500 one-off payments to close contacts of infected people and instead rolling out nationwide self-testing, so that those who test negative can return to work. The revamped self-isolation support scheme was drawn up by Hancock’s team to be considered by the government’s coronavirus operations committee, chaired by Michael Gove, which is expected to meet on Friday. The UK recorded another 1,290 deaths on Thursday and 37,892 new positive cases, and there is uncertainty about whether the current restrictions will do enough to bring the pandemic under control. Boris Johnson pointedly refused to be drawn on when lockdown measures could be lifted, raising fears that the regime may not ease for months. Financial support for people who need to self-isolate is critical to the government’s coronavirus strategy because the disease will continue to spread unless infectious people and their close contacts go into quarantine for 10 days. However, there have been concerns that the scheme unveiled by the prime minister four months ago is excluding many people who cannot afford to self-isolate, meaning they are torn between losing earnings or spreading the disease. The overhaul has been prompted by Cabinet Office polling indicating that only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward for testing, according to the policy paper. It said: “Wanting to avoid self-isolation is now the single biggest reported barrier to requesting a test.” A separate survey carried out for the DHSC, discussed in the report, found that only one in four people reported compliance with self-isolation, with 15% going to work as normal. At present only those on a low income who cannot work from home and receive one of seven means-tested benefits are eligible for the £500 test-and-trace support payment (TTSP), excluding many small business owners, sole traders, self-employed workers and parents whose children have been told to self-isolate. Councils are given an additional pot of “discretionary” funding, but figures released by Labour this week showed that three-quarters of applicants were being rejected. An official review of the scheme has concluded that it excludes too many people, has created a “postcode lottery” around England, and that only one in four of those eligible have received financial support – about 50,000 people in total – because the application process is too complex. It proposes four options to expand the programme. The most generous is paying £500 to anyone who tests positive. The report says: “Anyone who tested positive for Covid-19, irrespective of their age, employment status or ability to work from home, would be eligible for TTSP. This would be straightforward for local authorities to administer, though it would lead to significantly greater volumes of applications than under the current scheme.” Describing the universal payment as “the preferred DHSC position,” officials estimate it would cost up to £453m a week if there were 60,000 cases a day – 12 times the current cost of £36.5m a week. It would cost £340m a week if there were 45,000 infections a day, as at present.
A second option is paying the lump sum to those who test positive and cannot work from home, costing up to £244m a week. The third option is paying those earning less than £26,495 a year or on means-tested benefits, at a cost of £122m a week. The fourth proposal is keeping the current system but “significantly” expanding the discretionary funding to councils. The policy paper says “a more radical approach” would be paying people their usual earnings instead of a £500 lump sump, but it would be difficult to assess the earnings of those on zero-hours contracts, agency workers and the self-employed and therefore that option is not recommended. The proposal to end £500 payments to the close contacts of infected people and instead introduce regular nationwide at-home lateral flow testing would save the government £79m a week if cases were at 60,000 a day, according to the report. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has cautioned against using self-tests as a “green light” to avoid self-isolation. Any nationwide scheme would need to be clinically approved. Another proposed change likely to be controversial is to give individuals’ health data to the police to prove that someone has tested positive for Covid-19, making it easier for them to be prosecuted. In October, it emerged that police could request information about whether someone was supposed to be self-isolating, but “no testing data or health data”. The official paper says the current enforcement approach is “difficult to implement” and that police should be given health data to distinguish between people who have tested positive and those required to self-isolate because they are a contact.
It adds: “Contrary to previous assurances given to the public, this will mean sharing health data (ie an indication of who has tested positive for Covid-19) with the police if someone is reported to have breached their legal duty, but this is considered a necessary and proportionate measure – and data-sharing agreements will provide that the information is not used for any other purposes.” On Friday morning, the environment secretary, George Eustice, told Sky News the plan was “under review”. “We do need people, if they are asked to self-isolate because they have been contacted through our test and trace, we do need them to self-isolate,” he said. “No decisions have been made on this. But this is a dynamic, fast-moving situation with the pandemic.” A DHSC spokesperson said they would not comment on leaks, but said: “We are in one of the toughest moments of this pandemic and it is incumbent on all of us to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules. “All local authorities costs for administering the test-and-trace support payment scheme are covered by the government, and each authority is empowered to make discretionary payments outside of the scheme. Fifty million pounds was invested when the scheme launched, and we are providing a further £20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. “We also recognise the impact of the pandemic on people’s mental health and wellbeing which is why mental health services have remained open throughout the pandemic.”"
2021-01-21T20:24:30Z,politics,Politics,Two helpings of Priti Patel is pretty much no help at all | John Crace,"Boris Johnson spoils us. Up until last week, the home secretary had been kept away from the Downing Street press conferences since a disastrous appearance last May. Now we get Priti Patel twice in two weeks. But then the prime minister didn’t have a lot of choice, given that he clearly didn’t fancy taking Thursday night’s himself. Matt Hancock is self-isolating, Dominic Raab appears to have taken a vow of silence, and Gavin Williamson had all but handed in his resignation letter during a car crash series of interviews during the morning media round. Then perhaps Patel wasn’t such a bad choice after all. Not because she had anything very important to say, but precisely because she didn’t. Few politicians match her ability to fill dead air with a series of disconnected sentences that leave most people none the wiser by the time she comes to a stop. Ideal for a press briefing with minimal news content that has to be extended to 40 minutes to keep up appearances. The home secretary did more or less just fine when she was reading from her prepared statement. Nearly 5 million people had been vaccinated so far, she wanted to counter disinformation that the vaccine wasn’t safe, 1,290 people had been reported dead in 24 hours, the NHS was under pressure and she was bringing in a new fine of £800 for the minority of people who insisted on still having house parties. Patel made it sound as if the few people breaking the rules were entirely responsible for the pandemic rather than any mistakes on the government’s part. She then handed over to Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, and Dr Vin Diwakar, NHS England regional medical director for London, who pretty much repeated what she had already said with a few examples thrown in. So far so good. It all began to unravel a bit when the questions began. The BBC’s Vicki Young wanted to know if England was likely to extend its lockdown as Northern Ireland had just done and whether the home secretary was pleased that Boris had finally got round to her way of thinking on enforcing stricter border controls for visitors from other countries. Patel could sense danger and she activated her default setting of mindless filler. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end, even though the government had actually promised a review in the middle of February that everyone had always known was absurdly optimistic and had only been been introduced as a possibility to keep the Coronavirus Research Group headbangers vaguely onside. It also appeared to have slipped Patel’s mind that earlier this week – perhaps anticipating a messy and damaging public inquiry – she had knifed Johnson in the back by claiming she had wanted stricter border controls back in March but had been overruled by the prime minister. So she ignored that bit of the question and went back on to repeat. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end etc etc. The home secretary did much the same when asked whether people should think about booking summer holidays. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end and people should be concentrating on staying home rather than thinking of travelling. And by the way the emergency services were doing an excellent job.
To break things up, and perhaps because even she realised that she didn’t have anything more to say, Patel regularly invited further contributions from Hewitt and Diwakar but they didn’t have much to add to what they had already said. Beyond Hewitt asking the government to get the police higher up the vaccination priority list and Diwakar saying that the NHS was under such strain that he couldn’t conceive of planning more than two weeks in advance at the moment. So the idea of people booking summer holidays was a massive category error.
There was time for Patel to dismiss quarantine hotels as “speculative” – if the home secretary doesn’t know what government policy is, then who does? – and to brand vaccine queue-jumpers as “morally reprehensible” but she came unstuck right at the end when asked why the UK had the worst death rate, and whether the government’s own actions had been a major factor in this. Unlike at the weekend when she had tried to argue that other countries counted dead people differently, Priti Vacant went back to her customary diversionary tactics of semi-coherent rambling. We were in the middle of a terrible pandemic. The vaccine was a good thing. It was far too early to say when the lockdown would end. Every death was a tragedy. Perhaps the repetition was a comfort to her, but most listeners had nodded off by the time she closed with the assertion that at all times the government had been guided by the science. There are many scientists – including an increasingly vocal Patrick Vallance – who would beg to differ. But for Patel it was job done: a press conference that had contributed little to public understanding. Onwards and sideways."

Priti Patel, the home secretary, has announced new Â£800 fines for people who attend house parties in breach of lockdown rules. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, she said: Next week we will be introducing a new Â£800 fine for those attending house parties, which will double for each repeat offence to a maximum level of Â£6,400. These fines will apply to those who attend illegal gatherings of more than 15 people in homes. The science is clear: such irresponsible behaviour poses a significant threat to public - not only to those in attendance, but also to the wonderful police officers who attend to shut down these events. The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has decided to extend its lockdown until 5 March. At a news conference Arlene Foster, the first minister, said: The executive today has reviewed the current restrictions and agreed that they remain an appropriate and necessary response to the serious and imminent threat posed by Covid-19. Following a detailed outline from health highlighting continuing pressures on hospitals and intensive care units and the emergence of highly-transmissible variants the executive has agreed that the restrictions will be extended for four weeks until March 5 2021. Glastonbury 2021 is officially cancelled, the festivalâ€™s organisers have announced. The UK vaccination programme has recorded its best day so far, with 363,508 people vaccinate, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said.
A year of the Covid-19 pandemic has wiped out a decade of progress in reducing unemployment in Britainâ€™s industrial heartlands and left the jobless rate higher than after the financial meltdown of the late 2000s, a report has found. A mandatory requirement that electronic tags be worn by international arrivals for up to 10 days to ensure they abided by Covid-19 quarantine restrictions was an option explored by the Home Office under controversial plans, the Guardian has learned. Covid outbreaks are slowing delivery of the vaccine to some care homes in England as GPs postpone jabs in infected facilities, the Guardian has learnt. A lorry load of potato crisps destined for a Northern Ireland supermarket was held up for two days because of Brexit checks, MPs have been told.

2021-01-21T16:09:15Z,politics,Politics,No 10 takes relaxed view as Biden removes Churchill bust from Oval Office,"Downing Street has said it is up to Joe Biden how he decorates the Oval Office, after it was reported that a bust of Winston Churchill, lent by the UK government, has been removed. “The Oval Office is the president’s private office, and it’s up to the president to decorate it as he wishes,” Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said, adding: “We’re in no doubt about the importance President Biden places on the UK-US relationship, and the prime minister looks forward to having that close relationship with him.” Johnson’s relaxed attitude is in marked contrast to his criticism of Barack Obama, when the former president moved the Churchill bust aside. Writing in the Sun in 2016, Johnson, then London mayor, and the author of a Churchill biography, called Obama’s decision a “snub,” suggesting it may have been because of “the part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British empire”. A bust of Mexican American labour rights leader Cesar Chavez was visible in pictures of Biden signing executive orders on Wednesday. The prime minister, who was referred to by Donald Trump when he was president as “Britain Trump”, is keen to strike up a strong working relationship with the socially liberal Biden, who the government hopes will attend the G7 meeting in Cornwall in June. Johnson’s spokesman was forced to field a string of questions about whether Johnson is “woke”, after the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, described Biden as a “woke guy,” referring to his support for Black Lives Matter and trans rights. Asked about her comments on Wednesday, Johnson appeared uncomfortable, before remarking that there was, “nothing wrong with being woke”. When the prime minister’s spokesman was asked whether Johnson would consider himself “woke”, he said: “You would have to define that, but you’ve got the PM’s views on what he believes, and specifically on his agenda to level up across the country, and ensure that everybody has the opportunity to succeed.” The Conservatives believe publicly rejecting socially liberal policies such as the removal of historic statues with colonial connections will help them to score points over Labour. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said he will legislate to prevent historic statues being removed, “at the hand of the flash mob” or by a “cultural committee of town hall militants and woke worthies”.
Johnson’s remarks about Obama, made during the buildup to the Brexit referendum, caused a furore. It subsequently emerged that Obama had simply moved the bust of the wartime leader – a loan from the UK government – to a spot in his personal residence. When Theresa May rushed to Washington in early 2017 to be the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, he swept her into the Oval Office to show that Churchill had been restored to prominence."
2021-01-21T15:47:11Z,politics,Politics,"Crisps lorry held up for two days by Northern Irish Brexit checks, MPs told","A lorryload of potato crisps destined for a Northern Ireland supermarket was held up for two days because of Brexit checks, MPs have been told. The Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin made the claim at the Commons public accounts committee (PAC) as the Labour party was told of the “disastrous” impact of the Northern Ireland protocol. Hauliers told the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, that Northern Irish Brexit checks had caused shortages of food, deliveries of equipment to the NHS and farm machinery, despite claims by Boris Johnson it was all going “smoothly”. However, officials told the PAC that Brexit operations were running much better than anticipated in Dover with no holdups on the Kent roads and 200 lorries turned away over a two-day period. Emma Churchill, the head of the government border and protocol group, said 636 drivers had been fined £300 in on-the-spot penalties over the past three weeks over the new Kent access permit required to get into the county in order to cross the Channel. She was speaking as research by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found that 60% of firms reported delays to shipments going from the EU to Britain. The data around port operations comes amid tales of behind-the-scenes chaos, job losses and financial burdens in Northern Ireland appearing overnight because of Brexit. “A lorryload of potato crisps was held up for two days because the haulier couldn’t prove the potatoes … had not been imported into the UK from somewhere else,” Jenkin told the committee. An ardent supporter of Brexit, he said the “whole point of the protocol was to prevent goods at risk of entering the Republic of Ireland”, not to check items that would remain in Northern Ireland. “This is ridiculous, this isn’t a threat to the single market. There is no purpose in applying the union customs code to these goods,” he said. At issue is the overnight introduction of EU rules on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the income of Northern Ireland hauliers and freight companies had dropped an estimated £20m since 1 January. “These are not teething problems. These are structural problems,” he said in response to a statement by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, that many of the problems would be ironed out during the six-month grace period. Uel Nesbitt, who runs a freight transport operation in Northern Ireland, said politicians in Westminster did not have a clue. He said the choke points were not the ports, whether Belfast or Dover, but the ports and distribution centres where goods were not even getting on to lorries because paperwork was not in order. “People are not listening to us. If it’s coming from the top that it’s all fine, that’s what they think. We had the prime minister saying yesterday things are all sweet and dandy. Well he hasn’t got a scooby doo of what’s going on. Come up here, Boris Johnson, and see for yourself because it is a complete car crash,” said Nesbitt.
Hauliers in Northern Ireland are urging the UK government to try to renegotiate the interpretation of the protocol. Burnett said extending the grace period, as some have suggested, was just “kicking the problem down the road”. One haulier, John Esler, told the Labour briefing that the overnight change had been devastating. His income has dropped 40% in the past three weeks. “Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit. I did not vote for Brexit. But I suspect our current secretary of state did, Michael Gove did, Boris Johnson most certainly did – but they ignore us. “If we do not get help, it will be P45s by Easter. It is as blunt as that.” Others blamed the two false starts for Brexit, claiming that meant British companies had not got ready for the Northern Ireland protocol which had been agreed a year before the trade deal. A government spokesman said: “We are aware of specific issues related to moving mixed food loads, known as groupage, and new guidance is coming soon, following a successful trial with industry.”"
2021-01-21T12:48:31Z,politics,Politics,4.6m people in UK given Covid vaccine amid pressures for tougher lockdown,"The UK has now given doses of the coronavirus vaccine to 4.6 million people, Matt Hancock has said, as he came under pressure to consider tougher restrictions given concerns that cases of the virus may not be falling. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, the health secretary said more than 5m doses had been given, also counting more than 400,000 second injections. “This virus is a lethal threat to us all and, as we respond through this huge endeavour, let’s all take comfort in the fact we’re giving 200 vaccinations every minute,” said Hancock, who was appearing from home, as he is self-isolating after being alerted by the test-and-trace app this week. Of older care home residents, 63% had now been vaccinated, he added. But Hancock was pressed on possible new restrictions after an Imperial College London study based on swab tests from more than 142,000 people across England between 6 and 15 January suggested that while new infections may have fallen recently they could be stable or even growing slightly. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health select committee, asked whether the UK should enforce new arrivals to the country to quarantine in hotels, end mixing outside households and bubbles, and follow Germany in mandating full protective filter masks in shops and on public transport. Hancock said: “We have looked at the question of PPE with respect to the new variant and the clinical advice I’ve received is the current guidelines are right and appropriate.” Speaking for Labour, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, sought updates on whether it was known if newer variants of the virus, such as that identified in South Africa, could hamper the efficacy of vaccines. Hancock said the “early indications are that the new variant is dealt with by the vaccine just as much as the old variant”. Ashworth pressed Hancock on the Imperial survey, calling it “alarming”, and asking why, given infections were so high in London, the capital and the east of England seemed to be lagging in vaccination numbers. “Yesterday the prime minister referred to ‘constraints in supply’,” Ashworth said. “What are these constraints, what guarantees has he got from manufacturers that they will be resolved, and by when?” Hancock replied only that he had acknowledged supply could limit the vaccination programme, and that there was at time “a lumpy supply schedule”. He said: “The manufacturers are working incredibly hard to deliver the supply as fast as possible, and I pay tribute to them and their work, but it is challenging and therefore it isn’t possible to give certainty as far out as many GPs and those delivering on the ground would like – because the worst thing would be to give false certainty.”"
2021-01-21T12:47:48Z,politics,Politics,Firm linked to Tory donor Lord Ashcroft wins £350m Covid contract,"A company linked to the Conservative party donor and former treasurer Lord Ashcroft has been awarded a contract worth £350m by the government to provide laboratory staff for the Covid-19 testing operation. The contract, awarded to Medacs Healthcare plc, which has an ongoing contractual “framework agreement” with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and provides locum doctors, nurses and other staff to the NHS, is one of the largest awarded to any company throughout the pandemic. Medacs Healthcare plc is owned by the Impellam Group, a company chaired by Lord Ashcroft, which provides staff for healthcare and a range of industries in the UK and other countries, including India, Australia and New Zealand. In its most recent annual report, for 2019, Impellam declared global revenues of £2.25bn, saying it was the largest provider of locum doctors to the NHS and “the largest supplier of specialist healthcare managed services outside of the US”. Ashcroft is the non-executive chairman of the Impellam Group, which owns Medacs, and he personally owned more than half of Impellam’s shares until 2010. He transferred a majority of shares from his personal ownership in April 2010 to Lombard Trust, which now owns 56%. According to the announcement made by Impellam at the time, Ashcroft’s children and grandchildren were the Lombard Trust beneficiaries. The DHSC contract with Medacs, which started on 18 December, is for the provision of “laboratory worker personnel for the NHS test and trace programme”. It is stipulated to run for two years, with the maximum payable, depending on demand for Medacs’ staff, £350,402,831. Medacs is an existing contractor to the NHS under a framework agreement agreed in 2015, which runs until 7 February this year. The agreement approves 64 suppliers, including Medacs, to provide doctors, nurses and other staff to the NHS. Framework agreements enable the government to carry out due diligence on suppliers in advance, enabling individual contracts to be agreed without a competitive tender each time. The government has spent billions of pounds during the pandemic under existing framework agreements or emergency regulations that have waived the requirement for competitive tenders. Questions have grown about the connections some companies awarded contracts have had with the Conservative party. Ashcroft has longstanding connections with the party; a former treasurer and deputy chairman, he donated more than £11m to the Tories up to 2010. He then paused his financial support, but resumed again recently, contributing £100,000 last year to the Tory candidate for the London mayoral election, Shaun Bailey. Made a life peer in 2000, Ashcroft was the subject of a political storm when he confirmed that he was still a “non-dom,” meaning his permanent home was not in the UK, so he did not pay UK tax on overseas earnings. He remained in the House of Lords until 2015, then resigned his seat, but kept his peerage. Ashcroft’s spokesman said that he was not involved in the negotiation of Medacs Healthcare’s £350m contract with the DHSC, and did not know about it until after it had been awarded. The spokesman declined to answer any questions about Lombard Trust, or Ashcroft’s current residency arrangements, saying they are irrelevant to the award of the DHSC contract to Medacs Healthcare. Elizabeth David-Barrett, professor of governance and integrity at the University of Sussex, said it was good practice for the government to have framework agreements with companies, and they could ensure good value for the public. However, she argued that improved processes were needed to manage the perception of potential conflicts of interest. “The public has good reason to ask whether the current system for regulating conflicts of interest is fit for purpose,” she said. “We can ask whether a major Conservative party donor should be able to benefit from winning business from a Conservative government, and the government should provide clear assurances that those connections played no part in any contract award.” Impellam said the company “has not benefited from any connections that any non-executive may hold,” and that the value of the contract includes wages of scientific and support staff who will be delivering the services. “The non-executive directors do not have any involvement in the award of contracts or the operational, day-to-day management of the company.” A DHSC spokesperson said that the framework agreement was concluded with Medacs Healthcare after a full open market competition, saying: “Proper due diligence is carried out on all government contracts.” The DHSC’s contract with Medacs was first reported by openDemocracy and the non-profit investigations organisation, The Citizens."
2021-01-20T17:56:32Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's moment of truth offers gnomic relief in sub-par PMQs | John Crace,"Maybe everyone knew that all eyes were on Washington. Both to watch out for any last-minute hissy fits or dodgy pardons from Donald Trump and to follow the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Or maybe Keir Starmer has finally got fed up with never having his questions answered by Boris Johnson and has given up trying. Whichever it was, this was one of the more low-key and least satisfying prime minister’s questions. Even the tech seemed to be having a day off in sympathy. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, had his second question delayed as his Zoom connection died. The Tory MP Nicola Richards couldn’t work out how to unmute herself, and by the time she did, she was unable to hear what was going on in the chamber. She wasn’t missing much. Neil O’Brien couldn’t work out how to switch off his phone, and the sound of children shouting could be picked up on at least two other remote questions. These were the biggest dramas of the day, missed only by the increasingly affected Desmond Swayne, who appeared to remain unconscious for most of the session. Starmer started promisingly by reminding Boris, who had only bothered to mention Biden, that the inauguration of Harris as the first woman – and a woman of colour at that – as vice-president was an equally historic moment. He then went on to challenge Johnson on the number of criminal investigations that had been put in jeopardy and how many files on convicted criminals had been deleted after the cock-up with the police national computer 10 days ago. “We don’t know,” said Boris, in what may have been one of his first honest and truthful answers he had ever given at PMQs. A rare moment, which on another day might have drawn greater surprise. Still, Keir persisted with a further three questions to demand exact figures on the data lost – something over 400,000 files – and a time when the data would be restored. Manually, if necessary. “That depends on how long it takes,” Johnson replied. Gnomic, certainly, but possibly only the second time he had given an honest and truthful answer. He didn’t know much about the progress of the data loss and didn’t really seem that bothered by it. His main expression was one of surprise that Starmer was making such a big deal over something he regarded as fairly trivial. You got the feeling that Starmer would have happily gone on about the police national computer system for much longer – these things probably matter more to a former head of the Crown Prosecution Service – but he belatedly switched to comments the home secretary had made the night before. Apparently, Priti Patel – clearly wanting to get her defence in early for any forthcoming inquiry – had said she had called for all borders to be closed last March, but had been overruled by the prime minister. A decision that might have cost tens of thousands of lives. Ah, said Johnson. He couldn’t remember Labour calling for borders to be shut back in March – carefully ignoring the fact that Starmer didn’t become leader of the party till April, and that the scientific data wasn’t widely shared with the opposition – and he announced proudly that the UK now had some of the strictest border controls. What he forgot to mention was that these new controls had only just come into operation this month and that it had been his natural instinct throughout the pandemic to do as little as possible. By now, though, Starmer had used up his six questions and was wondering why he hadn’t put his time to better use by asking why the UK had the highest coronavirus death rate in the world, how much supply of the vaccine we actually had, and why the rollout was so slow in some parts of the country. So Boris was free to do what he always does at the end: abuse the Labour leader for being “Captain Hindsight” and a “weathervane”. So much for the “kind and civil” language Johnson had been talking up on Monday. Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s spokesperson, later excused Boris on the grounds that his words were not “unpleasant” but a “description”. Just think of the accurate descriptions Starmer would now be free to use, if he wanted to lower the tone. Sometimes you just long for him to shake off his leash and say what he really thinks. A mess. A shambles. A liar. A narcissistic charlatan. Pathologically unfaithful. And that’s all before we get on to his mishandling of the pandemic crisis. That would certainly liven up PMQs. Blackford dragged up Theresa May’s Daily Mail article in which she had accused Johnson of abandoning the UK’s right to the moral high ground of global politics by threatening to abandon the international aid budget, but Boris pretty much ignored this. Moral questions have never unduly detained him, not even ones of genocide, as he sidestepped his government’s refusal to adopt the Lords’ amendment to the trade bill that specifically addressed this issue. People just had to trust him to do the right thing, he said. Even though most people have learned never to take Johnson at his word. No one looked bothered when the session ended. It had been a sub-par performance all round, something that always plays to Johnson’s strengths. But for the rest of the afternoon all eyes would be on the US, where integrity and decency were making a welcome comeback. It would be nice to think the same could happen here one day."

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is at the centre of a fresh row after saying the UKâ€™s borders should have been closed earlier, claiming she had been an advocate of shutting them at the start of the Covid pandemic last March. Downing Street has ruled out changing the vaccine priority list to give the police priority ahead of the over-50s - an idea floated by Patel this morning. (See 2.47pm.) The government has told schools to pause the daily coronavirus testing of students and staff in England, five weeks after it was announced as a â€œmilestone momentâ€� by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. Coronavirus vaccines may need to be redesigned this year to boost protection against a new variant that emerged rapidly in South Africa, research suggests, while past Covid sufferers may not be protected against reinfection.

2021-01-20T13:45:52Z,politics,Politics,'Absolute carnage': EU hauliers reject UK jobs over Brexit rules,"A British freight company director with more than 20 years’ experience has told how EU hauliers and transport companies are turning their backs on UK business because they are being asked to provide tens of thousands of pounds in guarantees to cover VAT or potential tariffs on arrival in Britain. The financial guarantee requirement did not exist before Brexit and EU transport companies who previously provided a shipping service for small and medium-sized firms have decided they do not want the extra financial burden, according to Colin Jeffries, who runs Key Cargo International in Manchester. “We’ve got people that are trying to bring textiles in from Italy but we are being told there is no haulage availability on that. Nobody’s willing to touch anything because of these guarantees. In Poland, we’re trying to get masks in for PPE in the workplace and we can’t get anyone to bring them over.” Jeffries, who has been in the freight forwarding business for 24 years, said his business nearly came to a standstill last week because of the sudden trade barriers erected on 1 January. He said it was “absolute carnage out there” trying to get EU hauliers to come to Britain, because they underestimated the gravity of the financial guarantees, known as T1s, that now apply to goods being exported to the UK. A truck with a £200,000 cargo would need cash or a T1 financial guarantee document for £40,000 in VAT alone, he said, a significant burden for transport companies with multiple trucks going to the UK.
Before Brexit these guarantees were not required for goods coming from the EU. “Many agents who are completing T1s have run out of guarantee funds, which they need to have in place,” he added. He spoke as data showed that an increasing number of freight groups rejected contracts to move goods from France to Britain in the second week of January. Transporeon, a German software company that works with 100,000 logistics service providers, said freight forwarders had rejected jobs to move goods from Germany, Italy and Poland into Britain. In the second week of January the rejection rate for transport to the UK was up 168% on the third quarter of 2020 and had doubled in the first calendar week of the year. Jeffries said one of the problems was how complicated exporting to the UK had become. While goods could sail through British ports before Brexit, now EU suppliers, like the UK exporters, had to provide a panoply of paperwork before export in addition to the T1 financial guarantee. Apart from the customs declaration and the T1 financial guarantee they have to provide a Rex (registered exporter system) document to certify the origin of the product, which will determine whether tariffs will apply on entry to the UK or whether they are subject to preferential treatment. Jeffries also hit out at the government for its repeated refrain to businesses instructing them to go to freight forwarders or customs agents to prepare them for Brexit. “They haven’t issued freight forwarders with a magic book,” he said. “A lot of people think we have inside knowledge because the government says go to a freight forwarder or customs agent. But we haven’t been given any insight. We are researching this like everyone else and like everyone you can only gain access to some systems from 1 January so you had no time to test systems until it went live.”"
2021-01-20T13:43:20Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel says she wanted UK borders shut last March,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, is at the centre of a fresh row after saying the UK’s borders should have been closed earlier, claiming she had been an advocate of shutting them at the start of the Covid pandemic last March. In comments that seemed to put her at odds with Downing Street, which only last week announced a tightening of borders, Patel said she was in favour of clamping down on travel 10 months ago. The remarks put Boris Johnson under pressure at prime minister’s questions, with Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, asking why he did not take Patel’s advice at the time. Last week Johnson announced the suspension of travel corridors to “protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains”. Anyone flying into the UK is required to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. International arrivals have to quarantine for 10 days unless they test negative after five days. In comments first reported by the Guido Fawkes website and made a day after the new policy came into effect, Patel said she had been an advocate of tightening borders at the start of the pandemic. Patel reportedly told the Conservative Friends of India group during a Zoom call on Tuesday: “On ‘should we have closed our borders earlier?’, the answer is yes, I was an advocate [of] closing them last March.” Travel corridors allowing arrivals from certain destinations with low rates of Covid-19 to avoid quarantine were introduced in July last year, the month after the government moved to implement quarantine restrictions on international arrivals. There have been frequent changes to the corridors in recent months, with countries dropped from the list as infection rates have fluctuated. At PMQs, Starmer said the government was not disputing Patel’s version of events, asking: “Why did the prime minister overrule the home secretary?” Johnson ignored the question, saying only that the UK had “introduced one of the toughest border regimes in the world”. The PM added: “I’m delighted that he now praises the home secretary.”
Starmer asked the same question again, which Johnson avoided for a second time. Last March the Daily Telegraph reported that Patel and Johnson were embroiled in a row over closing borders, with the prime minister said to have refused a plea from the home secretary to halt flights to the UK. Responding to Patel’s latest comments, the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “This is a shocking admission from the home secretary about the government’s failure to secure the UK’s borders against Covid. “Priti Patel’s admission, coupled with the complete lack of strategy for testing of travellers, means that the government has left our doors open to the virus and worrying mutations. Ministers now need to urgently review and overhaul border policy, whilst taking responsibility for the huge damage their incompetence has done to our national safety and security.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have strong measures in place at the border, which are vital as we roll out the vaccine.” In a damning report last year, MPs concluded that the government’s failure to impose special border measures in the run-up to the first Covid lockdown was “a serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. From late January to mid-March 2020, the UK introduced a series of travel measures, including quarantining 273 people mainly from Wuhan, as well as issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries. The list of locations, which was incrementally expanded, included China, Iran and Italy by mid-March. But it was withdrawn on 13 March without a reason being given and there were no border measures in place for almost three months until 8 June, according to the report published in August by the Commons’ home affairs committee. In the 10 days between the withdrawal of guidance and the introduction of lockdown on 23 March, the report stated, evidence suggested that thousands of new infections were brought in from Europe. “It is highly likely that this contributed to the rapid increase in the spread of the virus in mid-March and to the overall scale of the outbreak in the UK,” they concluded. Responding to Patel’s latest comments, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee which produced the report, said: “I have been raising the issue of the UK’s weak border measures with the home secretary and the government repeatedly since last March and up until now everyone has defended the decisions made at the start of the pandemic not to have stricter border and quarantine measures in place.”"
2021-01-20T07:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Furious Kent residents step up fight over Brexit lorry park,"Residents of a village near Dover have mounted what they describe as a “David and Goliath” battle to try to reverse government plans to turn fields at the ends of their gardens into a giant Brexit customs clearance site for 1,200 lorries. The local Anglican priest and former president of the chamber of commerce accused the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and the transport minister, Rachel Maclean, of a “clear abuse of power” over the lack of notice and consultation over the consequences of their plans. With less than two weeks to go before the end of an official 21-day engagement process, they staged a socially-distanced protest at the fields destined to become the White Cliffs inland border facility. They are demanding the government to “relocate to a safer site”. One pensioner was almost in tears over the prospect of hundreds of HGVs driving beyond his fence in a 37-hectare plot of agricultural land.
He complained the plans were hatched “behind closed doors” and only conveyed to residents on New Year’s Eve despite the devastation they will bring to their lives. “I think they way they have handled it is unethical, immoral and unprincipled,” said Peter Sherred, a self-supporting Anglican priest who has lived in the village for the past 25 years officiating at numerous local churches.
“The disgraceful thing about all of this was there was absolutely no consultation whatsoever with people in the local area or the residents who are going to be most affected, to whom these plans came as a complete shock. “We were told that at some stage in January we would be involved in an engagement process, where we would have been able to express our views, but I have to say I find that somewhat meaningless because as you can see they are already have machines in the land, they have created an access route to the land and yet they say it will not be approved until after the engagement. “I can’t see them backtracking on this project. This is a fait accompli,” he said. In an official submission to the Department for Transport he and his wife say: “The manner of proceeding has involved a clear abuse of power by departments involved [DfT and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] including the secretaries of state, under secretaries of state and officials”. The DfT says in its notice about the site, published last week, that the site will only be used for five years and says it will take feedback submitted by 3 February into account. “The White Cliffs inland border facility proposals are planned for temporary use and are designed to ensure that there are no significant or long-term environmental effects,” it said. But none of the locals can see the site being restored to something suitable in 2025.
Sarah Gleave, the coordinator for the Green party for Dover and Deal, has been leading the campaign to get the plans reversed along with Guston parish council members. She said the site was a result of “lazy, ignorant planning by London”. “Obviously we must have inland clearance sites but this is the wrong location,” she added. The site is one of 10 inland border facilities the government has either opened, is building, or is planning to deal with the full suite of customs, tariffs and duties checks that will be operation from July this year. Maclean wrote to locals on New Year’s Eve to notify them of the purchase of the land and the site. But Sherred and residents say they got a second shock last week when the department wrote to them with a more detailed outline for the site, which showed an exit route for lorries sited along a cycle and bus route proposed by the local council as part of a pre-existing regeneration programme.
“Mentally it is getting to me with Covid and everything else and now this. I just wanted to retire peacefully,” said a visibly distraught Kieron Jaynes, 70, as he explained how hundreds of HGVs were now going to skirt the garden in the rural home he bought more than 20 years ago. Dover born and bred, he has lived in his house for 22 years, and invested in the community through a business employing 35 people. Jaynes doesn’t want conflict or headlines and suggests one solution is the government, which purchased the site at the end of last year under emergency legislation, instead use the land for a visitor attraction for the coachloads that visit nearby Dover Castle and the cyclists and runners who use this town hinterland for its green credentials. The town has “such enormous history” over the centuries and yet has nothing for tourists, not even toilets at the castle, just a walk away from his house.
Neighbour Mick Palmer, 78, and his family are also suffering and his wife has become ill with anxiety and depression since the plans were revealed three weeks ago. “It is a travesty to say it’s a consultation. They’ve already got the bulldozers in,” he said. A DfT spokesperson said it was engaging with the local community and had extended the time period for residents to submit views from two weeks, their legal requirement, to three. • This article was amended on 25 January 2021 to remove a reference to Betteshanger Park that incorrectly said the area was flat and had been “paved over”."
2021-01-20T06:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's 'levelling up' council criticised as most members based in London,"A business council set up by Boris Johnson to rebuild the UK after Covid has been criticised for being too London-centric and treating most of the country with “contempt” after it emerged that all but five council members are based in or near the English capital. Just one of the 30 Build Back Better Council members is based in the north of England, two are in the Midlands, one in Cambridge and one in Scotland. None work for firms headquartered in Wales or Northern Ireland. Twenty-two are in London and three in commuter towns within 25 miles of the capital. Announcing the council on Monday, Johnson said it would “level up opportunity for people and businesses across the UK”. He promised it would “provide an important forum for frank feedback on our recovery plans”. But the geographic makeup of the council was criticised for drawing almost exclusively from firms based in London or the commuter belt of the capital. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said: “So much for levelling up. We’re the only city with an A rating for our CDP assessment (demonstrating our ambition and plan for net zero by 2030), we’ve created thousands of jobs in the city over the last decade, we’ve won national praise for our work on tackling homelessness, we’ve broken all our housebuilding targets and we’re the first city to have all care home residents vaccinated against Covid. But the government doesn’t think they have anything to learn from us.” Frank McKenna from UnitedCity, a pressure group set up to help businesses in Greater Manchester recover from the pandemic, said: “The one thing the government should have learnt from the last nine months, surely, is that we can’t have a one-size-fits-all-approach to rebuilding our economy.” McKenna, who also heads Downtown in Business, which brings together firms in the north of England and the West Midlands, said it wasn’t too late to broaden the council’s membership. “Even at this stage I would say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues: this just looks daft … At worst it looks like the north of England has been forgotten and is being treated with contempt again.” Henri Murison, the director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, said: “A large part of the British business community, including a number of its most significant firms, is here – not least most of its major supermarkets. It is vital that discussions about key business priorities reflect that.” A government spokesperson defended the appointments, saying: “The Build Back Better Council members have significant operations across the UK, employing tens of thousands of people in factories, R&D campuses, shops and forecourts across the Midlands and the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Council members were selected because of their long-term commitment to the UK economy and their combined capability to increase business investment, get the economy moving and create jobs across the entire country.” The council members include senior executives from companies including Google, Heathrow Airport, British Airways and Unilever. Outside London and the commuter belt there is the chief executive of Siemens, based in Manchester; the chief executives of Jaguar Land Rover and Severn Trent, both in Coventry; Sir Ian Wood of the engineering consultancy Wood in Aberdeen, and Poppy Gustafsson from the cyber-security firm Darktrace in Cambridge. The three companies within 25 miles of the capital are in Slough, Brentwood in Middlesex and Welwyn Garden City."
2021-01-20T06:00:12Z,politics,Politics,"'Woke guy' Joe Biden is an inspiration for Labour, says Lisa Nandy","Joe Biden won the US presidency as a “woke guy” who proudly defended trans rights and Black Lives Matter but also set the agenda on economic recovery, the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said as Labour seeks to build new alliances with the Democrats. In a Guardian interview ahead of the 78-year-old president’s inauguration, Nandy said the Democrats were looking to her party as a dependable partner and that Labour would seek to use the relationship to improve UK interests damaged by Boris Johnson. “On every occasion he’s managed to trash our reputation as a country that is reliable, dependable and values-driven,” she said. Nandy had been due to attend Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday but pulled out once England entered its third Covid lockdown. She hinted that Biden was an inspiration for how a Labour leader could win without compromising on progressive values and being drawn into culture wars. “Joe Biden – he’s a woke guy, he appointed an amazingly strong woman of colour who is also pro-choice as his running mate, he mentioned the trans community in his victory speech, he stood up for the Black Lives Matter protesters, he spoke out about the policing of that movement, and he’s never shied away from standing up for his values,” Nandy said. “People know exactly who he is. And he equally won’t be diverted off course when he wants to talk about the economy, when he wants to talk about Covid.” Nandy said it was clear Biden had not healed US divisions but his victory was “a source of hope for a lot of progressive parties around the world”. She said she believed UK voters would not be drawn easily into febrile conspiracy-fuelled politics and that the US election showed there was a “ceiling” for the amount of disruptive politics that voters would tolerate in a pandemic. “They want a government that they can trust to actually get a grip, not just on the health crisis but on the economic fallout which is already affecting people across this country and across America.” However, she drew parallels between the US and the UK Conservative party’s efforts to stoke tensions, referencing the Charlottesville protests where white supremacists were given some endorsement by the president. “Two years later we had the prime minister here trying to start a culture war over a statue of Churchill and also exactly the same pattern of behaviour in relation to trans rights … In 2019, No 10 was polling the red walls to see if it could start a culture war in northern towns over LGBT rights.” Nandy said she was aware the launch of two explicitly rightwing TV channels, one under Rupert Murdoch and another fronted by Andrew Neil, were targeted at constituencies like hers in Wigan, with a strapline of “being for the underserved and unheard … which is a deliberate targeting of voters in constituencies like mine where you’ve had 40 years of economic decline and repeated attempts by the far right to get a foothold”. While Labour wants to explore the Democrats’ electoral strategy, she said the party could more importantly act as a channel for improving UK relations with the Biden administration. “I wouldn’t underestimate how deep the strength of feeling about Boris Johnson goes, particularly with members of the administration who previously served under President Obama,” she said. Nandy said the UK public should not underestimate senior Democrats’ private disdain for Johnson, which has been heightened by concerns over Brexit and Northern Ireland. She said the Biden administration had communicated ways to repair relations, including a major push from the UK ahead of the G7 and Cop26 climate summit to persuade Australia and India to make binding climate targets, as well as taking a firmer stance on Russia and disinformation. Nandy said it was her understanding from conversations with Democrats that Alok Sharma’s appointment as full-time president of Cop26 was a “direct request from the US” as a demonstration of seriousness. She said it was not just Johnson’s perceived closeness to Trump, who dubbed his UK counterpart “Britain Trump”, but actions taken by the UK in recent months. “I think the Democrats feel, in the conversations we’ve had with them, that it’s not clear what Britain wants out of the special relationship any more,” she said. “They are genuinely quite baffled about why the British government took cooperation on military, security, defence and foreign policy off the table in negotiations with the EU,” she said. “The great strategic value of Britain to the United States is that we have a close relationship with both the US and the EU on those matters.” Russia and the spread of disinformation are another key target for Nandy where there is a wedge between the UK and the Biden administration. The intelligence and security committee report, published six months ago, has seen none of its 15 recommendations implemented by government. “We’ve got great big gaping holes in our defences,” Nandy said. “The City of London still operates as a haven for dark money that sustains the regime that Dominic Raab is railing against. Yet nothing has been done – that’s heard both in Russia and in the US.” Nandy said she would back sanctions against key Russian figures named by dissident leader Alexei Navalny, imprisoned this week in Moscow following a poisoning attempt blamed on the Kremlin. “In the end, if you don’t clean up the corrupt networks and dirty money, then you continue to sustain the regime that Alexei Navalny has spent his entire life fighting against,” Nandy said."
2021-01-20T00:32:28Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May accuses Boris Johnson of 'abandoning global leadership',"Theresa May has accused Boris Johnson of abandoning Britain’s “position of global moral leadership”, in her most unrestrained attack on her successor yet. Writing in the Daily Mail ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, the former prime minister had stern words about both the outgoing US president, Donald Trump, and her successor. May said that, in her view, Johnson has failed to honour British values by threatening to break international law during Brexit trade negotiations and backing out of the foreign aid target, writing that these two manoeuvres had not “raised our credibility in the eyes of the world”. “Threatening to break international law by going back on a treaty we had just signed and abandoning our position of global moral leadership as the only major economy to meet both the 2% defence spending target and the 0.7% international aid target were not actions which raised our credibility in the eyes of the world,” she wrote. In her article, May appeared to remind Johnson that he needed to live up to “our values” to have any aspirations for a truly “Global Britain” to play a key role on the international political stage, and urged him to adopt compromise. “We have been sliding towards absolutism in international affairs: if you are not 100% for me, you must be 100% against me,” she said. “Compromise is seen as a dirty word.” “We must reject a scene in which a few strongmen face off against each other and instead bring people together in a common cause. But to lead we must live up to our values.” May and Johnson have clashed repeatedly in the Commons over the past year and a half, particularly over Brexit talks involving Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement. Likening the storming of the US Capitol to “attacks on our own democratic institutions” such as the murder of PC Keith Palmer, who died during the 2017 Westminster terror attack, May condemned Trump for having “whipped up” a violent mob and described the election of a “decent” Biden as the next US president as a “golden opportunity” for Britain to become a force for good in the world again. “What happened in Washington was not the act of a lone extremist or a secretive cell, but an assault by a partisan mob whipped up by an elected president. I know from experience that leaving power is not easy – especially when you feel that there is more you want to do.” May was the first foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House in 2017. • This article was amended on 20 January 2021. An earlier version said Theresa May “was the first foreign head of state to meet Trump in the White House in 2016”. The UK prime minister is the head of government, not the head of state; and the meeting took place in January 2017. These errors have been corrected."
2021-01-20T00:01:05Z,politics,Politics,MPs demand answers over lack of Covid support for self-employed,"Parliament’s spending watchdog has called on the government to explain and fix issues with the tax system that have denied whole groups of freelancers and self-employed workers financial support during the coronavirus pandemic. The powerful cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) said some of the workforce had “not had a penny” from the government’s multibillion-pound support schemes despite repeat lockdowns blocking many from work, while some large companies had received taxpayer support and paid dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. It said “quirks in the tax system” and problems with HM Revenue and Customs’ computer systems had allowed people to fall through the cracks in the support schemes and made it more difficult for the tax authority to identify fraud. Campaigners have warned that about 3 million taxpayers – 10% of the UK workforce – have fallen through gaps in the support system and have received no help since the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, with self-employed workers and freelancers among the most likely to be excluded. Demanding answers from officials, the group of MPs said HMRC should, within six weeks, publish an explanation of why it cannot help those freelancers and other groups that have been excluded from receiving any support, and set out steps it can take to overcome those obstacles. The report comes amid growing pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to refresh the government’s emergency support schemes as the UK economy edges closer to a double-dip recession during the second wave of the pandemic.
The PAC said it was concerned that some self-employed taxpayers may have moved on to company payrolls because of the government’s IR 35 tax rules – aimed at stopping tax dodging by disguising employment through so-called personal service companies – but had not been classed as employed at the right time to be eligible for emergency support. It also said it was common in some sectors – such as TV, film and the wider creative industries – for freelancers to work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between, which could mean they miss-out on financial support. The government has spent more than £46bn subsidising the wages of almost 10m jobs since the pandemic began through the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April. More than 2m claims worth more than £18bn have been paid out through the similar self-employed income support scheme. Warning that people were still falling through the cracks, the PAC report said that HMRC was coming under strain as it attempted to upgrade its IT systems, handle increased demand during the pandemic, and adapt to the UK’s post-Brexit customs regime. The report warned the tax authority it was spending too much time patching-up out-of-date and potentially risky computer systems rather than modernising them, with these old systems making it tougher for HMRC to provide reliable and timely data. Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC, said: “As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support. And the system is going to struggle, and in many cases fail, to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming it.”"
2021-01-19T19:13:12Z,politics,Politics,Senior Welsh Tory and Labour figures apologise for drinks event,"Three senior politicians including the Conservative leader in Wales, Paul Davies, have apologised over a drinks event in a Welsh parliament building at a time when pubs were banned from serving alcohol on their premises under Covid laws. Davies, along with the Tory chief whip in the Senedd, Darren Millar, and the party’s chief of staff in Wales, Paul Smith, said they had broken the spirit of the rules and were “profoundly sorry”. Alun Davies, a former Labour Welsh government minister, also said he was “very sorry” and has been suspended from the Senedd Labour group. A ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises came into force in Wales on 4 December. Four days later, on 8 December, a group of Senedd members and staff allegedly drank alcohol in the Ty Hywel building in Cardiff Bay. A spokesman for the Senedd commission said: “We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. “The Senedd commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.” A joint statement from Paul Davies, Millar and Smith said: “We are profoundly sorry for our actions. While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day’s work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through.” A spokesperson for the Senedd Labour group said: “A member has been suspended from the privileges of Senedd Labour group membership while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident.” Alun Davies said: “I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations, which I have consistently supported throughout the last year. “For context, the purpose of this meeting from my perspective was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill” [to improve the outcomes for people who suffer cardiac arrests]. This is part of my work across political parties on this issue. “The Senedd commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time. I have also confirmed to the commission that the regulations on the number of people present and on social distancing were not breached either. I look forward to the commission’s final conclusions on this matter.” It is understood the alcohol was not bought on the premises and was not served by catering staff. A spokesman for the catering company CH&CO Group, which offers catering and hospitality services at the Senedd, said: “We are aware of an alleged breach of public health regulations at the Senedd estate. “As caterers, we take our responsibilities and obligations to restrictions and public health regulations across the UK very seriously. We are currently undertaking a full investigation into this matter.” The Welsh government’s minister for mental health, Eluned Morgan, has written to the Welsh Conservatives asking them to suspend its members involved while the incident is investigated. A spokesperson for South Wales police said: “South Wales police is aware of an internal investigation being conducted by the Senedd Commission into an incident on the Senedd estate last month. “If the matter is referred to police, an investigation will be undertaken if suspected breaches of the public health regulations are identified.”"
2021-01-19T19:06:56Z,politics,Politics,UK proves world-beating at Covid deaths and prioritising profit | John Crace,"On the day that the UK took pole position in the number of deaths per capita in the coronavirus pandemic – I’m not sure that’s what the prime minister had in mind when he described the country as world-beating – one of the biggest political stories was whether Boris Johnson treated himself to power naps during the course of his working day. Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s press spokesperson, insisted that the rumours were untrue but stopped short of saying they were “completely” untrue. So maybe Boris just likes to spend a lot of time wide awake with his eyes closed. But if Johnson had been planning on a quick snooze, he couldn’t have chosen a better moment than the SNP’s Peter Wishart’s urgent question on visa restrictions for musicians wanting to tour the EU post Brexit. Not because there was anything inconsequential about the matter, but because in Caroline Dinenage, a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Tories have a natural barbiturate. Someone far better suited to reading audiobooks for insomniacs than her chosen career in parliament. It’s not just the monotone with which she delivers her sentences, it’s the absence of content. Rather she just bores everyone into submission by repeating the same things over and over again – something which in Westminster is regarded as a highly prized asset – so no one comes away any the wiser from an hour spent in her company. Her main thrust was that the UK had offered the EU a great deal for touring musicians but that the EU had turned it down and offered an unacceptable deal instead. Wishart and many others shook their heads in disbelief. Their understanding – along with the Musicians’ Union – was it had been the EU which had offered the good deal of a 90-day free travel period and that the UK had turned it down. “Absolutely not,” Dinenage said, while refusing to give any details and insisting that the EU had been telling lies about what it had proposed. Eventually Labour’s Kevin Brennan and others begged her to publish the full correspondence between the UK and the EU so parliament could make up its own mind about who was telling the truth. Now Dinenage became uncharacteristically coy, saying she would have to ask her superiors at several other departments for permission. Something she made sound as difficult as a breach of the Official Secrets Act. You have to remember, she mumbled, that the country had just voted for parliament to take back control over its laws and borders so now was not the time to do anything that might benefit the EU. Or the UK for that matter. Next up came the consideration of the Lords’ amendments to the trade bill. Or rather, the outright rejection of all the amendments by the government’s mouthpiece, junior trade secretary, Greg Hands, whose main objection to everything was that the executive hadn’t gone out of its way to take back control only to allow MPs to have their say. It had been bad enough in the old days when MEPs had been allowed to have a voice on EU trade policy. So why throw away all the advantages gained by giving UK democratically elected representatives the chance to mess things up? What was needed was a bit more trust. The UK had promised not to get involved in any deals that might trade away the NHS or risk online harms to children, so it would be helpful if MPs just took the government at its word rather than seek to cause trouble through greater scrutiny. But the key amendment was the one on genocide, with many Tories concerned that the government might turn a blind eye to the treatment of the Uighurs in its keenness to come to a deal with China. “We don’t have a free trade deal with China,” Hands declared triumphantly. So there was nothing genocidal to be considered. And even if there was, we shouldn’t trust the British high courts to decide what regimes had or hadn’t committed human rights abuses, not least because they may taker a harsher view than the compromised international criminal court. It should be the government that decided the ethics of trade deals, not some unelected UK judges. It wasn’t that far away from declaring the British judiciary to be enemies of the people yet again. Tory MP Nusrat Ghani interrupted to say that was why she had tabled another amendment giving parliament the right to vote on any deal in the event the courts had found our trading partners guilty of genocide. Hands looked genuinely surprised. This was the first he had heard of it. Well that’s odd, said Iain Duncan Smith, unusually finding himself on the side of the angels, because he had given the department a copy of the amendment a week ago and it had mysteriously found its way on to the day’s order paper. It was a staggering admission of ignorance and complacency but Hands did his best to cover his embarrassment by saying that nobody cared more about human rights than he did, but the damage was done. Several other Tories, as well as all opposition MPs, spoke out in favour of the amendment but Hands wasn’t in the mood for listening. His hands were over his ears. Given a choice of conscience or profit, the latter won out every time. That’s what will make the UK world-beating again. That and the death stats."

2021-01-19T14:43:59Z,politics,Politics,Business secretary confirms post-Brexit review of UK workers' rights,"The business secretary has confirmed his department is reviewing how EU employment rights protections could be changed after Brexit, while insisting they will not be watered down. The Guardian understands a consultation on employment rights was signed off by Kwasi Kwarteng’s predecessor Alok Sharma, who left after being given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference. Insiders say the consultation is ready to launch and has been circulated among some select business leaders. Following reports last week that the government was examining EU rules such as the working time directive, which sets a maximum 48-hour week, ministers said they were not eroding protections. But speaking to the business, energy and industrial strategy committee on Tuesday, Kwarteng confirmed his department was carrying out a consultation with business leaders on EU employment rules, including the working time directive. Asked by the committee chair, Labour’s Darren Jones, to outline the review, Kwarteng confirmed it was happening. “I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like,” he said. However, he added, the plan was to maintain “a really good high standard for workers in high employment and a high-wage economy. That’s what I’m focusing on. And so the idea that we’re trying to whittle down standards, that’s not at all plausible or true.” On the working time directive, Kwarteng said a number of EU countries had opted out of it, adding: “So, even by just following that we are way above the average European standard. And I want to maintain that, I think we can be a high-wage, high-employment economy and a very successful economy. And that’s what we should be aiming for.” However, just five countries have an opt-out of the time directive that applies to all sectors – and the UK is one of the five. Eleven other countries have limited opt-outs for specific sectors, mostly applying to doctors and medical staff. Asked about his role in Britannia Unchained, a 2012 collection of essays by then Tory backbenchers calling for reduced worker protections, Kwarteng told the committee that was “a long time ago”. He said: “We are absolutely looking at safeguarding employment rights. I know there’s been stories in the newspapers that there’s going to be some sort of bonfire of rights. This could not be further from the truth.” According to the report in the Financial Times, proposals in the review also cover rules about breaks at work, and removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements. Another proposal would be to get rid of the requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said Kwarteng had “let the cat out of the bag” after initially dismissing media reports. “A government committed to maintaining existing protections would not be reviewing whether they should be unpicked. This exposes that the government’s priorities for Britain are totally wrong,” he said. “Neither workers nor business want ministers to take a wrecking ball to the hard-won rights of working people and families.”"
2021-01-18T21:25:20Z,politics,Politics,PM tells business chiefs Covid jab is UK's best way out of recession,"Boris Johnson has told business leaders that efficient delivery of the coronavirus vaccine is Britain’s best economic recovery tool as he promised a sustainable fightback from the worst recession in 300 years. The prime minister chaired the first meeting of a new business council designed to coordinate the government’s economic response to Covid-19 with leaders from the country’s biggest companies. Aiming to reassure business leaders that the government remained committed to kickstarting the economy as soon as possible, Johnson told the executives from 30 major firms – including GlaxoSmithKline, British Airways and HSBC – that the government was looking ahead to the economic recovery and the business landscape after Brexit. The prime minister said it was important for the government and businesses to work together to rebuild the virus-stricken economy, and that he would support job creation, upgrade Britain’s infrastructure, and launch a “green industrial revolution” to help the country “build back better” from the pandemic.
Despite recent border disruption and intense frustration among business leaders over the government’s handling of Brexit, Johnson told the first meeting of the “build back better council” that British industry had opportunities to seize from leaving the EU. Johnson had been reported in 2018 to have said, “Fuck business” when questioned about the sector’s concerns over a potential no-deal departure. Sources attending the meeting said the government was in “sales mode” in a bid to strengthen relations with company bosses that had become increasingly tattered in recent years. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who also attended the meeting, told the leaders that effectively distributing the vaccine was the most important economic policy. Although no “big bang” removal of lockdown restrictions was expected, the chancellor suggested that vaccination would help to build a platform for a strong economic recovery in the second half of the year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, the trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, also attended the meeting, which included representatives from firms from sectors of the economy including finance, energy, technology and hospitality. Johnson told those present that with the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow this November and G7 summit in Cornwall in June, Britain had the potential to develop an influential voice in shaping a green recovery from the pandemic. However, green groups said there was a telling lack of environmental leadership at the event despite its high-profile billing. Attendees included the chief executives of oil and gas group BP and of Heathrow, Britain’s largest airport. “Boris Johnson’s ‘build back better council’ looks more like a polluters’ club,” said John Sauven, Greenpeace’s executive director. “It’s packed with some of Britain’s most polluting industries and investors, and green leadership is conspicuous by its absence. “We can’t build back better by relying on the same old industries that are fuelling climate chaos and the destruction of nature. It’s high time the government stopped favouring the usual vested interests and gave its full support to the businesses building a cleaner, healthier, safer future.” Connor Schwartz, climate lead at Friends of the Earth, said the government should be discussing green policies such as scrapping multi-billion-pound investment in road schemes and boosting investment in green technologies.
“This is a far cry from just two months ago, when the prime minister announced the need for a green industrial revolution,” he said. “Instead of listening to fossil fuel companies and airports, the government should turn their ear to the majority of the public who want climate change prioritised in the economic recovery to coronavirus.”"
2021-01-18T20:30:36Z,politics,Politics,Lawyers for Corbyn accuse Starmer of 'disingenuous' attack,"Lawyers for Jeremy Corbyn have accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of making “inflammatory and disingenuous” attacks on his predecessor following a row over the party’s handling of antisemitism. At a high court hearing on Monday, Corbyn’s lawyers said documents would help prove there was a deal with Starmer’s office to readmit him to the party, and Corbyn’s suspension “went behind an agreement to reinstate” him to Labour “at all levels”. Corbyn’s barrister, Christopher Jacobs, told the hearing: “The disclosure will enable my client to plead that there was procedural unfairness, and breach of a duty to act in good faith.” He said Corbyn’s treatment by the party had been “grossly unfair”.
Corbyn was initially suspended from Labour in October, when he said the scale of antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated”, in the wake of a damning report by the equalities watchdog. In November Corbyn was readmitted by the national executive committee, but Starmer ordered the Labour whip be withheld until he apologised. Corbyn has not done so, but did issue a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to “tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it”. In court, Jacobs accused Starmer of “resiling from a settled agreement, and going behind a final decision of the NEC”. He cited a speech Starmer gave to the Jewish Labour Movement conference on 29 November, in which he said Corbyn’s reaction to the watchdog’s report was “as bad as you could get”. Jacobs said: “We say that is an inflammatory statement and is disingenuous because of the NEC outcome.”
Jacobs also said there was an “inference” from media remarks made by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge that she agreed to stay a member of the party only if Corbyn was suspended. Only the party minutes and copies of any emails from Hodge to Starmer’s office would prove whether such a deal had been made, Jacobs said. “We need the records.” The Labour party’s barrister, Rachel Crasnow QC, dismissed the application, saying the matter was a “straightforward contractual dispute” that did not require pre-release of any documents. Crasnow also disputed there had been any agreement to readmit Corbyn to the party while suspending the whip. Crasnow argued in written submissions that Corbyn’s “purpose of obtaining early disclosure from the party is to advance a political, rather than a legal, position”. The judge, Lisa Sullivan, said she would give her ruling on Corbyn’s application “as soon as I can”."
2021-01-18T20:23:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson kindly and civilly abstains on helping the poorest | John Crace,"The prime minister appears to have had a personality transplant. There are those of us who remember Boris Johnson driving a JCB with “Get Brexit Done” on the front of the digger through a polystyrene wall marked “Gridlock” during the last general election. Others may recall him waving fish or a cheque for £350m made out to the NHS in the Brexit referendum campaign. Then there was the zip-wire, along with too many other attention-seeking photo opportunities to mention. In fact, it’s often felt as if Johnson’s entire political career has been built on one childish stunt after another. Some may also remember Johnson abusing his opponents. During the Brexit debate he frequently accused remainers of collusion, surrender and general acts of treachery. Only last week he was called out by the Speaker for calling Keir Starmer hypocritical. But enough is apparently enough. Boris has now officially distanced himself from the political stunt. According to Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s spokesperson, Boris has also undergone a damascene conversion on language. He now believes that our politics should be conducted in a “kind and civil” manner. So no doubt we can look forward to Johnson unreservedly apologising to Starmer for all the insults he has thrown at the Labour leader over the past nine months and to treating him with some of the respect and civility Starmer has shown him. At least these were the reasons Downing Street dredged up for the Tories washing their hands of the opposition day debate on maintaining the £20 increase in universal credit. According to Boris, Labour was guilty of a low-rent stunt aimed at unnecessarily worrying the public by calling for a debate on this issue. And because some Labour supporters had been angry on Twitter about the worst-off being further impoverished, Johnson was urging all Tory MPs to abstain in the non-binding vote. Only a cynic could imagine that asking his MPs – some from badly-hit “red wall” constituencies who might be tempted to vote with the opposition – to vote for a £20-a-week cut would not be a great look and that abstaining was the least bad political outcome. Indeed, some might even call abstention a stunt had not Boris already assured us that kind of behaviour was a thing of the past. We were at Tory politics Year Zero. With the outcome not in doubt and only a handful of MPs in the chamber, the debate itself felt particularly low-key. Opening for the opposition, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was keen to point out that calling for the £20 UC uplift to be maintained was not a stunt but a lifeline for many of the poorest families. What would be a stunt would be to introduce a one-off payment of £500 or £1,000 as that would not be available to the 800,000 or more people expected to lose their jobs in the coming year. Reynolds was also keen to offer an olive branch to the government benches. He wasn’t going to characterise them all as heartless bastards – that would not be kind, civil or helpful – especially as he knew that many of them secretly (and not so secretly) agreed with Labour on this, so he was just making a plea to the deluded and the misguided to have a rethink. And yes, Labour would ideally get rid of UC and replace it with a fairer welfare system, but as it wasn’t in a position to effect that change it was calling for the least bad option. There was no sign of the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, in the chamber – something Reynolds attributed to the fact that she was one of the many Tories whose idea of kindness and civility was to extend the £20 uplift for another year at least to see the country through the worst of the pandemic. So it was left to junior minister Will Quince to make the case for the government. He tried to look chipper and upbeat, but his optimism rang hollow. His job was merely to get through the session relatively unscathed. The government had been doing a great job in helping people out already, he said, but the way to get people out of poverty was through work, not benefits. That was why he was so pleased to have recruited 125 mentors to help people find jobs. He was also at pains to point out that the chancellor’s £20 increase had only ever been temporary and that come April there could be more than enough work for everyone – I’m not sure what he knows that every other economic forecaster doesn’t. It would be wrong for Rishi Sunak to act too soon by giving people certainty about their finances, when they were all about to become millionaires anyway. Giving the extra £20 would only make people feel bad about themselves. Labour, SNP and DUP backbenchers all pretty much restated Reynolds’s case, many of them citing emails from constituents about how the £20 had made the difference between survival and the food bank. As indeed did some Tory MPs, such as Stephen Crabb and Simon Fell, who felt that, although the government had done a good job in supporting the least well-off during the pandemic, now was not the kind or civil time to withdraw that help. They seemed to have less faith in the coming economic miracle than many of their colleagues, some of whom were profoundly unbothered about how the country was going to pay for its £280bn bailout fund but desperate to know where the £6bn to pay for the £20 increase in UC was coming from. Never let it be said MPs don’t sweat the small stuff. The vote though was never in doubt, meaningless as it was. Though everyone suspected there would be a U-turn on this by the government sometime between now and the next budget. And when it was announced, there would be no great celebratory stunt from Johnson about how much he single-handedly was doing to support the country. Rather he would kindly and civilly thank the opposition for showing him the error of his ways."

2021-01-18T19:16:48Z,politics,Politics,Treasury minister downplays need for immediate tax rises,"A Treasury minister has downplayed the need for immediate tax rises to tackle record levels of government borrowing caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Jesse Norman said a rapid economic recovery from the worst recession for more than three centuries could help ministers avoid increasing the tax take in response to record borrowing levels. Answering questions from the Commons Treasury committee amid mounting speculation that the March budget could be used to increase taxes, he told MPs: “It’s not absolutely obvious therefore that there may be any future need for consolidation, depending on the view you take of taxes. “Of course we may end up with a somewhat delayed but nevertheless very pronounced bounce. There are features of the economy which would suggest that could be quite significant, if you look at the level of household savings, for example, and data like that.” The comments follow weekend newspaper reports that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to raise taxes in the 3 March budget in order to bring down record levels of government borrowing. Sunak has warned that “hard choices” must be made to fix the public finances, and used his spending review in November to freeze public-sector pay and cut the overseas aid budget. The UK’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income plus other receipts – is on track to reach at least £394bn for the financial year ending in March, amid a rise in emergency spending during the crisis and collapse in tax receipts. The national debt – the sum total of every deficit – has risen to more than £2tn, equivalent to more than 100% of national output. However, major tax increases might well provoke a swift Tory backlash. The chancellor has also been urged by leading economists to take advantage of record low borrowing costs and to steer clear of raising taxes or launching a renewed austerity drive to allow a sustainable economic recovery to take hold. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said £40bn in tax increases may be necessary in future to put the public finances back on a sustainable footing. Downplaying the need for immediate action, Norman said the Treasury was still focusing on stabilising Britain’s economy amid elevated levels of Covid infections and tough government restrictions. “We [need to] stabilise the economy and try to keep things moving forward before we can start thinking about the wider framework of policy. Although, as I’ve said, the chancellor does expect to think in terms of strong and sustainable public finances,” he said. Mel Stride, chair of the Treasury committee, said: “I take away from this that it’s not a done deal that there will be tax rises. There are possibilities out there in terms of our recovery that might see us avoid what probably a lot of people are expecting. That remains to be seen.” • This article was amended on 19 January 2021 to clarify the definition of budget deficit to include other receipts."
2021-01-18T18:52:54Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock cautions against booking holidays abroad,"People should plan for a “great British summer”, the health secretary has said, suggesting that holidays abroad may not be a given as he revealed he has booked his own break in Cornwall. Matt Hancock’s comments come after the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested it was “too early” for Britons to book summer breaks overseas. Asked if people should book a trip abroad, Hancock said: “I’m going to Cornwall. And I have said before I think we’re going to have a great British summer. But we’ve got a lot of work to do between now and then. “What we can do is see the line of sight to vaccinating everybody by September and anything before that would be a bonus. As the foreign secretary said yesterday, we’re driving this as fast as we possibly can.” Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Hancock said admissions to hospital on Monday were the highest they had been throughout the pandemic, with one Covid patient currently admitted to hospital in the UK every 30 seconds. The latest government statistics show there are 37,475 people in UK hospitals and Hancock said the NHS “is under significant pressure in all parts of the country”. He said it was more vital than ever that people continued to stay at home and respect the restrictions. “Don’t blow it now, we’re on the route out with protecting the most vulnerable,” he said. “We’re getting the virus under control. Together, I know that we can do it. And we’ve got to stick at it, and especially with our plans for all adults in the UK to be offered a Covid vaccine by September.” The health secretary also did not rule out changing the law to protect medics from charges of “unlawful killing” should the NHS be forced into situations where doctors had to choose which patients to save. “I know that this is a very serious concern,” Hancock said. “I’m very glad to say that we are not in a position where doctors have to make those sorts of choices. And I very much hope that we don’t get in that situation and that everybody can get the treatment they deserve.” He said he had been given clear advice that it was “not necessary at this point to change the law on this on this matter” but it would be kept under review. “I take very serious questions of this nature,” he said. “That is not the situation now, and the data show that we are getting this under control. But that requires you to act by staying at home, unless you have one of the reasons set out very clearly as to why you can leave whether it’s for exercise, or if you can’t work from home.”"
2021-01-18T17:36:36Z,politics,Politics,Seafood lorries travel to Westminster for protest against Brexit red tape,"Fishing lorries from Scotland and Devon have descended on Westminster to stage a protest against the Brexit red tape they say is either delaying or ruining exports of their fresh shellfish to the EU. Trucks with slogans including “Brexit carnage” and “Incompetent government destroying shellfish industry” parked metres from Downing Street on Monday, but they stopped short of carrying out their threat last week to dump fresh fish close to No 10. “We strongly feel the system could potentially collapse,” said Gary Hodgson, a director of Venture Seafoods, which exports live and processed crabs and lobsters to the EU. “Boris Johnson needs to be honest with us, with himself and with the British public about the problems for the industry,” he told Reuters.
One operator, he said, needed 400 pages of export documentation last week to enter Europe. David Rosie at DR Collin & Son, which employs 200 people, used to send one or two lorries a night to France carrying live crab, lobster and langoustine worth about £150,000. He said he had not exported a single box this year. Fishers, he said, “lost their livelihoods in the turn of a clock” when Britain left the EU’s orbit on New Year’s Eve. Johnson has said he “understands the frustrations” of businesses exporting to Europe and pledged that any business experiencing difficulty exporting to the EU “through no fault of their own” would be compensated from a £23m fund that was being set up. He claimed that one of the current problems impacting exports of fish was Covid curbs. “Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic,” Johnson told Sky News.
Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by delays since the UK’s transition period ended on 31 December with full customs declarations, guarantees over rules of origin and health certificates required for every consignment. Food exporters have been hit badly as they also require a health certificate. In addition, any haulier with a mixed load, or “groupage”, can be held up if just one box on the trailer does not have the right paperwork. The resulting red tape from Brexit has prompted some importers to pay extra for empty trucks to cross the Channel in order to guarantee supplies can get into the country, one EU logistics company said. The company, which did not want to be named, said it had about 50 trucks delivering cargo every week from the EU to the UK, but they were returning empty as importers in key industries such as the motor sector were willing to cough up to ensure smooth passage. “Companies are willing to pay the price for the trucks to go back empty because it’s cheaper than being stuck in a lorry park for four or five days,” said the source. “We charge €400 to €600 a day, so it’s cheaper for companies to pay for the trailer to go back empty and then get another delivery back into the truck. It’s stupid at the end of the day but that is Brexit. “If they have a delivery coming from Belgium or Germany they would prefer the truck to go back and get a second or third delivery,” they added. “The UK is already the laughing stock of Europe with Brexit, but I have to say, and I don’t enjoy saying this, we are making a lot of money out of it,” said the source. The Haulage Association has said “something has to give” over the behind-the-scenes chaos. “The government is dodging bullet after bullet. If it were not for Covid this is a disaster that would be on the front page every day,” said Rod McKenzie, policy director.
Even with the correct paperwork one driver claimed he was issued with an on-the-spot £300 fine because it had taken so long for customs paperwork to be checked as his 24-hour “Kent access permit”, required for all international truck drivers crossing the Channel, had expired. The Department for Transport said that if a driver’s permit has expired, they should get a new one free of charge on the government’s website."
2021-01-18T17:27:17Z,politics,Politics,'A multiple pile-up in the fog': wine agent's fury at Brexit red tape,"A major British wine agent has described how his business is facing its biggest threat in 30 years because the government did not think through Brexit. Daniel Lambert who imports up to 2m bottles of wine a year for 300 retailers including supermarkets, said he is unable to import wine from the EU because of the complex and unworkable HM Revenue and Customs system, which requires companies to work out one of 10,000 different combinations to describe the product they want to import. â€œWe were a pretty good little business, we were doing quite well, until Brexit came along,â€� he said. â€œWhile we knew Brexit would be a car crash we did not know it was going to be a multiple pile-up in the fog with fatalities,â€� he tweeted in a thread over the weekend that has resonated with thousands on Twitter.
â€œHM Revenue and Customs are being as helpful as they can be, but itâ€™s not their fault they are civil servants. This is the governmentâ€™s fault and they donâ€™t give a shit about business. Boris Johnson said â€˜fuck businessâ€™ and this is exactly what they are doing,â€� he said. â€œWe knew they would screw it up, so Iâ€™m not surprised. Iâ€™m just disappointed,â€� he told the Guardian. Lambert, who is temporarily unable to import wine from the EU, said he would survive, but that ultimately consumers will lose out because there will still be a mountain of paperwork â€“ even if the initial problems were sorted out. â€œWine per bottle on retail will increase by at least Â£1 per bottle for mass market products; for niche small batch wines you are looking at Â£1.50 or even Â£2.00 on the bottle prices. Thereâ€™s another of those Brexit â€˜dividendsâ€™,â€� he said. Lambert started his business in Bridgend in 1992 and said this was the biggest threat he had faced, leading him to consider leaving the country when his children complete their education. His was one of the many businesses that thought they were fully prepared, taking detailed steps to mitigate against the worst possible scenario, a no-deal Brexit, five months ago. He went as far as setting up a bonded warehouse system to enable all the customs and duties paperwork to be done in house rather than on the border where they would face impediments in a no-deal scenario. â€œIt was very complicated to get to that point and in fact HMRC told us they were surprised at how prepared we were. â€œBy 9 December we had, as far as we were concerned, done everything we needed to do. â€œNow I literally cannot bring wine in from the EU,â€� he said. At the heart of the issue is a complex piece of paperwork, called Chief, that was used for imports from non-EU countries before Brexit. â€œNow you would think that government would want to make using Chief as easy as possible as now there are millions of businesses having to use it,â€� said Lambert. â€œWrong, this is the only HMRC system where there is no number to call. Just an email with a five-day turn around. Remember that when government say they are doing all they can to help, â€œ said Lambert. His company was familiar with the system as it had for years imported wines from places such as the US and Australia. The system worked for him â€œlike clockworkâ€� until Brexit hit. It requires him to answer 64 questions just to import a bottle of wine and can easily go wrong when it comes to matching a commodity code and a customs procedure code (CPC) as that varies according to the type of wine and its alcohol strength. â€œIf I remember correctly, Chief has 10,000 different combinations depending on what type of import youâ€™re doing, depending on the commodity code itself. So you have to get the combination between the commodity code and the CPC code exactly right, otherwise [it] wonâ€™t allow the declaration to happen, the system wonâ€™t give you the green light,â€� he said. Lambert said the system is â€œantiquatedâ€� and so complex even companies like his that are used to using Chief have come a cropper with next to zero meaningful help from HMRC. â€œI originally put a query into HMRC on 4 January to ask whatâ€™s the CPC code for this [a particular wine] and they said it depends on your declaration, after five days. That was the answer. Well thatâ€™s not really helping is it?â€� â€¢ [Note added 25 January 2021] HMRC told us after publication that it had a dedicated helpline for imports and exports. The number is 0300 322 9434. Businesses can also speak to an adviser online."
2021-01-18T06:00:21Z,politics,Politics,New No 10 team take on Cummings' legacy of chaos and acrimony,"A subtle signal was sent across Whitehall last week when Tom Scholar, once identified by aides loyal to Dominic Cummings as on the notorious “shit list” of senior civil servants, was reappointed as permanent secretary to the Treasury. It appeared that the war once waged against opinionated mandarins was over, and the threats of a revolution had left the building with Boris Johnson’s senior aide. The prime minister now has a new machine, most notably in his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, and his press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who plan to give his No 10 tenure a reset. Senior sources said they hoped it would mean a period of reasonable continuity and far less stories about different internal restructures. “It makes a change to have the weekend papers mercifully free of the fascinating ways Cabinet Office rooms are being reorganised,” one MP joked.
Johnson’s boosterism, and Matt Hancock’s, have led to a multitude of issues, including impossible targets being set – as well as a combative approach from the No 10 operation that sought never to give in to press criticism, but which ended up in embarrassing U-turns. Those days are far from over, but there is now a concerted attempt at diplomacy with MPs to try to predict issues before they arise, as well as heavily caveating targets as Johnson did in his press appearances this week about the vaccine rollout. Stratton held a briefing call with Conservative MPs this week, and though a number lined up to berate the government for falling into “bear traps” set by Labour and urged the comms operation to get better at rebuttal, the mood after was optimistic. “It was very good, she was extremely impressive,” said one senior MP. The relaunch has hardly gone without a hitch, because Johnson himself is the root of many of the issues. The prime minister was deeply personally reluctant to cancel the proposed Christmas mixing and so aides dutifully briefed straight after a crisis meeting with the devolved administrations that the prime minister had saved Christmas. But within days the picture was so desperate Johnson had no alternative but to change course. The same pattern followed with schools: it was Johnson who personally held out to keep them open until his chief scientists said they would raise the Covid alert to its highest level, meaning the NHS was under serious threat. Cummings’ big ideas for reform of the civil service and the machinery of government have been a key casualty of his departure. He promised to make it smaller, more nimble, less London-centric and open to “weirdos and misfits”, and cracked down hard on special advisers, making them report directly to him.
One of those named on the “shit list”, Sir Philip Rutnam, resigned after a series of briefings to the media claimed he had obstructed and undermined several home secretaries. He claims he was forced out after standing up to Patel for bullying Home Office staff. In all, five senior civil servants have resigned, and Rutnam is claiming constructive dismissal, but Cummings’ critics say that beyond instilling a fear and resentment, little changed in the structures of the civil service and his reforms to recruitment policies have fallen flat. The five replacements are predominantly from the same backgrounds as their predecessors, there has been no major overhaul of No 10’s structures and recruitment policies have continued much as they were before Johnson’s election. Some within Whitehall say Cummings can claim some credit for arguing that Whitehall offices should move out of London – a proposal that appears to be coming to fruition, with plans for a new northern campus for the Treasury. But Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants and “Spads”, said there was little evidence there would be much – if any – legacy of the Cummings period at No 10.
“For all the talk of reform, the reality felt more like a culture war based on preconceived ideas, rather than a genuine attempt to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the civil service to implement meaningful reform. Chaos and acrimony do not lead to better government, it is not an effective way to lead. Whether those lessons will be learned by No 10, only time will tell.” Johnson still feels strongly about improving government delivery; aides say he has been particularly frustrated in recent days by some of the bureaucratic hurdles around vaccine distribution. Sir Michael Barber, who ran the prime minister’s delivery unit under Tony Blair, has been brought back into Downing Street to oversee a rapid review of government delivery. Insiders are expecting some changes in the Downing Street policy unit, which one described as “shambolic – but mainly because we have no policy”. Other projects spearheaded by Cummings are still alive but are being revised – including his most important personal priority pre-Covid, which was the creation of a “high risk, high reward” research agency modelled on the US’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), with a budget of £800m over five years. Cummings felt so passionately about the project that his WhatsApp profile had the slogan “Get Brexit Done then Arpa”. The project was meant to launch last year but no green paper has been forthcoming. Cummings is said to have spent his notice period continuing to work on plans for the government’s mass testing programme, Operation Moonshot. Although Whitehall never calls it so, the programme is still very much alive – though plans to test millions of schoolchildren for coronavirus every week appear to be in disarray after the UK regulator refused to formally approve the daily testing of pupils in England. Another big gamble – a planning algorithm to set targets for new housing – is being radically revised after a Tory revolt. The departure of Johnson’s former senior adviser Lee Cain has also prompted rumours another project is in its death throes – the long-delayed televised Downing Street briefings, to be fronted by Stratton. They were touted to start in October, then January and now postponed until at least the end of lockdown, though No 10 says they will go ahead.
“I would be astonished if they go ahead in the same form,” said one senior Tory source. “The timing has just never seemed right when what people need to hear is from the prime minister, not someone they’ve never heard of. “And the communications team who are now running No 10 are the ones who have been most sceptical about the briefings. Tough restrictions will be needed for a while, then soon as you know it, it’s the summer – can they really continue if they have to delay beyond recess?” Government sources say both Stratton and the director of communications, James Slack, are still fully committed to the briefings – and have the added imperative of having built a £2m broadcast studio. Any rumours of their demise are “total and complete bollocks”, according to one senior source. Another acknowledged there remained some opposition. “Of course there are people who don’t want it to happen – we are dealing with Whitehall and it is a conservative beast but we will get there,” the source said."
2021-01-18T00:07:27Z,politics,Politics,MSP Monica Lennon joins Anas Sarwar in race to lead Scottish Labour,"Monica Lennon, the MSP who led the successful campaign for Scotland to become the first country to provide free, universal access to period products, has announced her aim to be the next leader of Scottish Labour, challenging Anas Sarwar for the position. Confirming her intention to replace Richard Leonard, who resigned last Thursday, just hours before the midnight deadline for potential candidates, Lennon, who is currently her party’s health spokesperson, requires support from at least four of the party’s MSPs or its sole Scottish MP by midday on Tuesday to be formally nominated. Before her declaration, Sarwar, the centrist MSP who was recently made Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesman and who lost to Leonard in the last leadership contest in 2017, was the only candidate. He announced his own plans to run in the Observer, and has already secured nominations from eight Holyrood colleagues. Making her announcement on Twitter, Lennon – who was first elected to Holyrood in 2016 and enjoys strong grassroots support – wrote: “Following discussions with party members, I have decided to put my name forward to lead the Scottish Labour party. Our members deserve to have their say about the best way to take forward our vision for a fairer and more equal Scotland.” The election of Scottish Labour’s fifth leader in a decade comes after Leonard stood down, suggesting speculation about his leadership had become “a distraction”. Many in the party were taken by surprise at the timing of his decision, with Labour trailing the Scottish National party by at least 35 points in opinion polls and at risk of losing a dozen or more seats in May’s Scottish parliament elections. Leonard is believed to have made his decision after losing the confidence of trade union allies, including his own union, GMB Scotland. He narrowly survived a short-lived rebellion over his leadership by fellow MSPs last September. Writing for the Observer, Sarwar said that he had gained a new perspective on party politics and decided “we spend too much time highlighting our differences, rather than focusing on what unites us”. He went on: “I firmly believe we cannot go back to society as it was before the pandemic – insecure work, hollowed-out public services, an underfunded health service, and the constant focus on another independence referendum when there’s far more important things we need to be dealing with.” Before Lennon’s announcement, several Scottish Labour sources said that an unopposed coronation would not serve any new leader who would require a mandate to take the radical action required to overhaul the party’s fortunes. On Saturday, the party’s executive agreed to a condensed timescale for any contest, with the Holyrood elections less than four months away. A new leader is due to be in place by the end of February."
2021-01-17T17:33:25Z,politics,Politics,Tories' London mayoral candidate criticised for comments that 'attack working class families',"The Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has been accused of an “attack on working class families”, after comments emerged in which he appeared to suggest that poor people cannot be trusted with money. Bailey is running against the Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, in May’s election, which was delayed for a year by the Covid pandemic. A YouGov poll in November suggested Khan has a 21-point lead over his rival. Bailey has already been criticised for a series of controversial comments, including suggesting homeless Londoners could save up a £5,000 deposit for a mortgage. Giving evidence to a House of Commons select committee in 2011, Bailey said: “The key thing about poverty and poor people is that poverty is as much about mindset as it is about money. If you give poor people lots of money, they buy things, and not always what they need; they buy what they want.” The remarks were made when Bailey was an ambassador for David Cameron’s ‘big society’ volunteering initiative. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “This is a disgusting attack on working class families, which reveals the true colours of the Conservative candidate for mayor of London”. In a 2005 pamphlet for the thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, Bailey had previously claimed that “a culture of dependency rules the working class”, and “this liberal agenda hasn’t benefited the working class. The working class look to rules. The rules are important to them. Take away the rules and they are left in limbo.” He was also criticised last week when he claimed in an interview with Inside Housing magazine that his plans for affordable housing would help homeless people trapped in temporary accommodation because they could save up the necessary £5,000 deposit and secure a mortgage. “I don’t think the £5,000 will [be a problem],” he said. “The mortgage application thing might be a bit tougher … they could save for it, yeah.” Pressed by the interviewer on whether he was suggesting a homeless family in bed and breakfast accommodation could afford a deposit, Bailey replied: “Not all of them, but some people could. A full proportion of people could.” In response to Rayner’s criticism of his 2011 comments, Bailey said: “I grew up in a council house. I was raised by a single mum. I’ve been poor and I’ve been homeless. I’m proud of my working-class roots. “The only attack is coming from City Hall, where Sadiq Khan is raising council tax on working-class families by 10%. Something even Keir Starmer called absurd.” In a recent speech, Starmer called on the government to provide more funding to local authorities to prevent them from having to impose council tax increases at a time when people can ill afford it."
2021-01-17T15:37:12Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn to campaign against Murdoch's News UK TV channel,"Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to campaign against the arrival of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK television channel as he launched his Peace and Justice Project at an online rally. A more “just, free and accountable” media is one of four causes Corbyn is encouraging his supporters to back. He also urged them to help with organising direct support in communities, such as food banks; campaign for a green new deal; and press the government to speed up the delivery of Covid vaccines in developing countries.
“So many of the ideas we need to make the 2020s better than the 2010s were developed in and around the Labour party in recent years, by outstanding thinkers, but more importantly by demands of our movements, and the skills, knowledge and needs of the communities affected,” Corbyn said. “We will build on these policies, taking them further, adapting them to the post-pandemic world, so that our movement can turn the dial towards peace and justice.” Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour party in November, after being suspended over remarks he made when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its critical report on the party’s handling of antisemitism. But his successor as leader, Keir Starmer, declined to restore the Labour whip to Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP. The broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, gave the go-ahead last month to Murdoch’s right-leaning news channel, which is expected to be on air for four to five hours a night. It is expected to compete with Andrew Neil’s GB News, with the pair racing to be the first on air. Corbyn repeatedly criticised the role of the media in public life during his time as leader of the opposition. He was ridiculed in some of Murdoch’s newspapers, with the Sun’s front page on election day in 2017 urging its readers: “Don’t chuck Britain in the Cor-bin.” Corbyn gave a lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2018 calling for a taxpayer-owned British Digital Corporation to offset the power of multinational corporations in the media, though the policy never found its way into Labour’s manifesto. His digital rally also featured Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana. The new initiative will not be signing up members but Corbyn hopes to play a convening role in bringing together activists, trade unions and other leftwing groups. Setting out the aims of his new political venture, he appeared to take a sideswipe at his successor, saying: “If you refuse to argue for your side, our opponents win by default.” Some of Corbyn’s allies believe Starmer has not been sufficiently robust in attacking Boris Johnson’s government – and fear backsliding from some of the radical policies set out in the 2019 general election manifesto. Starmer has adopted the slogan “a new leadership” to differentiate his tenure from Corbyn’s four-and-a-half-year period at the top of the party."
2021-01-17T12:44:19Z,politics,Politics,"Make May elections in England more Covid-safe, Labour urges","Labour has urged ministers to make May’s elections in England more Covid-secure, after the emergence of a Cabinet Office document that warned the pandemic could severely hamper the process and put millions off voting. The paper raises the possibility that even if coronavirus infection levels are relatively low, it could be difficult to attract enough election staff, and that safety fears may “disenfranchise large proportions of [the] community”. Labour is calling for safeguards such as the possibility of spreading voting over several days, or having an all-postal vote, options that have been prepared for elections to the Scottish parliament, also due to take place on 6 May.
The Cabinet Office said the elections document dated from May 2020, and that the scenarios were part of a planning exercise, rather than predictions. Election officials have already said that the English elections will be logistically complicated, not least because they comprise two sets of votes – this year’s, and those postponed from May 2020. There will also be ballots to elect the London mayor and assembly, a series of other mayors, and police and crime commissioners (PCCs), with some voters facing up to seven separate ballots. Although they will be protected by plastic screens, there are concerns about attracting enough volunteer election staff – especially given that many tend to be older – and about finding venues. The May 2020 Cabinet Office document, seen by the Guardian, sets out two hypothetical scenarios. In the first, even though the Covid outbreak has been largely contained, the double set of elections causes “significant challenges for administration and supply”.
The other scenario theorises some limited social distancing measures, even as “overall normality is returning”. Under this, the document posits staff shortages due to redeployment of council officers, home working, and health worries for at-risk staff, plus a greatly increased number of postal votes. It also sets out the idea that social media posts “inciting fear of continued spread of Covid-19 threaten to disenfranchise large proportions of [the] community”. Cat Smith, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said it was “deeply concerning that ministers have failed to introduce new voting methods used across the world to ensure polls can go ahead safely”. She said: “Labour has consistently called for safer voting methods to be introduced, including voting over multiple days and all-postal voting. Ministers have had many months to make the necessary changes to protect our democratic process, but instead they are treating these elections like business as usual.” While the government has said it will set out its plans for the elections in England soon, there is currently no provision for changes such as spreading the vote over several days. Each UK nation organises its own elections. Scotland and Wales are holding elections on the same day for their parliaments, and for PCCs in Wales. There are no elections in Northern Ireland this year.
The Scottish parliament passed legislation in late 2020 allowing for May’s Holyrood election to be held over two days, for vote counting to take longer, for an all-postal vote election, or even to delay the election if it seen as too unsafe to stage on 6 May. Political parties are likely to put heavy emphasis on postal voting to ensure voters are not put off casting ballots in polling stations, but Scotland’s election management board says polling stations will be safe. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the elections document set out “hypothetical, made-up scenarios used in a planning exercise by officials back in May 2020. The document clearly states that the scenarios are not predictions.” They said: “Last week, the government set out its action plan to roll out vaccines at pace. We are working closely with the electoral sector, public health bodies and political parties to identify and resolve challenges in the successful delivery of the polls this May. We will set out this detailed planning in due course.”"
2021-01-17T10:57:48Z,politics,Politics,"Arrivals in UK could be asked to stay in quarantine hotels, Raab says","People arriving in the UK could be asked to stay in quarantine hotels under plans being considered by ministers to try to deal with the spread of the pandemic, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said. Raab said the government had “considered all of the possibilities” when asked about reports in the Sunday Times that ministers have ordered plans to be drawn up for the creation of quarantine hotels for arrivals in Britain. The report says the quarantine hotels, modelled on New Zealand’s policy of “directed isolation”, could use GPS and facial-recognition technology to ensure that people are staying isolated. Raab told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “We will consider all the measures in the round. In terms of enforcement, we are going to be strengthening the checks at the border – so when people come in, to make sure that they have filled out the passenger location form, that they have got that negative test that they have to vouch for before they get on the flight. “Also, because the effect of abolishing or suspending the travel corridors is that people go into quarantine and self-isolation for 10 days, we’re making sure that Public Health England checks to make sure people are adhering to those rules. “As well as changing the rules, we are also making sure that we beef up the capacity to make those checks.” Raab dismissed claims that the government had been too slow in setting up border measures to prevent the importation of new coronavirus variants. He told the Andrew Marr show: “I don’t accept that we have been too slow in this – we are broadly the same pace in terms of Canada and Germany.” Raab said the government target was to have delivered the first dose of the vaccine to 17 million people by spring, when restrictions could be lifted. However, he said that the English lockdown was unlikely to be lifted for the whole country at once, with a return to the tier system. “I think it’s right to say that we won’t do it all in one big bang as we phase out the national lockdown and people end up phasing through the tiered approach. We want to make sure that we can do it in a safe and simple way.”
He said the government would take advice on the easing of restrictions and publish its “exit plan” in due course. Raab would not be drawn on a Sunday Telegraph article reporting that civil servants believed the vaccination rollout could be speeded up to vaccinate all over-18s in Britain by the end of June, but said he was “quietly confident” that the government would meet this target by September. “When I look at the numbers, I think people just want to hear what the real facts are with this. We’ve vaccinated now over 3 million. If you take the UK compared to other countries around Europe, we’ve got double the vaccination rate of the next leading country, Denmark.” He refused to guarantee that all those who had received the first dose would receive the second within 12 weeks, amid concerns about vaccine supplies. “I think if we follow the roadmap and the supply chains that we have set out, along with the backup that we’ve got because we’ve got the volume of doses – 360 million – and we’ve also got seven suppliers, we ought to be able to deliver on that.
“But of course right the way through this pandemic, we’ve had to adapt to all sorts of different things. So we are just focused on making sure we deliver on the roadmap that we’ve got,” Raab said, adding that people get a “very high” level of protection after receiving one dose of a vaccine. The foreign secretary said people should not go on holiday as he warned that the NHS is “on the cusp”. “I think right now people should be staying at home unless it is absolutely necessary, so, no, they shouldn’t be going on holiday – I don’t think that is appropriate,” he told Sky. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said he would “look at” the option of quarantine hotels for passengers returning from abroad. Reynolds told Sky’s Ridge on Sunday: “If that is the most effective way to tackle that, I’d look at that. I’m not sure necessarily it is the case.”"
2021-01-17T10:30:02Z,politics,Politics,Media’s libertarian Covid sceptics under fire from senior Tory,"A vice-chair of the Tory party on Sunday launched a savage attack on prominent Conservative libertarians in the media who have persistently played down the dangers of Covid-19, arguing that they “have a hell of a lot to answer for”.
Neil O’Brien, the MP for Harborough, accuses prominent Tory-supporting journalists of making things up and repeatedly peddling claims that have been disproved. His increasingly heated disagreements with right-wing figures including Toby Young, Allison Pearson and Julia Hartley-Brewer has been building on Twitter over recent days. It mirrors splits among Tory MPs who are themselves deeply divided over how serious the virus is and the need for draconian lockdowns. But writing in the Observer O’Brien goes further, calling the group “the guilty men (and women) of the media” who must themselves be held to account for putting people at risk. He adds: “The truth is, the Covid sceptics aren’t really sceptics at all. They engage in motivated reasoning; make stuff up, and double down on claims that have been disproved. They’re powerful figures in the media, not used to being questioned. But the truth is, they have a hell of lot to answer for.” O’Brien says that from the beginning of the pandemic these media figures underplayed the dangers of Covid-19, then wrongly predicted that the virus was disappearing and by late last summerthen denied there would be a major second wave. Recently, O’Brien writes, they have shifted their arguments again. Now, “with the new variant exploding, and TV news showing ambulances queuing outside hospitals and wards full of people gasping for breath, the story had to change again. Yes, people were now dying. But not in unusual numbers. “On 4 January this year Julia Hartley-Brewer reassured us: ‘The virus kills. It just isn’t causing excess deaths anymore.’ This was rather difficult to square with the Office for National Statistics saying there were excess deaths, and that 2020 had seen the largest increase in deaths in a single year in England and Wales since 1940.” The MP’s clashes with the controversial journalist Young have created particular interest on Twitter. Last Thursday O’Brien tweeted that Young had excised his previous tweets because they had proved to be so wide of the mark on Covid-19. On the same day press regulator Ipso ruled that the Daily Telegraph must publish a correction over a column written by Young in July 2020 containing “inaccurate and misleading information” where he claimed the common cold could provide “natural immunity” to Covid and London was probably approaching herd immunity. “As the UK tragically hits a record number of Covid-19 deaths, Covid-sceptic-in-chief @toadmeister appears to have deleted all his tweets from last year,” O’Brien wrote. Young responded saying he did so because of attacks on intolerant critics of his views: “In fact, I installed an app last week that deletes all tweets more than a week old,” he explained. “This was in response to Twitter’s increasing intolerance of people who challenge liberal orthodoxies including Covid orthodoxy.” Earlier this month Boris Johnson faced another Tory revolt over legislation that placed the country in a third national lockdown as Covid-sceptic MPs on the backbenches made their feelings known. Some 12 Tory and 4 DUP members opposed the legislation. While the rebellion was much smaller than in previous votes – 55 Tory MPs opposed toughening up restrictions in a vote in December – Boris Johnson knows that serious differences of opinion remain that have to be managed. Last week in a message to fellow Tories in the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), which comprises around 70 MPs wary of lockdown measures, Tory MP Steve Baker said the government’s Covid strategy raised questions about the prime minister’s leadership. Baker told fellow MPs it was “imperative you equip the chief whip today with your opinion that debate will become about the PM’s leadership if the government does not set out a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter”. After his comments created another social media storm Baker later tweeted his complete support for Johnson writing: “What this country needs is the complete success of Boris Johnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour.”"
2021-01-17T07:30:10Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: Tory MPs and commentators who joined banned app Parler,"At least 14 Conservative MPs, including several ministers, cabinet minister Michael Gove and a number of prominent Tory commentators joined Parler, the social media platform favoured by the far right that was forced offline last week for hosting threats of violence and racist slurs. Parler was taken offline after Amazon Web Services pulled the plug last Sunday, saying violent posts and racist threats connected to the recent attack on the US Capitol violated its terms. Analysts from the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) said that Parler had become a platform where the ideas of mainstream Conservative MPs coalesced with those of extremists. Milo Comerford, senior policy manager at ISD, said: “By positioning themselves as a safe haven for free speech and an alternative to the alleged ‘liberal bias’ of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter, platforms like Parler attracted a motley crew of ultra-libertarians, violent extremists and conspiracy theorists, as well as more mainstream ‘free speech fundamentalists.’” At least nine of the Tory MPs on Parler joined the platform in an apparent show of support for free speech following Donald Trump’s clashes with Twitter over remarks he made following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota last year.
The social media giant warned that one of Trump’s tweets “glorified violence”, the first time it had applied such a warning on any public figure’s tweets. Twitter’s row with Trump prompted a campaign by American rightwing voices to move en masse to Parler, which encouraged Trump followers to join on 15 June with a declaration for internet independence. Days later, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly along with Brexiter Steve Baker MP and Ben Bradley MP, who was recently accused of linking free school meals with “crack dens”, joined Parler. Far-right provocateur Katie Hopkins joined on the same day, after her Twitter account was permanently suspended. Hopkins, who on Thursday joined Ukip in time for the party’s leadership contest, owned Parler’s largest UK account with 435,000 followers when it was taken offline. Other Tory MPs to join Parler on the same day as Hopkins include Mark Jenkinson, who last year alleged that food parcels were sold or traded for drugs in his Cumbrian constituency without offering any proof, and trade minister Ranil Jayawardena.
Health minister Nadine Dorries joined Parler on 21 June. Dorries had weeks earlier been reprimanded by Downing Street for sharing a video from a far-right Twitter account that falsely claimed Keir Starmer blocked the prosecution of grooming gang members when he led the Crown Prosecution Service. The most prolific Tory MP on the site was Bradley who sent 52 “parleys” and had more than 12,000 followers. Gove sent at least 26 parleys and had more than 5,000 followers. There is no evidence any Conservative MP posted anything untoward or what might be considered extremist or far right. Some of the accounts had been hardly used and some of those activated in June 2020 appear to have been set up only to support the free speech protest. Other notable Conservative figures on the site include pro-Brexit campaigner Darren Grimes. In June he told his followers on Parler that “it’s about time we fought back against big tech’s assault on free speech, free expression and freedom of association”. Comerford added: “Platforms like Parler must be understood as part of a broad online extremist ecosystem, ranging from mainstream social media platforms, imageboard sites like the chans, to encrypted-messenger apps like Telegram, all of which play roles in helping extremists to mobilise, organise and propagandise.” • This article was amended on 16 January 2021 to remove the statement that Maria Caulfield was on Parler. There is a fake account in the MP’s name on the site."
2021-01-17T06:45:09Z,politics,Politics,"Shock Brexit charges are hurting us, say small British businesses","Government ministers describe the post-Brexit headaches that British exporters have suffered since 1 January as mere “teething problems”. But Alex Paul, who jointly runs a successful family business that features in the Department for International Trade’s list of national “export champions”, disagrees. And he wants the real story to be told. Two weeks into the supposed golden era of global Britain, Paul and many other British entrepreneurs, large and small, are running into very serious problems. UK fish exporters are unable to sell into European markets because of delays at borders and complain that Boris Johnson and others misled them about Brexit. Leading supermarket chains are warning ministers of food shortages in Northern Ireland because of new border rules and bureaucracy. And small UK companies such as Paul’s, which thrived as part of the EU single market, are saying they may have no future at all in exporting into continental Europe because of the crippling new costs. Paul is a director of Leon Paul, based in Hendon, north London, which employs 50 people. It is a niche business, which has been in his family since it was set up in 1921. It designs and manufactures equipment for the Olympic sport of sword fencing. But in many ways it is typical of tens of thousands of small companies that sold some of their goods at home and some abroad, and enjoyed seamless access to the border-free EU market for decades. “Previously the business of sending orders direct to customers in Europe was very straightforward,” he says. “You put something in a box, sent it off with a courier and it got to the customer in a day or two days without any friction, just like sending something within this country.” Almost a third of Leon Paul’s £7m annual turnover is to customers in EU countries. On average each order to the EU has been worth about £200. But the European export side of the business is now looking increasingly unsustainable.
“We did everything we could to prepare for Brexit and are part of the DTI’s export champion community,” says Paul. But since 1 January, his firm – like other UK exporters – has been hit by three new charges. And four days ago the firm discovered another one that his customers in the EU will have to pay on receiving the goods. “As far as I can see, currently, companies like ours in the UK are not going to be able to do ‘end sales’ to customers in the EU any more. Particularly, small orders for anything under £100 will be completely impossible,” says Paul. The new export levies, which he says will amount to £160,000 a year for Leon Paul, are first, a “Brexit charge”, as the couriers are calling it, an export fee of £4.50 for every parcel shipped to the EU to cover costs of extra administration and form filling that couriers must carry out. Second, there is a “deferment account fee” of £5 per parcel that covers couriers’ costs of pre-paying import charges in the destination country; and third, a “disbursement charge” which is set at different levels in each EU country with a minimum of about €14 per parcel, or calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods, whichever is the higher, plus VAT in the destination country. This covers the costs of the tax authority in the recipient country inspecting and processing the parcels. For the past fortnight Paul has been trying to work out how to absorb the extra costs. But he is struggling to see an easy way. “Jobs lost will be lost here,” he says. “That is the reality. All of these fees will come straight off profit margins. “We might save some of the increased costs of doing business in Europe by setting up a warehouse there – and thereby avoid paying charges on every consignment – but we would have to make redundancies in our warehouse here and reduce the size of the business footprint in the UK. We are of course a relatively small business but all exporters will be hit with similar charges.” Were it not for Covid-19, such stories would be dominating the news. Privately ministers know things will get worse. Behind the scenes civil servants in Whitehall are letting it be known that there is little that can be done because the exhaustively negotiated trade deal is largely set in stone. “There is the potential to make some changes if both sides agree – that is in the deal,” said one leader of a UK business organisation. “But there is not much goodwill in the EU to help British business now. Business people like us can ask for more talks with the EU but optimism that we will get anywhere is in short supply.”
On Wednesday the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis will appear before the all-party Northern Ireland select committee. He is sure to be grilled on why Boris Johnson and he both insisted there would be no such problems. On 1 January Lewis tweeted: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’. As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.” As discontent grows ministers are also being warned that Scottish fishing vessels will begin heading in larger numbers to Denmark to land their catches from this week as a result of the bureaucracy created by the Brexit deal. An increase in boats making a two-day round trip to Danish ports has already been detected as trawlers face slumping prices in Scottish ports as a result of difficulties in selling on their catches to the EU in time. Industry figures are already demanding compensation for the businesses that are being hit as a result of the disruption. “It’s not just something you do at the drop of a hat, it’s a couple of days round trip,” said Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation. “But it does at least give the vessels a decent chance of getting a decent price. Talking to some of the folks in our association, they suggest there would be an increased number of vessels that would probably do that next week. Clearly, that has an impact on the businesses this side, in terms of the auction markets and the processors. “The prime minister has said he recognised that businesses are being affected by these problems and that there would be compensation for businesses affected. While obviously we want the problems to be resolved, it’s really important that those businesses that have lost significant amounts of money – fishing businesses and processing businesses – are able to be compensated for the losses because they have been significant. And we want to see the details of that scheme come forward as quickly as we can.”"
2021-01-17T06:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Proud to be English: How we can shape a progressive patriotism,"Towards the end of his 1930s masterpiece, English Journey, JB Priestley writes of “memories reaching from West Bromwich to Blackburn, Jarrow to Middlesbrough, darkly crowding in on me”. The suffering witnessed by the author during the Great Depression, he explains, turned him into a Little Englander: “That little sounds the right note of affection. It is little England I love. And I considered how much I disliked Big Englanders, whom I saw as red-faced, staring loud fellows, wanting to go and boss everybody about all over the world. Patriots to a man. I wish their patriotism would begin at home.” The writer lived up to the spirit of his prose. The Common Wealth party, in which Priestley was a leading figure, was highly influential in the formation of the postwar welfare state. But it would be very unusual to hear such warm talk about England on today’s left. In Labour circles, the language of nationhood, when used by the English, engenders at best suspicion and more often outright hostility. Brexit, an overwhelmingly English project, only deepened a conviction that rising nationalism in the United Kingdom’s largest country is a much darker affair than its Scottish equivalent. Xenophobia, nostalgia for empire and cultural authoritarianism are judged to be its trademarks. But if progressives are not, paradoxically, to find themselves on the wrong side of history, it might be time for the left to undertake its own English journey. English identity has become a fundamental feature of Britain’s politics . The editor of the New Statesman, Jason Cowley, is completing a book entitled Who Are We Now? Stories of Modern England. In March, the Oxford University Press will publish an academic study entitled Englishness: the political force shaping Britain. The zeitgeist is moving, and England’s left-leaning politicians need to catch up. In Priestley’s time, as far as the English were concerned, England was synonymous with Britain. Big Englanders didn’t need to waste time on clearer definitions. The whole world knew who they were. This fuzziness lasted well into the postwar period. Crowd footage from the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley shows the terraces replete with Union Jacks. For citizens of the overwhelmingly dominant nation in the United Kingdom, pride in England and pride in Britain simply overlapped.
A red, white and blue thread links the nationalism of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to this tradition. But the end of Empire and the rise of globalisation, followed by Scottish and Welsh devolution in the 1990s, chipped away at the foundations of what has been called “Anglo-Britain”. Scottish nationalism and the fallout from Brexit seem likely to bury it for ever. In May, assuming elections go ahead, the SNP is likely to regain an overall majority in Holyrood. Turbo-charged by pro-EU sentiment, popular enthusiasm for IndyRef2 may become irresistible. The Brexit trade deal places Northern Ireland firmly in the EU’s orbit. Even in Wales, there has been a surge in support for independence over the past year. A smaller England, post-imperial, post-EU and possibly post-UK, is taking shape. Interviewed by Andrew Marr last week, the academic Ailsa Henderson, co-author of Englishness and a director of the Future of England Survey, testified to a frustrated popular desire for politicians to treat “England as England”. John Denham, the former Labour MP and now director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics, has written that “political Englishness” has been around for 20 years or so. Ignoring it, or disparaging it, contributed to the widespread rejection, in 2016, of a wider European identity. Brexit, at one level at least, was surely the revenge of a repressed or unacknowledged emotional attachment to England, but Labour continues to steer clear of the subject. In his speech last month on devolution and the future of the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer referred to Scotland on 24 occasions. England was mentioned just four times. The Labour leader pledged to devolve power away from Westminster to council leaders, mayors and regions. But the idea of “England as England” remains too neuralgic to broach. As the academic and former Labour MP David Marquand wrote in the New Statesman in 2016: “the notion that the English have to decide who they are and who they want to be” is treated either as a “backward-looking fantasy” or “romantically archaic”. The derision heaped on Rebecca Long-Bailey’s somewhat sketchy formula of “progressive patriotism”, floated during last year’s Labour leadership elections, reveals the depth of distrust. More developed visions of how the left might change its relationship with England are out there waiting to be discussed. The writer and campaigner Anthony Barnett has made a compelling case for an English parliament as part of a remade, federal, equitable and regenerated UK. “The paradox,” Barnett has written, “is that England has to discard Anglo-Britain and become itself in order for the union to survive.” Jon Cruddas, the head of the Labour Party’s policy review under Ed Miliband, has argued that Labour, a party with a distinguished 20th-century history of nation-building and bridging social divides, can wrest the idea of Englishness from the right. “The English,” said Cruddas in 2014, “are independent-minded, sometimes conservative in sentiment, but also radical in outlook. But they feel powerless to shape the future of their country.” Cruddas’s policy review proposed the formation of an English Labour party. Nothing came of it.
Something needs to give. If the English left never bothers to engage with Englishness, its emotional reality becomes the de facto preserve of the right. Fears of pandering to nativism and legitimising nostalgia for a monocultural past are understandable. Memories of the rise of the National Front in the 1970s, and more recently the English Defence League, are still fresh. But what England is and can become need not be imprisoned within the embittered horizon of white English nationalism. The recent Small Axe films by Steve McQueen, exploring black experience across generations, were a landmark moment in the narration of the national story, seven decades after the Windrush arrived in Tilbury Docks. Half a century on from that World Cup triumph against West Germany, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, has championed the “modern England” that his diverse, talented team embodies. One of its members, Marcus Rashford, has become a national hero for his contributions off the pitch.
In parts of the left, there is an unattractive blind spot that misses the importance of collective attachment to an inherited landscape, both physical and emotional. That landscape is not immutable but it shapes a sense of belonging and context. For many Leave voters, particularly those who have traditionally voted Labour, the emotional landscape of “England” has offered a way to express communal values neglected during 30 years of excessive individualism, licensed by both left and right. The SNP in Scotland, steered by Alex Salmond to the left of Labour, understood this, successfully fusing social democratic values with national pride. Where Scotland led, its large southern neighbour can follow. England has a greater level of inter-regional inequality than any other large, industrialised country. A renewed sense of English nationhood can be part of a politics of social justice, greater de-centralisation of power and a re-set relationship with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But to get there, the left must lose its inhibitions and find a way to talk about building a proud, democratic, inclusive “Little England”."
2021-01-16T22:00:43Z,politics,Politics,Anas Sarwar:  ‘I’ll rebuild Labour party in Scotland’,"Anas Sarwar, a 37-year-old former dentist and member of the Scottish parliament, sets out his stall today to become Labour’s next leader in Scotland as he says the cause of equality – not independence – should be top of the political agenda. Sarwar missed out in the race for the leadership four years ago to Richard Leonard, who resigned last week after failing to challenge the SNP as the dominant force in Scottish politics. Writing online in the Observer, the son of former Glasgow Labour MP Mohammad Sarwar and an early frontrunner says his task is to “rebuild” Labour north of the border after recent electoral humiliations. It finished fifth in the 2019 European elections and fourth in the general election later that year in terms of the number of seats won. His fellow MSP Monica Lennon, Labour’s health spokesperson at Holyrood, is seen as another likely candidate. With the campaigns for May’s Holyrood elections due to start in March, Labour sources say they hope to have a new leader in place by the end of February. Sarwar says internal wrangling must be replaced by a sense of united purpose. “Over the past few years, I have gained a new perspective on our politics and realised that the things we argue about mean little to people’s lives. We spend too much time highlighting our differences, rather than focusing on what unites us.” He says life cannot not be the same after Covid-19, and that the focus must be on advancing equality in society rather than the cause of taking Scotland out of the union. “I firmly believe we cannot go back to society as it was before the pandemic – insecure work, hollowed- out public services, an underfunded health service, and the constant focus on another independence referendum when there’s far more important things we need to be dealing with.” He adds: “Scottish Labour can compete again if we offer a positive alternative – a plan to heal our wounds, to reunite our people and to rebuild our country.” He cites his own personal experiences growing up in Glasgow and facing racism, saying they have taught him about the need to speak up and act against prejudice. “Speaking out against the racism I’ve faced was the hardest thing I’ve done in politics. My family faced death threats as a result. But I’ve used that experience to spend my time in our communities working on what unites us and bringing people together – I have listened and I have learnt. “I want to bring that same approach to our Labour movement so that we can rebuild our party and rebuild our country.” Leonard resigned last Thursday, throwing Labour into turmoil just months before the crucial Scottish elections – which the SNP hope will demonstrate increased support for independence – are due to take place. In a statement Leonard, who was from the party’s left and an ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said after having failed to re-establish Labour as a threat to the SNP he had “come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party” to step aside."
2021-01-16T21:00:42Z,politics,Politics,Firms accused of putting workers’ lives at risk by bending lockdown trading rules,"Irresponsible firms are exploiting looser lockdown regulations to bring thousands of non-essential workers into sometimes busy workplaces, with little chance of enforcement action by the nation’s safety watchdog. Analysis by the Observer shows that no enforcement notices have been served on companies by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspectors for Covid safety breaches since the country went into the latest lockdown, despite being contacted 2,945 times about workplace safety issues between 6 and 14 January. Overall, just 0.1% of the nearly 97,000 Covid safety cases dealt with by the agency during the pandemic appear to have resulted in an improvement or prohibition safety notice, with not a single company prosecuted for Covid-related breaches of safety laws. This comes as the latest Public Health England surveillance data suggests workplace infections surged as people returned to work in January. The number of coronavirus outbreaks in workplaces rose by almost 70% in the first week of the national lockdown, with 175 Covid case clusters reported in English workplaces, not including care homes, hospitals and schools. New polling carried out by the TUC shows that fewer than half of workers are in workplaces with Covid-secure risk assessments. In the past week, the government has focused attention on the failure of some people to stick to social distancing rules, from the release of a video of police approaching an individual in a parked car to an advert warning that “grabbing a coffee can kill”. But experts and unions have warned that unsafe workplaces may be playing a bigger role in fuelling the pandemic. “If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules,” said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady. She called for big increases in resources for the HSE to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk. Non-essential shops are supposed to be shut and most workers are expected to work from home to reduce the transmission of the virus, but unlike the first national lockdown all businesses are allowed to provide click and collect services in England. This contrasts with Scotland, where non-essential retailers were on Saturday banned from allowing customers to pick up goods ordered online. Shop assistant Mike Richards, who works in a luxury fashion store in the centre of Birmingham, was furloughed during the first national lockdown in March but ordered to come into work last week to make sales calls alongside his colleagues under the guise of click and collect. “We got an email out of the blue saying, ‘You’ve got to get back into the store to sell.’ This is a luxury fashion brand – how can it be essential?”
Richards (not his real name) had to travel by train into work and was told to call clients who had previously bought luxury handbags. “There were eight of us in the store that day. We were masked up but there was hardly any socially distancing,” he said. “Every single facet of what we’re doing could be done in the comfort of our own homes. But we’re being forced to go in. It’s an irresponsible act, for the sake of a little bit of profit for a multibillion-pound company.” He added that staff had been given letters in case they were stopped by the police on the way to work. “It says, ‘We are carrying out duties of click and collect and home deliveries.’ Nowhere does it say, ‘This person is in the store selling’, which is what we are actually doing.” Professor Susan Michie, who sits on one of the government’s Sage subcommittees, said people were being needlessly driven into workplaces amid a raging pandemic, which has pushed the NHS to the brink in many parts of the country. “Every day I get contacted by distraught people who are being forced into workplaces, which they feel are completely unsafe. They are having to choose between the risk of serious illness or death and losing their job – not to mention the risk of spreading the virus on the way to and from work.” She added that click and collect services were providing transmission routes for Covid. “They should all be shut down unless absolutely essential,” said Michie. As well as clamping down on click and collect abuses, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also placed a legal obligation on employers to ensure people can work from home wherever possible. This contrasts with England, where businesses only have to facilitate working from home. Administrator Sandra Jackson, who works for a small vehicle supplier in Essex, was ordered to come in last week, even though there has been an outbreak of coronavirus, with just over a third of the workforce testing positive in December and January. “I worked from home for one day and then I got a message saying, ‘This isn’t working. We won’t allow you to work from home.’ I’m absolutely furious about it.” Tradespeople in England are still allowed to carry out all types of work in people’s homes. Electrician Stuart Collins has been ordered to install smart meters in multiple homes every day. “If people had lost supply or if it was a new connection, I would have no issue whatsoever,” he said. “But exchanging existing meters for smart meters is not essential. All we are doing is assisting this virus to spread. They are putting financial gain ahead of people’s lives.” Professor Stephen Reicher, who advises both the UK and Scottish government, called on UK ministers to follow Sturgeon’s lead. “People have got to have the right to work at home if they can,” he said. “These are not wild and woolly ideas. They’re happening in Scotland. They could be very easily done. But the UK government seems to want to keep its head in the sand.” Michie said more businesses were being allowed trade in England and more workers were going into workplaces because the government’s lockdown rules were so broad that almost any businesses could claim to be essential. “The government has effectively handed responsibility to employers to say whether they are essential or not,” she said.
The HSE said it had scaled up its proactive work to check, support and advise businesses on public health guidance. It added that it had carried out more than 32,000 site visits during the pandemic. “Inspectors continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law. Our role in contributing to the national response to reduce Covid-19 transmissions and support economic recovery has been widely recognised,” said a spokesperson. A government spokesperson said: “The law is clear that people can only leave the home to work if they cannot reasonably work from home. We have worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce comprehensive Covid-secure guidance so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.”"
2021-01-16T20:00:40Z,politics,Politics,"Close coffee shops and nurseries during lockdown, voters say in new poll","Most people now believe takeaway coffee shops, cafes and children’s nurseries should be closed in a further tightening of the national lockdown, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. A majority of voters also think lockdown rules should be tightened on outside exercise with a ban on people walking or exercising with anyone from a different household. The findings are in line with a growing view among voters that the government is not responding fast or strongly enough to the virus. The proportion who think ministers are under-reacting is now 51% (+7 points) compared with a week ago, while the proportion who think they haven’t reacted quickly enough is 75%, (up 3) on last week and the highest Opinium has recorded. This latter figure includes 60% of people who voted Conservative at the last general election in December 2019. Some 51% believe takeaway coffee shops and cafes should close while 61% say it is time for nurseries to shut. There are broadly similar majorities in favour of tighter rules on outside exercise (53%), with 55% supporting the suspension of click and collect services in all but essential shops. Labour holds a four-point lead over the Conservatives in the latest poll, on 41% (up 1 point on a week ago) with the Tories on 37% (-2). This is the joint highest lead Opinium has recorded for Labour since the last election. The Liberal Democrats and SNP are on 6%, the Green Party on 4%, and Plaid Cymru on 1%. Johnson has also recorded his lowest score on Opinium’s “best prime minister” tracker, with just 29% picking him against 32% who would prefer Labour leader Keir Starmer. Johnson also records his lowest net approval since the last general election in December 2019, at -14 (34% approve while 49% disapprove). Starmer’s net approval has also dropped since last week from +15 to +10 now. Just 37% approve of the job he is doing as Labour leader, with 27% disapproving. Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “One of the consistent themes of this pandemic has been a government which is petrified of being punished by the voters for putting in place too many restrictions, and a public crying out for further restrictions because they are petrified of the spread of the virus. “The data from this week’s poll is probably the most extreme example of this trend, and perhaps one of the reasons why we have seen such a drop in support for the government.” Just 30% (-1) now approve of how the government has handled Coronavirus, compared to 50% (+2) who disapprove."
2021-01-16T17:02:44Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer outlines 'optimistic' future for UK with Biden as president,"Sir Keir Starmer has set out his “optimistic” vision for a wide-ranging new relationship with the US under Joe Biden. Speaking before Biden’s inauguration on 20 January, Starmer said he was “incredibly optimistic about the new relationship we can build” and that Britain must once again be “the bridge between the US and the rest of Europe”. The speech marks Starmer’s first full remarks on UK foreign policy since being elected Labour leader.
He described himself as “pro-American but anti-Trump”, saying he was committed to a new US-UK relationship, consisting of “a strong future together, on everything from security, climate change, aid and trade”. He said Boris Johnson had spent the last few years “cosying up to people who don’t have Britain’s interests at heart – thumbing his nose at our friends, breaking international law and courting the idea that he’s ‘Britain’s Trump’”. In contrast, he said that under a Labour government, Britain would seek to act as a “moral force for good in the world” after “a decade of global retreat” under the Conservatives. He drew on the examples of the work done under former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and urged Johnson to use this year’s hosting of the G7 summit to bring countries together to rebuild after the pandemic. “Britain needs to seize this chance to lead in the world again, just as Blair and Brown did over global poverty and the financial crisis, that’s what Britain can achieve,” he said. “The outgoing president is in the middle of being impeached; charged with incitement to violence, no less. And the US is more divided than at any time I can remember. “Amid all that, this is a moment of huge optimism. Of hope winning out over hate. And it can also be a turning point. Not just in America but also for Britain’s relationship with the US, and for global politics.” At the same time the Labour leader said he would look to build a “close economic relationship” with the EU, rooted in shared values with high standards and protections for businesses, working people and the environment. “Of course, Boris Johnson will never do that. He wants something completely different from Brexit. To deregulate, to lower standards, to slash rights,” he said."
2021-01-16T15:25:04Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel faces growing pressure over deletion of police records,"Priti Patel is under mounting pressure to give a full account of a police computer error, which may have affected more than 400,000 crime records. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, highlighted the gravity of the issue on Saturday and that some of the lost files pertained to live investigations. He urged the home secretary to take responsibility for the fiasco. The blunder, in which records for serious offences supposed to be kept in perpetuity were accidentally deleted, left police fearing criminals may not be caught – with officers already suffering what they term “near misses” for serious crimes.
The junior Home Office and Ministry of Justice minister Kit Malthouse released a statement on Friday blaming human error and saying urgent efforts were under way to recover the data and assess the full extent of the issue. He later said contingency plans had been put in place to ensure investigations could continue. Starmer told Sky News: “This government is very good whenever there is a problem at saying it’s somebody else’s fault. At a time like this we need the home secretary to take responsibility herself for this. At the very least she should be in parliament on Monday making a statement about this, explaining it, giving it the full facts and facing questions from MPs. That’s the least we should expect.” The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, also told the broadcaster: “You do not make our streets safer by losing such a substantial amount of information about criminal behaviour. This is extraordinarily serious. “The home secretary needs to be gripping this and tell us what’s going to be done to mitigate the risk, to try and recover this data and how do we prevent it from happening again.” Late on Saturday afternoon, Patel said Home Office engineers were continuing to work to restore data lost following a routine housekeeping process earlier this week. “Public safety is the number one priority of everyone within the Home Office, and I would like to thank the data engineers working to restore these records,” she said. “I continue to be in regular contact with the team, and working with our policing partners, we will provide an update as soon as we can.” A letter sent to senior officers on the National Police Chiefs’ Council on Friday from Naveed Malik, lead for the organisation on the police national computer (PNC), seen by the Guardian, outlined the scale of records affected. “Approximately 26,000 DNA records corresponding to 21,710 subjects have potentially been deleted in error, including records that have previously been marked for indefinite retention following conviction of serious offences,” he said. The letter revealed cases where some people police suspect nearly got away because of the blunder: “We are aware of a couple of instances of ‘near misses’ for serious crimes where a biometric match to an offender was not generated as expected but the offender was identified through matches between scenes. However, in these circumstances, without a direct match report to the subject, it may be more challenging for police to progress to an interview or arrest. “We are also aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation of the individual’s involvement in the crime.” Technicians are also scrambling to recover tens of thousands of fingerprint records, according to Malik’s letter, which said “30,000 fingerprint records and 600 subject records have potentially been deleted in error”. The deletion also caused chaos with the visa process. Applications, which are checked against the PNC, were suspended for two days but have now resumed. The Guardian understands that a rapid review identified the problem and corrected it so it cannot happen again. Malthouse said on Saturday: “As I’ve said, the affected records apply to cases where individuals were arrested and then released with no further action, and we are working to recover the affected records as a priority. “While we do so, the police national computer is functioning and the police are taking steps to mitigate any impact.”"
2021-01-16T07:00:25Z,politics,Politics,Brexit delays Mojo magazine as cover CDs remain stranded in EU,"The venerable cover CD, beloved of music magazine buyers for a generation, has been challenged by Brexit after Mojo was forced to postpone distribution of its next issue because of a delay in delivery. In an email to subscribers on Friday, Mojo said that while the magazine itself was printed, “the CDs which are produced in the EU, are not yet in the UK”. It is understood that the issue was caused by hold-ups in the process caused by new trade rules. Mojo, which apologised to readers and said they would be given early access to the digital edition of the magazine, is the victim of the latest logistical hiccups to strike business since the Brexit transition period ended. German freight giant DB Schenker paused UK deliveries on Thursday, blaming increased paperwork, while companies including Fortnum and Mason have reported problems delivering to customers in the EU and Northern Ireland. Marks & Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pigs, would now be subject to import tariffs. Meanwhile, international delivery giant DPD also said it was “pausing” road service from the UK into Europe last week. Mojo’s problem represents another challenge to the economics of the cover-mounted CD. Once a prized staple of music and technology magazines and even deemed a threat to the music industry when they appeared in weekend newspapers, they are now largely anachronistic as most people access entertainment online and fewer have CD players. The heritage music magazine is not the only publication to fall foul of Brexit-related issues. Electronic Sound magazine also said it had been forced to delay its next issue, editor Push told the Guardian, saying that a problem with the free vinyl sent to subscribers was “the result of issues with changing to a UK supplier”. Oliver Condy, editor of BBC Music Magazine, said he had feared the same issue with cover CDs and he had been “planning for this for months and months”. “We sent materials to the [CD] presses a couple of months early,” he said. “We haven’t seen the results yet, but we’ve got our fingers crossed it will be fine.” Bauer, Mojo magazine’s publisher, declined to comment, saying it was “still a live situation”. • This article was amended on 16 January 2021. The original incorrectly said Ocado was among the companies reporting problems delivering to customers in the EU and Northern Ireland. The firm only has customers in Great Britain (primarily England)."
2021-01-15T23:10:10Z,politics,Politics,‘Internexit’ for Leave.EU as domain name temporarily suspended,"Leave.EU has been forced to “Internexit” after the group’s EU domain name was temporarily suspended. It comes after the Irish businessman in whose name the pro-Brexit campaign group’s domain name is registered denied having any involvement with the organisation. Now visitors to the site are greeted with an error message, and the EU’s online registry marks the domain as under a server hold, meaning it is “temporarily inactive and under investigation”. Following Brexit, UK organisations are no longer able to use the .EU top-level domain, a change which – ironically – affected the pro-Brexit group, the most prominent owner of an EU domain name in Britain. Irish businessman Sean Power, who is based in Waterford, is still registered as the legal owner of the domain name. However, he has long insisted he has no knowledge of Leave.EU, and had never heard of the organisation before the Guardian contacted him on 7 January. “My lawyers are looking into this on my behalf presently and will be in touch as deemed necessary in due course,” he said last week. Last week, Neale Richmond, a member of the Irish parliament, wrote to ComReg, the country’s communications regulator, calling for an investigation into how Leave.EU was able to secure the domain name. “It is utterly ridiculous to think that Leave.EU could brass-plate an address in Waterford to maintain their domain name,” Richmond said on Friday. “They wanted to leave the EU, they have, that means they leave their domain too. “Many other questions in relation to data storage, fundraising, finances, donations and political activities would need to be answered if Leave.EU were genuinely relocating to Waterford. “Leave.EU are quite simply not welcome in Ireland, their questionable activities over the past number of years have brought a new level of toxic politics in the UK and beyond. “I welcome the suspension of this domain; I sincerely hope this is the end of this odious website and the related traffic driven to this odious brand. Good riddance.” But Andy Wigmore, the communications director for the campaign group, told the Guardian: “We’ll be back up soon – our lawyers will be taking action against those (and they know who they are) who have broken those delicious EU laws they love so much.” Calling Richmond a “third-rate EU fanatic,” Wigmore added: “if he wants to make those cowardly defamatory allegations outside of parliamentary privilege let’s see how massive Billy big balls Neale is then. “And any more nonsense from Brussels lovers like him and we may decide to put the full weight of Leave.EU behind the IREXIT campaign.”"
2021-01-15T22:30:27Z,politics,Politics,"Over 400,000 crime records could be affected by police computer error","More than 400,000 crime records could have been affected by a data blunder, with records for serious offences supposed to be kept forever accidentally deleted and police fearing criminals may not be caught, a letter from a senior officer reveals. The records were accidentally deleted due to a coding error on 10 January, and the incident affects fingerprints, DNA, and arrest records on the police national computer (PNC). The Guardian has learned that records related to serious offences, meant to be kept “indefinitely”, have been affected and police have already suffered what they term as “near misses” for serious crimes. Police leaders are also concerned that the chaos may cause them to hold data they should have legally deleted. Pressure is mounting on the home secretary, Priti Patel, to give a full account of the blunder affecting the PNC, which is run by the Home Office. A letter sent to senior officers on the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) on Friday from deputy chief constable Naveed Malik, lead for the organisation on the PNC, outlines the scale of records affected: “In PNC approximately 213,000 offence records, 175,000 arrest records and 15,000 person records have potentially been deleted in error. In terms of understanding the potential linkage between records, a one-person record can have multiple arrest records and one arrest record can have multiple offences linked to it.” The DNA database is connected to the PNC and has also been hit, the police chief’s letter reveals. It says: “Approximately 26,000 DNA records corresponding to 21,710 subjects have potentially been deleted in error, including records that have previously been marked for indefinite retention following conviction of serious offences.” Technicians are also scrambling to recover tens of thousands of fingerprint records, according to the deputy chief constable’s letter, which says that “30,000 fingerprint records and 600 subject records have potentially been deleted in error”. Police fear offenders may be missed. Malik wrote in the letter to police chiefs: “As the National DNA Database and the National Fingerprint Collection currently contain incomplete sets of biometric records, there is the possibility that biometric matches between crime scenes and offenders may not be identified.” The letter reveals cases where some people police suspect nearly got away because of the blunder: “We are aware of a couple of instances of ‘near misses’ for serious crimes where a biometric match to an offender was not generated as expected but the offender was identified through matches between scenes. However, in these circumstances, without a direct match report to the subject, it may be more challenging for police to progress to an interview or arrest. “We are also aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation of the individual’s involvement in the crime.” The Home Office said it was working with police to assess the impact of the error, which reportedly occurred by accident during a weekly “weeding” session to expunge data. The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said the PNC was a large database of information that requires maintenance, adding: “Unfortunately down to human error, some defective code was introduced as part of that routine maintenance earlier this week and that’s resulted in a deletion of some records and that’s currently under investigation. “We are now working very quickly with policing partners and within the Home Office to try and recover the data and assess the full extent of the problem.” Although officials are “not entirely sure as yet” whether the problem has had an operational impact on the police, Malthouse said, contingency plans have been put in place to ensure investigations can continue. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called on Patel to make an urgent statement: “It’s not good enough for the home secretary to hide behind her junior minister on this when there has been such a major security breach on her watch. “It’s now vital that she makes an urgent statement outlining the true scale of the issue, when ministers were informed and what the plan is to provide public reassurance. Yet again, Conservative incompetence is putting people’s safety at risk.” He added: “This is an extraordinarily serious security breach that presents huge dangers for public safety. The incompetence of this shambolic government cannot be allowed to put people at risk, let criminals go free and deny victims justice.” On Friday night Thomas-Symonds wrote to Patel, urging her to show “personal responsibility and leadership” and asking when ministers were first made aware of the breach, if local forces had been informed of potential impacts in their area, and what steps were being taken to retrieve the data. The PNC allows real-time checks on people and vehicles. Millions of records are kept on it, and they are removed automatically after certain periods depending on the nature of the offence, the suspect’s history and other factors.
The deletion also caused chaos with the visa process. Applications, which are checked against the PNC, were suspended for two days but have now resumed. A spokesperson for the NPCC said: “We are aware of an issue with the PNC and are working closely with the government to understand the potential operational impacts.”"
2021-01-15T18:16:00Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Boris Johnson says all travellers to UK must show negative coronavirus test from Monday - as it happened,"To prevent new variants arriving in the country, all travel corridors will be closed from 4am on Monday. All arrivals will need a negative Covid test and must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. The vaccine is â€˜steadily protecting those most at riskâ€™, Boris Johnson said. Almost 45% of over-80s and 45% of care home residents have been vaccinated. The spread of the virus is â€˜slowing right downâ€™ in most parts of the UK, Chris Whitty said, but warned hospitalisations and deaths would likely continue to rise into next week. There are early signs the restrictions are working, with the R number estimated to have narrowed to between 1.2 and 1.3, compared to 1 and 1.4 last week. In London, where tougher restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower, estimated - based on data up until 11 January - to be between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week. The UK government said a further 1,280 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday, bringing the official total to 87,295. The government also said that, as of 9am on Friday, there had been a further 55,761 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 3,316,019. You can view the data dashboard here. Separate figures published by the UKâ€™s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 102,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. Wales will introduce new Covid risk assessments for workplaces, shops and supermarkets amid concerns some businesses are not taking restrictions seriously enough. All retailers will be required by law to put in place measures such as limiting the number of customers, while workplaces are to be obliged to carry out Covid assessments taking into account the new more easily transmissible variant. Wales also introduced mandatory testing for international arrivals. Passengers planning to travel into Wales from abroad will have to prove they have tested negative for coronavirus before their departure from 4am on 18 January. The new Brazilian variant of concern has not yet been detected in the UK, Prof Wendy Barclay, G2P-UK lead and head of department of infectious disease and chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said. It comes as Britainâ€™s ban on the arrivals of travellers from South American countries and Portugal came into effect at 4am on Friday morning, to limit the spread of a concerning new variant. The Supreme Court â€œsubstantially allowedâ€� an appeal brought by the FCA in a landmark Â£1.2bn legal battle over businessesâ€™ ability to claim on insurance for coronavirus-related disruption. The UK economy is edging towards a double-dip recession as GDP fell 2.6%. Official figures confirmed a renewed slump in November fuelled by the second national coronavirus lockdown in England. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. You can continue to follow our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic over on the global live blog, where the news has just broken that a tragic global milestone has been reached. More than two million lives across the world have now been lost to Covid-19. My colleague Mattha Busby has this very sobering reminder: It took eight months to hit 1 million dead. It took less than four months after that to reach the next million."
2021-01-15T06:00:29Z,politics,Politics,Migrant healthcare workers on Covid frontline angry about deportation risk,"Migrant doctors and other healthcare professionals who have contracted Covid-19 while caring for NHS patients sick with the virus say they are devastated that a parliamentary bill that would have given them the right to remain in the UK has been postponed. The healthcare workers said they were holding out hope that the second reading of the private members’ bill – which had been scheduled for 15 January and is now cancelled – could give them immigration security if passed. The immigration (health and social care staff) bill 2019-21 calls for migrant healthcare workers to be granted indefinite leave to remain. It is similar to the citizenship being granted in France to frontline migrant workers. The Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, who sponsored the bill, has called on the government to consider debating bills such as this one remotely; private members’ bills were cancelled for several months due to the pandemic. “I make no bones about the fact that I would like the government to recognise the contribution made by the NHS workers – the foreign nationals – who have done so much for this country in this crisis,” she said in a blog post on Wednesday. The Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Nursing, Doctors Association UK, Independent Age and Unison are all backing the bill along with organisations supporting migrants such as the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants. MPs have received 7,400 letters in support of the bill. Dr Femi Osunlusi, a senior house officer in general surgery at Walsall Manor hospital, said migrant healthcare workers were shattered by the cancellation of a bill they had hoped would provide them with a lifeline. Osunlusi contracted Covid-19 over Christmas, as did his wife, who is a physiotherapist. Both are now back at work. “If I didn’t go back to work, there would be gaps in the rota,” he said. He added that many migrant healthcare professionals were putting their lives on the line caring for Covid patients but faced immigration insecurity, having to apply every year for five years to renew their work visas. “If my employer chooses to stop my certificate of sponsorship, I can be deported at any time, despite the contributions I have made to this country,” he added.
Another doctor, Hassan Malik, currently off sick with Covid, said: “Migrant NHS workers have made an unquantifiable contribution to the treatment of the UK population during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite risking their lives during this crisis, these NHS workers on non-permanent visas have had to work knowing they and their families could be deported if they are struck by Covid. “The uncertainty of our immigration status hangs over us like the sword of Damocles. Without the assistance of these hardworking foreign nationals, our NHS would be in dire straits. I was working on a Covid ward and managed to avoid getting [the virus then]. But the new strain is much more transmissible, and I caught it.” There are 84,316 non-EEA internationally educated nurses working in health and care across the UK. The Royal College of Physicians’ annual 2018-19 census of consultant and higher specialty trainee physicians revealed that 43% of advertised consultant posts with an advisory appointments committee went unfilled due to a lack of suitable applicants. There are about 112,000 vacancies in adult social care in England on any given day. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: “We are hugely grateful for the vital contributions all NHS staff have made during the pandemic, which is why we have introduced a range of unprecedented measures to ensure the health and care sector are supported fully. “Last year, we launched the health and care visa for eligible professionals and their families, which provides fast-track entry, reduced fees and dedicated support. This includes exempting health and care workers from payment of the immigration health surcharge, and extending the visas of more than 6,000 frontline health workers and their dependants for free.”"
2021-01-15T00:01:21Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson represents ‘boys’ club’ approach to Commons, says Rudd","Boris Johnson is emblematic of a “boys’ club” approach to the House of Commons which makes it harder for women to win promotion, his former cabinet colleague Amber Rudd has said as part of a project in which former ministers reflected on their time in power. Rudd, who was home secretary under Theresa May, and then quit as work and pensions secretary when Johnson was prime minister, said he was part of an “establishment group” whose style meant the political prospects for women were actually diminishing. “There is a kind of boys’ club-type behaviour in parliament because it is still more like a public school or a university club than anywhere else you’ll ever go,” Rudd told the Institute for Government (IFG). “I fear that it’s going backwards a bit at the moment because unless you have the leadership really making an effort to ensure that women are promoted as equals, all the time – not just because, ‘oh, let’s promote the women, we forgot about the women’ – it’s going to be a problem,” she said. “I see that in Boris Johnson, I’m afraid. Even though I don’t dislike him at all. He’s come from that establishment group. And also, he has that sort of language, which he’s – quite rightly – nervous of using in front of women.” Rudd said she had left Johnson’s cabinet amid a purge of Tory MPs over Brexit because of the way he treated people. “It was Boris Johnson’s style of government, really,” she said. “It was the way he treated other people and his determination to deliver Brexit, whatever the cost in terms of the economy and, I thought, the consequences to people’s lives.” Another former minister, Andrea Leadsom, said that when she was the Commons leader, her relations with John Bercow, the then Speaker, were so bad that eventually they could not have their scheduled weekly meetings alone. “It reached a point where I had to take someone with me, because of the level of vitriol in those meetings,” Leadsom said. “And he, likewise, said he needed to have someone there, because apparently I was extraordinarily difficult.” The two clashed repeatedly over how the Commons should operate amid a chaotic period when May was trying to get a Brexit deal through parliament. At one point Bercow was accused of calling Leadsom a “stupid woman” in parliament, which he denied. In another interview, Jeremy Wright, the former attorney general, who was a cabinet minister under both May and David Cameron, said the latter “let his irritation show more often and more visibly than Theresa ever did”. He also expressed regret at not having pushed back more against newspaper headlines condemning judges over their handling of high-profile Brexit cases. At its peak, a Daily Mail headline from November 2016 called three high court judges, who ruled that parliamentary consent was needed for the government to trigger the Brexit process, “Enemies of the People”. Wright told the IFG: “Where I think we were going wrong … was to allow the sort of abuse to play out in the newspapers, of those who were doing their job as judges and as lawyers.”"
2021-01-14T22:57:55Z,politics,Politics,Government rejects report it will lower workers' rights post-Brexit,"The government has rejected a report that following Brexit, it plans to tear up employment protections based in EU law – a strategy that Labour has called “a disgrace”. Proposals include an end to the 48-hour maximum working week, changes to rules about breaks at work, and removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements, the Financial Times said. Another proposal would be to get rid of the current requirement for businesses to log information about daily working hours, to save on administration costs. The package is being drawn up within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the newspaper said, and while it has not been put to other ministers, the department has consulted some business leaders.
Such a move would prompt fierce opposition from unions and from Labour, with Boris Johnson’s government having pledged that the ability to diverge from EU rules post-Brexit would not involve watering down employment rights. But Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary – who took the job last week after his predecessor, Alok Sharma, was given a full-time role leading preparations for the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November – rejected the claims. “We are not going to lower the standards of workers’ rights,” he tweeted. “The UK has one of the best workers’ rights records in the world – going further than the EU in many areas. We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights going forward, not row back on them.” But his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, said the FT report “exposes the truth about the government’s priorities, which are way out of step with the needs of workers and their families”. Miliband said: “In the midst of the worst economic crisis in three centuries, ministers are preparing to tear up their promises to the British people and taking a sledgehammer to workers’ rights. “These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers. They should not even be up for discussion. People are already deeply worried about their jobs and health. It’s a disgrace the government is considering forcing them to work longer hours or lose paid holidays.” Any deviation from EU standards could trigger retaliatory measures such as tariffs by Brussels, as permitted under the trade deal with the UK sealed on Christmas Eve. However, this would be gauged against the impact of any UK changes on competition. Under the European working time directive, weekly working hours should not exceed 48 hours on average, along with other stipulations such as a guaranteed rest break for work periods over six hours, and at least 11 consecutive hours of rest every 24. The UK, like some EU members, allows people to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. But the government stresses that some UK provisions go beyond the working time directive, such as a minimum full-time holiday entitlement of more than five weeks a year, against the EU’s four."
2021-01-14T19:56:26Z,politics,Politics,UK to ban travellers from South America and Portugal from Friday,"The UK government has been accused of putting lives at risk with a botched border policy after it banned arrivals from South America and Portugal several days after concerns emerged about a new Brazilian variant of Covid. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that arrivals from more than a dozen countries including Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia and Peru would be halted. He said Portugal had also been included because of its close travel links with Brazil. It is unclear as yet whether the Brazilian strain may be vaccine-resistant. UK citizens and permanent residents will be exempt from the travel ban but they and their families will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival.
The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, welcomed the measures as necessary but criticised the government’s failure to implement more systematic checks on arrivals. “This is yet another example of government incompetence, lurching from one crisis and rushed announcement to another. The failure to put in place an effective policy on testing before entry and a quarantine system that is checking only one in 100 people is putting lives at risk,” he said. The new measures came 24 hours after Boris Johnson was pressed by Labour’s Yvette Cooper about why he had not taken more urgent action in response to reports about the Brazilian strain of the virus. Cooper welcomed the travel ban on Thursday but warned: “We know from the first wave of the Covid crisis that focusing just on direct flights isn’t sufficient. We still need a proper testing and quarantine system for airports and ports as other countries have.” She called the government “irresponsible” for delaying its new testing regime for all arrivals to the UK at the last minute, pointing out that the Brazilian strain had been identified in Japan by testing of passengers in airport quarantine. The new testing system, which will require travellers to have a negative Covid test before coming to the UK, has been pushed back from Friday morning to Monday after a backlash from travel companies and tourists who complained the government had failed to provide enough guidance to operate the scheme effectively. The prime minister’s spokesperson defended the last-minute delay, calling it a “grace period”. “We always said we would introduce the regulations on Friday, and the laws still come into force on Friday, but we’ve implemented a grace period over the weekend so that passengers can have a little bit more time to get access to the tests they need that meet our requirements,” he said. The safeguarding minister, Victoria Atkins, had earlier suggested the delay had been made for business reasons. Speaking to Sky News, she said: “There’s a very delicate balancing act here between controlling the virus but also ensuring that we are not putting too much of a burden on the economy.” Travellers will need to present proof of a negative test result to their carrier upon boarding, and UK Border Force will conduct spot checks on arrivals. Arrivals who flout the rules will face a minimum £500 fine, and the operator who transported them will also be fined. Passengers will still have to quarantine for 10 days regardless of their test results. The guidance specifying the type of tests and documentation that would be required was not published on the government’s website until late on Wednesday, making it almost impossible for potential inbound travellers abroad to arrange tests in time for the original deadline. The decision on the travel ban was made at a meeting of the ministerial Covid-O committee on Thursday morning on the basis of evidence from experts on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) on new viruses. Government sources said devolved administrations supported Shapps’s decision, with Wales and Scotland poised to announce similar action. Johnson had hinted at fresh restrictions on Wednesday when he was grilled by MPs about the issue, telling Cooper: “We’re putting in extra measures to ensure that people coming from Brazil are checked: and indeed stopping people coming from Brazil.” Direct flights between Brazil and the UK were banned last month as the Brazilian government tried to prevent the highly transmissible English variant of the virus arriving on its shores. The UK government has been criticised throughout the pandemic for failing to act rapidly enough to control the borders."
2021-01-14T19:14:47Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson could face Tory challenge if lockdown lasts through spring,"Boris Johnson’s position as prime minister could be under threat if the coronavirus lockdown in England lasts into late spring, a backbench Conservative MP has warned. In a message to fellow Tories in the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), which comprises around 70 MPs who are wary of lockdown measures, Steve Baker urged colleagues to stress their concerns. He told fellow MPs it was “imperative you equip the chief whip today with your opinion that debate will become about the PM’s leadership if the government does not set out a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter.” Baker, the deputy chair of the CRG, wrote: “Certain government scientists have said that the current lockdown could last until late spring. There is no reason to think there will be any real resistance in cabinet to the argument for greater and longer and more draconian restrictions on the public. “This could be a disaster. Nothing seems more certain to break the public than giving hope before taking it away, and doing it repeatedly.” He said the government “has adopted a strategy devoid of any commitment to liberty without any clarification about when our most basic freedoms will be restored and with no guarantee that they will never be taken away again”. He added: “People are telling me they are losing faith in our Conservative party leadership because they are not standing up for our values as a party. If we continue forward with a strategy that hammers freedom, hammers the private sector, hammers small business owners and hammers the poor, inevitably the prime minister’s leadership will be on the table: we strongly do not want that after all we have been through as a country.” The CRG was formed to coalesce opinion on the Tory backbenches connected to emphasising the negative effects of lockdown, with a number of members voting against previous restrictions for England. The CRG was broadly supportive of the current lockdown, given the emergence of the new, more transmissible Covid variant and the extreme pressures on NHS hospitals. However, the issue is felt extremely keenly by some Tories, with reports last week that two MPs had submitted letters to the 1922 Committee, which represents backbench Tories, seeking Johnson’s departure. Triggering a leadership contest would require at least 15% of Tory MPs – around 55 – to send in letters. In a CRG statement following the imposition of the current lockdown, the group’s chair, the former chief whip Mark Harper, praised the Covid vaccination programme but said the government should set out how this “begins to translate into a return to normal life for us all and show a clear exit strategy – a route back to freedom”. Despite the message, Baker later tweeted his complete support for Johnson to remain as prime minister. He wrote: “What this country needs is the complete success of Boris Johnson, with his excellent EU deal, a successful vaccination programme and a #Road2Recovery back to freedom. I am clear Boris is the only person to lead us out of these difficulties and I support him in that endeavour.”"
2021-01-14T18:25:02Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard steps down,"The Scottish Labour party is to launch a fast-tracked leadership contest after Richard Leonard resigned as leader months before a Holyrood election. Leonard said he had decided over Christmas that the constant attacks on his leadership were undermining Scottish Labour’s ability to “get its message across”. Labour is trailing the Scottish National party by at least 35 points in opinion polls and is at risk of losing a dozen or more seats when Scotland goes to the polls on 6 May. The party confirmed it would launch a leadership contest immediately to guarantee Leonard’s successor is in position well before the election. Jackie Baillie, who has stepped up as interim leader, has agreed with Leonard that he can stand as a Labour candidate in May. Anas Sarwar, the centrist MSP who was recently made Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesman, and who lost to Leonard in the last leadership contest in 2017, is an early favourite for the post. Baillie urged different parts of the party to come together and said: “We face the fight of our lives in the run-up to the 2021 Scottish parliament elections.” Party sources said Leonard had had several clashes with senior colleagues and trade union leaders, and had lost the confidence of former allies on the Corbynite wing of the party who had become disillusioned at his approach. He was said to be guarded and unwilling to take advice. He narrowly survived a short-lived rebellion over his leadership by Labour MSPs in September. Tensions with Keir Starmer, the UK party leader, came to a head in late December when Leonard announced Scottish Labour would vote against the Brexit deal at Holyrood because of the economic damage he believed it would cause. That contradicted Starmer’s decision to back the UK government’s deal. Amid derision from their opponents, Leonard’s colleagues mounted a rapid damage-limitation exercise. The next day they claimed their stance was based on the UK government’s failure to include Holyrood in its Brexit planning. In a brief statement, Leonard accused the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the Covid crisis but implied he no longer believed he was the best person to take them on. “I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect,” he said. “This was not an easy decision, but after three years I feel it is the right one for me and for the party.” Starmer thanked Leonard and said he should be “very proud” of his achievements, which included campaigning for the creation of a national care service in Scotland, jobs guarantees for unemployed youth and a fair rents bill. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and first minister, tweeted: “Despite our political differences, I’ve always liked Richard Leonard. He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future.” In the 14 years since Alex Salmond and the Scottish National party claimed their first Holyrood election victory in 2007, Scottish Labour has had six leaders. Last summer Jackson Carlaw stepped down as Scottish Tory leader and was quickly replaced unopposed by Douglas Ross, a Tory MP."

Headteachers in England have been told not to provide either free school meal vouchers or food parcels for disadvantaged children over the half-term holiday next month, it has emerged. A plan to discharge Covid patients from hospitals into care homes without tests has been branded â€œmadnessâ€� by care home providers who warned the move risks a repeat of last springâ€™s crisis, which was partly fuelled by pressure to relieve the NHS. Scotlandâ€™s plan for the distribution of coronavirus vaccinations has been taken offline after the UK government raised concerns that the document included sensitive details about vaccine supply. The government has faced sustained criticism in parliament from Conservative MPs representing fishing areas, including in Scotland, over red tape and delays caused by the introduction of the post-Brexit fishing regime.

2021-01-14T17:58:03Z,politics,Politics,MPs question Tory donor tipped for CPS inspector post,"The government’s preferred candidate for independent inspector of the prosecution service is a Conservative donor who gave £10,000 to the party during the last general election campaign, it has emerged. Andrew Cayley QC defended his suitability for the role of chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which is appointed by the attorney general, Suella Braverman, after a committee of MPs quizzed him on the donation. Cayley, who was the director of service prosecutions from 2013 to 2020 and prior to that was the international co-prosecutor of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia, revealed he was a card-carrying member of the Conservative party during the pre-appointment hearing before the justice select committee. Asked about the donation by Labour MP Andrew Slaughter, Cayley said: “I have a very firm view about the democratic process. I lived in a country in south-east Asia where you wouldn’t even be interviewing me unless I was a signed up member of the ruling party, thank God we don’t live in a country like that. “I felt free to give that donation. The Conservative party is a party I support. I’m not active within the Conservative party. I am a card-carrying member of the Conservative party. “I took a number of decisions when I was working for the Service Prosecuting Authority that didn’t make the government very happy at all, in terms of the Iraq [war] cases, the investigation into members of the armed forces. “My view is I should be free to give donations to political parties I support. I certainly don’t believe it effects my independence. “If you look at the current leader of the Labour party [Keir Starmer] he went from being the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to gaining one of the safest Labour London seats in about 15 months, and I don’t think anyone questioned that. “I think as long as things are done fairly, as long as my independence is proven, which it is, I don’t think there are any issues with that at all. I certainly don’t have any intentions in this job to be politically active but after that who knows?” Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate inspects the CPS and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The inspectorate has looked at a wide range of issues ranging from disclosure issues, domestic abuse prosecutions, youth crime and handling of rape cases. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) said: “Andrew Cayley is the preferred candidate, appointed by fair and open competition which was governed by the public appointment principles. He was interviewed by panel that included independent members.”"
2021-01-14T16:35:43Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: business secretary accepted donations from fossil fuel investors,"The UK’s new business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, accepted substantial donations from fossil fuel investors and advisers as part of his 2019 general election campaign, despite the government’s commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Kwarteng was energy minister until earlier this month, when he was promoted to secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. He replaced Alok Sharma, who has now taken full-time responsibility for the UK’s hosting of this year’s UN climate talks, Cop26. In the 2019 election campaign, Kwarteng received £16,000 from companies and individuals with a direct interest in fossil fuels, and a further £4,500 from companies that advise on or facilitate trading in fossil fuels. The donations, according to the MPs’ register of interests, included £7,500 from IPGL, a holding company with a 40% stake in Cluff Energy Africa, a London-based company that prospects for oil in west Africa. IPGL is owned by the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, and donated £48,000 to Conservative MPs, of whom Kwarteng received the highest single amount.
He also received £4,000 from Majid Jafar, chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, a privately held company with oil and gas operations in the Middle East, and a board member of Dana Gas. A further £4,500 came from Helios Investment Partners, whose portfolio includes Eland Oil and Gas, Impact Oil and Gas, Vivo Energy and Africa Oil Corp. In addition to these donations, Kwarteng accepted £2,500 from Capital Generation Partners, which advises on investments including fossil fuels, and £2,000 from CQS, an asset management firm that facilitates trades in fossil fuel interests among other commodities. Labour has called on Kwarteng to give back the donations. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy and green new deal minister, said: “Ministers should not accept money from donors where there is a clear conflict of interest, and I hope he will pay it back. Our democracy should never be up for sale to Tory donors.” A spokesperson for Kwarteng said there was no conflict of interest and that all donations were in line with the ministerial code. “For the past 18 months, as energy minister, Mr Kwarteng led work to develop the energy white paper – this government’s plan to fully decarbonise our energy system, phase out fossil fuels and end the UK’s contribution to climate change. Any suggestion Mr Kwarteng is somehow not committed to the green agenda is manifestly false,” they said. A spokesperson for Helios said: “The donation was not made by Helios Investment Partners. It was made by Babatunde Soyoye, co-managing partner at Helios in his personal capacity when Kwasi Kwarteng was running for re-election at the last parliamentary elections in 2019. It was inadvertently recorded as Helios as this is also the same postal address for Mr Soyoye. We are in the process of requesting this to be corrected.” A spokesperson for Capital Generation Partners said: “Capital Generation Partners has not made a donation to him or to any other political figure. One of our partners made a personal contribution but this comprised his own funds, paid from his personal UK account and was explicitly made in his own name. The partner concerned has asked Mr Kwarteng to correct the record.” Kwarteng will bear much of the responsibility for putting the UK on track to meet the government’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Last autumn, Boris Johnson set out a 10-point plan, including massive investment in offshore wind, new nuclear power and an overhaul of infrastructure, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has set out plans for a new emissions trading scheme, of which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will take charge. The UK is not on track to meet its carbon budget targets, and experts have said much more interventionist policy from government and higher investment will be required to put the UK on a path to net zero. Kwarteng belonged to the Free Enterprise Group of Tory MPs, which takes a strongly free-market stance, calling for drastic reductions in the regulation of business. He was co-author of Britannia Unchained, a 2012 manifesto alleging that Britain, whose people were “among the worst idlers in the world”, suffered from a “bloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation” and needed a bonfire of red tape. Green campaigners also raised concerns over the business secretary’s links to fossil fuel interests. Connor Schwartz, climate lead at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s clearly a concern that the new business secretary, [in] one of the most important roles in government for responding to the climate emergency, has received money from fossil fuel interests. It’s essential ministers take bold decisions to bring down emissions and create good, green jobs across the country, but how can people be sure they will do that if they’ve been aided in getting elected by money from oil and gas?”"
2021-01-14T16:04:12Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs from fishing areas criticise government over Brexit red tape,"The government has faced sustained criticism in parliament from Conservative MPs representing fishing areas, including in Scotland, over red tape and delays caused by the introduction of the post-Brexit fishing regime. With some Scottish seafood exporters warning they face possible bankruptcy amid a suspension of road deliveries due to border delays, the environment secretary, George Eustice, conceded the sector faced “teething issues” and “some additional administration”. However, when asked several times by MPs about Boris Johnson’s promise during an appearance before the Commons liaison committee to compensate businesses affected by the new regime, Eustice ignored the questions. Instead, Eustice indicated many of the delays were due to seafood firms exporting to the EU not correctly filling in paperwork, saying this had been less of an issue for firms with experience of selling goods outside the bloc. “The key thing is to get this process working more smoothly, and that requires traders to familiarise themselves with that,” he said, adding that the paperwork had been designed by the EU and could be improved. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, later went on to argue that the fish were now happier being British. “The key is that we’ve got our fish back. They’re British fish and they’re better and happier fish for it,” he told parliament.
However, Downing Street later confirmed there would be compensation for affected businesses, and said it did not believe the companies were to blame for delays or losses. “We have said that we are looking to compensate the fishing industry given they face temporary issues, and we accept that this may have been through no fault of their own,” Johnson’s spokesman said. “That’s why the prime minister said what he said yesterday.” It is understood officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are looking at a compensation scheme whereby seafood exporters who can prove they lost business because of delays can apply for compensation. It is not expected to be an industry-wide scheme, said one source. “It’ll be a mechanism for providing support for individual firms who lost out in specific circumstances,” the source said. During an urgent question on fishing, Eustice heard sustained criticism and concern over the situation from a number of Tories, including Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Ross said he had been contacted by fishing workers in his Moray constituency and around Scotland, “raising their serious concerns and frustrations about the current situation”. More than half a dozen English Conservative MPs representing coastal areas also expressed worries, with Steve Double, the MP for St Austell and Newquay in Cornwall, saying his local fleets “benefit little from this deal”. Sheryll Murray, the South East Cornwall MP, quoted a local fishing business owner who said border red tape was “posing a real threat to his business”. The row is seen as particularly damaging for the Conservatives in Scotland, amid predictions it could erode support for the party in previously pro-Brexit fishing areas at May’s Scottish parliament election. An opinion poll by Savanta ComRes for the Scotsman on Thursday morning showed a five-point fall for the Tories since December, suggesting they could lose 14 of their 31 seats. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday, the Scotland Office minister, David Duguid, the MP for the fishing area of Banff and Buchan, said: “I do not underestimate the problems and the struggles that the industry is going through right now.” He promised urgent action. One seafood exporter, Jamie McMillan, of Loch Fyne Langoustines, speaking on the same programme, said his firm and many others were on the brink of bankruptcy because of the extra costs and delays, including inspections by vets taking up to five hours, which meant his live seafood was dying before it reached the wholesale market in Boulogne, France. On Wednesday, DFDS, which manages Scottish seafood and salmon exports by road, said it was suspending all deliveries of live seafood from small firms such as McMillan’s until Monday 18 January to see if the problems could be resolved or reduced. McMillan said his customers in Europe were switching to other suppliers in Denmark. “This is a very, very serious situation,” he said. “We’ve been screaming for the last six months that we have to get our produce to market within 12 to 24 hours. Any delays in that process, our shellfish will arrive in France dead. It is now harder to export to France than it is to the far east. That can’t be right.” The urgent question was asked by the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, who complained of fishing boats “tied up in harbour, their propellers fouled with red tape manufactured in Whitehall”. Carmichael also condemned Victoria Prentis, the fisheries minister, for seemingly saying she had not read the full post-Brexit trade deal when it was agreed on Christmas Eve as she was busy organising a nativity trail. Eustice said Prentis was only saying “that her jaw did not drop” when she read what was in the agreement, as she knew what it was going to contain. Nathalie Loiseau, France’s former Europe minister, tweeted on Thursday afternoon: “An MP who says the fish are happier because they are now British, a fisheries minister who admits she hasn’t read the agreement with the EU in her field: happily in Europe, we at least took fishermen seriously.”"
2021-01-14T14:55:23Z,politics,Politics,Plan to discharge Covid patients to care homes in England is 'madness',"A plan to discharge Covid patients from hospitals into care homes without tests has been branded “madness” by care home providers who warned the move risks a repeat of last spring’s crisis, which was partly fuelled by pressure to relieve the NHS. The Department of Health and Social Care issued guidance that Covid positive patients in England who have been in isolation in hospital for 14 days “are not considered to pose an infection risk” and do not have to be retested. If they are not showing new symptoms or have had fresh exposure to the virus they can be moved directly to care homes from hospital. News of the strategy was first reported in the Guardian on Wednesday when NHS commissioners told care operators in Yorkshire that discharges could start happening directly in some cases “because we now know they do not pose an infection risk to other residents in a care home”. Care homes are demanding to see evidence to support that assessment in the light of rising cases of the new more transmissible strain of the virus. About 1,200 care home residents died from Covid in England in the first week of January and on Wednesday the NHS ordered GPs to rapidly accelerate vaccination of England’s approximately 400,000 care home residents to deliver all first doses by the end of next week. The latest discharge guidance comes amid an urgent need to free up space in the NHS, and the DHSC said it was clarifying an approach that had already been approved by its deputy chief medical officers and Public Health England.
“Our priority is to ensure everyone receives the right care, in the right place at the right time,” a spokesperson said. “We have been doing everything we can to protect care homes since the start of the pandemic, providing billions of pounds of additional funding, free PPE, infection control guidance, increasing staff testing and providing priority vaccines.” But Mike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in North Yorkshire, said: “I can’t quite believe the government is thinking of doing this. How do we know [people being discharged] haven’t been exposed especially with this new virulent strain? It seems we haven’t learned from the first wave. We want to help the health service but people will be reluctant to accept discharges without the comfort of a test … It seems madness.” Rights for Residents, which represents families who use care homes, said its members were “terrified” by the prospect of hospital patients who have had Covid being discharged into care homes without a recent test. “My anger and frustration is that the government has had 10 months to plan for this,” said Diane Mayhew, co-founder of the group. “Care homes have closed and many are standing empty and would have the perfect infrastructure for discharge.” In mid-December, DHSC policy on discharges said everyone with a positive test result being sent from a hospital into a care home should first be sent to a designated facility set up specially to handle potentially infectious patients. This was described as an “important precaution to protect care home residents and minimise, where possible, the risk of infection”. However, only 136 of the so-called “hot homes” have been established after the government set a goal of at least 500 in October. The December policy also said infected patients who had been isolated for at least 14 days and were not showing new symptoms need not be tested but that “a clinical assessment should be made to determine subsequent onward movement”.
The new guidance says: “If these individuals have already completed their 14-day isolation period from onset of symptoms or positive test result and have no new Covid-19 symptoms or exposure, they are not considered to pose an infection risk. They therefore do not have to be retested and can move directly to a care home from hospital.”"
2021-01-14T10:26:11Z,politics,Politics,Brexit problems halt some Scottish seafood exports to EU,"Deliveries of Scottish seafood to the EU from smaller companies have been halted until Monday, 18 January, after post-Brexit problems with health checks, IT systems and customs documents caused a huge backlog. Scottish fishing has been plunged into crisis, as lorry-loads of live seafood and some fish destined for shops and restaurants in France, Spain and other countries have been rejected because they are taking too long to arrive. The industry’s biggest logistics provider, DFDS, a Danish company, pointed to delays regarding health certificates, issues with the IT system interface between the group and local authorities, and incorrect or missing customs documentation from customers.
New Brexit rules require every box of seafood and fish to be offloaded from lorries and inspected by vets before it leaves Scotland. It has taken business owners five hours per lorry to obtain a health certificate, which is required to apply for other customs paperwork. If the issues are not resolved soon, some fear the trade, worth more than £1bn annually to Scottish businesses, could collapse. Faced with the backlog, DFDS suspended its “groupage export service” – which allows several exporters to group products together in a single consignment – last Friday, a week after the UK’s departure from the EU. It said it wanted to fix IT issues and train more staff to help its customers to get the customs documentation right. It is understood that single-load, single-commodity consignments are still being delivered. DFDS said it expected to resume deliveries next Monday, but the service would take considerably longer than before Brexit, and it highlighted the importance of 100% correct paperwork. Goods sent off on day 1, for example from Larkhall near Glasgow, are now being scheduled to arrive in Boulogne on day 3 – one to two days longer than it took to send goods to France before Brexit. Customers have been told to wait before sending orders, until they have received written clearance and completed a “summary control document” for each export dispatch. DFDS said: “By working together, we aim to have a robust service running very soon again.” Jimmy Buchan, chief executive of the Scottish Seafood Association, told the Guardian the problems were partly caused by the “untried and untested” new IT system, which went live on 28 December when the industry was on holiday. “We were thrown in at the deep end. We’ve had two years to prepare for this and government are standing back and saying: ‘This is what you wished for.’” He suggested setting up an independent clearing house for Europe in Scotland, which “clears seafood on Scotland’s soil, and it doesn’t have to stop again until it arrives in France”. He said this would save valuable time and could enable the industry to make overnight deliveries again.
The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, told MPs that Britain needed to secure easy access to Europe for the Scottish seafood industry. “[Regarding] the specific issue of seafood supplies, because of their perishable nature it’s absolutely vital that we ensure the smoothest possible access to European and other markets,” he said in parliament. At the same time, the UK government proposed to fast-track empty supermarket food lorries returning to Europe to reload, amid concerns that disruption at ports could lead to food supply shortages, the Financial Times reported (paywall). A consultation document sent to the industry by the agriculture ministry on Tuesday said “the potential for further disruption remains high”. It said: “Given the potential for border delays to impact supply chains over the next few weeks, we are proposing an emergency contingency measure  …  to expedite the return of empty food lorries from the UK to the EU where they can be restocked with supplies.” • The headline on this article was amended on 14 January 2021. The EU is not responsible for halting the exports as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-13T21:59:05Z,politics,Politics,Lords inflict two defeats on government over 'spy cops' bill,"Peers inflicted two significant defeats on the government on Wednesday evening over a bill to regulate the use of undercover informants, passing amendments to stop them participating in murder and rape, and to curtail the use of children as informants. The lords voted by 339 to 235 to ban the use of under-18s as police or MI5 informants except in exceptional circumstances, in an amendment put forward by the children’s rights campaigner and peer Beeban Kidron. Children are frequently recruited by police seeking to prosecute “county lines” gangs who coerce youngsters and other vulnerable adults into transporting illegal drugs around the UK. “In every other interaction with the criminal justice system we try to remove children from criminal activity, to take them away from harm and towards safety,” Lady Kidron told fellow peers. “But before us is legislation which formalises our ability to do the opposite.” Thirteen Conservatives also rebelled against the government, led by the former transport secretary Lord Young. He warned that if an underage informant were to be discovered and killed “the policy would be reversed the next day after a public outcry and incredulity that this was permissible”. Peers were voting on the final set of amendments to the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill, legislation put forward to codify existing guidance covering the handling of informants and undercover operatives used principally by the police and MI5. The government was also defeated by 299 to 284 on an amendment from the peer Doreen Massey, which proposed explicitly banning those acting undercover from being allowed to participate in a list of serious crimes, including murder, torture, rape or other sexual offences as they gained information. Ministers had ruled out introducing such a list previously, arguing that creating a list of forbidden offences could give terrorists and serious criminals ways to unmask infiltrators by asking them to engage in such banned activities. “If we create a checklist on the face of the bill we make it very easy for criminal gangs to write themselves a list of offences which amount to initiation tests,” said Lady Williams, a Home Office minister. The government also argued that because the bill would be compliant with the Human Rights Act some offences were effectively banned, meaning that it did not amount to a “licence to kill”. Campaign groups welcomed the result, arguing that it would put the UK on a par with similar western countries in setting clear limits. Dan Dolan, deputy director of Reprieve, said: “The US, Australia and Canada all recognise the need for common sense limits to prevent undercover agents being authorised to commit murder, torture or rape, and now the House of Lords has too.” The defeats by the lords mean that the amendments will return in due course to the Commons. An acceptance of the amendment calling for an explicit ban on murder and other serious crime is not thought likely, but Labour sources said that Williams had indicated that the government would look again at the question of child informants. Peers were debating the bill at the second day of its report stage. On Monday, an amendment from Shami Chakrabarti seeking to strike out immunity for undercover agents acting within authorised guidelines was defeated by 309 to 153, after the Labour leadership chose to abstain."
2021-01-13T19:19:36Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: a defensive man with much to be defensive about | John Crace,"For the last few days, the Commons has been unusually tranquil, with ministers and MPs going out of their way to be polite and cooperate with one another. Partly because there have been so few people in the chamber that the theatrics lose their edge, but mainly because MPs of all parties are genuinely terrified by the scale of the coronavirus pandemic. Cheap point-scoring feels like a waste of time when people are dying by the thousands every day. Needless to say, though, that all changed with Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions. It’s not just the defensive, combative tone with which Johnson treats the session: that is perhaps understandable given that he has a lot to be defensive about and Boris’s first instinct when under pressure has always been to lash out and blame others. What really sticks in the throat is the lack of regret and remorse in his voice. His inability to accept any blame for his government’s response to the Covid crisis is borderline sociopathic. Johnson began with a quick U-turn. On Monday he had said there was no “clamour” for 24/7 vaccinations. Now he was telling us they would soon be piloted. But it was when Keir Starmer ran through the recent government timeline that Boris resorted to bluster and outright lies. He appeared to have forgotten that Matt Hancock had told the Commons about the new variant two days before Boris had announced there would be no lockdown and Christmas would be going ahead as usual at PMQs. Since then the government had consistently done too little too late, and Johnson was unable to explain why this third lockdown was less severe than the first one when the pandemic was now even worse. Perhaps the weirdest exchange took place when the Labour leader moved on to free school meals and Johnson merely accused Starmer of being worse at pointing out how crap the government had been than Marcus Rashford. Not the greatest defence of government policy. Keir had done his homework, though, and pointed out that the £30 free school meals worth about a fiver were more or less in line with the Department of Education’s own guidelines. Give or take a tin of sweetcorn. At which point Boris gave up on not answering questions and went into a long rant about Labour’s failings that the Speaker had to interrupt and call to a halt. This hadn’t been a vintage Starmer performance – he still struggles rather when Johnson basically ignores him – but it had been enough to expose most of the prime minister’s more disturbing pathologies. There were fewer hiding places on offer for Johnson during his two-hour appearance before the liaison committee – the supergroup of select committee chairs – as he faced more detailed questions on his handling of the pandemic and the UK’s exit from the EU. Though obviously that did not stop Boris from engaging in his favourite pastime of endless pointless digressions designed to disguise his lack of straight answers. Not that Johnson didn’t appear to have made more effort to come prepared to this meeting of the committee. Now that Dominic Cummings is off the scene, it feels as if his new team of advisers in No 10 have been telling him he needs to do more preparation for these events. Mostly in just being more polite and trying to appear interested in what he is being asked. His standard response to most questions about coronavirus was that the vaccine will sort things out eventually. He had less to say on his government’s track record over the past 10 months, as he has invariably done too little, too late. His desperate need to be loved by not imposing restrictions may well have accounted for thousands of unnecessary deaths. When push came to shove, Johnson again disowned his government’s own guidance on free school meals and agreed with both Robert Halfon and Catherine McKinnell that what had been provided by some contractors had been pitiful. He also appeared not to hear McKinnell enquire if he regretted having once said that Donald Trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize. Perhaps even Boris struggles to believe he could ever have said anything so absurd. Labour’s Stephen Timms managed to extract an inference that the £20 uplift in universal credit would not be extended beyond April, but as so often it was Yvette Cooper who really managed to get under his skin. There is no love lost between the two and Johnson is self-aware enough to realise that in a straight fight he will always come off worse. So he opted for damage limitation as Cooper challenged him on his lack of action on both the South African and Brazilian variants. Right now, Cooper observed, it was possible for anyone to fly into the UK from both these destinations and travel onwards by public transport without a negative coronavirus test. Or indeed with little chance of anyone checking whether you self-isolated once home. Boris merely muttered “we’re taking steps” over and over again before mentioning the vaccine yet again. After which the fait accompli of Britain’s exit from the EU felt more like an afterthought. Hilary Benn pointed out that many supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland were empty due to the increased bureaucracy. Boris somehow managed to contradict himself by saying the flow of goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland had never been so smooth, which was why goods were flying off the supermarket shelves, but that any ongoing problems would soon be sorted out. Let the good times roll. Thereafter the session rather petered out. Not least because Bill Cash was so full of praise for the man who had rescued the country from the evil empire of the EU that the only question he could muster was: “Please tell us why you are so wonderful.” Something Johnson was happy to do at length. After all, that is his favourite subject."
2021-01-13T18:36:17Z,politics,Politics,"UK Covid: record 1,564 deaths reported to take toll past 100,000; PM 'concerned' about Brazilian variant – as it happened","More than 100,000 people have died from coronavirus in the UK since the disease first appeared in the country almost a year ago, in what public health experts have said is a sign of â€œphenomenal failure of policy and practiceâ€�. Boris Johnson has told MPs that he is â€œconcernedâ€� about the new variant of coronavirus circulating in Brazil. (See 3.36pm.) But, in evidence to the Commons liaison committee, he refused to make it clear whether or not he was going to impose a ban on arrivals from Brazil. He told Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, that the government was â€œtaking steps to stop the Brazil variant being imported into this country, as weâ€™ve taken steps to stop the South African variant being imported into this countryâ€�. But, when challenged, he was evasive as to whether he meant Brazil would be covered by the rule coming into force on Friday saying all international arrivals into England will have to have had a negative test, or whether the government is planning a Brazil-specific ban. Johnson also told MPs the risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed was â€œvery substantialâ€�. He said: If you ask me when do we think that the ICU capacity is likely to be overtopped, I canâ€™t give you a prediction for that. But all I can say is that the risk is very substantial and we have to keep the pressure off the NHS and the only way to do that is to follow the current lockdown. The government is to roll out 24/7 vaccinations centres, Boris Johnson has confirmed, after days of pressure on ministers to step up the programme further. Shops in Scotland have been ordered to stop non-essential click-and-collect services and alcohol consumption is to be banned outdoors, in a further tightening of lockdown measures. The government has been forced into a U-turn over free school meal provision during lockdown, and it has emerged that its guidance on what should be in food parcels is strikingly similar to images circulating on social media that the prime minister described as â€œunacceptableâ€�. NHS England has ordered a rapid acceleration of care home vaccinations in response to rising Covid outbreaks in which deaths of residents have risen to levels not seen since May. Second shots of coronavirus vaccine could be delayed even further amid growing evidence that spacing out the doses improves their effectiveness. Hospital admissions in London and south-east England have fallen for the first time after rising steadily throughout December, figures show. The UK coronavirus vaccine rollout is constrained by limited supply of the vaccines, but the government is on track to vaccinate the top four priority groups by 15 February, Matt Hancock has said. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog."
2021-01-12T20:38:49Z,politics,Politics,"Since we've had the carrot, it's time for Patel to bring the stick","First the carrot, then the stick. At Monday’s Downing Street press conference, we had Matt Hancock being “Mr Nice Guy” as he begged everyone to stick to the guidelines as the vaccination programme was rolled out. For Tuesday’s we got Priti Patel – the iron fist in a tungsten glove – and Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, to spell out what was in store for those people who insisted on breaking the rules. Or for some people at any rate. Patel has form for giving a free pass to her mates, as she could never bring herself to criticise Dominic Cummings’s Durham safari back in the spring. This was the first time the home secretary had been let loose at a No 10 briefing since May last year and it soon became clear why. Because Patel is almost pathologically unable to utter a coherent sentence. Whenever she prefaces a statement with, ‘Let me be clear’ – which she does with monotonous regularity – you can be certain she’s going to be anything but.
Still, she did get through her opening scripted remarks almost unscathed – if through gritted teeth – as she was forced to admit that most people were observing the rules properly. This was clearly a disappointment. In Priti world, everyone – especially immigrants – is a potential law breaker and people should be issued with fixed penalty notices just for thinking of breaking the rules. The trouble started with the first question from Ian, a member of the public, who wanted to know why the rules for the third lockdown were less onerous than they had been for the first, when the government’s own scientists had identified that the new coronavirus variant was far more infectious. “Let me be clear,” she said. This was not about the rules now being more relaxed. Even though that was precisely what it was about, as the rules are demonstrably less draconian this time round. Priti umm-ed and ahh-ed, talked nonsense for a bit and left everyone even more confused. The rules were extremely clear. Everyone was to stay at home and act as if they had the coronavirus apart from the occasions on which they would be allowed out. And when they did go out, they should either stay close to their front door or remain local. Whichever was nearer to the front door or more local. It depended on the circumstances and whether it was “outdoor recreation”. Not surprisingly, this mess of an answer was followed up by the same question from a journalist working for ITV and was responded to with a similar word salad. With Patel, the words on their own can occasionally make sense: the trouble starts when she tries to put them in any kind of order. Hewitt tried to come to her rescue, suggesting: “People should ask themselves, ‘Is going out to do this essential?’ and ‘Am I doing it in the safest way?’” Which didn’t exactly help matters, as Patel’s prime mission was to avoid dobbing in the prime minister for his weekend bike ride at the Olympic Park. Even two days later, no one at No 10 seems any clearer if Boris headed out on his own from Westminster or went by car to Stratford with a police escort and only started cycling once he was there. Nor are we any the wiser why he chose the Olympic Park as his bike ride of choice, given that he reportedly noted after getting there how busy it was. At this point, even the not very sharp Patel could tell that the key message she had been sent out to communicate – that the rules were clear and people should use their common sense to work within them – was beginning to fall apart. Especially when the Guardian’s Rajeev Syal posed the question that many people had been asking themselves all day. How come two women in Derbyshire had been fined for driving five miles to walk around a reservoir, when Johnson had been aided and abetted to travel seven miles for his bike ride? “The police have been brilliant,” Patel said, before contradicting herself and admitting they had made a mistake with the two Derbyshire women, who had their fines rescinded when the police realised any journey within seven miles was more or less permissible. Exercise was vital to people’s health and wellbeing, she continued. And that also applied to exercise. Or something like that. By now the only thing that was clear was that Patel had been the wrong person to send out to promote a strong law-and-order message two days after the PM had done his best to muddy the waters about what the rules actually were. Predictably with Priti Vacant, the entire press conference ended in confusion when she once again repeated that the rules were tough enough and clear to everyone but that the government was actively looking at making them even tougher and more clear. For the punters, if not for the prime minister. Hewitt again did his best to save the day by saying that the police would continue to enforce the rules properly, but ideally people would save themselves and his coppers a world of pain by following not just the letter but the spirit of the rules. After all, his men and women had other crimes they would rather be investigating. Such as how a government department could dole out free school meal contracts at £30 a pop to a company that was only sending out meals that appeared to be worth about a fiver."
2021-01-12T19:27:01Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs say Johnson’s future rests on a successful vaccine programme,"There is a popular meme among leftwing Starmer-sceptics in the Labour party, one that was often used against the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: “Any other leader would be 20 points ahead.” While Keir Starmer has steadily eaten into the Conservatives’ poll lead, there is a frustration among some Labour MPs and the wider opposition to Boris Johnson that the prime minister does not appear to be absorbing more of the personal responsibility for the worst crisis since the second world war, a crisis that government delay, cronyism and ideology have all played a part in exacerbating. There are reasons why Johnson’s supporters believe he can continue to deflect some of the more personal criticism – although closer inspection of polling numbers and the disquiet on the Tory backbenches does indicate Johnson has damaged and squandered goodwill in ways that will be difficult to mend. One former Tory adviser said they had watched gobsmacked as a prime minister who had won his party a handsome majority now had those same backbenchers in open revolt. Even some of the most ardent opponents of Johnson on the Tory benches firmly believe their voters will give the party the benefit of the doubt in the handling of an unprecedented pandemic. But a successful vaccine programme is key to this. “Most hospitals have not actually yet been overwhelmed, most people have had their livelihoods protected by furlough, those have been the key measures so far and as long as the government passes its third test – which is to get everyone a vaccine before the summer is out – I think he will be able to ride this out,” one Tory MP said. Another shire Tory, a supporter of Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign, observed that as long as the prime minister could claim the success of the vaccination programme for himself, voters may forgive “his dithering, his lack of attention to detail and his pathological obsession with being liked, which is always the reason he is reluctant to make hard choices until they become inevitable and more painful”. His fiercest opponents within his own party had been lockdown sceptics, members of the newly formed Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs who have been willing to vote against coronavirus restrictions in numbers large enough to defeat the government – had Labour not supported them. But the influence of the group has waned as quickly as it waxed, now the vaccination programme has commenced, with the vast majority of the group backing the latest lockdown measures. The group is also out of step with the general public, with polling showing most of the country favouring more stringent restrictions and longer lockdowns as a way of protecting loved ones. In the latest Opinium poll, 64% said they would prefer “a government who quickly puts lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes measures are put in place that didn’t need to be”. One tactic that enrages Johnson’s opponents is the subtle shifting of blame on to the public’s compliance with rules as the reason for a rise in infections. Many were alarmed by a recent poll by YouGov, which found that 58% of Britons held the public most responsible for the rise in coronavirus cases over the last month, rather than the government, who were blamed by 28%. This came despite the insistence of Johnson that lockdown rules would lift on 2 December, that Christmas mixing would continue as planned and that schools would return as normal – followed by a last-minute scramble to change the rules after infections soared. However, a closer look at the polls suggests Johnson has not escaped blame. In the 12 months since the 2019 general election, Johnson’s lead dropped from double-digits to level-pegging, the steepest decline in modern history. According to the Focaldata survey of more than 22,000 people from early January, the public are deeply unhappy with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the government would lose its majority at an election held at the present time. More people think Johnson should resign as prime minister than think he should continue in office, according to the latest Opinium poll. Many Tories privately fear there are voters the government will never win back, especially parents of teenage children whose education has been so disrupted by missteps, as well as teachers themselves. “It’s appalling what has gone on; the pressure on teachers has been unbelievable,” one senior Tory MP said. “What teacher would vote Conservative again? Not in a million years.” Ultimately, the judgment on Johnson at the next election will be on the success of the country’s recovery from the pandemic – with many more tough choices to come that the “sunlit uplands” prime minister cannot duck."
2021-01-12T18:51:44Z,politics,Politics,"Priti Patel insists 'rules are clear'; 1,243 more deaths recorded, second highest daily toll – as it happened","The UK has recorded 1,243 more Covid deaths - the second highest daily total on this measure. (See 5.12pm.) Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced the figure at a press conference where she twice dodged questions about why the current lockdown is less strict than last springâ€™s, even though the new variant of coronavirus poses a much greater risk because it is much more transmissible. Patel claimed the current rules were â€œtough enoughâ€�. But she also said that they were being kept under â€œconstant reviewâ€� and that conversations were going on within government about whether they might need to be tightened. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, told the press conference that officers will not â€œlingerâ€� trying to encourage the public to obey lockdown rules. He also gave examples of recent breaches including a boat party in Hertfordshire with more than 40 people who had each paid Â£30 each for a ticket, and a minibus full of people from different households travelling from Cheltenham into Wales for a walk. In an article this morning Dame Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner, said that people who break lockdown rules were now â€œincreasingly likely to face finesâ€�. (See 9.05am.) Hewitt has admitted that Derbyshire police officers made a mistake when they fined two women for going for a walk five miles from home. Asked about the case, he said the police were having to deal with â€œhighly unusualâ€� health regulations and that they were dealing with the public on â€œhundreds of thousandsâ€� of occasions. He went on: Sometimes mistakes will be made, but we always have looked at those, we have looked at them quickly, we have dealt with the members of the public concerned and we have said when we have got something wrong. The fines have now been rescinded. Asked about the same case, Patel said the police were â€œoutstandingâ€�, but she also pointed out that those fines have been withdrawn. Hewitt has indicated that he is not in favour of setting an exact distance people are allowed to travel when exercising away from home under the Covid regulations. Earlier the Met commissioner suggested the exercise guidance should be clarified. (See 10.04am.) But at the press conference Hewitt said: If you tried to make a definition for every possible circumstance that would be really challenging. I donâ€™t think we are in a position where we want to set a particular distance because how would - if a police officer stopped somebody - [they] prove that a person is within or outside that distance. At the press conference Patel defended Boris Johnsonâ€™s decision to go on a bike ride seven miles from his No 10 home on Sunday, but she also stressed the importance of people staying local. MPs have been told that hospitals might not the Covid pressure on hospitals in England may not reach its peak until February. (See 3.37pm.) Marcus Rashford has warned that â€œsomething is going wrongâ€� with free school meal delivery during lockdown, after he held talks with the school catering company at the centre of a row over inadequate free school meal (FSM) parcels. Experts are calling on the UK government to halt or pause its mass testing programme for people without symptoms in care homes, schools, communities and potentially at home, warning that the lateral flow devices it has bought are inaccurate and can do more harm than good. Military helicopters could be used within days to airlift coronavirus patients from the Isle of Wight, the islandâ€™s medical director has said, after an â€œastronomicalâ€� rise in infections fuelled by mixing and visitors over Christmas. The number of prisoners in England and Wales who have tested positive for coronavirus and died has risen by 50% in a month as cases behind bars surge. Public Health England is to step up its surveillance of a highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that arrived in the UK after fuelling a surge in the number of cases in South Africa. International travellers will need to present a negative Covid-19 test to enter England from 4am on Friday. The number of students in state schools in England plummeted in the week before Christmas, government data shows. The Chinese government has accused Boris Johnson of â€œgroundless conjectureâ€� after the prime minister suggested coronavirus could have spread from people grinding up the scales of pangolins. (See 4.50pm.) Chinaâ€™s treatment of the Uighur people amounts to torture, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said as he set out measures designed to ensure no companies allow the use of forced labour from Xinjiang province in their supply chain. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-12T18:48:29Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's bike ride: a 'storm in a teacup' or 'eroding public confidence'?,"Boris Johnson’s cycle ride to the Olympic Park on Sunday has provoked the full gamut of responses, from those praising his desire to keep fit on two wheels, to others simply wondering how he found the time when they haven’t washed their hair since schools closed. The incident also resulted in some interesting thought experiments, as politicians, senior police officers – and everyone else – struggled to answer two key questions: is seven miles actually seven miles? And how on earth do you define “local”? Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, wanted to clear things up. He said people must not “stretch the rules”. But then went on to say that whether seven miles was to be considered local or not “depends on where you are”. “Seven miles will be local in different areas,” he added. The rules, said the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, were not clear to the public, and even to some of her officers. No wonder, perhaps, that most readers who spoke to the Guardian about the episode responded with little more than a faintly irritated shrug. For Paul, a charity worker, it was a “non story”, for engineer James, “a storm in a teacup”, while Paul, a designer, worried it might put further restrictions on outdoor exercise. “Riding a bike is one of the few carefree, guilt-free, socially responsible things you can do in this shit-show of a time,” he said. “And now I feel like I need to be on a metaphorical elastic band attached to my flat.” But some were perplexed by the fact that Johnson had very local access to Hyde Park and St James’s Park – but chose to go much further afield. Christine, a teacher, asked if Johnson could not have cycled in the 17-hectare (42-acre) private gardens of Buckingham Palace – with its tennis court, lake and two and a half miles of gravel paths – where the prime minister has jogged and walked his dog since being given permission by the Queen during the first lockdown. “He just felt like going somewhere else,” she said. And which parent contemplating their 534th walk past the hairdressers, betting shop and cordoned off bandstand, recalcitrant children in tow, could not sympathise with that? Christine added: “Local for him is Green Park or St James’s Park. I wish people would stop cutting him so much slack – he has eroded public confidence.” Others felt the trip was yet another example of those in authority stretching the rules made for others to follow. “Personal responsibility only applies to the public when they are being blamed by the government but never applies to Conservatives or the prime minister,” said Paramdeep, 27. “Johnson certainly should be on his bike, out of No 10 – this country deserves so much better.” Eric in rural Oxfordshire, wondered if the controversy merely compounded the damage done during the first lockdown, when Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, bent lockdown rules to drive 264 miles from his London home to Durham, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus, before going on a family trip to Barnard Castle, ostensibly to test his eyesight. “It is well understood and accepted now that the Dominic Cummings scandal changed the calculus in everyone’s mind from how do I defeat the virus, to can I find a loophole in the lockdown rules,” he said. Yet there were significant numbers of commentators who suggested an enthusiastic cyclist prime minister trying to lose weight was exactly the role model the times required. “It’s good to hear prime minister @BorisJohnson has been cycling in London. @PHE_uk encourage cycling as a way to protect your physical and mental health,” tweeted the London Cycling Campaign. Linking to a story about the incident from the Guardian, the former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable called the report “unbelievably petty” and went as far as to ask what the publication “had against cycling” – the question of a man who has clearly not seen the amount of Lycra on display in the Guardian’s London office on any pre-pandemic morning. There could have been another decent reason other than exercise that the prime minister took the cycle ride, suggested a Johnson parody Twitter account, which tweeted: “Well, that was useful. I now know I don’t need to wear glasses after all.”"
2021-01-12T08:13:22Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson under pressure over bike ride seven miles from No 10,"Boris Johnson is under pressure to clarify details of a Sunday bike ride seven miles from his Downing Street residence after No 10 refused to say whether he was driven there. Parkgoers spotted Johnson cycling in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park in Stratford, east London, along with his security detail, at about 2pm on Sunday. A Downing Street source said the prime minister was exercising within the rules but would not give further details as to whether Johnson cycled from his Westminster residence or was transported there by car. “The PM follows Covid-secure guidelines. It does not say in the regulations that driving somewhere to take exercise is a breach of the rules. That is not a comment on the PM’s case but the rules only say remain local,” the source said. Official government guidance to reduce the spread of coronavirus says “you should not travel outside your local area” while exercising. Johnson’s spokesperson was unable to provide any information on the record but a No 10 source said there was no suggestion his travel had broken any rules, without giving details. Johnson has been a keen cyclist for years and goes jogging regularly near his home in Westminster. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith in London, said: “Once again it is do as I say not as I do from the prime minister. London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example.” Asked at Monday’s Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “It is OK to go if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise but stay local.”
News of Johnson’s Sunday excursion emerged in the Evening Standard days after two women were fined £200 by police for driving five miles from their home to meet for a walk at a reservoir, although the fines were rescinded on Monday following criticism. Derbyshire police said it had issued fixed penalty notices to Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore because driving to a location to exercise “is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths”. On Monday, the force’s chief constable, Rachel Swann, said: “Two fixed penalty notices that were handed to two women … have been withdrawn and we have notified the women directly, apologising for any concern caused. “I support the fact that the officers were trying to encourage people to stay local to prevent the spread of the virus. This is a responsibility for all of us.”
She added: “We have been working hard to understand the ever-changing guidance and legislation and to communicate this to our officers in a way that makes it clear what is the right course of action to take.” The government is understood to be reviewing guidelines on exercise, which could include limits on the distances people are allowed to travel as well as whether to restrict exercise within households when current rules allow exercise with one other person outdoors. Speaking on Monday, Johnson urged the public to respect coronavirus regulations when out grocery shopping and buying takeaway coffee, saying people needed to “do the right thing” and adhere to social distancing. “We need to enforce the rules in supermarkets. When people are getting takeaway drinks, in cafes, then they need to avoid spreading the disease there, avoid mingling too much,” he said. Johnson said Britain was in “a race against time” to distribute vaccines as he urged against any complacency. “We can all see the threat that our NHS faces, the pressure it’s under, the demand in intensive care units, the pressure on ventilated beds, even the shortage of oxygen in some places,” he said on a visit to a vaccination centre in Bristol, in southwest England.
“This is a very perilous moment. The worst thing now for us is to allow success in rolling out a vaccine programme to breed any kind of complacency about the state of the pandemic.”"
2021-01-11T22:50:51Z,politics,Politics,Did Boris Johnson’s bike ride bend the lockdown exercise rules?,"Boris Johnson has come under fire after he was spotted cycling in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park in east London on Sunday, seven miles away from his Downing Street residence. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith in London, accused the prime minister of failing to lead by example by exercising so far from home, but sources at No 10 insisted no rules had been broken. What exactly are the rules for outdoor exercise? The rules announced on 4 January for the third national lockdown in England state you are allowed to leave your home to exercise, but this should be limited to once a day and you should not travel outside your local area to do it. When exercising outside you can do so alone, with the people you live with, with your support bubble or with one person from another household. However, you must stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household or support bubble (or, if not possible, a metre apart with extra precautions like face coverings). Exercise includes, but is not limited to, running, cycling, walking, and swimming. Personal training can continue one-on-one, unless everyone is within the same household or support bubble. Where are you allowed to exercise? The rules state you are allowed to exercise in public outdoor places such as parks, beaches, countryside, public gardens, the grounds of a heritage site and playgrounds. Outdoor sports venues such as tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools, however, must close. But as Matt Hancock emphasised during a Downing Street press conference on Monday evening, wherever you go to exercise, it must be local. What classes as “local”? This is the crucial bit of information missing from the government rules and which has caused quite a bit of confusion over the past few days. Last week two women were fined by Derbyshire police for travelling to a reservoir around five miles away from where they lived, with officers at the time saying they could have stayed closer to home. The force has since apologised and rescinded the fines, following further guidance from the National Police Chiefs’ Council. During Monday’s press conference, Hancock – in what seemed to be a deliberate reference to the prime minister’s bike ride – said: “If you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles away from home, that is OK. “But, you should stay local, you should not go from one side of a country to another, potentially taking the virus with you.” What about driving to get to where you exercise? While most people might think needing to take a car to get to an activity would suggest you were travelling too far, a Downing Street source stressed this was within the rules. When asked about whether Johnson had gone by car to the Olympic park, the source told the Guardian: “It does not say in the regulations that driving somewhere to take exercise is a breach of the rules. That is not a comment on the PM’s case but the rules only say remain local.”"
2021-01-11T18:18:19Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock rules out removing support bubbles if England restrictions tightened – as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has categorically ruled out any changes to the support or childcare bubble system. He was speaking at a No 10 press conference only hours after Boris Johnson said he was not ruling out toughening the lockdown rules. (See 2.33pm.) Asked if a further clampdown could involve support bubbles being removed, Hancock said: I can rule out removing the bubbles that we have in place - the childcare bubbles [and] the support bubbles are very important and weâ€™re going to keep them. I know how important they are to people and they are an important part of the system that we have got to support people whilst also having these tough measures that are necessary. Hancock has said meeting a friend outside could be banned if people donâ€™t follow current rules. (See 5.38pm.) He has defended Boris Johnsonâ€™s right to go for a cycle ride seven miles from No 10. (See 1.48pm and 5.38pm.) Hancock has praised the supermarket firm Morrisons for saying it will refuse to serve people who do not wear face masks. He said: It isnâ€™t just about the government and the rules we set, or the police and the work that they do - itâ€™s about how everybody behaves. I applaud the action Morrisons has taken today, the supermarket, they have said that they will not let people in without a mask unless they clearly have a medical reason. Thatâ€™s the right approach and I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this. Hancock has said he is â€œconfidentâ€� that the government can meet its target of offering the vaccine to around 14 million people who are in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. Hancock has revealed that the seven-day rolling average for UK Covid deaths reported daily has reached 926. (See 5.09pm.) But the latest figure shows the rolling average for the number of new cases starting to fall. (See 5.09pm.) The full dashboard data has just been published and is available here. Hospitals are reporting shortages of oxygen because of the huge pressure of treating the rising number of people left seriously ill with Covid, Boris Johnson has acknowledged. There are no plans for 24-hour provision of coronavirus vaccinations because there is â€œnot a clamourâ€� from the public for appointments beyond 8pm, Downing Street has said. The government must look at new coronavirus restrictions within the next 24 hours, Keir Starmer has said, naming estate agents and nurseries as those that could face further curbs to halt the spread of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, Englandâ€™s chief medical officer, has said the next few weeks will be the worst of the pandemic as he urged everyone to minimise meeting people. Emergency plans have been triggered to keep bodies in temporary mortuaries in Kent and Surrey and a new temporary morgue is being built in London as a rising death toll from Covid begins to overwhelm storage facilities. More than a third of the UKâ€™s poorest families have seen their already meagre incomes squeezed during the pandemic because they have had to spend more on food, gas and electricity, and home schooling, a study has revealed. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-11T16:08:06Z,politics,Politics,Dutch officials seize ham sandwiches of drivers arriving from UK,"Dutch TV news has aired footage of customs officers confiscating ham sandwiches from drivers arriving by ferry from the UK under post-Brexit rules banning personal imports of meat and dairy products into the EU. Officials wearing high-visibility jackets are shown explaining to startled car and lorry drivers at the Hook of Holland ferry terminal that since Brexit, “you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff.” To a bemused driver with several sandwiches wrapped in tin foil who asked if he could maybe surrender the meat and keep just the bread, one customs officer replied: “No, everything will be confiscated. Welcome to the Brexit, sir, I’m sorry.” The ban came into force on New Year’s Day as the Brexit transition period came to an end, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) saying travellers should “use, consume, or dispose of” prohibited items at or before the border. “From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (eg a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,” the Defra guidance for commercial drivers states. The European commission says the ban is necessary because meat and dairy products can contain pathogens causing animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or swine fever and “continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the union”. Dutch customs also posted a photograph of foodstuffs ranging from breakfast cereals to oranges that officials had confiscated in the ferry terminal, adding: “Since 1 January, you can’t just bring more food from the UK.” The customs service added: “So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up.” • The headline of this article was amended on 12 January 2021. The seizures apply to all drivers arriving from the UK, not just British drivers as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-11T15:26:24Z,politics,Politics,What exactly is the Alex Salmond controversy all about?,"What is the Salmond controversy about? In August 2018 news leaked the Scottish government had investigated two allegations of sexual misconduct against Alex Salmond while he was first minister. It did so under new rules introduced due to the #MeToo movement, which allowed retrospective investigations into former ministers. Its findings were passed to Police Scotland, which launched its own investigation. Salmond denied the allegations, resigned from the Scottish National party, and immediately took the Scottish government to court, accusing it of abuse of process. In January 2019, the court of session in Edinburgh ruled that the government inquiry was unlawful because the lead investigator had had prior contact with the complainers. Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, admitted it was “tainted by apparent bias”. What happened next? Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, admitted she spoke to Salmond about the government inquiry five times while it was under way, including meetings at her home. She failed to tell Evans she had done so until hours before her third conversation, potentially in breach of the ministerial code. A series of investigations was launched: Sturgeon referred herself under the ministerial code and the case was passed to James Hamilton QC, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions; the Scottish parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the government’s handling of the inquiry and Sturgeon’s actions; and the government set up an internal review of its actions. Two weeks after winning his judicial review, Salmond appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court on 14 counts, including two of indecent assault, nine of sexual assault and two attempted rapes. He denied all the charges. In August 2019, the Scottish government paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal expenses for the judicial review. It later emerged that figure was so high because of serious procedural concerns about the government’s handling of his legal challenge. What happened at the Salmond trial? In March 2020, after nine days of evidence at the high court, Salmond was cleared of 14 charges – an attempted rape, one intent to rape, 11 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults, against 10 women. One charge was dropped by the crown; the jury acquitted Salmond of all the others on majority verdicts. Salmond admitted in evidence that he had an extramarital “sexual liaison” with one of the complainers, but on a different date to the one alleged in the charges, and a “sleepy cuddle” with another which he soon apologised to her for. It emerged during the trial that a number of civil servants heard of two alleged incidents after the women involved told close colleagues. Once the trial ended, the Scottish parliament inquiry began to gather evidence. What has happened with the two remaining inquiries? By the end of 2020, the Holyrood inquiry had held 10 oral evidence sessions, given under oath, including several with Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary; the senior civil servants involved in drafting the sexual harassment policy used to investigate Salmond; and the officials who carried out the inquiry. MSPs heard that officials were aware of unspecified rumours about Salmond, including alleged bullying. The government has released thousands of pages of evidence to the committee but MSPs have repeatedly accused ministers of breaching promises to do so quickly. After ministers repeatedly refused to release their legal advice on the Salmond case, Holyrood voted to insist it was handed over. The government has not given way, and the committee has only been allowed to see a summary of the advice. Salmond has told the ministerial code inquiry that Sturgeon misled Holyrood about what she knew and when, and is guilty of breaching the code. Sturgeon and Salmond are due to appear before MSPs on oath but the latest Covid lockdown has led to further delays. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but said it is up to Holyrood and Hamilton to judge."
2021-01-11T13:42:09Z,politics,Politics,Salmond affair: call for investigation into Sturgeon to be widened,"Opposition MSPs have called for an investigation into Nicola Sturgeon’s actions during the Alex Salmond affair to be widened after fresh allegations she misled the Scottish parliament. Four MSPs, from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, have asked a former prosecutor to investigate new claims from Salmond that Sturgeon broke the ministerial code by failing to disclose how much she knew about an internal inquiry into him. James Hamilton QC, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, was appointed in 2019 to investigate whether Sturgeon interfered with a civil service investigation into two allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond, her predecessor as Scotland’s first minister. Salmond has told Hamilton that Sturgeon’s account to parliament of what she knew and when are “simply untrue”. He alleges she had a series of discussions about his concerns about the inquiry, offered to pass on his concerns and gave him advice on what to do. The four MSPs on a special Holyrood committee set up after a court ruled the government’s handling of that internal inquiry was unlawful, said they believed it was “vital” Salmond’s new allegations are formally investigated under the ministerial code. They have written jointly to John Swinney, the deputy first minister, and to Hamilton arguing the case for his investigation to be broadened. Jackie Baillie, a Labour MSP on the committee, said any minister found to have broken the code must resign. Sturgeon’s account was “at odds with Alex Salmond’s”. “It gets harder to swallow with every twist and turn,” Baillie said. On Sunday, Swinney dismissed Salmond’s allegations as “absolute nonsense” and said Sturgeon would robustly defend herself when she gives evidence to the Holyrood committee. Swinney said Hamilton already had the discretion to expand his inquiry if he saw fit. On Friday Sturgeon’s spokesperson said: “The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond’s claims about the ministerial code. “We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond’s behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories. “The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee in the coming weeks.” Sturgeon told Holyrood she was first told by Salmond about the allegations when the pair met at her home in Glasgow in April 2018. She published a list showing three face-to-face meetings and two phone calls with Salmond. In a potential breach of the ministerial code, she also acknowledged she did not tell the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, Lesley Evans, about their contacts until the eve of her second meeting with Salmond, at the Scottish National party conference in Aberdeen in June 2018. Sturgeon failed to tell parliament she had also met Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Holyrood office on 29 March. She told MSPs late last year she had forgotten it as it was a fleeting meeting because Aberdein happened to be in parliament. Salmond has told Hamilton that is wrong. He said the meeting was arranged after Sturgeon’s chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, had contacted Aberdein earlier that month and had told him about the investigation. Salmond alleges Lloyd also named one of the two women who had lodged complaints against him. The Scottish government said this was untrue. “This meeting was for the purpose of discussing the complaints and thereafter arranging a direct meeting between myself and the first minister,” Salmond told Hamilton. “There was never the slightest doubt what the meeting was about. Any suggestion by the first minister to the Scottish parliament that the meeting was ‘fleeting or opportunistic’ is simply untrue.” Salmond also alleges Sturgeon promised at their first meeting on 2 April she would tell the civil service they had met and pass on his request the harassment complaints be dealt with by mediation. Salmond said that in an exchange of messages on 1 June, Sturgeon had retracted that and instead told him she had always argued her intervention “was not the right thing to do”. “That was both untrue and disturbing,” Salmond told Hamilton."
2021-01-11T12:34:45Z,politics,Politics,"Make further Covid curbs in next 24 hours to halt spread, says Keir Starmer","The government must look at new coronavirus restrictions within the next 24 hours, Keir Starmer has said, naming estate agents and nurseries as those that could face further curbs to halt the spread of the virus. “This is the most serious stage of the pandemic and therefore, we have to face the most serious restrictions,” said the Labour leader. “I think a lot of people will be quite surprised primary schools are closed, and nurseries are open. “It is still possible at the moment, as I understand it, to go and view houses if you’re going to buy a house, and that wasn’t allowed last March. So we’re in this extraordinary situation … at least as serious, if not a more serious position than in March of last year, we’ve got less restrictions in place.”
“I think we are going to have to look in the next 24 hours or so, what are the other measures that could be put in place, and hear from the scientists as to which of those that they think are more effective, and then all pull together and support those measures if they’re needed because the numbers are still, as everybody knows, heading in the wrong direction on.” In his first major policy speech, the Labour leader called for the government to give employers the right to put workers on “flexible furlough” to allow them to look after children while schools are closed, as well as extending support to the “excluded” 3 million workers who have no support. Starmer said the government was doing little to support working families who had to work full-time and homeschool their children during the national lockdown. He said Labour in power would pledge the creation of 400,000 jobs in low-carbon sectors – “because this recovery has to be a green recovery”. He also said a Labour government would create a “high streets fightback fund” to protect local shops and retail, saying “Britain can’t reopen if our towns and our high streets are closed”. Starmer said the government had not honoured its contract with the British people by failing to get the virus under control after many months of restrictions. “It makes no sense to me at all that when we’re asking so much of the British people, the government is doing so little to support families,” he said, calling for “a legal, enforceable and immediate right for parents to request paid, flexible furlough and by promoting that to all working parents to help them get through this lockdown”. In his speech, Starmer laid out a number of measures he said the government could take in order to ease the burden on working families and their finances. He said the government could cancel council tax hikes with more funding for local authorities – calling the rise “a £1.9bn bombshell that lands a bill of around £90 on every family”. He also urged the government to pull its plan to cut the £20 universal credit uplift, which was put in place at the start of the pandemic, but which the government plans to cut back in April. Starmer said that would be “taking £1,000 a year from millions of families and pulling another 200,000 children into poverty”. He also criticised the decision to freeze public-sector pay for millions of key workers, people, he said, who had “got us through this crisis – including our armed forces, our care workers, our teachers, our firefighters and police officers”. Starmer, who on Sunday said he believed lockdown measures might need to be tightened further, said the government had been “found wanting at every turn” during the crisis. “Even in the best of times, you can’t be indecisive in government. In the worst of times, indecision can be fatal. Every time there’s a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,” he said.
Starmer said the public needed to hear daily press conferences with the underlying message of “stay at home” and added: “One of the problems we’ve had in the last nine months is the mixed messaging coming from the government, this made it so much harder. The vast majority of the British public will comply with the rules, will do what’s asked of them, but they need absolute clarity as to what those rules are.” The Labour leader was also asked if he could see a role in a future Labour administration for the former prime minister Tony Blair, who is reported to have been in advisory talks with Matt Hancock about the vaccine strategy. Starmer said he had spoken to Blair about his reports but declined to suggest he would be offered any formal role now or in the future. “I’ve spent many hours of many days, talking to many, many people about the pandemic, and I will continue to do so because I want to hear from anybody who can help us through this and to ensure that I’m as best informed as possible,” Starmer said."
2021-01-11T12:11:27Z,politics,Politics,Home Office minister rejects plans for extra support for trafficking victims,"A Home Office minister has rejected proposals in a parliamentary bill for new support for victims of trafficking, a letter leaked to the Guardian reveals. Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, outlined her opposition to the modern slavery (victim support) bill, which calls for trafficking victims of all nationalities to receive a minimum of 12 months’ access to safe housing, support and protection from immigration detention. The private member’s bill has been tabled by Ian McColl, a Conservative life peer, and co-sponsored by Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader and former work and pensions secretary. Atkins wrote to Maya Esslemont, the director of After Exploitation, a data mapping project tracking outcomes for slavery survivors in the UK, last week expressing her opposition to the bill. The minister said the government had been carefully considering the issues raised in the bill but “does not support the … bill in its current form. The government does not agree that victims should automatically be granted leave to remain for 12 months.” The letter added: “The government does not have an absolute exclusion from detention for any particular group.” It said that if the government did detain victims of trafficking who were vulnerable, assessments known as adults at risk were carried out and the detention was authorised by senior Home Office officials. Atkins’ letter outlines a series of measures the Home Office is taking to support trafficking victims. According to Home Office data obtained by After Exploitation through freedom of information requests, 1,256 potential trafficking victims were detained in 2019. The private member’s bill, along with a letter last October signed by dozens of NGOs, calls for increased protection for trafficking victims, particularly those at risk of deportation because they are not UK nationals. If trafficking victims are deported, not only are their lives potentially put at risk but valuable intelligence about who trafficked them could be lost. Esslemont said: “In order to be recognised as a survivor, victims are first referred by ‘first responders’ and then assessed via a two-stage process sometimes lasting years. It is insulting that even where victims undergo the gruelling steps requested of them, the government cannot meet survivors halfway with incredibly basic and short-term protection. “The current system of support and recognition is unsustainable and makes it difficult for non-UK survivors to report crime due to the threat of deportation or detention. Equally, UK survivors cannot be confident about the length of support, such as access to safe housing, they will receive if they come forward. Until the government creates a culture of safety for those exploited, it is impossible to win the trust of survivors who are rightfully fearful of seeking help.” Atkins said in a statement: “The government is committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and ensuring that victims are provided with the support they need to rebuilt their lives. We have already implemented a number of significant reforms to the national referral mechanism aimed at improving the speed, quality and independence of the decision-making, and offering the best possible support for victims.”"
2021-01-11T07:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Labour facing another split over police immunity in 'spy cops' bill,"Labour is poised to split again over a controversial bill allowing undercover agents to commit crimes while infiltrating criminal gangs, after the party’s leadership refused to back a Lords amendment from Shami Chakrabarti. The former shadow attorney general under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership says undercover police and informants could be immune to prosecution if the “spy cops” bill goes through parliament unamended. She has submitted an amendment for debate in the upper house on Monday, seeking to remove the immunity and saying that otherwise there would be “grave risk” of human rights abuses from agents acting undercover. But while Lady Chakrabarti is confident of winning Lib Dem support in the upper house, she has failed to win round the Labour leadership. Party sources said on Sunday that Labour would whip its peers to abstain. When told the leadership’s intention, the Labour peer said she intended to press her amendment to a vote, even though it was now unlikely to pass. “This is too important to be left to deals involving the usual channels,” Chakrabarti said. Labour has already split twice over the proposed legislation as it passed through the Commons. Two frontbenchers resigned in October as part of a rebellion by 34 MPs on its third reading, unhappy that the party was not prepared to vote against. A fortnight earlier 20 Labour MPs had rebelled at a second reading. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, had called on the party to abstain over the bill, arguing that statutory regulation of undercover operatives would have been necessary if the party had been in power, after the government only narrowly won a court case over the issue. Further concerns about the conduct of undercover officers resurfaced in November as a public inquiry opened into the work of the Met police’s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), which targeted left-wing, environmental, anti-war and black justice campaigners for more than 40 years. Chakrabarti says the bill does more that codify existing policies used by MI5 and the police and, in effect, would give undercover informants and officers immunity against prosecution for crimes committed, if their actions were authorised. The legislation describes such as acts as “lawful for all purposes”. “Total legal immunity means even less incentive for some of the most volatile and manipulative people – including ‘turned criminals and terrorists’ – to behave ethically,” Chakrabarti said. “Blanket licence for crime without limit, is completely alien to equality before the law.” The peer said she believed that a group of women who successfully sued the Met in 2015 after they had been deceived into forming “abusive and manipulative” long-term relationships with undercover police officers, would probably find it impossible to bring a similar action again. “The ‘spy cops’ scandal with undercover state agents inciting and perpetrating crimes they were supposed to prevent, has yet to be investigated fully,” the peer said. It was unclear if the officers involved had their actions authorised, but Chakrabarti said it would be very difficult for future claimants to prove that either way. Peers are debating the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill, which reaches its report stage on Monday and Wednesday this week, where amendments are typically taken for a vote. Labour sources complained that Chakrabarti was trying to inflame internal divisions between the Corbyn and Starmer supporting wings of the party. One said there had been “no real attempt” to engage with the party leadership on the issue. The party intends to support several other amendments limiting the scope of the bill, including an amendment from Lord Dubs, requiring a judge to approve the use of a confidential source except in the case of an emergency, which is due to be voted on Monday. Conservative ministers say that the use of secret operatives remains critical in tackling terror offences, helping, for example, to halt a plot to kill former prime minister Theresa May. But former undercover police say the power is most frequently used in drug cases, where it can be at risk of abuse."
2021-01-11T00:02:03Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit UK should aim to be a global broker, not a great power, says report","Britain will fail if it seeks to reincarnate itself after Brexit as a mini-great power, and should focus instead on being a global broker for solutions to specific challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, global health and human rights, a major report has proposed. The report by Robin Niblett, the director general of Britain’s leading foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, coincides with the 75th anniversary of the first meeting of the UN general assembly in London. It also warns that the UK will be making a mistake if it seeks to set itself up as a rival to the European Union on foreign policy, since it will need EU cooperation to meet many objectives. Niblett urges the UK not to indulge in nostalgic fantasies about individual glory or Global Britain. “Britain will fail if it now tries to reincarnate itself as an independently influential miniature great power,” he writes. “It should focus instead on being an enabler of positive international outcomes.” He also says the UK has an image problem as it strikes out on its new journey “at a moment when its competence is being called into question as a result of the government’s handling of coronavirus”. Instead, Niblett suggests, it should draw on its soft power and diplomatic network to become a practical solution seeker on some of the world’s great problems. The six subjects he chooses are climate change, human rights, Nato strength, global health, a cyber alliance of democracies and clamping down on global tax avoidance – a subject the UK championed in the past, but has since dropped. Even, he says, “enjoying unique reserves of soft power, a seat at most of the world’s top tables, and the assets to leverage the UK’s voice and support its interests does not guarantee an ability to lead global change or secure outcomes to the national advantage”. “The incoming administration of Joe Biden will seek to heal America’s relations with allies in Europe and Asia,” Niblett writes. “Brexit Britain will have to fight its way to the table on many of the most important transatlantic issues, with the EU now the US’s main counterpart in areas such as China relations and digital taxation.” The UK will also come under greater bilateral pressure than before to demonstrate its loyalty to the US or risk paying a price as the junior partner in the relationship. The test for British governments, Niblett says, will be whether they can turn the UK’s greater policy autonomy and nimbleness as a non-EU member into an asset in the relationship with the US. He argues strongly against the UK seeking to undercut the EU in foreign policy areas. “For Britain to strengthen its relations with Hungary or Turkey, for example, with no regard for the ways this could undercut the policies being developed towards them by their European neighbours would not only be hypocritical; it would be counterproductive, whatever the potential near-term economic benefits for the UK,” Niblett writes. “The EU remains the main upholder, inside and around Europe’s neighbourhood, of the political norms that Britain champions. If these are eroded, the UK will be less secure and less prosperous in the long term.” He also suggests that, in seeking new partners, the UK will have to choose not to be close to everyone, and suggests Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia and India as four countries with which the UK should not seek close alliances.
He also gives an implicit warning to Boris Johnson that he will have to improve and change his tone on the international stage if he is to achieve the new role he proposes for the country. A positive reputation for Britain as a valued and creative broker in the search for solutions to shared problems will need to be earned, he warns. “It will emerge only from the competence and impact of Britain’s diplomacy, from trust in its word, and from a return to the power of understatement for which the country was so widely respected in the past. Britain’s G7 presidency and co-chairmanship of COP26 [the UN’s climate change conference] in 2021 will be critical first tests.” He also urges Johnson and others to be judicious in their rhetoric, writing: “The notion of ‘Global Britain’ may have a convenient alliteration with ‘Great Britain’ but, in the minds of many, Britain became ‘Great’ by building a world-spanning empire whose injustices and inequities are now rightly being re-examined. “The government will need to be judicious in how it now goes about communicating its global agenda, especially among its Commonwealth partners.”"
2021-01-11T00:01:03Z,politics,Politics,Calls to escalate English lockdown amid fears one in five may have had Covid,"Ministers were under pressure on Sunday night to escalate the current lockdown in England amid warnings that current measures may not be tough enough. They came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said about 2 million people – including about a third of people over the age of 80 – had already been vaccinated, and the opening of the mass vaccination sites is intended to accelerate the process. More than half a million people over the age of 80 are to receive letters inviting them to attend one of seven large coronavirus vaccination centres opening in England, where they will be able to book an appointment online or over the phone.
But, in an interview on Sunday, Hancock also said that, with hospital cases and deaths still rising sharply, the NHS was “probably under the greatest pressure it ever has been”. According to modelling seen by the Guardian, one in five people across England may have had coronavirus, equivalent to 12.4 million people, rising to almost one in two in some areas. It means that across England the true number of people infected to date may be five times as high as the total number of known cases according to the government’s track-and-trace programme. Amid concerns that people are continuing to mix more than they did during the first lockdown, Keir Starmer suggested the current lockdown measures might be inadequate. “They may not be tough enough,” the Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Nurseries should probably close, Starmer said. “Quite a lot of people are surprised that primary schools are closed and that nurseries aren’t closed.” Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the Kent variant has made the situation “more risky” and that if the infection rate does not slow down then “we’re going to have to be even stricter”. The current lockdown, England’s third, was announced in a televised address by Boris Johnson on 4 January, but Hancock on Sunday, just six days later, refused to rule out further restrictions. Reports suggested that measures could include a ban on exercising with those outside your household, the end of support bubbles, making office workers wear masks and stricter rules for supermarkets such as one-way systems and masks for outside queues. He said he did not want to speculate on what might be needed but that people should follow the rules. To drive home the importance of compliance with the restriction, Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, will be doing a round of media appearances on Monday morning to highlight the risks facing the NHS. Whitty, a regular at the No 10 press conferences but not someone who often gives interviews, is expected to stress that the risk from social contact is much greater than it was during the first lockdown because the new variant of the virus is so much more transmissible. Ministers are confident that the vaccination programme will ultimately provide a release from lockdown and mass vaccination centres will open from Monday at the ExCel centre in London, Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, Millennium Point in Birmingham; Robertson House in Stevenage; Etihad tennis club in Manchester; and the Centre for Life in Newcastle upon Tyne. Letters are being sent out to more than 600,000 people over the age of 80 living up to 45 minutes away from one of the sites inviting them to book an appointment. Anyone already offered a vaccination appointment by their local GP can choose which suits them best. Many more GP and hospital vaccination facilities are also due to open this week, as well as the first Boots pharmacy-based pilots, taking the total number of vaccination centres in England to about 1,200.
The large vaccination centres, which will also provide the jab to NHS staff, will be the first services to deploy volunteers from St John Ambulance and the NHS volunteer responder scheme who are helping with the programme. The government is committed to ensuring that everyone in the top four vaccination priority groups – care home residents and staff, NHS and care staff, the over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable – will have been offered a jab by 15 February. On Monday Hancock will also publish the government’s Covid-19 UK vaccines delivery plan, which he will set out at a No 10 press conference. Hancock said the document was being released “so the public can be assured of the time, effort and resources that have gone and will go into ensuring we protect the British people from the scourge of this virus”. Hancock said the government wanted to vaccinate everyone in the remaining five of the nine priority groups drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – everyone else over the age of 50, and people over 16 with serious underlying health conditions – by the spring. It wanted to vaccinate all adults by the autumn, he said. Starmer said the priority list should be reviewed after the first four groups have been covered, with perhaps teachers being added as a new category, but the Department of Health said the independent JCVI drew up the list, and a JCVI source said there were no plans to revise the nine groups already included. On Sunday the UK recorded 54,940 further coronavirus cases and 563 further deaths. Although both figures were lower than the numbers for preceding days, the total number of reported deaths in the last seven days (6,363) is 49% up on the previous week. Ministers are also particularly alarmed about hospital numbers. The most recent UK-wide data showed 32,294 Covid patients in hospital on Thursday last week, with admissions up 35% week on week. That is more than 10,000 higher than the UK total for hospital numbers at the peak of the first wave in April. On Sunday Tracy Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, told Sky News that the ambulance service was currently under “unprecedented” pressure and that there were cases of patients having to wait “five, six, seven, eight, even nine hours” to be transferred from an ambulance to a hospital because of a shortage of beds.
She also said she had heard of patients with non-life-threatening conditions in areas such as London and the south-east having to wait up to 10 hours for an ambulance to arrive. Hancock said that he expected the government to be able to ease restrictions in the spring but he refused to spell out exactly when he considered spring to be over. One unnamed government official was quoted in the Sunday Times as saying pubs might not be allowed to open in England until the May bank holiday. In a speech on Monday, Starmer will say the government should make putting families first a priority during the lockdown and he will challenge the government to commit to protecting family incomes by preventing the planned council tax rise, reversing the planned cut to universal credit and giving key workers a pay rise. Starmer will also urge people to take inspiration from the Labour government of 1945 when rebuilding after the pandemic, saying: “We can build a country worthy of the sacrifices of the British people, just as we did in 1945 when Attlee’s government built the welfare state from the rubble of war.”"
2021-01-10T20:00:11Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for more help for working parents in England lockdown,"Ministers are being urged to change the eligibility rules for the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme to support working parents and others during the latest national lockdown in England. The call came as fresh analysis showed almost four million people said childcare responsibilities affected their work the last time schools were closed. According to a survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), more than 22 million people reported that the first lockdown had affected their work. Almost four million, or 17.9%, cited childcare responsibilities as the reason. With schools closed until February half-term at the earliest, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has called on her government counterpart, Rishi Sunak, to take urgent action to help those with caring responsibilities through the current lockdown. Dodds said: “Four million working parents found it hard to juggle work and childcare during the first lockdown. “Almost a year on, the government must change the eligibility rules of the furlough scheme to support working parents and other workers through the current lockdown. Early years providers are also teetering on the brink, with this new lockdown likely to further impact attendance.” Under current rules, individuals who start a new job after 31 October are no longer eligible for the scheme. ONS data suggests 520,000 people changed jobs between July and September last year. In the same data, 625,000 people changed jobs between April and June. This means some individuals who started a new job after 31 October could be denied access to furlough during the latest lockdown. Dodds believes that without childcare provisions, there will be significant effect on parents’ ability to continue to work. “It is a short-term financial consideration to not be supporting childcare providers right now,” she said. “That will have an enormous impact on a parent’s ability to work, particularly mothers, and we know that already mothers have been more likely to be made unemployed or to have to changed their hours very radically because of this crisis. This really is a crunch point for a lot of families and a lot of working parents. “We’ve had more guidance about how to play tennis from the government than what working parents should be doing with childcare for their kids and protecting their incomes. That’s really got to change now.” Anne Malindine, the CEO of Raised in Bristol, said: “We’re being asked to be the heroes of the hour but no one was interested in our experiences before. Why are we not, for example, in the priority list for vaccination? Children are living in households of adults and coming into nursery every day. “We can do our best and, undoubtedly, we are, but I think there hasn’t been an opportunity for feedback from a sector that has suddenly has a huge responsibility put on it. And I think that’s really evident for the first time. I haven’t seen it before.” The impact of Covid-19 since March has led to a stark decline in the number of families accessing childcare places. A survey carried out by the Early Years Alliance in November found that 25% of childcare providers believed they would cease to be viable within six months if the government changes its approach to early-years funding next year. According to Labour analysis, this could result in nearly 19,000 childcare providers being forced to close their doors within six months, and more than 30,000 at risk of closure by next Christmas.
A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children. “Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children. “We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. Where nurseries do see a drop in income from either parent-paid fees or income from DfE, they are able to use the furlough scheme. “Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “It’s been clear since the first lockdown that employers can furlough eligible employees who have childcare responsibilities, including because of school closures.”"
2021-01-10T19:47:10Z,politics,Politics,Raab to clampdown on firms linked to forced labour in Xinjiang,"Dominic Raab is to address concerns over UK complicity in the use of forced labour in China’s Xinjiang province with more requirements on companies that buy goods there and possible sanctions on Chinese officials believed to be instrumental in the abuse. Proposals released by the foreign secretary this week could include fines if companies fail to meet commitments to show due diligence in their supply chains. A proposal for a total ban on cotton from the province is thought not to be feasible. The measures due to be announced by Raab and the trade secretary, Liz Truss, in the Commons on Wednesday come as a Conservative party human rights commission (CPHRC) backed by former Tory foreign secretaries prepare to demand the government do more to challenge China. The Foreign Office does not regard its supply chain measures as representing a definitive new government stance on British-Chinese relations, and will steer clear of proposing sanctions against officials involved in the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. China, however, will resent suggestions that it allows the use of forced labour. China’s outgoing ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said last week that relations between the two countries “depend on whether the UK sees China as a partner or a rival, respects China’s core interests and major concerns, and abides by the basic norms governing international relations, including non-interference in each other’s internal affairs”. “The ball is in the court of the UK side,” he said. The CPHRC will claim forced labour is rife in Xinjiang province, which supplies nearly a quarter of the world’s cotton. The Chinese government has long denied the claims, insisting that camps for workers are “vocational training schools” and factories are part of a huge, and voluntary, poverty alleviation scheme. Ministers are expected to extend the number of organisations subject to reporting obligations under the Modern Slavery Act (MSA); introduce binding rules on the content, timing and publication of modern slavery statements; and propose a single enforcement body to oversee MSA compliance. Limited financial or civil penalties for organisations that fail to comply are also being considered. As many as five officials were being considered for Magnitsky sanctions, which target those involved in human rights abuses. The Foreign Office refuses to discuss who may soon be subject to sanctions in advance. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “Our approach to China is rooted in our values and interests. However, where we have concerns, we raise them and hold China to account. We have done this consistently over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.” Rights groups say Xinjiang’s Uighur minority are being persecuted and recruited for forced labour. Photographic evidence suggests many of the camps do contain factories. Two Commons select committees are investigating the issue of forced labour, showing the degree of concern. As public awareness grows, many fashion brands are increasingly fearful they will be revealed to be unwittingly and indirectly sourcing cotton products from the region in China’s far west, and have been scrambling to make commitments about their supply chains. Raab will also set out his opposition to a Lords all-party amendment giving UK courts a right to declare if countries are committing genocide. A group of Conservative backbench MPs are supporting an amendment passed in the Lords that calls for the UK not to strike bilateral trade deals, including with China, if a British high court makes a preliminary assessment that the country has committed or is committing genocide. The amendment has the backing of Iain Duncan Smithand the Labour human rights barrister Helena Kennedy. The government opposes the measure on the grounds that determination of genocide is for international courts."
2021-01-10T15:28:59Z,politics,Politics,Musicians hit out after report UK rejected visa-free EU travel,"The government has been called spineless after a report it rejected a deal with the EU that would have given musicians visa-free touring on the continent, saving acts from expensive and potentially prohibitive post-Brexit bureaucracy. The Independent reported that despite the government’s claim Brussels had rejected an “ambitious” reciprocal touring arrangement, an EU source said it was the UK that refused to accept European acts having 90 days of visa-free travel. The unnamed source, who was said to be close to the negotiations, was reported as saying in “agreements with third countries, that [work] visas are not required for musicians. We tried to include it, but the UK said no”. The source accused the government of lying about the negotiations, and said the UK refused to agree because “they were ending freedom of movement”. The Department of Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) had released a statement that said the UK had “pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU”, which would have covered musicians but its “proposals were rejected.” Priti Patel’s immigration reforms were blamed for the tougher restrictions on touring EU musicians, which require them to apply for visas for stays of more than 30 days and provide proof of savings and a sponsorship certificate. The DCMS stood by its original statement, reiterating its claim that it “pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians”, while dismissing the story, calling it “incorrect and misleading speculation from anonymous EU sources”. Radiohead’s Thom Yorke responded to the report by calling the government spineless, while others demanded strong collective action as the music industry struggles to cope with the impact of Covid-19 and the prospect of costly EU touring. Horace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, called for the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to clarify what occurred, saying the situation was unbelievable after months of campaigning for “musicians’ passports” that would allow visa and permit-free travel. The composer, broadcaster and crossbench peer Michael Berkeley said he had submitted an urgent question to the Lord Speaker over the issue. If “the story holds up then it would mean that, albeit by omission, we have been misled about these negotiations,” he said. Labour said that if it was confirmed the government had stopped musicians from touring in Europe to “make a political point, then music fans will not forgive them”. A petition backed by musicians including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa has amassed more than 200,000 signatures and calls for the government to “negotiate a free cultural work permit that gives us visa-free travel throughout the 27 EU states for music touring professionals, bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment”. Failure to agree a bloc-wide arrangement that means acts no longer need to acquire work permits for every European country they visit could rule out or dramatically curtail EU touring, according to musicians. Bands and orchestras said the bureaucracy could stop them from travelling to Europe, describing Covid-19 restrictions and the post-Brexit requirements a “double whammy” to an already devastated music industry."
2021-01-10T13:12:06Z,politics,Politics,HMRC to waive fines for taxpayers who file late returns due to Covid,"People who file their tax returns late won’t face a fine this year, as long as they can show that the delay was due to coronavirus. In a show of forbearance that could offer relief to millions of workers, HM Revenue & Customs will take a lenient stance towards people who file after 31 January for Covid-related reasons. The move means pressures of home schooling could be deemed a valid reason for delay, while people who can show that either they or their accountant have recently been ill with the virus are also likely to be shown clemency.
HMRC said: “We want to encourage as many people as possible to file on time even if they can’t pay their tax straight away. But where a customer is unable to do so because of the impact of Covid-19 we will accept they have a reasonable excuse and cancel penalties, provided they manage to file as soon as possible after that.” About 12 million people file their own tax return because they are self-employed, a landlord or have a second form of income. HMRC said slightly more than half had already filed a return by 4 January, meaning millions could benefit from an extension. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is also weighing up whether to extend the deadline for everybody, moving it from 31 January to March, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story. Kevin Sefton, chief executive of the tax app firm Untied, said a nationwide extension would help avoid HMRC being flooded with millions of excuse forms around the deadline.
“Covid-19 and the associated effects such as having to home-school children are circumstances that the self-employed population of the UK cannot control and are therefore causing these individuals extreme anxiety,” he said. “Challenges like these make it incredibly difficult for some people and business to stay afloat so we welcome anything that HMRC can do to ease the burden on the working population. “We are again calling on HMRC to extend the deadline officially for both filing and paying. This will reduce admin and paperwork at HMRC and uncertainty and worry for taxpayers.”"
2021-01-10T12:43:15Z,politics,Politics,Starmer accepts end of EU free movement in Brexit reversal,"Keir Starmer has abandoned the commitment to free movement of people in the European Union he made to Labour members during the party’s leadership contest. The Labour leader said his party had to be honest with the public, and that if it won the next general election a major renegotiation of the Brexit treaty would not be possible. The deal, which was finalised on Christmas Eve, confirmed the end of free movement for Britons and EU nationals within each others’ countries because it kept the UK out of the single market, as the Tories promised in their 2019 election manifesto. In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Starmer was reminded that when standing for the Labour leadership after the party’s election defeat he said, as one of 10 pledges, he would “defend free movement as we leave the EU”. Marr also pointed out that in January 2019, when he was asked specifically if he would bring back free movement of EU citizens to the UK, he had replied: “Yes of course, bring back, argue for, challenge.” Starmer told Marr, however, that he was ruling out the sort of extensive renegotiation of the Brexit treaty that would be required to restore free movement. “I don’t think that there’s scope for major renegotiation. We’ve just had four years of negotiation. We’ve arrived at a treaty and now we’ve got to make that treaty work,” he said. He said there were aspects of the treaty that might be improved on, including how it covered the creative industries and what it did for the service sector, which he said had largely been left out. When it was put to him that this would disappoint Labour members who voted for him because of his commitment to free movement, Starmer said it was not realistic to pretend that the EU would want to negotiate a new Brexit treaty with the UK. “Whether we like it or not, that is going to be the treaty that an incoming Labour government inherits and has to make work. And it is not being straight with the British public to say we can come into office in 2024 and operate some other treaty,” he said. Free movement became an issue in the leadership campaign after the party conference backed the principle in autumn 2019. The commitment was linked to defending migrants’ rights generally, but it contradicted previous party comments saying free movement would end if the UK left the EU. Asked by Marr if he thought government debt, at about 100% of GDP, was at a dangerous level, Starmer said: “We’re going to have to reassess debt.” He would not, however, say how until he knew the state of the economy at the time of the next election.
He refused to commit to renewing Labour’s 2019 pledge for free broadband in the next election manifesto, although he said more should be done to improve broadband access for disadvantaged pupils and their families. Starmer also said he did not favour another Scottish independence referendum now, but that he thought Boris Johnson was wrong to rule one out for another 40 years. He also said the status quo with regard to Scotland wasn’t working, which is why he said Labour favoured a constitutional commission."
2021-01-10T11:18:37Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson should resign as PM, 43% of people tell survey","More people think Boris Johnson should resign as prime minister than think he should continue in office, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The first poll of 2021 found that 43% thought he should resign, while 40% said that he should remain as leader. However, most Conservative voters (87%) think Johnson should stay on as leader, with just 7% thinking he should resign. Just 20% believed Keir Starmer should resign as Labour leader, with 52% saying he should remain as leader. There were also signs of a slight drop in support for the government’s handling of coronavirus. Some 72% (+4 on the last poll) think the government has not acted fast enough, with 42% (+4) thinking they are definitely not acting fast enough.
The public appear to want to err on the side of caution in terms of Covid restrictions. More than three in five (64%) said they would prefer “a government who quickly puts lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes measures are put in place that didn’t need to be”. Only 25% said they would prefer “a government who tries the hardest they can not to put lockdown measures in place, even if that means that sometimes decisions are made later than they would otherwise have been”. Johnson’s overall approval numbers have seen a slight drop. The proportion approving is now 37% (down one point from the last poll), while 45% disapprove (up one point). The government’s handling of the virus more generally has also seen a small drop. The number who approve is now 31% (-3), while the number disapproving is 48% (+3). This is the highest disapproval number since early November. Overall, Labour hold a one-point lead on 40% of the vote, with the Conservatives on 39%. The Lib Dems are on 6%, the SNP on 5%, and the Greens on 4%. Opinium polled 2,003 people online on 6-7 January."
2021-01-10T07:30:44Z,politics,Politics,"Baffling Brexit rules threaten export chaos, Gove is warned","Ministers must restart trade negotiations with Brussels immediately to sort out the “baffling” array of post-Brexit rules and regulations that now threaten much of the UK’s export trade to the EU, leading business groups have said. Amid mounting anger among UK firms at cross-border friction they were told would not exist, British manufacturing and trade organisations met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in an emergency session on Thursday to discuss problems resulting from the deal struck by Boris Johnson with the EU before Christmas. The prime minister had hailed what he claimed was a “zero-tariff” and “zero-quotas” deal that would allow free and simple access to the single market. Less than a month on, however, Britain’s EU departure appears to be anything but pain-free. One leading figure involved in the talks with Gove described the new rule book as a “complete shitshow”. Another said Gove seemed “very concerned” at hearing reports of problems, after a week in which Marks & Spencer was among leading companies to warn that more bureaucracy would increase costs. The source added: “He [Gove] seemed to realise the full gravity of the situation that is unfolding and about to get worse.” Gove admitted on Friday that there would be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. In the first week after the UK finally left both the single market and customs union, the parcels firm DPD suspended some of its services, bookseller Waterstones halted sales to customers in the EU and UK fishermen warned they would not be able to sell their fresh produce into EU markets because of delays at borders. There were also problems with consignments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as new border checks caught many businesses unawares. Luxury food store Fortnum & Mason also told customers on its website: “We are temporarily unable to deliver to Northern Ireland or countries in the European Union”, while Debenhams has temporarily shut its online business in Ireland. Some of the problems are being blamed on a rushed deal, and others on the sheer complexity of arrangements including “rules of origin”, some of which have not been finally determined. Only goods made up largely of parts that originate in the UK qualify as tariff-free. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of the Northern Ireland business organisation Manufacturing NI, said: “The reason why the UK and EU originally agreed that there would be an implementation period of 11 months was so that people could get their heads around what was needed and assure their businesses were compliant. But we didn’t have that. We had seven days before everyone had to be ready, and one of those was Christmas Day. “There is a big problem with GB businesses being unaware of their new responsibilities. We have the triple whammy here of Covid, Christmas and new customs rules arriving all at once without any time to adjust.” Johnson assured Northern Ireland business owners in November 2019 that they would have “unfettered access” to the rest of the UK. “There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind,” he said. If anyone told them they needed to fill in forms, “tell them to ring up the PM and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin.” The government was also facing pressure over its Brexit deal from the SNP. Ian Blackford, the party’s leader in Westminster, called on the UK government to “pay compensation to Scotland”, claiming a “multibillion compensation package” was needed to mitigate the costs of Brexit in Scotland. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said much still needed to be negotiated between the UK and EU. “Industry welcomed the trade agreement that avoided the catastrophe of no-deal, as tariffs and quotas would have been a disaster for exporters. However, this is only a starting point, as there are still substantial issues that need ironing out, with many months, if not years, of tough negotiations ahead. “There are customs experts with 30 years’ experience who are baffled by what the new regulations mean, let alone small- and medium-sized businesses who have never had to deal with the kind of paperwork that is now required. The great fear is that for many it will prove too much and they will simply choose not to export to the EU.” He also raised fears about the UK car industry, which could be adversely affected by tariffs if EU rules relating to the origins of components used in car manufacture cannot be met. “Having built up seamless and complex supply chains over decades, the automotive sector in the UK is facing a jolt to its systems that places its very future under threat,” he added. “While there is no suggestion multinationals will close plants overnight, we have already seen decisions to build new models placed elsewhere. As those models that have been built in the UK for many years come to the end of their life, we are likely to see a slow puncture for the sector of investment drifting away.” Dominic Goudie head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation said talks needed to re-start between the UK Brussels. “Where problems emerge there will need to be further conversations,” he said. “The trade deal provides the means to do that. It is a question of whether there is the will to do so (after so many months of talks).” Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said there were problems that could grow over coming weeks and months. “The new import/export formalities are proving problematic for many companies. The lack of obvious queues at the border disguises the fact that many trucks are stuck in depots, unable to head to the ports due to their clients failing to provide the necessary documentation and information.”"
2021-01-09T08:00:16Z,politics,Politics,May elections to go ahead in UK despite coronavirus concerns,"Elections due in May are expected to go ahead despite coronavirus, officials have said, amid warnings they are likely to be among the most logistically fraught and complicated the UK has witnessed. Boris Johnson told MPs this week that while the plan was still for local and mayoral elections, some of which were postponed from last year, to happen on 6 May in England, this remained “under review”. Officials stress that while the pandemic means all government plans are theoretically subject to change, the strong expectation is the polls will go ahead. In England, as well as a double set of council elections, there will be ballots for the London mayor and assembly, for a series of other mayors, and for police and crime commissioners (PCCs). Scotland and Wales are holding elections on the same day for their parliaments, and for PCCs in Wales. Each UK nation organises its own elections. While Scotland’s government has left open the prospect of the Holyrood elections being staged over two to three days, to allow distancing and cleaning at polling stations, England is committed to its usual timetable. Election officials are warning that while turnout at English local elections tends to be low, the practicalities could mount up, not least because of the sheer number of contests taking place, with some voters receiving up to seven polling cards. With the government rejecting the idea of all-postal voting, polling staff will be protected by plastic screens. Voters will socially distance and be encouraged to bring their own pens. They will show polling cards rather than handing them over. There are nonetheless worries about attracting enough volunteer election staff, many of whom tend to be older, and about finding venues, with schools and community halls potentially wary about hundreds of people tramping through their building. With people able to apply for postal votes up to 11 working days before the election, there is also uncertainty of how many of these need to be produced – and thus how many people will turn out in person. Peter Stanyon, the chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, which represents election officials, said the situation was hugely complex. He said: “I’m confident in my colleagues to do all they can to deliver a safe and secure election. If you’d asked me this a month ago, I’d have been more bullish. We are concerned, as key decisions and planning are happening now, without really knowing what the situation will be like in May.” All the preparations will cost money. While the Cabinet Office says councils can provide for this out of Covid funding already granted, the Local Government Association says government “will need to meet any additional costs of holding these elections in these extraordinary circumstances”.
It also remains to be seen whether distancing rules might hamper campaigning, much depending on the speed of Covid vaccinations. If significant restrictions remain in place there is a worry it could favour incumbent candidates, as regular election practices such as handing out leaflets and knocking on doors would be impossible. In Wales – where the elections will be the first to include 16- and 17-year-old voters – people are being encouraged to vote by post, and plans are in place to delay the poll if needed. In Scotland, there have been isolated calls for the election to be postponed but Nicola Sturgeon, whose Scottish National party is at 58% in opinion polls, has said she can see “no reason at this stage” why they would not go ahead. Neil Findlay, a Labour MSP who is quitting Holyrood at the election, said there were strong public health reasons to postpone the vote. “Can you think of any other place during this crisis where we’d be encouraging thousands of people to go into the same small spaces? That’s effectively what we’d be doing,” he said."
2021-01-08T19:25:57Z,politics,Politics,Firms halt deliveries from UK to EU over Brexit border problems,"A growing number of retailers and courier firms are suspending or cutting back deliveries into the EU as companies grapple with new border controls as well as import taxes. On Friday DPD, the international delivery giant, said it was “pausing” its road service from the UK into Europe, including the Republic of Ireland. Separately, Marks & Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pig sweets, would now be subject to import tariffs. Such taxes could spell higher prices for shoppers. DPD said new border procedures, including additional customs paperwork, needed for parcels destined for Europe were putting extra pressure on turnaround and transit times. The company said it was returning one-fifth of parcels to the sender because they had incorrect or incomplete data attached. It also blamed delays and congestion at UK ports for its decision, as well as more rigid requirements for Channel crossings. The firm said it hoped to restart the service on Wednesday. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he expected there to be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “So far disruption at the border hasn’t been too profound but it is the case that in the weeks ahead we expect that there will be significant additional disruption, particularly on the Dover-Calais route. It is our responsibility in government to make sure that business is as ready as possible, and hauliers and traders have already done a lot but we have to redouble our efforts to communicate the precise paperwork that is required in order to make sure that trade can flow freely.” Although the government sealed a “tariff-free” trade deal on Christmas Eve, it has emerged that food and clothing products that do not qualify as made in Britain could be hit with levies.
Under the agreement, if more than 40% of the pre-finished value of a UK firm’s product was not British, it would attract tariffs. Boris Johnson was said to have swerved the topic of Brexit impact in a call with more than 200 business leaders earlier this week. “It was a meaningless call, it was all mottoes – we are going to build back business better, build back business greener – and a few patsy questions about how much better it would be, nothing about the realities of Brexit and Covid hitting us all hard,” said one business leader. The department store chains Debenhams and John Lewis, which recently closed its international business, are among the big names no longer serving the Irish market. Fortnum & Mason, the famous London department store, has also temporarily ceased shipping to Northern Ireland and EU countries. The bookseller Waterstones has also suspended sales to customers in EU countries, as has the fashion chain Jigsaw. Retailers have been hit by the cost of customs paperwork that applies to all imports and exports, including goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. M&S has temporarily cut nearly 400 products from the food and drink aisles of its 20 stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury’s has made a similar move and filled the gaps on its shelves with products from Spar shops. The moves are designed to simplify the business and so avoid the delays at the border amid reports of retailers having trucks turned back. The reduction of M&S’s range equates to about 5% of the 6,500 products usually sold in M&S food halls and includes popular ready-meals such as lasagne and beef bourguignon, as well as takeaway salads and some essential lines such as bread, sugar and teabags. A spokesperson for M&S said it had served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and its priority was to provide the “same choice … our loyal customers have always enjoyed”. Its stores had been receiving regular deliveries this week but the changes came as it moved over to new processes, he said. M&S has also warned that more than 2,000 of its food products, including Percy Pigs, could attract new import taxes when re-exported to its stores in EU countries such as Ireland and France. The new “rules of origin” regulations dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. The M&S chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print. For big businesses there will be time-consuming workarounds but for a lot of others this means paying tariffs or rebasing into the EU.” Tesco said it had experienced short delays moving goods into Northern Ireland but that it had a “good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland”. It added: “There has been a short delay on certain products but we’re working with suppliers to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can.” Tesco said it was discussing the rules of origin regulations with HMRC and Irish Revenue and hoped “to find a satisfactory resolution as quickly as possible”. The British Retail Consortium said: “At least 50 of our members, all of them large retailers, face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU.” Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said some product-specific rules meant exports were no longer viable, with “serious challenges for supply chains that span across the UK and EU”. He also said EU-produced food and drink that moved to other EU markets via Great Britain without further manufacturing taking place in Britain faced the payment of full EU tariffs on return to the EU. “As a result, suppliers are being forced to cancel deliveries of products to customers, particular those in Ireland,” he added. One unnamed source for a logistics business spoke of mayhem behind the scenes. He described how one truckload of parcels had to be completely offloaded and relabelled on Thursday night before export to the EU, simply because one line on the code for goods was wrong. He also told of companies hiking charges for invoices to £3.50 a parcel going to Europe, making low-value goods too expensive to export. John Arbon Textiles, a small artisan knitting wool company in Devon, said it had been told by DPD that its spools and balls of fibre would not be accepted in Europe.
“I feel DPD are being cautious, but I have no confidence that I can send anything to my customers in the EU at the moment,” the business’s owner, Juliet Arbon, said. Northern Ireland’s chief vet has said goods arriving in the region, which is now following EU rules for imports, would be destroyed or returned if not compliant after a short grace period. Robert Huey told a Stormont committee that some companies contracted to do the paperwork for hauliers were “overwhelmed” and in one case a staff member had to show a major supermarket how to complete its paperwork."
2021-01-08T17:33:02Z,politics,Politics,Irish politician calls for investigation into Leave.EU's Irish registration,"An Irish politician has called for an investigation into how Leave.EU was able to secure a web address that should have been reserved for European citizens, after it was revealed that the campaign group’s website was registered under the name of an Irish man based in Waterford. Neale Richmond, a teachta dála (member of parliament), has written to ComReg, the Irish communications regulator, calling for the body “to ensure that the company meets all necessary requirements to hold a .eu web domain”. “I am deeply concerned by this move and would like to receive assurances as to whether this move is a legitimate way to retain the web domain following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union,” Richmond’s letter continues.
When contacted by the Guardian, he said: “I see Leave.EU to be an odious organisation with a dubious reputation that spews bile, often directed specifically at Ireland. I am asking for scrutiny of their operations and qualifications.” Alongside his letter, Richmond shared examples of Leave.EU messaging, including tweets calling the former taoiseach Leo Varadkar an “EU lapdog” and “childish”, and dubbing Joe Biden an “Irish nationalist” who “is no friend of Britain”. Sean Power, the Irish businessman whose name appears on Leave.EU’s domain registration, insists he has never heard of the company. “My lawyers are looking into this on my behalf presently and will be in touch as deemed necessary in due course,” said Power, the chief executive of Business Services Group, a Waterford-based company. “I have nothing to do with Leave.EU and never heard of it before yesterday.” Andy Wigmore, head of communications for Leave.EU, asked for comment about both Power’s and Richmond’s claims, replied “Good lol”, with an emoji of a face laughing tears of joy. Under EU law, domain names ending in .eu can be owned only by European citizens, or by businesses and individuals based in Europe. Before Brexit, Wigmore had suggested that Leave.EU was content to lose access to its domain name if the eventual relationship between Britain and the EU did not allow for the name to be kept. But this week, after Britain’s transition period came to an end, domain registration records showed the pro-Brexit campaign group had in fact transferred ownership to a shell company based in Ireland, with Power’s email address listed as the contact. • This article was amended on 12 January 2021 to use the Irish term for a member of the Irish parliament."
2021-01-08T16:14:54Z,politics,Politics,'I'm stuck here': lorry drivers in Calais begin to feel effects of Brexit,"Roger White arrived in France at 2.30pm on Tuesday with a truckload of hard cheese from Somerset. Before Brexit he would have rolled off the Eurotunnel train and carried on up the A16 to Belgium, unloading his wares a few hours later at his ultimate destination in Utrecht. But 24 hours after setting foot on European soil, the 69-year-old driver from Yeovil is still sitting in his cab in the Eurotunnel compound in Calais after being asked to reverse into a special unloading bay at a newly built border control post for sanitary and phytosanitary checks (SPS) checks on food. “I’ve been here since yesterday afternoon and I am stuck here until God knows when. I have to wait until I am cleared to go,” he said.
He knew there was trouble ahead when he drove off the shuttle and the electronic display assigned him the orange lane instead of the green, indicating he would be subjected to an inspection by authorities. “I think they are picking on the English trucks maybe,” he said, as there was nothing wrong with the cheese. “Just missing paperwork.” Until it arrived, he would not be free to go. “I am just waiting here. It is terrible – not good at all,” he said. A driver for 48 years, White remembers what it was like before the single market in 1993 swept away the trade barriers that Brexit has re-erected. “We had customs checks before but it was so well organised on the border,” he remembers. “Everybody is learning as they go. You can do your preparations beforehand but it’s not enough. All of this is new to everyone and unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it. We just have to get used to it,” he said. Eurotunnel traffic is exceptionally low seven days after Brexit with drivers and exporters still avoiding the ports and Channel train services, partly because of pre-Brexit stockpiling and partly because business is conventionally quieter in the first two weeks of the new year. In normal times, 6,000 to 9,000 HGVs cross the Channel each day, but the Department for Transport said just over 2,000 HGVs crossed on 6 January, the day of the Guardian’s visit, with “90%” of those trucks border-ready. It tested 1,081 drivers for Covid that day, with six coming back positive, bringing the number of tests carried out on drivers to 46,563 since the chaos on 23 December.
Just down from White’s truck are another 30 or 40 HGVs also waiting clearance. The French drivers Benjamin Brogniart and Michael Delattre have come from Corby in Northamptonshire with lorries packed with red plastic packaging for industrial batteries. They have been stuck in the lorry park since 8pm the night before. “Brexit, for us, it’s not very good,” said Brogniart. Another French driver, Alexandre Tronet, joins the conversation. “This is what you wanted. You wanted Brexit,” he said. “I got here at 6am,” he added, putting his waiting time so far at six and a half hours. Again he has to wait until the freight owner sends over the correct customs paperwork to authorities stationed at the Eurotunnel border post. “You make the decisions at the last minute. They should have had this ready in the autumn and this would be running properly,” he said.
Eurotunnel said so far Brexit had gone smoothly with the vast majority “fully compliant” with the new trading arrangements, and it was determined to help British exporters get to grips with the system. “Our aim is to have people spend as little time as possible here. Apart from teething problems, everything has gone very smoothly,” said John Keefe, the director of public affairs. “For the few trucks that are stopped, we have our Eurotunnel border service to help them through the process. They meet the drivers on arrival, help them go through the paperwork or inspection and help them gather whatever documents are missing so that they can leave here as soon as possible. They also make sure the drivers, the haulage companies and the traders understand what was missing and what they need to have with them to avoid stopping next time.” These maiden Brexit disruptions offer a glimpse of the potential for delays when traffic levels at Dover and Calais return to normal levels at the end of this month. Eurotunnel said it had been Brexit-ready since March 2019 when it first put the infrastructure now being deployed in place at a cost of £47m.
It already operates an array of controls and checks on those travelling the other way, including safety checks using sniffer dogs. They are deployed on every truck at the “pit stop” inspection point, trained to identify stowaways. The stop now also provides an opportunity to scan drivers’ paperwork for exports into Britain.
On the other side of the channel, the UK has delayed the imposition of Brexit checks for six months: some of the lorry parks are not ready, nor is business, as the Brexit deal was only sealed on Christmas Eve. It has put in place mitigation measures to avert a repeat of the mayhem on Kent roads before Christmas. One of those is the Michael Gove-inspired Kent Access Permit (KAP) – being called the Brexit passport – which is issued electronically to trucks whose suppliers have to testify they have all their paperwork for the Channel crossing in order. The Cabinet Office said 18,000 KAPs had been issued so far and “around 700 lorries have been turned away from the border” with a further 150 fines handed out for non-compliance. “One of our guys was fined £300,” said Delattre. The driver was caught not by police, but when he went to the Ashford HMRC park to get a Covid test, which are now mandatory before boarding either a train or ferry to France."
2021-01-08T15:39:27Z,politics,Politics,Johnson promised tariff-free trade – so why is Brexit reality so different?,"Less than two weeks after Boris Johnson celebrated what he described as his “jumbo” Brexit deal that would guarantee tariff-free trade with the EU, British businesses have found the small print tells a different story. Some EU retailers say they will not sell into Britain because they would have to register in the UK for VAT, while other high street names including Marks & Spencer are finding that those goods not largely made in Britain could indeed be subject to tariffs. Why is this happening? John Lewis says its decision to stop selling into the EU is not related to Brexit but a strategic decision to concentrate its business on the UK. Other businesses, however, have told customers they have suspended exports to the EU or into the UK while they get to grips with the new trading arrangements.
One of the big issues is whether goods sold by retailers into Europe are subject to tariffs. Under the Brexit deal a product will attract tariffs if more than 40% of its pre-finished value is neither of British nor EU origin, from Japan, for example. Big retailers will take time to calculate their exposure to tariffs and some have suspended all sales to the EU while they work out their new cost base. The cost of new paperwork, including customs declarations required on goods being traded in both directions, is another consideration, as is the £150-a-time health certificate require on all consignments of food. What about companies selling into the UK? Because the UK is no longer in the EU-wide VAT system, the government is requiring EU businesses to register for a UK VAT number, charge VAT at the point of sale and hand over the tax to HMRC. The bike parts supplier Dutch Bike Bits said on its website it had been forced by a “ludicrous” policy to stop dealing with UK customers, despite that fact that it had “many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade [with them]”. “The British government has decided to require every company which exports to the UK to apply and collect British taxes on behalf of the British government,” it said. Other companies deciding to stop shipping to individual consumers in the UK include Beer On Web, a Belgian beer specialist; BestSecret, a German designer merchandise site; the Belgian chocolate manufacturer Neuhaus and the Dutch homewares store Hema which has simply closed its UK-facing webshop. Some have said they hope the move will be temporary. The Finland-based outdoor clothing retailer Scandinavian Outdoor said it had halted UK sales but hoped to take orders again once “our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out”. Before Brexit, companies could reconcile VAT payments and charges through an electronic system that worked out which country would benefit from what tax. As of 1 January, the EU no longer validates UK VAT numbers so British VAT must be collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation. It means EU companies abroad must register for UK VAT and account for it if the product is valued at less than £135. Which retailers are affected? The British Retail Consortium says that at least 50 of its members face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU. Marks & Spencer has said about one-third of its food lines are subject to complex rules of origin regulations including Percy Pigs sweets, which could attract tariffs if re-exported to places like Ireland and France. Debenhams has closed its online business in Ireland for similar reasons. North Face, the outdoor clothing company, has also put a notice on its website that “due to customs clearance issues caused by Brexit, the shipment of orders to Northern Ireland are suspended from December 28 until further notice”.
What is happening at ports? Dover and Folkestone, the gateway to Europe, are relatively quiet, partly because of pre-Christmas Brexit stockpiling by importers but also because large retailers have temporarily suspended exports. Holyhead, the UK’s second-largest ferry port, has also experienced a decline in trade as British businesses struggle to get to grips with Brexit rules. On Thursday night Ireland’s revenue commissioners announced they were easing the rules for traders to try and get traffic flowing again. There have also been complaints that trucks are being stuck in Dublin port while checks are being conducted. When will things improve? It will takes weeks and months for British businesses to assess the impact of the new rules. The government was so concerned about lack of Brexit readiness it decided to phase in the new controls on the British side over six months, an indication of how long it expects disruption to last."
2021-01-08T10:44:14Z,politics,Politics,Bookcase diplomacy: Grant Shapps' shelves flatter new US counterpart,"The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has apparently used his bookshelves to flatter the incoming Biden administration in the US, while condemning Donald Trump for encouraging the storming of the Capitol building. During a round of broadcast interviews on Friday morning, Shapps was seen with a copy of a memoir by Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden’s nominee for transportation secretary, placed behind his head as he gave video interviews from home.
In an interview with Sky News, he condemned the violence in Washington as “despicable” and said it was “inescapable that people were encouraged to go a march on the Capitol building”. Shapps’s comments and his backdrop of the memoir, Shortest Way Home, come only months after he declined to condemn Trump for suggesting people should inject themselves with bleach to protect themselves from Covid. They also underline how quickly senior Conservatives have moved from praising Trump to condemning him. Shapps stopped short of calling for Trump to be impeached as Democratic leaders in the US have demanded. He said: “What happened completely dishonours democracy and was just despicable to see those people encouraged to go to the Capitol building and to ransack it like that. I think we can very fairly leave it to the Americans to work out what they should do next, that’s their call clearly.” He added: “It’s not for me interfere in American politics any more than I expect an American president or politician to do in the UK.” Shapps’ bookshelves have drawn attention before, having previously featured union flags, a ministerial red box and face-up covers of books with titles including Getting Inside People’s Heads and How to be Nice to People."
2021-01-07T18:40:28Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: hospital numbers in east and south-east England more than double first wave peak – as it happened,"A national booking service for vaccine appointments in England will be launched to help hit ambitious targets, Boris Johnson has said, as he pledged to immunise every elderly care home resident by the end of the month. As Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart report, the prime minister said everyone would be able to get a vaccination within 10 miles of their home and that GP-led vaccine sites providing jabs would increase to more than 1,000 by the end of next week, and hospital sites to 223, delivering hundreds of thousands of vaccines a day by 15 January.
Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has said the health service is facing an â€œincredibly serious situationâ€�. Speaking at a No 10 press conference alongside the PM, Stevens said there were 50% more Covid patients in hospital now than at the peak of the first wave. And numbers were â€œaccelerating very, very rapidly,â€� he said. He went on: Weâ€™ve seen an increase of 10,000 hospitalised coronavirus patients, just since Christmas Day. Thatâ€™s the equivalent of filling 20 acute hospitals with extra coronavirus patients ... And that is, of course, all happening at what is traditionally the busiest time of year for hospitals and the wider NHS. The UK has recorded 1,162 further coronavirus deaths - the second highest daily total on this measure. (See 4.51pm.) Boris Johnson has said Donald Trump was â€œcompletely wrongâ€� to cast doubt on the result of the US presidential election and encourage his supporters to storm the Capitol. In his most critical comments as PM about Trump, a pro-Brexit ally who once boasted about Johnson being a British version of himself, Johnson said: Insofar as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol and insofar as the president consistently has cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election I believe that that was completely wrong. I think what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong. I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol. And all I can say is Iâ€™m very pleased that the president-elect has now been duly confirmed in office and that democracy has prevailed. A third Covid vaccine is likely to be approved for use in Britain next week but it will not be available until April because the UK is no longer part of the EU. Homelessness campaigners have demanded an urgent reboot of the governmentâ€™s â€œEverybody Inâ€� scheme to provide safe shelter for thousands of rough sleepers as the UK enters another lockdown, with winter temperatures expected to plummet. The founder of Clap For Our Carers and Clap For Heroes has distanced herself from tonightâ€™s event after getting abuse and threats from â€œa hateful few on social media channelsâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-07T17:12:21Z,politics,Politics,Leave. EU leaves Britain after Brexit,"Leave.EU has left the UK, as Brexit forced the Eurosceptic campaign group to choose between its name and its country. According to domain name registration records, the organisation, founded by businessman and activist Arron Banks, picked the former. The website is now registered in the name of Sean Power, the chief executive of the Ireland-based professional services company BSG. When asked, however, Power, who is based in Waterford, insisted that he had no involvement with the organisation. When informed that his name and contact details were present on the registration, he said he would be “looking into the matter”. Leave.EU has had some time to consider its move. The organisation is named after its web address, but .EU domain names can only be held by businesses or individuals based in the EU or wider European Economic Area. As the Brexit transition period drew to an end in 2019, the British owners of .EU domain names – of which there were estimated to be about 340,000 – started to express alarm that no deal had been made, meaning that they would have to give up their websites when Britain left the EU. Initially, Leave.EU suggested it was fine with that outcome. “If we leave with no deal our job is done,” Leave.EU’s communications chief, Andy Wigmore, told the Guardian in 2019. “No need for Leave.EU any more. Cheers all round, I’m sure!” But in July that year, the EU threw a lifeline to organisations, confirming that UK-based owners of .EU domains could continue to operate – provided the actual registration was transferred to an EU citizen.
For companies which did not take that step, it is not too late to follow Leave.EU’s lead. According to UK government advice: “On 1 January 2021, any UK registrant who cannot meet the eligibility criteria will have their .eu domain names withdrawn. A withdrawn domain name no longer functions … and can no longer support any active services (such as websites or email). “Withdrawn domain names will not be available to any other entity for a further 12 months. On 1 January 2022, all the withdrawn domain names will be revoked and made available for registration by other entities.” But a grace period, lasting until 31 March this year, allows registrants to transfer suspended domain names to an EU-based owner, or any person with EU citizenship."
2021-01-07T12:42:43Z,politics,Politics,Lawyer calling for Dominic Cummings investigation forced to move after attacks on home,"The former regional chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal has revealed he was forced to move house after his campaign for an investigation into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings apparently prompted attacks on his property. In June, a week after Afzal became the figurehead in a legal campaign to prosecute the prime minister’s former chief aide, a brick was thrown through the window of his family home in Manchester, he told the Guardian. The following month his car was “slashed” outside the home after he announced he had urged the Metropolitan police and Crown Prosecution Service to investigate Cummings’ journeys to Durham and Barnard Castle. Afzal said: “My family felt scared. I don’t blame Dominic Cummings. All I know is that in 25 years prosecuting some of the most organised criminals in the country, nobody has attacked my home. Yet suddenly someone starting attacking me and my family and we’ve had to move house. “There’s always a personal cost to standing up [for] what’s right. In 2006 I was on an al-Qaida death list after I prosecuted Danish cartoon protesters, and in 2012 the far right demonstrated outside my house after the Rochdale grooming gang case. I accept that people will attack me personally, but I draw the line when my family is involved.” Afzal said he would not be intimidated. “It has made me more committed to delivering justice, not just in the Cummings case, but for anybody for feels they are not being listened to. More than 3,000 people have crowdfunded the campaign to get Cummings prosecuted, and thousands more have messaged me to say ‘you’re doing this for me’. This is about restoring trust.” Cummings, who resigned from the government in November after an internal power struggle, denies his movements during the first lockdown amounted to a breach of the Covid regulations. In December, Durham police revealed it was assessing a 225-page dossier submitted by Afzal and his lawyers, alleging Cummings breached the lockdown rules multiple times and perverted the course of justice in his account of his movements.
Afzal says the documents gave Durham police a “second bite of the cherry” after the force decided to take no further action against Cummings following a three-day investigation in May. “I suspect they are now carrying out a much more thorough investigation than the very cursory one back in May. Durham police now has the opportunity to restore public confidence in them,” he said. “I know for a fact that senior police officers feel it has set back public confidence in policing. And the evidence says that public compliance with the rules has diminished as a result of Cummings’ behaviour.” Afzal, a former senior prosecutor for London and the chief prosecutor for north-west England until 2015, said: “If this was the prosecution service I was part of, I have no doubt they would say there is a case to answer. My concern is that we may not have as robust and courageous a prosecution service as we had in the past.” If Durham police and the CPS decide not to prosecute, Afzal says he would have the financial backing to pursue the case himself. “I could prosecute the perverting the course of justice allegation as a private prosecution. I have been approached by philanthropists who like many are deeply concerned by what happened and are prepared to pay for any legal action that might follow, but it should be the state taking the responsibility.” Afzal said he feels “angry and emboldened” by the events of 2020. His older brother Umar died of coronavirus in April while isolating at home in Birmingham. Weeks later, his mother died of a “broken heart”, he said. He added: “My brother would not be dead if the government hadn’t stopped community testing on 12 March.” Afzal, who is currently suffering from Covid himself, also offered to meet Boris Johnson on behalf of the families bereaved by the virus. “I think he desperately needs to hear the voices of the bereaved. I would bring along others who have suffered similarly. The prime minister would benefit tremendously from hearing from us – he would be more decisive and listen to the scientists and medics more.”
If Johnson agreed to a meeting, Afzal says he would volunteer to act as a US-style special prosecutor to investigate the UK’s response to the Covid crisis. Such an investigation would help restore public confidence much quicker than a public inquiry, he said. “It could be 10 years before we get the results of any public inquiry, but we need answers now. I would say to the prime minister: ‘Give me the legal powers and I will be your special prosecutor on the response to Covid. It’s important you do this, prime minister, because public confidence and trust is at an all-time low.’” In April, a paperback version of Afzal’s book The Prosecutor will be published with a new chapter on the death of his brother and the Cummings affair."
2021-01-07T12:28:26Z,politics,Politics,"Williamson wrong to force universities to abide by antisemitism definition, say lawyers","A group of eminent lawyers, including two former appeal court judges, has accused Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, of “improper interference” with universities’ autonomy and right to free expression. They say that Williamson’s insistence that universities adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism or face sanctions is “legally and morally wrong”. Their statement comes amid some academic resistance to Williamson’s letter to university vice-chancellors in October, in which he warned: “If I haven’t seen the overwhelming majority of institutions adopting the [IHRA] definition by Christmas, then I will act.” Academics at University College London are due to vote this month on whether to call on the institution’s governing body to rescind its November 2019 adoption of the IHRA definition. Some are arguing it stifles free speech on Israel. Oxford and Cambridge are among universities that have adopted the IHRA definition in recent weeks. The Department for Education said at least 27 institutions have adopted the definition since Williamson’s letter.
According to a tally by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), a total of 48 out of 133 have now adopted the definition, including the vast majority of universities in the elite Russell Group. The UJC said those institutions reluctant to follow suit were showing “contempt … for their Jewish students.” However, the lawyers’ letter, published by the Guardian, says: “The legally entrenched right to free expression is being undermined by the promotion of an internally incoherent ‘non-legally binding working definition’ of antisemitism. Its promotion by public bodies is leading to the curtailment of debate. Universities and others who reject the instruction … to adopt it should be supported in so doing.” It cites the Universal Declaration of Human Rights regarding freedom of expression, which is embodied in UK law by the 1998 Human Rights Act. Williamson was “legally and morally wrong in October to instruct English universities to adopt and implement” the IHRA definition of antisemitism. His threat of sanctions “would be an improper interference with their autonomy”. The letter adds: “The impact on public discourse both inside and outside universities has already been significant.” Among its eight signatories are Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Stephen Sedley, both retired lord justices of appeal. Academic opposition to wholesale adoption of the IHRA definition centres on freedom of expression and in particular whether criticism of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people would be inhibited. The IHRA definition is only 40 words long. It says: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” But it is accompanied by 11 illustrative examples, of which seven relate to Israel. According to the report of a working group set up by UCL’s academic board, the definition and examples “disproportionately draw debate over Israel and Palestine into conversations around antisemitism, potentially conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism … thereby … risking the suppression of legitimate speech and academic research.” The report says the definition has no legal basis, and there is already a “large body of existing UK law and coherent UCL policies that instead should be used as the basis of any institutional mechanism to combat antisemitism”. Universities have “an express statutory obligation to protect freedom of speech within the law”, the report says. As an educative tool, the definition “may indeed have potential value, but that would have to be balanced against potentially deleterious effects on free speech, such as instigating a culture of fear or self-silencing on teaching or research or classroom discussion of contentious topics”. The report says: “The ability to have uncomfortable conversations or feel challenged by clashing ideas lies at the heart of the mission of higher education. There are times when we need to clarify and illuminate these tensions, rather than rush to meet the demands of vocal critics who may misrepresent these instances as acts of discrimination, if we are to uphold the values of university life.” While acknowledging “disturbing evidence that incidents of antisemitism have persisted in our university”, the report recommends UCL’s governing body retract its adoption of the IHRA definition and “consider more coherent alternatives”. Academics at UCL were due to vote on the report’s recommendations before Christmas, but decided to extend debate into the new year because of the level of interest. One critic of the report, Harry Goldstein, claimed its arguments give credence to “precisely the conspiracy theories that are central to classical antisemitism. It must all be a plot to silence criticism of Israel.” In a blogpost, Goldstein – who describes himself as a liberal centre-left supporter of Israel – said the report blurred the distinction between criticism of Israel and anti-Zionism, used tendentious language, and failed to “understand the distinctive nature of antisemitism compared to other racisms”. Dave Rich, the head of policy at the Community Security Trust (CST), which advises the UK Jewish community on security issues, said the academic argument over definitions of antisemitism “loses sight of what really matters: the welfare and safety of Jewish students at British universities”. A CST report, Campus Antisemitism in Britain 2018-20, recorded a total of 123 antisemitic incidents involving students in 34 towns and cities over the two-year period. “Far too many Jewish students do experience prejudice or bigotry, whether on campus, off campus and online. This included antisemitism from the far left, merging their hatred of Israel with suspicion of any Jews who disagree with them,” Rich wrote last month. James Harris, the president of the UJS, said the continuing battle over the IHRA definition was “unacceptable”. He added: “We have seen multiple examples of anti-Jewish racism being dismissed by universities who consistently refuse to adopt this definition. When the definition is not used, it gives the power to those investigating to arbitrarily determine what they believe constitutes antisemitism. “The IHRA definition is a cornerstone in ensuring that antisemitism, when reported, is dealt with in a way which Jewish students can be confident in.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government expects institutions to take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism, with robust measures in place to address issues when they arise.”"
2021-01-07T12:28:24Z,politics,Politics,Tories urged to suspend politicians who likened US violence to anti-Brexit protests,"The Conservatives are to investigate two senior Tory figures who equated the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump with people opposing Brexit, after complaints from Labour. The party is to look into tweets sent by Susan Hall, the Tory group leader on the London assembly, and Andrew RT Davies, formerly leader of the Welsh Conservatives. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader and party chair, wrote to Amanda Milling, who chairs the Conservative party, to say she was “deeply concerned” at the comments. Davies, who is a member of the Senedd Cymru and shadow minister for health, responded to a tweet by Keir Starmer condemning the scenes in Washington by noting the Labour leader’s former support for a second Brexit referendum. Davies wrote: “To be honest I’m not sure you’re in the strongest position right now given you campaigned to overturn democracy and the will of the British people.” In her tweet, Hall said she was “flabbergasted at the amount of remainers screaming on Twitter that Trump voters should respect democracy – err, hellooo – pot – kettle spring to mind!” Hall later apparently deleted the tweet, but sent another tweet calling the Green MP Caroline Lucas, another supporter of a second Brexit vote, a “hypocrite” for condemning the violent Trump supporters. Milling is to write to Hall and Davies to warn them about the consequences of such language. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “The scenes in Washington last night were disgraceful and unacceptable. We totally condemn them. We are investigating these comments.” In her letter to Milling, Rayner wrote: “I am deeply concerned that two Conservative elected representatives have equated democratic debate in the UK with an armed, violent and fundamentally anti-democratic assault on the US legislature, during which people lost their lives. “These statements are absolutely unacceptable, extremely dangerous and must not be allowed to stand. “To equate peaceful democratic debate in the UK with deadly violence in the USA validates the violence that we have seen in Washington DC, serves to legitimise and incite violence in our own country and undermines our democracy and democratic processes.” Rayner said she hoped Milling would condemn the comments, begin an inquiry, suspend Hall and Davies from the party, and “ensure that they are not able to stand as Conservative candidates in the May elections”. Boris Johnson and senior Conservative ministers have vigorously condemned the violence in Washington, but have largely steered clear of condemning Trump for fomenting it. As well as making repeated, baseless claims that the November presidential election was “stolen” from him due to fraud, Trump addressed the protest crowd in Washington shortly before it stormed the Capitol. In a tweet on Wednesday night, Johnson said: “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.” In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Rayner called Johnson “spineless”, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, “toadying”, saying both “have to also take their fair share of shame for not calling out his lies after the election”."
2021-01-07T10:15:43Z,politics,Politics,Customers in Europe hit by post-Brexit charges when buying from UK,"Customers in Europe buying products ranging from furniture to pet food from UK companies are receiving unexpected bills for VAT and customs declarations or finding household names have stopped shipping to the continent, as post-Brexit trading rules bite. “We bought a €47 [£42] shelf from Next for our bathroom,” said Thom Basely, who lives in Marseille. “On the morning it was supposed to be delivered we received an ‘import duty/tax’ demand for over €30, like a ransom note. It came as a complete surprise.” A Frankfurt resident who ordered cycle clothing from a UK company was sent a tax and customs demand for €102, while a woman in the Netherlands who bought trousers in December “with no issues” faced a €40 bill for two more pairs ordered in January. Chris Hickson, a retired logistics and freight forwarding expert living in France, said many people may have been surprised because “they believed the tariff-free trade deal negotiated between the UK and EU meant there would be no extra charges”. Since the end of the Brexit transition period, however, continental customers must both complete a customs declaration for goods imported from the UK – a procedure generally performed by transporters, for which consumers will be charged, frequently up to €20 per declaration – and pay national VAT. Other European customers have been informed that such iconic British retailers as the luxury food store Fortnum & Mason were unfortunately “unable to send any products to European countries at this current time, due to Brexit restrictions”.
Customers of the department store chain John Lewis, also popular with British citizens living in the EU, who value its “never knowingly undersold” price match guarantee and reliable customer service, have also been disappointed. Until December, the retailer offered EU delivery for many items on sale through its website, including clothes. But anyone requesting shipping to Europe is now greeted by a page stating: “We are no longer taking orders for international delivery.” Some retailers, such as George at Asda, have promised no additional charges, but several international platforms including Asos have halted deliveries to Europe from their UK sites, instead directing buyers to national versions in, for example, France. David Martin, who lives in the Creuse region in central France, said he switched his regular order for dog food from the pet supplies company Zooplus to its Irish site after being told the UK platform was no longer accepting orders from the continent.
An “import fees deposit”, meanwhile, is now automatically added to orders from continental Europe placed via Amazon’s UK website, nearly doubling the cost of some items and making it significantly cheaper to find an EU alternative. Hickson said fees for customs declarations were usually collected by the international shipping companies, such as DHL or UPS, responsible for transporting the goods, with customers notified of the charge – and obliged to pay – before delivery. “Many vendors are not yet aware that this is the case, or if they are may not be able to say in advance what the bill will be,” he said. “VAT will depend on the category of goods and their value.” Despite the tariff-free deal, customs duties will apply to goods ordered from the UK that do not originate from Britain. Goods ordered from and manufactured in the UK should not attract customs duty, but products ordered from the UK worth more than that €150 and shipped from outside Britain will. A leading French consumer website cited the example of a pair of trainers ordered from a UK website for £270 but manufactured in and shipped from China, saying customs duty of 16.9% and 20% French VAT would bring their cost to about £378. And while continental buyers are no longer charged British VAT on UK purchases, they must now pay local VAT in their country of residence - although this is waived for orders under €22 until 31 July. Platforms such as Amazon are entitled to collect continental VAT on orders worth less than €150. “It’s a hugely complex situation,” Hickson said. “My recommendation to anyone in the EU looking to buy goods in the UK is: don’t order anything until you know what the charges and VAT will be. And be patient. This should all sort itself out eventually, but it’s going to take some time.”"
2021-01-07T09:30:54Z,politics,Politics,Labour MP Jo Stevens thanks 'exceptional' NHS staff for Covid care,"The Labour MP Jo Stevens has expressed her gratitude to the NHS staff who cared for her after she returned home following treatment in hospital for coronavirus. Stevens said she “cannot begin to describe my gratitude to the wonderful people who have cared for me in hospital” and described healthcare workers as “truly exceptional”, in a tweet sent late on Wednesday night. She described how lucky she felt to have been discharged from hospital, saying she knew that for many families it was a “very different situation”. Her discharge comes in a critical week for hospitals, as figures show more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the previous 24 hours from the virus.
The MP for Cardiff Central was said on New Year’s Eve to have been “laid low with Covid for a while”. Three days later, her team announced she had been admitted to hospital, triggering an outpouring of support. Her team tweeted on Tuesday that her condition was improving, writing: “She has asked us to thank you all for your kind concern and good wishes which have been overwhelming.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, expressed pleasure that his shadow culture secretary had returned home in a tweet on Wednesday evening. He also thanked the NHS.
Stevens, 54, is the fourth MP known to have been treated in hospital with Covid. Along with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who was admitted to intensive care in April, the Labour MPs Yasmin Qureshi and Tony Lloyd were also admitted to hospital. Lloyd spent 10 days on a ventilator in an induced coma."

2021-01-06T18:56:52Z,politics,Politics,Safe but unsafe: Boris introduces MPs to Schrödinger’s schools | John Crace,"It’s getting to be a habit. Last week parliament was recalled to pass the EU trade agreement. This week it was recalled to allow the government’s third national lockdown to be retrospectively rubber-stamped. From this, you might imagine that the government either leaves important legislation until the last possible minute or doesn’t really have much of a clue what it will be doing from one day to the next. And you wouldn’t be wrong on either account. A recall suggests high drama. The reality was the precise opposite. A general sense of existential ennui until the proceedings reached the conclusion that everyone knew was inevitable. But parliamentary formalities must be observed, so the day kicked off with Boris Johnson giving a statement in which he basically cut and pasted paragraphs of Monday night’s TV address along with a few from Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference. The new coronavirus variant had forced his hand, he began. If rather later than many scientists had wanted, given he had known about the variant for weeks. So he was planning on locking down the country until at least 22 February, even though the regulations gave him the leeway to keep the UK shut down until the end of March. No one wanted to close schools, he continued, before insisting schools were still safe, even though he was closing them. This caused some puzzlement on both sets of benches. We were now in the realm of Schrödinger’s schools. Both safe and unsafe. Unless what he was trying to say was that the schools themselves were safe: it was just the pupils and the teachers in them who weren’t. But not to worry, because this time round we had a way out of the pandemic, with 14m doses of the vaccine being administered to the most vulnerable individuals by the middle of February. He was rather short on detail on the logistics of this. But then, Johnson has often relied on a wing and a prayer. In reply, Keir Starmer’s only regret was that the government hadn’t acted earlier, as he himself had suggested. The Captain Hindsight, as the prime minister used to call the Labour leader, has morphed into Captain Foresight. But to be fair, most of the country has been consistently ahead of the government on when further restrictions are needed. Keir breezed through a shortlist of the government’s failures over that past 10 months but even he sounded as if he was on autopilot, with the expression of someone who knew he was basically talking to himself. MPs had been advised to stay away from parliament – for their own sanity as much as their health – and to contribute remotely, but only Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems appeared to have taken the guidance seriously. While the opposition benches were near enough empty, the Tory benches were almost full with MPs who had made a special effort to travel into Westminster to say just how dangerous such travel had become and, though they regretted the measures and would like regular votes between now and March on keeping the restrictions in place, they accepted the need for them at present. The lone dissenter was Desmond Swayne, who described the loss of liberty as “pettifogging malice” – someone needs to let him know the daily Covid death total had just passed 1,000 for the first time since April – but Boris dealt with him easily enough. In fact, by the end Johnson was looking quite chipper. So much so, that he began to overpromise yet again, virtually assuring the house that schools would reopen and life would be more normal next month. After a few days under the cosh, Boris the crowdpleaser was back. Even if it was in reduced circumstances. Still, that statement proved to be the day’s highpoint compared with what followed – a statement from the hapless education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on why there was no inconsistency between him saying last week that exams were still on and schools would remain open and this week announcing the opposite.
It was all a far cry from those heady days of 2006 when he won fireplace salesman of the year at the St Albans Travelodge. Back then he had been a somebody. A man going places. Now he’s just a third-rate politician, in a job from which he can’t be sacked because he’s fucked it up so badly that his successor would inevitably also have to resign from the fallout of Gav’s incompetence. So he can do nothing but muddle on, each day making a bad situation worse. His tragedy is that, deep down, he knows he’s useless. His confidence is shot, his self-worth at rock bottom. Only the last vestiges of ego remain. He’s condemned to being the worst education secretary of all time but is powerless to do anything about it. Even the most loyal and unctuous Tory MPs have had it with Williamson. One by one they pointedly failed to congratulate him on a job well done and pointed out his failings, over exams, laptops, everything really. He used to be the cabinet’s Private Pike but that has long since become a gross insult to the Dad’s Army character. “I never wanted to be in this position,” he sobbed. And for the first time, he had most of the country on his side. Because there is no one who values education who wishes he was in his current position either. His only value – apart from satisfying Johnson’s bullying tendencies – is to make the other cabinet deadbeats look not quite so bad. It’s life, Gav, but not as we know it."
2021-01-06T18:54:44Z,politics,Politics,"'Inept, careless, tribal': Calls grow for Gavin Williamson to go","“The most incompetent, ineffectual and inept education secretary in living memory.” Such was the Yorkshire Post’s verdict this week on one of the county’s own sons, Scarborough-born Gavin Williamson, in a blunt editorial calling for him to resign or be sacked. A Times leader was similarly damning. “Mr Williamson, by far the worst performer in an underpowered cabinet, already looks to have sacrificed his own future in government. Britain cannot afford for him to be so careless with the future of its children.” Early on Wednesday morning, the education secretary cut a forlorn figure as he made his way into the Department for Education (DfE), to shouts from a Sky TV crew asking if he was going to resign. His appearance before MPs in the Commons later the same day to explain the latest of a catalogue of delayed decisions, disastrous climbdowns and humiliating U-turns, will have done little to bolster his shattered reputation.
And it could all have been so different. When Williamson took up the post in 2019, his arrival at the DfE coincided with a much-needed boost to schools spending, a new levelling-up agenda and a fresh commitment to further education and vocational and technical qualifications. Then the Covid pandemic hit, and though there was initially some sympathy for a secretary of state who found himself facing unprecedented challenges, that swiftly dissipated. The U-turns have come thick and fast, from exams and exam results, to free school meals, BTecs and failed school openings, to the point where the education secretary is routinely likened to the pathetic TV comic character Frank Spencer, of the 70s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. Even the most moderate of headteachers and sector leaders have become increasingly exasperated with his leadership, among them Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “We would all acknowledge he has been dealt a difficult hand,” he said, “but equally so have the people I’ve been representing.” He awarded him a C+ for effort and a U for achievement. “The most important ingredient in leadership is to be able to take people with you.” Too often, said Barton, the unions have been seen as part of the problem, rather than part of the solution.
“The frustrating thing with Gavin Williamson is too often there’s a tribal political outlook and this is probably not the best time to be tribal.” Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, and an outspoken critic of Williamson, said: “He has never got on top of the brief. I always have a lot of sympathy for a secretary of state for education because it’s a huge area. It’s highly complex with a lot of technical issues. “I’ve spent 40 years in education so I should know about it. But what you can expect a secretary of state to do is to do the homework, to do a lot of learning, to master the brief. He just never has. “In a crisis like the pandemic, you are not going to get everything right. But it’s really important to get the key decisions as right as possible.” She also complained that Williamson had been too concerned with ideology, rather than the impact on the ground in schools, among teachers and parents. The decision to take legal action to force schools in Covid hotspots to remain open, and to insist that 3 million children should return to primary school this week, literally hours before the prime minister announced a national lockdown including schools, were among his worst errors, Bousted said. Williamson’s cast-iron guarantee just last month that exams would take place this summer has resulted in yet more egg on his face. The only possible explanation for his continuing leadership at the DfE, according to one critic, is that he is a useful “fall guy” to take the flak for the prime minister.
“Williamson’s skill, if it is a skill, is making people lose the will to live,” said one former colleague who asked to remain anonymous. “He drains energy from everyone and everything around him. He’s a vacuum, a black hole, a void.” Former Labour education secretary Estelle Morris knows a thing or two about the challenges of the job, and when to resign. Almost two decades ago, after just a year in the post, she handed in her resignation saying she didn’t feel she had done a good enough job, a rare instance of political mea culpa. Gavin Williamson may have lost the trust of heads, teachers and parents, but she says resignation is not always the answer, despite a minister’s shortcomings. Instead, she suggested others with expertise should be drafted in to support and help rebuild trust and confidence in the department. “To be a really successful secretary of state for education you’ve got to be both political and educational. But Gavin Williamson is almost all about politics. I’m not saying he doesn’t care what happens to kids. “But the thread running through is that every time he has been asked to make a decision, he has had his eye on the political, rather than the educational impact. “I never call for resignations. We are in such a dire position that we need a better debate. Something needs to change, but I know what it takes for a department to adjust to new leadership and resignation is not always the right answer.”"
2021-01-06T17:15:12Z,politics,Politics,Johnson: no Covid vaccine in Scotland if it were up to SNP,"Boris Johnson has taken a swipe at the Scottish National party by claiming that there would not have been a single Covid-19 vaccine in Scotland if it were up to Nicola Sturgeon’s party, the Guardian understands. Addressing a virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs on Tuesday evening before Wednesday’s Commons vote on the third national lockdown in England, the prime minister highlighted the threat of the new Covid variant, but is also said to have criticised Scotland’s ruling party. Johnson tackled a series of questions from backbenchers on the Zoom call, including one from a Scottish Tory MP about the SNP, the answer to which took aim at the pro-independence party. The prime minister is understood to have said that the strength of the union lay in what could be done for people across the UK, claiming that if it were up to the SNP, no coronavirus vaccines would have been delivered in Scotland. One MP who attended the virtual meeting said: “Essentially, the point the prime minister was making is that the UK is a major country, we’ve got sufficient clout to get the vaccines rolled out. He did actually mention that we were ahead of the rest of Europe. “He said if it were up to the SNP, then there wouldn’t have been a single vaccine delivered in Scotland. It was a UK effort, in other words, and needed the clout of a big government.”
Asked about Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, the prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said she had not been present at the 1922 meeting. But she said: “In terms of the broader point about the vaccine, there’s no doubt that the union’s been critical in the development, production and administration of the vaccine, and indeed across a range of measures. The UK governments during this pandemic have all worked together to provide for the British people. “I think on Monday Nicola Sturgeon said they have 100,000 vaccines in Scotland. It’s great news for the Scottish people, but it’s been a collective effort.” Responding to Johnson’s remarks, an SNP spokesperson said on Wednesday: “These comments are as crass as they are inaccurate and show once again how desperate the Tories are to politicise the pandemic. The development of vaccines has been a global effort and our focus is on ensuring we vaccinate people in Scotland as quickly and as safely as it is possible to do so.” The first doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine began to be administered in the UK on Monday, after the jab received approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) last month. It is the second vaccine to be approved by the regulator in the UK, following the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. According to the government, through the vaccines taskforce the UK “secured early access” to 357m doses of the seven “most promising” vaccine candidates. That includes the Oxford/AstraZeneca and BioNTech/Pfizer jabs.
Vaccination is being managed separately by health services in each UK nation, including NHS Scotland. Johnson’s comments follow Sturgeon saying that Scotland had acted “much earlier” to get the latest Covid wave under control compared with Johnson’s government in London. Speaking during a coronavirus press briefing earlier on Tuesday, Scotland’s first minister made the claim as she sought to defend her decision to close places of worship, which remain open in England. “It is one of the points of difference between Scotland and the UK, but so is the fact we decided to act much earlier in the curve of this wave of the pandemic to get it under control,” Sturgeon said. “We are trying to act as cautiously as we can at the moment to stop this situation deteriorating any further.” On Sunday, Johnson reiterated his position that a Scottish independence referendum should be a “once-in-a-generation” vote. The prime minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Referendums in my experience, direct experience, in this country are not particularly jolly events. They don’t have a notably unifying force in the national mood. They should be only once in a generation.” In November, Johnson triggered an angry reaction from politicians across the spectrum after he dismissed devolution as “a disaster north of the border”. During a Zoom call with about 60 northern Conservative MPs, the prime minister described devolution as “Tony Blair’s biggest mistake”.
Responding to questions from the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, on Wednesday after his Commons statement on the lockdown, Johnson said “every part of the United Kingdom” had received the vaccine “thanks to our national NHS”. He added: “It is thanks to our United Kingdom NHS, thanks to the strength of UK companies, that we are able to distribute a life-saving vaccine across the whole of our country, and I think that is a point that he might bear in mind.”"
2021-01-06T16:02:59Z,politics,Politics,Councillors vote to review plans for £100k unveiling of Thatcher statue in Grantham,"Councillors in Margaret Thatcher’s home town have voted for plans to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony for a statue of the former prime minister to be reviewed. South Kesteven district council’s cabinet had previously agreed to allocate funding for the event, due to be held in Grantham, Lincolnshire, this year, in the anticipation that they would be able to recoup the money in donations. But the council’s culture and visitor economy overview and scrutiny committee has voted in favour of asking the cabinet to review the decision and provide additional information on the event’s costs. Paul Fellows, an independent councillor and member of the committee, put forward the motion for the cabinet’s decision to be further scrutinised. He said: “As a scrutiny committee our decision was to look at the procedure process. It was not about whether or not we should have the statue. That decision had already been made and agreed through the planning committee.” Fellows had raised doubts about whether the cabinet had followed the correct procedures, and put forward a successful motion for the cabinet to “come up with some justification for why they think that that is a reasonable decision to make”. Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), which runs the Grantham Museum, and South Kesteven district council worked with the Public Memorials Appeal to draft a planning application for the statue, which was approved in 2019. The bronze statue, at 10.5ft (3.2 metres), was offered to the district council after proposals to erect it in Parliament Square, in central London, were rejected by Westminster council in 2018 as councillors feared it would be attract protests.
The statue has been paid for by the Public Memorials Trust, a charity that aims to commission and erect memorials of historically important figures. Money raised by the GCHA Margaret Thatcher Appeal will help deliver the statue. No public funds have been used. The council’s decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony had reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected at all. The Liberal Democrat councillor Amanda Wheeler said: “I think it’s embarrassing that the district council even contemplate spending £100,000. It’s so out of touch with where we are right now as a country.” Wheeler said a recent housing report for Grantham had placed the council into special measures yet it wanted “to blow £100,000 on salmon, caviar, and champagne”. She added: “I can understand the statue being in Grantham, not that I approve of it, nor am I going to challenge that, but under no circumstances should we be having this big celebration party.” At a public meeting to discuss the ceremony – which took place over Skype on Tuesday – members of the public logged in using the names Arthur Scargill and John Major. The Labour councillor Charmaine Morgan, who stepped down as a member of the planning committee in 2019 to speak in opposition to the planned statue, said: “It feels like the council is fiddling while we are burning. They want this big ‘feel good’ event, when thousands of people in our district are struggling to put food on the table. I think they’ve gotten their priorities completely wrong.” Amanda Schonhut, the director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), previously said the issue continued to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini-Brexit,” she said. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the council leader, Kelham Cooke, called it “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to boost tourism and to raise the profile of Grantham”. “Already I have had several expressions of interest to donate towards the cost of the event which is a huge vote of confidence for us,” he said."

2021-01-05T19:22:20Z,politics,Politics,Mother fears son could die as Brexit stops medical cannabis supply,"The mother of a nine-year-old boy with a rare and severe form of epilepsy has told how she fears her son could die after the government announced his supply of a life-changing cannabis medicine from the Netherlands would stop because of Brexit. Hannah Deacon was given just two weeks notice by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) that due to the end of the transition period “prescriptions issued in the UK can no longer be lawfully dispensed in an EU member state”. Her campaign to save her son Alfie Dingley’s life in 2017 led to a change in the law enabling the medicine which has seen him seizure free after years of 150 seizures a week, to be prescribed in the UK. Deacon told the Guardian she is in despair about her child’s future if he cannot get the Bedrolite oil he now takes three times a day. “They [the DHSC] said they understand our concern but they can’t do anything. Well let me tell them, it is not concerning, it is terrifying.” She says she wasn’t even told directly by the DHSC that she would no longer get the drug, something she describes as “galling”. Instead the letter went to pharmacy suppliers around the country who were told to advise on “alternative” prescriptions which would be “clinically appropriate to switch patients on to”.
“I am facing the fact that my son might go into refractory epileptic seizures again which can kill people. That’s how dangerous this is. So to say ‘oh you can swap it for another product, sorry we can’t help’ it is grossly unacceptable. It’s very very dangerous and I’m really frightened about what is going to happen,” she said. “The letter was sent on the 17 December, so we had no time. We’re very lucky that we were able to secure a couple of months worth of medicine. But that is not long. What makes me really angry is the lack of time we have, the lack of empathy, of care. My son is on a medicine that works for him, why would they take that away?,” she said. Neurologist Mike Barnes who led the fight with the Home Office to get Bedrolite prescribed for Alfie accused the DHSC of “an astonishing level of ignorance” to think every cannabis product is the same when there are “147 different cannabinoids” in each plant in addition to terpenes which create very specific medical properties. “Each variety of cannabis is subtly different and you can’t just swap a child from one product to another,” he said. In desperation Deacon wrote to Boris Johnson begging him to intervene on 29 December. “I just got an automatic response to say that he doesn’t reply to people that aren’t his constituents, which I find shocking because he is the prime minister,” said Deacon. Alfie was born in 2011 and was “perfect” she says but when reached four months he was constantly sick. At eight months he had his first “tonic-clonic seizure” and deteriorated from then losing every skill he had developed. By the time he was five years old he was having up to 150 cluster seizures every week, leaving him in intensive care once a week. “He would sometimes have these seizures for three or four days and then have a massive inflammatory response with back to back seizures that would mean he was pretty much flying off the bed they were so bad,” his mother said. He was diagnosed with a rare epilepsy syndrome caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein protocadherin 19, something only nine known boys worldwide have so prognosis and clinical trials of potential drugs was not possible. She went on to research treatments for epilepsy and found evidence of cannabis being used in 1841 leading her to developments in the Netherlands by a specialist pharmacist Arwin Ramcharan at Transvaal Apotheek. She moved to the Netherlands in September 2017 and Alfie began the treatment which saw his seizures stop but had to return five months later after money ran out, prompting her battle to get it legalised. “He has been seizure free for eight months,” she said on Tuesday. And before a tweak in the combination of drugs had an 11-month seizure free stretch before that. “We don’t have a perfect life and then he has a very difficult genetic epilepsy which causes behaviour problems; he has autism. Life is definitely not rosy but his quality of life is amazing he hasn’t been near a hospital for two years,” she said. Barnes said the situation was “appalling”. It is “not an exaggeration”, he says, to say that “one or two” of the 42 children on the drug “will die” if they can no longer receive this medicine. He said the way the DHSC has dealt with the situation was “lazy and flippant” and these families are now in crisis. Deacon says she would like to speak to Johnson and health secretary Matt Hancock to ask them what are they doing to protect her child.
Ramcharan said: “For me, it is really sad. We are not allowed to send this medicines whatsoever to the UK after Brexit. It is now a battle between the UK government and the Dutch government.” Deacon said her boy had “a horrendous quality of life, no quality of life” when he was ill, he is now able to attend to school. “I fought for two and a half years to keep my son well and to get him help on the NHS and it’s a real kick in the teeth, to be honest, for them to just, you know, not do anything to help us,” she said. “For the prime minister to ignore me, and all the other families, is an utter disgrace,” she said. The DHSC said: “We sympathise with patients dealing with challenging conditions. There is a range of alternative cannabis-based medicines available to UK patients. “The decision on what treatments to prescribe for patients is rightly one for clinicians to make, on a case-by-case basis and dependent on the specific needs of the individual. If patients have any concerns, they should discuss them with their doctor.”"
2021-01-05T19:01:56Z,politics,Politics,Former Labour chair criticised for raising doubts over Covid vaccine,"The former Labour party chair, Ian Lavery, has come under fire after questioning why anyone would have confidence in the Covid vaccine and expressing concern at the pace at which the two newly introduced jabs were approved. Footage of the MP emerged hours after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, spoke out about anti-vax campaigns and said he would support emergency legislation to tackle them. It shows Lavery apparently casting doubt over the speed at which the regulatory process was carried out for the vaccines. However, Lavery – who is understood to have been spoken to by Starmer’s office – later tweeted that “my words have been taken out of context”, adding that he rejected “any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout”. He also praised the scientific community’s achievements on the vaccine. The comments were made in a video broadcast by Socialist Telly – which describes itself as “Grassroots Socialist Television, for the many” – on 3 January. Noting the government’s handling of test and trace, PPE provision and the awarding of public contracts, Lavery said: “Why would anybody have any confidence in the vaccine?”
Lavery, who also made reference to the UK’s decision to delay administering the second vaccine dose so more people could get their first jab sooner, made clear he wanted people to get the vaccine. “I want everybody, let me be honest, I want people to take the vaccines, I really, really do and it’s important,” he said. However, in the footage – first reported by the Guido Fawkes website on Tuesday – he added: “I have got concerns about how these vaccines have … come on to the market when it would normally take 10 years and it’s … [taken] four month[s]. It normally takes three or four years to pass through the regulatory procedures … it hasn’t taken three or four weeks. And of course I’ve got concerns, massive concerns, about this government and the lack of trust.” Responding to a clip of the footage, the former Labour MP Mike Gapes – who defected to Change UK in 2019 before losing his seat at the general election – tweeted: “What a disgrace.” Lavery, an ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, served as the party chair for nearly three years until April 2020. On Tuesday, Starmer told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that “we have to deal with the anti-vax campaigns because they will cost lives”, as he explained that he would be prepared to work with the government to pass emergency legislation to deal with them. Lavery tweeted on Tuesday afternoon: “Like everyone else, I am blown away by the achievements of our scientific community in bringing a vaccine forward for a disease we have only known about for a year. My words have been taken out of context and I reject any claims that I am in any way opposed to the rollout. “We now need a national effort to ensure the vaccine is rolled out. I urge everyone to make sure they get the vaccine as soon as possible so we can once again see family and friends and get back to fighting for a better Britain.” Rollout began on Monday for the recently-approved Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the second to be given the green light in the UK. It follows the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also authorising the Pfizer/BioNTech jab last month, which made the UK the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid. Speaking as the Oxford vaccine was approved at the end of last month, the MHRA chief executive, Dr June Raine, stressed “no corners, whatsoever, have been cut”. As England begins a third national lockdown that will last for at least seven weeks to stem the spread of the virus, the government is hoping to deliver a first vaccine dose to those in the four highest-priority groups – 13.9 million people – by mid-February."
2021-01-05T18:57:36Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: more than 1m in England infected as UK daily positive tests hit record 60,916 - as it happened","Boris Johnson has revealed that more than 2% of the population of England - or more than one million people in total - is now infected with coronavirus. Thatâ€™s equivalent to one person in 50. The figure comes from the Office for National Statisticâ€™s infection survey, which is viewed as one of the most reliable guides to the prevalence of coronavirus in the community because its figures are based on the results of a large-scale, weighted survey, and donâ€™t just track the results from people who have actively decided to get a test. The last published ONS survey, released on Christmas Eve, put the coronavirus rate in England at one person in 85. Commenting on the new figures Johnson told a press conference at No 10: When the Office of National Statistics (ONS) is telling us that more than 2% of the population is now infected - thatâ€™s over one million people in England, and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40% higher than at the first peak in April, I think obviously everybody - you all - want to be sure that we in Government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, said an infection rate of one in 50 was â€œreally quite a large number indeedâ€�. See 5.08pm. Johnson claimed that it might be possible to start relaxing the lockdown measures from February - provided certain conditions were met. Asked if the country could be out of lockdown by March, he gave a highly qualified answer. He said: Our ability to get through this fast depends on a number of things. Provided we donâ€™t learn anything new about the virus we donâ€™t yet to understand, some new mutation we havenâ€™t currently bargained for; provided the vaccine rollout goes according to plan; provided the vaccine rule is as efficacious as we think it is; above all, provided that everybody follows the guidance now, then we think that by the middle of February, when a very considerable portion of the most vulnerable groups will have be vaccinated, then there really is a prospect of beginning the relaxation of some of these measures. I would not put it any stronger than that. But Whitty said some restrictions might still be needed next winter. He said said the risk level would gradually decrease over time with measures being â€œlifted by degrees possibly at different rates in different parts of the country, weâ€™ll have to seeâ€�. He went on: Weâ€™ll then get over time to a point where people say this level of risk is something society is prepared to tolerate and lift right down to almost no restrictions at all. We might have to bring in a few in next winter for example, thatâ€™s possible, because winter will benefit the virus. Johnson said that almost a quarter of the over-80s in England have now had one dose of vaccine. Announcing the latest figures he said: We have now vaccinated over 1.1m people in England and over 1.3m across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80, which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England. And that means that nearly one in four of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in two to three weeks â€“ all of them - a significant degree of immunity. But Johnson could not guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays. Whitty said there was a risk that delaying the period between giving the first dose of vaccine and the second could help the virus to mutate, but he said the danger was small. He said the advantages of giving more people a first dose quickly justified this. Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, played down the risks posed by the South African variant of the virus. He said a possible change in the virus shape in the variant â€œtheoretically gives it a bit more risk of not being recognisedâ€� by the immune system. But he went on: There is nothing yet to suggest thatâ€™s the case. This is being looked at very actively. Itâ€™s worth remembering that when a vaccine is given you donâ€™t just make one antibody against one bit, you make lots of antibodies against lots of different bits, and so itâ€™s unlikely that all of that will be escaped by any mutations. But we donâ€™t know yet. At the moment, youâ€™d say the most likely thing is that this wouldnâ€™t abolish vaccine effect. It may have some overall effect on efficacy but we donâ€™t know. Whitty said the governmentâ€™s timetable for administering the vaccine was â€œrealistic but not easyâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2021-01-05T13:28:14Z,politics,Politics,Exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England this summer,"Exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England this summer despite the extended lockdown, according to plans being considered by Gavin Williamson. The education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday after the prime minister called for schools to close and said summer exams were likely to be cancelled as part of a third national lockdown. Williamson will tell MPs he has directed the English exams regulator Ofqual to come up with a contingency plan to replace this year’s GCSEs and A-levels, which the government had hoped to retain despite concerns about pupils’ lost learning during the pandemic. One of the options under consideration is holding exams in core subjects such as English, maths and possibly science at GCSE, with school-assessed grades for other subjects, though there are concerns this could lead to pupils neglecting non-examined courses. Ministers are also worried pupils might stop engaging with their studies without the goal of exams. It is understood Ofqual may also look at online assessments as one possible option, though access to laptops remains a problem in schools. Teachers could also be asked to prepare and assess portfolios of students’ work, a sample of which could be moderated externally to try to ensure fair grades.
The government will be desperate to avoid a repeat of last year’s exams fiasco, when ministers cancelled exams and were then forced to scrap GCSE and A-level grades generated by an Ofqual algorithm. They finally resorted to school-assessed grades, causing chaos for university admissions. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, told Sky News on Tuesday: “Obviously we can’t have A-levels, GCSEs or BTecs in the way that we have had them in the past but there are ways of ensuring that we can assess the work that students have done, give them a fair recognition of that and help them on to the next stage of their education.” Before the announcement of the latest lockdown, the government resisted calls for summer exams to be cancelled for the second year running, with Williamson saying last month he could “absolutely” give a cast-iron guarantee that exams in England would go ahead. The vow came as Williamson unveiled plans for pupils to be given advance notice of topics and to be allowed to take in exam aids including formula sheets. Asked about plans for summer assessments, an Ofqual spokesperson said: “We know how difficult this must be for students, teachers and lecturers. We wish at all costs to avoid arrangements for this summer’s GCSEs, A-levels and vocational and technical qualifications inflicting further disadvantage on students. We are considering a number of options to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances.” Meanwhile, college leaders in England have urged the government to cancel this month’s vocational exams, which are due to get under way this week, saying it is neither safe nor tenable to press ahead in the context of a national lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of students are due to sit vocational exams in schools and colleges this month. Announcing the lockdown last night, Boris Johnson said the exams should proceed as planned.
The Association of Colleges’ chief executive, David Hughes, has written to Gillian Keegan, minister for skills and apprenticeships, calling for an urgent rethink. He said the prime minister’s message was that everyone should stay at home to help defeat the virus. Hughes added: “Asking college staff and students to ignore that message to sit exams is simply untenable. It is patently not safe for them and their families, even with the best mitigations a college can put in place. To go ahead with this exam series now would also be unfair on students.”"
2021-01-04T21:24:32Z,politics,Politics,"To predict government policy, listen to Boris and wait for the opposite | John Crace","In hindsight, the clues were there for everyone to see. Last week, the government forced a vote on extending recess by an extra week until 11 January. After all, it wasn’t as if there was a lot on for MPs to scrutinise. Brexit was bound to be going swimmingly and the coronavirus was near enough completely under control. So sure enough, on the very first day of its prolonged holiday, Boris Johnson announced that parliament would be recalled on Wednesday. It’s now becoming easier and easier to predict government policy. Just listen to what the prime minister said in the morning and the opposite is likely to be true come the middle of the afternoon. It’s almost like clockwork – the government does what most reasonable people would have done several weeks earlier. At every stage in the coronavirus pandemic, the government has been hopelessly behind the curve. From being late to lockdown in March while the Cheltenham festival and Carrie Symonds’s baby shower went ahead. From ignoring the Sage advice in September for a second national lockdown and being forced into one in November by both Keir Starmer and the rapidly rising rates of infection. From announcing a five-day Christmas free-for-all in early December – everyone knew Covid liked to take time off over the holiday period – which he then had to cancel after everyone had already made their plans. During the biggest national health crisis in 100 years, it’s just our luck to have Johnson in charge. A man pathologically unable to make the right calls at the right time. The prime minister is a narcissistic charlatan. The Great Dick Faker. Someone who can’t bear to be the bearer of bad news or to be proved wrong by people who disagree with him. So he stubbornly ignores the evidence until he becomes overwhelmed by it and public opinion has turned against him. He isn’t just a liability as a leader, his indecision has cost lives. His hubris will only cost him his job. So the day started off much like any other day for Boris. A quick feelgood photo opportunity jaunt to watch someone get the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on its first day of national distribution and a short clip to camera. Schools should definitely remain open, he insisted, apparently oblivious to the fact that most health and teaching professionals had said otherwise. But Boris thought differently. Most schoolkids only got a mild dose of Covid and the teachers should stop moaning. Despite the increased infectivity of the new coronavirus variant, teachers should take one for the team as children couldn’t afford to fall further behind in their education. It didn’t seem to have occurred to him that children also have parents and grandparents with whom they live and who might not be so lucky. There might be a time for increasing restrictions – Nicola Sturgeon announced Scotland’s early in the afternoon and the Labour leader had made a second appeal in two days for Johnson to see sense – but now was not the right time. Which begged the question: “If not now, then when?” With infections increasing exponentially, the death rate rising and hospitals struggling to cope with the rate of admissions, just how many more people would have to get seriously ill before Boris could be bothered to take action? As it happened, not many. Because shortly after filming this interview and insisting there would be no No 10 press conference that evening, Johnson announced he would be addressing the nation on TV at 8pm. Yet again, Boris had been shamed into another U-turn. Better late than never. Though too late for some. For his TV address, a dishevelled Boris – why change the habit of a lifetime and make it look like you give a toss? – didn’t look serious so much as scared shitless. Someone for whom reality had – temporarily at least – penetrated his self-delusion. There was little way to sugarcoat the news, despite him talking up the vaccine. No triumphs to be declared, no ersatz leadership theatrics for reassurance. Only the despair of a down-on-his-luck TV evangelist was on offer in the eight-minute statement. He began as if the huge rise in coronavirus cases had come as a massive shock to him at lunchtime, even though it was old news to the rest of the country, and spoke of his deep regret – the hurt was all his – at putting the country back into a total lockdown. Including closing the schools he had opened that morning. “Some of you might be wondering why we haven’t done this before,” he said. A question literally no one was asking as no one expects anything but incompetence and delay from this government any more. Typically, there was nothing about financial support for those whose livelihoods may be affected. He ended by saying that if all went well, there could be an easing of the lockdown by mid-February. But not even The Great Dick Faker, the master of self-deception, sounded convinced by this. As usual he didn’t have the balls to level with the country and tell us what we all deep down know. That it’s going to take at least three months before there’s even a hint of a return to normality. And that’s if we’re lucky. “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
2021-01-04T21:12:39Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid: Boris Johnson tells people to stay at home as England enters third national lockdown â€” as it happened,"Hereâ€™s a quick run-through of this eveningâ€™s events. England will enter its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed and people allowed to leave home once a day for exercise for at least six weeks. â€œIf things go wellâ€�, Johnson said the government expects to have offered the first dose to everyone in the four top priority categories by mid-February. Exams â€œwill not be able to go forward as normalâ€�, Johnson said. Primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England will move to remote teaching from tomorrow - except for key workersâ€™ children and vulnerable children. The government is advising people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. The UK reported its highest ever daily number of new cases, with 58,784 further infections registered. As well as being a record rise, Mondayâ€™s figure is also the seventh time in a row that the daily number of cases has topped 50,000, which had never happened until last week. The UKâ€™s four chief medical officers and NHS England medical director have recommended that the UK alert level should move from level 4 to level 5. The Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier, 60, has been arrested and charged in connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct over an alleged breach of coronavirus regulations between 26 and 29 September 2020. All schools and colleges in Wales will move to online learning until 18 January, the education minister has said. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital in England stood at 26,626 as of 8am on 4 January â€” a week-on-week increase of 30%. Thatâ€™s all from the politics blog for today, but you can follow our global blog for any major UK developments as well as international stories."
2021-01-04T17:16:08Z,politics,Politics,Government's Covid missteps continue to baffle Tory MPs,"With England on the verge of a third national lockdown and schools across the country closing their doors, it is hard to believe that less than three weeks ago the government was insisting its three-tier system was sufficient and five days of Christmas mixing could go ahead. It was 15 December when Boris Johnson overruled scientists’ advice and told the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland he would face down calls to cancel Christmas. Just four days later, swathes of the country were in a new tier 4 with festive mixing cancelled. More regions followed within days. Then three days before Christmas, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested evidence showed infections would soar if schools were allowed to open as normal.
Yet allies of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, briefed hard that he was mounting a counterattack to stop schools from closing, before Johnson yet again bowed to the inevitable last week and ordered classrooms in high-risk areas to shut to most pupils. Conservative MPs are united in their deep frustration at the chaos – but are split on its root cause. Many blame the government’s communications’ strategy, which has never fully recovered since cabinet ministers were ordered to defend Dominic Cummings as a model father after he was accused of flouting lockdown rules. Others point to the birth of the “stay alert” slogan in May as the moment where public compliance began to give way to ridicule. But communications chaos alone does not explain the flip-flopping and about-turns when it comes to policy and strategy, critics say. Often the sequence goes: news of government scientific advisers’ grave warnings leak, ministers sombrely opine on the need to act – and there follows a days-long vacuum of information set against a backdrop of growing and increasingly urgent calls for action. Last week there were stark and repeated warnings about growing pressure on the NHS, as cases surpassed 50,000 day after day. On Sunday the prime minister said there was “no question” England would need tougher Covid lockdown rules soon, echoed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Monday morning. It took 36 hours for the next steps to become clear. But in that vacuum, there is no transparent strategy for how action is decided. Though the UK is in a bleak situation, some MPs who blame communications say the government’s strategy and policy have not differed hugely from other countries that have also found themselves in deep difficulties. “The comms is [a] key problem. Underneath it all, the approach of most countries has been broadly similar,” one Tory MP said. “The key thing is to project competence with your ministers and your delivery. We have done neither. But the delivery bit can only be done with decisive decision-making.” Government communications has been beset by leaks in addition to strategic decisions to hand key announcements to certain papers or broadcasters, meaning public information filters out in the strangest of ways. Several MPs pointed to the near-farcical news of the new tier 4 and the cancellation of Christmas for many – which emerged via tweets from the Sunday Times deputy political editor, Caroline Wheeler, who got the leak. However, the journalist was locked out of her Twitter account and used a new account – meaning reporters, MPs and the public were initially unsure whether the news had been faked. Government advisers will privately say that delayed decision-making and a rapidly changing situation with the new variant of the virus are to blame rather than any communications strategy.
Andrew Mitchell, a veteran Tory MP who has not been afraid in the past to criticise the government, says the government is dealing as best as it practically can. “The truth is that it is the new variant of the virus that has driven a horse and cart through policy,” he said. “I have great sympathy with the government in trying to take very tough but essential decisions.” Yet there are gaps in the strategy that continue to baffle many MPs from all sides – including arrivals into the UK where travellers do not even routinely have their temperature checked, let alone are required to show a negative Covid test result. A number of normally loyal Conservative MPs have broken ranks in the past few days to call out the delay and indecisiveness, implicitly a criticism of ministers and Johnson himself. Among them was Neil O’Brien, only recently appointed as head of the Conservative party’s policy board. In a Twitter thread, O’Brien said the government “need[s] to do something big to slow the explosive growth and stop hospitals being further overwhelmed”, saying the current wave of coronavirus “is in many ways *worse* than the original spring surge”. The other call came from Jeremy Hunt, the former cabinet minister and now chair of the health select committee who normally restricts his campaigning to mass testing, but who joined the clamour for a change of strategy on Monday. “We need to close schools, borders, and ban all household mixing RIGHT AWAY,” he tweeted. Once again, the path for the government seems inevitable, but MPs are beginning to wonder if it is the fault of the communications or ministers themselves as to why they keep repeatedly falling into the same missteps. • This article was amended on 7 January 2021 because an earlier version referred, in the opening sentence, to ‘the UK [being] on the verge of a third national lockdown’. That should have referred to England."
2021-01-03T17:04:44Z,politics,Politics,Jo Stevens: outpouring of support for MP in hospital with Covid,"Politicians from across the political divide have sent best wishes to the Labour MP and shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens, who is being treated in hospital for coronavirus. The Cardiff Central MP has been “laid low with Covid for a while”, according to a statement from her team on New Year’s Eve. On Saturday, they tweeted from her account: “Jo has asked us to let you know that she is being treated in hospital for Covid. Thanks for all your good wishes, we will give an update when we can.” The 54-year-old was elected at the 2015 election, winning the seat back for Labour from the Liberal Democrats. She was shadow secretary of state for Wales for a short while under Jeremy Corbyn. She is the fourth MP known to be taken to hospital with Covid, including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who ended up intensive care in April. Her Labour colleagues Yasmin Qureshi and Tony Lloyd were also admitted to hospital, with Lloyd spending 10 days on a ventilator in an induced coma. Qureshi, the MP for Bolton South East and a shadow minister for international development, said she had been left “anxious and concerned” after being taken by ambulance to her local hospital in October. In an interview with the Guardian last month she described the “unbearable pain” caused by coughing fits and pneumonia as the disease took hold. News of Stevens’s illness prompted well wishes from across the House of Commons. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he wished Stevens a “speedy recovery”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, tweeted: “Get well soon Jo, a dear friend and colleague.” Mark Drakeford, Wales’s first minister, said: “All of our thoughts and best wishes are with Jo for a speedy recovery. Thank you to Jo’s constituency team for continuing to support Cardiff Central constituents at this difficult time.” In November she wrote to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, calling for the government to clamp down on platforms that host “anti-vax” content. During the pandemic, Stevens has lobbied for more support for the culture sector, which she said was in “complete despair”. She told MPs in October: “In arts and culture, experienced, skilled and talented live performers, and the people who create, produce and make those economically successful events happen, are being treated by the Treasury as though their jobs were mere hobbies.”"
2021-01-03T14:25:33Z,politics,Politics,Tony Blair: I would have voted for Boris Johnson's post-Brexit trade deal,"Tony Blair, who was one of the most prominent campaigners for a second referendum on EU membership, has said he would have backed Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels in the Commons. The former prime minister revealed he would have supported the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who whipped his MPs to vote in favour of the prime minister’s agreement with the EU last week before the end of the transition period. Starmer – who also backed remain during the 2016 vote as well as calling for a second referendum in 2019 while serving as the shadow Brexit secretary – faced pressure from his own party ranks over his decision to support the deal, despite criticising it as “thin”. Three Labour junior frontbenchers resigned after defying Starmer and refusing to vote for the agreement. They were among 36 of the party’s MPs who abstained. One Labour MP went further and voted against the deal, which sailed through the parliamentary approval process on 30 December. Starmer, who before becoming leader last year accepted that Johnson’s election victory at the end of 2019 “blew away” the case for a second Brexit referendum, had declared Labour’s support for the prime minister’s trade deal with the EU after an agreement was reached on Christmas Eve. Asked if he would have voted for the deal in the Commons, Blair – among the most high-profile members of the remain camp during the 2016 Brexit referendum – told Times Radio on Sunday: “I would have backed the leader on this. I mean, look, it’s a tactical question for the Labour party because the problem is … it’s open to your opponents to say that if you don’t back the deal, then you’re voting for no deal.” He continued: “I would have backed the leader on it. Look, there was a case for abstaining and there was a case for … voting for it because the alternative’s no deal.” He added: “I don’t think it particularly matters to the Labour party either way. I think what does matter is that we’re still in a position where we’re pointing out what the problems with this deal are.” Separately, in a piece published on Sunday, Blair argued that though he was “passionately opposed” to Brexit and that he had not changed his mind about its “wisdom”, it was now “reality” and “we must make the best of it”. Meanwhile, Johnson confirmed he would continue as prime minister after Brexit and sought to play down issues with red tape over trade after the UK formally severed ties with the EU following the end of the transition period at 11pm on Thursday. “Of course, there are going to be changes and we’ve made that clear,” the prime minister told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, adding: “Actually, I think there’s a great opportunity for British SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] and exporters of all kinds.” He continued: “What we’ve seen is many companies in this country not exporting in the way that they could … the tragic reality of … business life is that there is some bureaucracy. We’re trying to remove it but we have a massive opportunity to expand our horizons and to think globally and to think big.” Asked if he would carry on as prime minister after Brexit, Johnson said: “Yes.” The prime minister added: “We now have freedoms that we haven’t had for 50 years and there are lots of reasons to be very positive about this otherwise grim new year.”"
2021-01-03T13:59:44Z,politics,Politics,UK carmakers have three years to source local electric car batteries,"UK carmakers face a three-year scramble to source electric car batteries locally or from the EU to avoid tariffs on exports following the Brexit free trade deal, according to industry analysts.
The Christmas Eve deal means that all UK-EU trade in cars and parts will continue to be free of tariffs or quotas after the the Brexit transition period ended on Friday, as long as they contain enough content from either UK or EU factories. The deal came as a major relief to the embattled car industry. Batteries will at first be allowed to contain up to 70% of materials from countries outside the EU or the UK. However, from 1 January 2024 that requirement will tighten to 50%. This will mean that sourcing battery materials from within the UK or EU will be the only realistic option for UK carmakers to avoid EU tariffs from 2024 onwards, according to Alessandro Marongiu, a trade analyst at the lobby group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The rules mean it will be vital for UK carmakers to secure a battery supply from the the EU or the UK, said Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive. The deal makes it “imperative that the UK secures at pace investment in battery gigafactories and electrified supply chains”, he said. Ian Henry, whose AutoAnalysis consultancy works with a number of major carmakers, said one key issue in preserving the UK car industry was creating an entire supply chain, including manufacturing important and chemically complicated parts such as the cathodes crucial to lithium-ion batteries. “By the mid-2020s, the UK has got to be doing a lot more than just assembling bits from a kit,” said Henry. “Several core processes in battery manufacturing will have to take place here in order for the UK to have a viable electric vehicle industry.” The vast majority of batteries used in UK and EU electric cars are sourced from east Asian companies such as China’s CATL, Korea’s LG Chem or Japan’s Panasonic. However, European carmakers and governments are pouring billions of euros into new battery plants, with at least 10 credible efforts under way from companies including Sweden’s Northvolt and the French oil major Total, according to data company LMC Automotive.
The UK is lagging behind, with no fully funded plans to begin battery production in Britain, despite the promise of government funding and industry support for British “gigafactories” capable of large-scale battery production. The government-backed Faraday Institution this year said a failure to build a UK battery supply chain could cost more than 100,000 jobs by 2040. The Brexit deal was welcomed by the startup Britishvolt, which is the only company with public plans to build a gigafactory in the UK. Britishvolt last month bought rights to a site in Blyth, Northumberland, where it plans to build a factory, subject to fundraising. The Brexit deal’s provisions fit perfectly with Britishvolt’s ambitious plans to start battery production at scale by the end of 2023. It hopes to start building the plant in the summer. A spokesman said the deal would allow it to serve both the UK’s domestic automotive industry and carmakers in Europe."
2021-01-03T12:59:14Z,politics,Politics,Britons living in Spain barred from Madrid flight in post-Brexit travel row,"British residents flying home to Spain have been prevented from boarding a joint BA-Iberia flight to Madrid because the airline claimed their pre-Brexit residency papers were no longer valid, while others were deported back to Britain from Barcelona for the same reason. Max Duncan said the Iberia desk had refused to recognise his green card as proof of residence despite assurances by the British and Spanish governments that both the old foreign national identification (NIE) document and the new foreign ID card (TIE) remained valid. Duncan said he and seven other residents of Spain had not been allowed to board the 10.55am flight to Madrid. The Spanish wife of one of the Britons was also part of the group.
Madrid had announced last year that in the light of Brexit, UK nationals resident in Spain would be given a photo ID to replace the residency papers carried by EU nationals although the green card would remain valid proof of residency. It then restricted passenger travel from the UK on 22 December until 19 January after the discovery of the new coronavirus variant in southern England, with exceptions for Spanish nationals and those legally resident in Spain. The British embassy in Madrid reiterated in a tweet on Saturday night that the green card was valid. “This should not be happening, the Spanish authorities have reconfirmed again this evening that the green residency document will be valid for travel to return to Spain as stated in our travel advice,” it said. Patricia Moody and her husband, who were flying home to Almería via Madrid, were also turned away. “We had tickets with Iberia but someone said BA were accepting the green card so we bought tickets with them, so we spent a total of £1,500. BA boarded one of our suitcases then said we couldn’t board after all.” Moody and her husband, who urgently needs medication, are waiting to hear from the British embassy in Madrid. Meanwhile, their PCR tests, which cost £249, are no longer valid for travel.
It was not just the Madrid flight that was affected. On Saturday, Carlos Torres, who has dual UK-Portuguese nationality, narrowly escaped being deported when he arrived at Barcelona airport. “Yesterday I was on flight BA474 from London Heathrow and landed in Barcelona at 13:20,” Torres wrote on Facebook. “Everyone had their NIE, negative PCR test result and HR code [Spanish travel health] which all had been already checked prior to boarding at Heathrow. The police then start checking all the NIEs and calling people to verify their status. It quickly escalated to the police telling everyone they must board the plane and fly back to London. “I kept telling them that I’m a European Union national and that they have to let me through. All the Brits were forced back on the flight (me included). Finally, the penny dropped and the senior police officer let me through at the last minute.” Tens of thousands of Britons have registered to be issued with the new card but many are waiting to receive their ID as the system is overloaded. There are about 300,000 British residents in Spain, although the number may be much higher as many live outside the Spanish system. BA said in a statement: “In these difficult and unprecedented times with dynamic travel restrictions, we are doing everything we can to help and support our customers.”"
2021-01-03T10:59:24Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus restrictions 'probably about to get tougher', says Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson has raised the prospect of even tougher lockdown measures, including school closures, being imposed in England in the coming weeks to stem surging Covid-19 rates. Amid concerns over pressure on the NHS and the higher transmissibility of the new coronavirus variant, the prime minister revealed he was “fully reconciled” to potentially having to “do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher”. He also acknowledged that the coronavirus curbs were “probably about to get tougher”. Nearly eight in 10 people in England are already under “stay at home” tier 4 measures, which include the closure of non-essential shops and strict one-to-one outdoor meeting limits between households, but Johnson suggested stricter curbs could be introduced. Asked whether it may be necessary to introduce tougher “tier 5” restrictions in the near future, Johnson told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in … many parts of the country … I’m fully, fully reconciled to that. And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that.”
Asked what “tougher” might mean, Johnson said: “Until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we’re fighting this virus with the same set of tools.” Pressed again on what it might mean and if, for example, it could include March-style restrictions on daily exercise or a curfew, Johnson replied: “You’ve spoken about tier 5, I haven’t said that, but there are obviously a range of … tougher measures that we would have to consider.” Asked what they would be, the prime minister said: “I’m not going to speculate now about what they … would be, but I’m sure that all our viewers and listeners, will understand … clearly, school closures, which we had to do in March, is one of those … things… It’s not something we necessarily want to do.” Acknowledging that the situation was “very difficult”, Johnson added: “We’re entirely reconciled to doing what it takes to get the virus down and … that may involve tougher measures … in the weeks ahead.” “What we’re doing now is using the tiering system, which is a very tough system … and, alas, probably about to get tougher, to keep things under control. But we’ll review it.” He added: “And we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track in their tens of millions … and that, I think, is something that should keep people going in what I predicted, back on your show in October, will be a very bumpy period right now. It is bumpy and it’s going to be bumpy.” Despite warning of stricter measures on the horizon, and in the face of pressure from education unions, Johnson separately urged parents to send their children into primary schools on Monday in areas of the country where they are still set to open. Sir Mark Walport, who sits on Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) and was formerly the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, said it was “pretty clear” more restrictions would be needed to prevent transmission of the virus. “It is going to be very very difficult to get under control without much tighter social distancing measures,” he told Marr.
Those measures could potentially include closing schools, he said, adding: “We know that transmission occurs within schools, we know that a person between 12 and 16 is seven times more likely than others in a household to bring the infection into a household, and we know that there was a small dip in the amount of transmission in schoolchildren after the half-term, which then went up again when they went back.” Minutes from the Sage meeting on 22 December showed the group feared that even with full lockdown and closure of all schools, it might not bring the R number below one in the presence of the new variant."
2021-01-02T22:07:35Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson would lose majority and seat in election tomorrow â€“ poll,"The public are deeply unhappy with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the Brexit negotiations, a damning new poll suggests. The poll predicts that if a general election were held tomorrow neither the Conservatives nor Labour would win an outright majority. Disturbingly for Boris Johnson, the survey says the Conservatives would lose 81 seats, wiping out the 80-seat majority they won in December 2019. It gives the first detailed insight into the public’s perception of Johnson’s handling of the Brexit talks and the pandemic, amid fears that Britain is heading into a third national lockdown. The prime minister is on course to lose his own seat of Uxbridge and Ruislip South, if the insight is accurate. According to the survey of more than 22,000 people, conducted by the research data company Focaldata, using the multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) method that is said to be more than accurate than conventional polling, the results would leave the Tories with 284 seats and Labour with 282 – an increase of 82. Results in Scotland would see the Scottish National party achieve a near complete sweep, winning 57 of the 59 Scottish seats. The poll also predicts the Liberal Democrats would be reduced to just two seats – in Bath and in Kingston and Surbiton – down from the current 11. One in four voters who supported the Lib Dems in 2019 said they will switch allegiance to Labour. Many of the seats that Labour would gain are in the north of England, Midlands and Wales, part of the “red wall” collapse that swept the Tories to power at the last election, the Sunday Times reported. The survey forecasts that the Conservatives would cling on to just eight of the 43 red wall seats that they won at the last election – Bassetlaw, Bishop Auckland, Colne Valley, Dudley North, Great Grimsby, Penistone and Stocksbridge, Scunthorpe, and Sedgefield. Labour is marginally ahead of the Tories on 37.7% of the vote, with the Tories on 35.6, the Lib Dems on 8.7% and the Green party on 6.9%. The findings clearly suggest new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is making headway in rebuilding support for his party. In the last six months Labour has steadily hauled in the 26-point lead the Conservatives held. The poll results are likely to foment further unrest among Tory MPs about the performance of the prime minister and his cabinet. Justin Ibbett, founder of Focaldata, who carried out a similar poll for the Conservatives prior to the 2019 election, told the Sunday Times: “One year on from their stunning general election triumph, it is clear that the Conservatives already have a lot of work to do if they are to replicate their 2019 success in future elections. “The SNP would appear to be the real winners. Not only do they win all but two Scottish constituencies, but the most likely outcome is a Labour-SNP coalition government, which would have an overall majority of just over 20 seats.” Tory supporters were quick to point out on social media that the survey period ended before news of the Brexit deal was announced and claim there is evidence of a swingback to the Conservatives in the few days since."
2021-01-02T21:02:45Z,politics,Politics,"Come clean on logjams at British borders as new Brexit rules kick in, ministers told","Ministers are facing demands for more honesty and transparency over any logjams at the UK border in the wake of Britain’s exit from the EU, amid concerns that waves of disruption will last for six months. Several lorry drivers are understood to have been turned away at Dover for not having the right paperwork following the end of the Brexit transition period last week. It has caused concern among logistics and manufacturing companies that more severe problems could occur as trade flows increase later this month. The main initial worries for businesses concern the availability of vets to carry out checks for new export health certificates. This could hit meat and food sales to the EU. Bigger challenges will come when freight starts flowing from manufacturers of complex products, which are unlikely to have begun using the new systems. “We are going into a test period,” said Elizabeth de Jong of trade body Logistics UK. “If you were running your own business, you wouldn’t do it like this. You would have designed your new processes, you’d have trained people in them, you’d have tested the new systems, you’d have used it with dummy data, you’d have had a walkthrough. Those are all fundamentals of management. We’ve not been able to do any of it. “There are also cliff edges ahead. In July, we’re going to start import checks as well: that will need more capacity and more people. We’ve also got grace periods in Northern Ireland. “We need the absolute analysis of what’s going well, what isn’t, where the blockages are and what are the difficulties. We need that honesty and transparency. It’s a shared problem. We will get there and there are a lot of people who want this to work.” As the Brexit transition period ended last Thursday, Boris Johnson hailed the new relationship with the EU as an opportunity to “transform our country”. Disruption was not expected over the weekend, with low levels of freight crossing the border. However, almost half of the lorries entering Belfast from Britain on the first ferry of New Year’s Day were inspected: one was stopped for three hours. Jean-Michel Thillier, customs director for Calais, has warned the new arrangements will face “trial by fire” when traffic increases. In a move designed to curb queues, lorry drivers heading for mainland Europe must have a Kent Access Permit before entering the county. However, there are already reports that some holders of the permits still did not have all the necessary paperwork. Johnson won the support of hardline Tory Eurosceptics for his Brexit trade deal, but there remains unease about Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK and extra checks effectively creating a border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted on Friday, however, that there was “no Irish Sea border”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer’s decision to back the Brexit deal – which led to three frontbench resignations – is still angering his MPs. Some said they were now completely unclear about Labour’s aims for improving Britain’s relationship with the EU. “The Labour MPs [who refused to back the Brexit deal] aren’t going away,” said one rebel. “They will absolutely want Labour to be looking again at a customs union with the EU.” Former shadow cabinet member Clive Lewis warned that it would prove impossible for Labour to avoid the Brexit fallout. “The departure from Europe is going to open up a whole series of questions. A big part of the manifesto is going to have to talk about what we’re going to do with our relationship with Europe.”
Meanwhile, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party – which is seeking permission to rebrand as Reform UK – is planning to use concerns about fishing in its local election campaign in May. But for now, with Farage having announced that the “war is over”, the party is planning to focus more on issues such as the government’s Covid strategy. The Brexit party says it will field around 2,000 candidates in May’s local elections. However, chairman Richard Tice said he was already concerned there would be attempts to postpone the elections because of the pandemic."
2021-01-02T07:00:32Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: how the new rules will change your visits to the EU,"Before Brexit, UK citizens could travel, live, go on holiday and work anywhere in the EU without any special permits or visas. As of 1 January 2021 that is no longer the case. The Guardian’s Money team has spent the week poring over the many pages of documentation to explain how Brexit will affect you. Holidays and travel What does all this mean for holidays this year – if and when they are allowed to resume? While the coronavirus crisis has pretty much put a halt to all immediate travel, when the current restrictions are lifted and EU trips can resume, Brits face some significant changes over the next two years. While most of those taking city breaks or beach holidays to an EU country (plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland) will see little immediate difference, the picture is markedly different if you travel a lot or spend a significant amount of time in the EU.
Britain and the EU have agreed visa-free travel for short visits, meaning UK passport holders can spend up to 90 days in the its Schengen zone during any 180-day period. This can be in a series of short visits or one long visit, and it applies to all EU countries with the exception of the non-Schengen countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania. You could make a 90-day trip to any of those and still not use up your 90-day allowance. The same is true of Ireland, which allows unrestricted travel from the UK as part of a common travel area for British nationals. From 2022 (the exact date is yet to be confirmed), you will have to buy a visa waiver for holidays and short stays in the EU. This is not a visa but a permission to enter. It will cost €7 (£6.29) and will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, similar to the Esta permit currently required to visit the US. I usually spend more than 90 days in the EU over a six-month period as a tourist – will I be able to with a visa? Probably not. The Brexit agreement clearly restricts short trip visits to a maximum 90 days within one 180-day period. While the UK government says Brits who have exceeded their 90 days will be able to apply for a visa to stay longer, the European commission says that once the 90 days are up, the person would cease to be a tourist or “short stay” visitor, and would have to apply for a full long-term immigration visa – with all the costs and hassle that that entails. As it stands, someone spending May, June and July with a friend in Spain would not be able to return visa-free to any EU country inside the Schengen travel area until November – six months after they arrived in Spain. So, for example, if they wanted to visit Venice in August, that might prove tricky. However, each EU country has the right to set its own entry terms. It is possible that, for example, the Spanish or Portuguese governments, which are keen on maintaining UK tourist levels, could decide to offer an easy, non-work visa in the future, but this is by no means a given. Expect more details to emerge from EU countries during the coming months – but don’t bank on it.
Will my Ehic card still work? Yes and no. According to the NHS website, your European health insurance card remains valid in the EU until it expires, which for some people will be quite a way off. However, a replacement is being developed called the global health insurance card (Ghic). The bad news is that there are few details at the moment, and it does not for now extend as far as the Ehic. Currently, the new Ghic is expected to cover you for travel in EU countries, but not Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. If travelling to any of those countries, buying private cover should be regarded as an absolute necessity. Transitional arrangements have been put in place for Norway allowing UK nationals to use their UK passport to access state-provided medical treatment if necessary. The government is also negotiating new arrangements with Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA)/European Free Trade Association (Efta) states that could result in Ehic-style reciprocal healthcare cover there. Keep in mind that the Ehic and its successor the Ghic are not the same as travel insurance. The Ehic card entitles visitors only to necessary state healthcare for free or at a reduced cost. It does not, for example, cover repatriation to the UK after a serious accident. The “global” bit of the new Ghic is something of a misnomer. The British government has not suddenly decided to give British tourists free health cover in the US. It will offer cover only under existing reciprocal arrangements: largely in Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Will I need travel insurance? It is not a legal requirement that a traveller buys insurance when visiting the EU, but for the vast majority of people it would be daft not to, with scores of annual multi-trip policies costing less than £50 available for travel to the EU in 2021. There have been widespread concerns about the cost of travel insurance post-Brexit as the Ehic is withdrawn, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions.
What about passports/immigration control? Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expired. As of 1 January 2021, the UK government was advising travellers visiting the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, to have at least six months left on their passport. You will no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes, meaning possible delays at some airports. Also, when you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay.
And driving abroad? The good news is that your UK driving licence will continue to be valid in the EU. Previously it was understood that UK drivers would have to apply at the Post Office for one of two (or both) international driving permits, depending on the destination country. However, if you are taking your own car or other vehicle abroad, you will still need to apply to your insurer for a green card to prove that you have cover. There shouldn’t be a charge, except perhaps an admin fee, according to the Association of British Insurers. You should print it out and be ready to show it if asked by the police or other authorities. Note that Northern Irish drivers who enter the Republic will also need one. The ABI says the EU could end the green card requirement in the coming months. What about mobile roaming? The right to use your UK phone allowance while in the EU will end, meaning there is nothing to stop the phone companies reintroducing roaming charges. The big four main providers – EE, 02, Vodafone and Three – have said they have no plans to do this in the short term. As part of the deal, the UK and EU have agreed to cooperate on “fair and transparent” rates for mobile roaming. It remains to be seen what that means. And pet passports? The old EU pet passports are no longer valid. Instead the EU has agreed that Great Britain should be given “part two listed” status, allowing pets to travel within its borders providing the owners obtain an animal health certificate (AHC). This confirms that your pet is microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. You will need to get a new certificate each time you travel up to 10 days prior to travel. The AHC will be valid for four months.
How much booze can I bring back with me? The days of filling the car with as much wine as the suspension could take are also over, and a booze cruise to Calais won’t really be worth it after 1 January. Travellers returning from the EU will be restricted to 18 litres of wine (24 bottles), 42 litres of beer and 4 litres of spirits or liqueurs over 22% in alcohol – plus up to 200 cigarettes. So, compensation for flight delays … will we still get it? Yes. The EU261 rules that require airlines to compensate passengers for seriously delayed or cancelled flights have been written into UK law and remain as before. EU travel firms supplying UK consumers will also still have to provide compensation if their company goes bust. Studying in the EU For anyone who was already living or studying in the EU before 31 December 2020, it is business as usual, and you will pay the same (EU) fees until the course ends. You will also continue to be eligible for the same support – access to loans and so on – as students from the country you are studying in. However, as things stand, British students applying to study in the EU from September 2021 onwards face paying the much higher international fees paid by all non-EU nationals. They may well also not have access to the loans and other help that their predecessors enjoyed. Working in the EU
From 1 January 2021, UK citizens no longer have an automatic right to live or work in the EU, so if you are looking to do this, you will need to check your destination’s immigration rules. UK citizens who moved to an EU member state before 31 December 2020 can carry on living and working there but must register as a resident in the country where they live by 30 June 2021. For Britons who live in the UK but spend a lot of time working in the EU, things are now very complicated. There is a deal for senior managers who are seconded, and some short-term business visitors can work for 90 days in any given six-month period, but there are restrictions on the activities they can perform. The list of permitted activities shows that while meetings, trade exhibitions and conferences, consultations and research are fine, anything that involves selling goods or services directly to the public will require a work visa. Each EU member state has its own immigration regime, with often strict sanctions for those who don’t comply. Musicians and other performers have been left out of the deal, meaning that they have to get work permits to tour in the EU. The singer-songwriter KT Tunstall and the comedian Dawn French are among the more than 200,000 people who have signed a petition on the subject. There is no mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the deal, causing complications for those such as doctors, accountants and architects qualifying in the UK who wish to practise in the EU after 1 January. Living in the EU
I am a UK national in the EU – will I still get my UK pension? Yes. UK pensioners (including EU citizens who have worked in the UK) who have retired to an EU country have already been guaranteed that they will be able to receive the UK state pension, and benefit from any annual uprating. For people who intend to retire to another EU nation in future, there are also safeguards. The government guidance says: “You can carry on receiving your UK state pension if you move to live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland, and you can still claim your UK state pension from these countries. Your UK state pension will be increased each year in the EU in line with the rate paid in the UK.” If you are receiving a private pension, such as an annuity, from the UK but are resident abroad, the government says you should contact your provider. But in general it says: “UK law allows for workplace pensions to be paid overseas. The government does not expect this to change because the UK has left the EU.” However, there may be issues about the bank account into which your pension is paid. The Pensions Advisory Service says that although practice varies, pension schemes and annuity providers do not typically pay pension benefits directly into an overseas bank account, leaving the individual to transfer the money from a UK bank account – which will result in transfer fees and exchange rate fluctuations. More importantly, if you are resident overseas, there is a risk that your bank may close your UK account. In that case, you will need to contact the pension provider to ensure that it can pay the money into an overseas account.
So can I keep my UK bank account? Thousands of Britons resident in the EU were told in September that they would have their UK bank accounts closed by the end of the year. UK banks have been operating across the EU under passporting arrangements. Account holders who bank with firms that own an EU-based subsidiary will have their accounts transferred to that EU entity. But where that is not the case, accounts are likely to be closed. The Netherlands is particularly affected, with Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide and the Co-operative Bank withdrawing services. The Lloyds group, which includes Bank of Scotland and Halifax, is also closing accounts in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Slovenia, and Nationwide will no longer serve Italy. Barclays is closing accounts for customers in Belgium, Estonia, Italy and Slovakia, and Barclaycard accounts across the EEA will be closed unless linked to a UK address. While Santander customer accounts remain open, the bank is not taking on any new requests from EU-based customers. What does this mean for my payments in and out of the account? If you used your account to run direct debits for bills in the UK, there is no obvious solution other than to check with other banks to see if you can switch to a new account, according to Robert Hallums, of the advice consultancy Experts for Expats. Some pension providers may accept transfers from a currency account such as the Moneycorp online currency account, which converts payments and receipts into the desired currency without large fees or currency fluctuations. You can also use this kind of account to pay bills in the UK or receive rental income. In the worst-case scenario, you may need to consider paying it into a local bank account and accept the higher costs of currency exchange rates and fees. Will £85,000 of my savings still be protected? The Financial Services Compensation Scheme will still pay out the first £85,000 of your balance if your bank collapses, provided it is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. • This article was amended on 4 January 2021 to change references to Europe to the EU in the headline and text."
2021-01-01T17:55:07Z,politics,Politics,'Betrayed': Dover residents furious over building of Brexit lorry park,"It was all quiet on the Dover front in the hours after the UK left the EU, as lorries continued to avoid the port. But just minutes away, beyond the famous white cliffs, the sense of fury over Brexit was palpable as local residents came to terms with a government letter they received on New Year’s Eve telling them that from summer, their rural idyll of farmland and ancient Roman ways would be transformed into a customs clearance lorry park for 1,200 trucks. The site is in addition to the the Ashford lorry park 22 miles away that barricades fields behind 4-metre fences. Locals say they feel “betrayed” and “trapped” by the “lies” of the government over Brexit. Just as they were looking forward to a new year, the letter from the transport minister Rachel Maclean arrived advising them that the white cliffs site had been purchased and would be used as an “Inland Border Facility” from July.
“I am absolutely devastated,” said Charlotte Ashmore, who lives on a short row of period cottages overlooking the vast site, acquired under special legislation. The Green party coordinator for Deal and Dover, Sarah Gleave, said residents had been kept in the dark and feared they had no way of stopping construction.
She was told in a freedom of information disclosure by Kent county council, seen by the Guardian, that the white cliffs site would take over from Manston airport, where thousands of lorries were held last week after the French Covid border closure. Work is expected to start in days, and residents in the tiny villages of Whitfield and Guston that shoulder the site say the park will destroy the quality of their lives, wreck the environment including an ancient Roman right of way across the fields, and bring non-stop light and noise pollution. “My son has autism and we only moved here two years ago because of the calmness here. He doesn’t like noise and he doesn’t like light and he’s really anxious about this. He doesn’t want a lorry park here,” said Ashmore of her six-year-old, Nathan. “I’m considering putting the house on the market but we’ve just got a new five-year mortgage so we are trapped,” she added.
Like her neighbour Mick Palmer, she complains about the lack of consultation, saying the Department for Transport has given just “brief facts”. A former HGV international driver, Palmer is all too familiar with the need for lorry parks where drivers can rest up, wash and eat. He doesn’t believe the government claim that lorries will be required only to drive in, get their customs paperwork cleared and drive out again. “I’ve been here for 36 years and I would have been for all my life. They have just told lie after lie after lie. Never has a country treated its people so badly,” he said, adding that Westminster “bigwigs” had no interest in the consequences of their decisions. “They say it’s not going to be a lorry park but a customs clearance site and lorries will only be here for 20 minutes. “I know exactly what will happen. Lorries have nowhere to park in Kent, and they will come in here and stop and wave their tachograph and say: ‘I’m not moving.’ “They will have to have floodlights, power points for refrigerated lorries, which means generators going all night. “We heard this might happen and they said they might start digging on 3 January. We went to a local meeting with some officials and asked how many of them had come down here to look at the site. Not one of them. They don’t know our lives; they don’t know the impact on our lives,” he said. Residents say they have seen the 5-metre wooden fencing at the Ashford lorry park up the road, which has destroyed hedgerows and sweeping country views for walkers and residents. They fear they will face the same but just 25 metres away from their doors. “It is absolutely crazy. We have got to stop this,” said Palmer.
Gleave is desperately concerned about the impact on the environment. “People only hear about the port, but this is the North Downs way, the main footpath that goes across the county of Kent. It has fantastic wildlife, and is an area of fantastic food production, which is important post-Brexit, and the last thing we want to do is to destroy it. “The village of Guston is a wonderful community. People are here for the tranquility and community. They don’t have clout, but they are fighting it.
Sharon McCartney is one of those residents, out walking with her daughter, Missy, and their dog, Violet. “I am disgusted,” she said. “You can already hear the hum of the A2 but it doesn’t bother me when we are in the garden. But what is it going to be like with 1,200 lorries?” Missy, 17, is also devastated. “I use that Roman road to go into town. In the summer it’s one of the best walks you can do.” A Department for Transport spokesperson denied the site was a replacement for Manston. It said the facility would bring local jobs and “further planning consent” requirements would allow locals to express their views. They added: “Purchasing the white cliffs site in Dover will allow the government to set up an inland facility with easy access to the port, which does not itself have the space needed for extended checks. “We understand concerns about resulting disruption, which is why we are working with the relevant authorities and our principal designer to ensure the surrounding roads are not negatively impacted by increased HGV movements.”"
2021-01-01T16:05:39Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit is nothing to celebrate, says Ireland's foreign minister","Brexit is “not something to celebrate”, Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney declared after the UK formally severed ties with the EU, as he warned of trading disruptions due to fresh red tape.
In stark contrast to Boris Johnson’s buoyant characterisation of the country’s future following the end of the transition period at 11pm on Thursday, Coveney painted the UK’s departure as a source of regret. Calling it the end of an era, Coveney said trade across the Irish Sea would be “disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delays”. But on Friday, as the first ferries arrived in the Republic of Ireland from Britain under the new post-Brexit trade rules, events appeared to unfold smoothly. In Dublin, Irish Ferries’ ship Ulysses docked at 5.55am with about a dozen trucks on board, after travelling from Holyhead in Wales, and there were no delays as the freight trailers cleared customs checks. Meanwhile, the first ferries also sailed in and out of the port of Dover uneventfully, although it is thought that the real test is yet to come as the New Year is typically quiet and importers had been stockpiling products before the end of the transition period. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Coveney said: “For 48 years, the United Kingdom really has been a central part of the European Union. And that is now firmly ending with the end of the transition period … For all of us in Ireland, that is not something to celebrate. Our relationship with the United Kingdom is so close, so integrated, so interwoven, if you like, politically, economically and from a family perspective. “My own personal story is so shaped by the Anglo-Irish relationship, and that’s the same for so many other Irish people, so we’re seeing the United Kingdom moving in a different direction on its own, chasing some notion of trying to re-find its sovereignty and … that is something that we regret but, of course, we accept because it was a democratic decision.”
Despite Downing Street securing a trade deal with Brussels on Christmas Eve – which was subsequently fast-tracked through parliament on Wednesday as MPs approved a bill making the agreement UK law – Coveney warned there would still be trade issues. “We’re now going to see the €80bn [£72bn] worth of trade across the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delays,” he said. “That is the inevitable consequence, unfortunately, even with a trade agreement which everybody, I think, is very relieved was signed on Christmas Eve.” However, he said there would be no additional checks on goods between Northern Ireland – which is staying in the EU’s single market, as well as applying EU customs rules at its ports – and the Republic of Ireland. Newly introduced checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from mainland Britain would be “as limited as possible”, he said. “In terms of checks on goods, the whole point of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland linked to Brexit is to maintain an all-Ireland economy in terms of the movement of goods as it is today,” he said. “The only checks will be on goods coming from GB into Northern Ireland, and those checks will be as limited as possible to protect the movement of goods and services within the United Kingdom as a whole.” The first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast on Friday on schedule at 1.45pm – the Stena Line ship arrived from Cairnryan, in Scotland, with no evidence of disruption or delay. In France, the president, Emmanuel Macron, used his New Year’s Eve message to take aim at Brexit, calling it the product of “lies and false promises”. Meanwhile, in a piece for the Daily Telegraph to mark the new year, Johnson wrote: “Despite the many predictions of failure – and constant suggestions that the talks should be abandoned – we got a great new deal with our European friends and neighbours.” More than four years on from the Brexit referendum, Johnson also said the country had “taken back control of our money, our laws and our waters”. He added: “And yet it is also the essence of this treaty that it provides certainty for UK business and industry, because it means that we can continue to trade freely – with zero tariffs and zero quotas – with the EU.” He described it as a “big win for both sides of the Channel”, continuing: “For us, it means the end of the rancorous bickering about “Europe” that has bedevilled our politics for so long. It means the end of that uneasy feeling that we were constantly being asked to sign up for the details of a project – a giant federal fusion of states – in which we didn’t really believe and hadn’t really bargained for.”"
2021-01-01T15:00:12Z,politics,Politics,Brexit trade deal places Europe back at centre of UK politics,"In the words of one official in Brussels involved in the Brexit negotiations, the last year “accelerated the grieving process” over the UK’s departure from the EU. This is not to say the bloc’s institutions will be celebrating the country’s passing from the single market and customs union, 48 years to the day after its accession to the then European Communities on 1 January 1973. It remains a devastating loss to the EU, from which the full repercussions are yet to be seen even four and a half years after the referendum. The success or otherwise of the British experiment will play into European domestic debates for many years to come, not least the French presidential election in 2022. Yet, among even the most anglophile of officials and diplomats, of which there remain many in the EU quarter of Belgium’s capital, there is not only acceptance of the country’s exit but some unashamed relief.
The EU’s 27 member states were slow to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but, diplomats muse, how much worse would it have been with the UK as a member state? There was initial resistance from some capitals to the concept of joint borrowing on the financial markets as part of an effort to build up the EU’s €750bn Covid economic recovery fund, more than half of which will be distributed as grants rather than loans. The Netherlands, Sweden, Austria and Denmark – called “the frugals” – were forced to show their true colours after decades of hiding behind British awkwardness about such great leaps towards convergence. The link made between payments from Brussels and adherence to the rule of law among the member states – particularly relevant to Poland and Hungary – would have further posed a problem in Whitehall, where encroachment into domestic affairs has long been anathema. It is questionable whether, in the face of inevitable British scepticism, the concept of the recovery fund would have been allowed to fly at all. The final deal was hard-fought and messy, but how much more tortured would it have been with British involvement? Brexit, then, has been made tolerable by events. Now that it is done, there is nothing sentimental about Brussels’ approach to the future. If it was a coincidence then it was a happy one that at the same meeting at which EU ambassadors gave the green light to the post-Brexit trade and security deal this week, they also signalled approval of an investment pact with China. While it has its critics, the deal eases barriers to EU companies hoping to invest in China by lifting joint-venture requirements as well as caps on foreign equity in the automotive industry, private healthcare, ancillary services for air transport and cloud computing. China has also committed to “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify International Labour Organization conventions against the use of forced labour. The French government has framed the development as the EU correcting an imbalance in the openness of the two economies, a flexing of muscle not possible for any one member state or medium-sized island nation alone. While Boris Johnson has talked of a “global Britain”, Ursula von der Leyen has been putting into action her pledge to lead a “geopolitical European commission”. None of this is to traduce the Brexiter vision of a nimble Britain, able to negotiate trade deals around the world that better play to the country’s strengths in services, and financial ones in particular. But it is yet to be seen in practice – and officials in Brussels question both whether Whitehall has the bandwidth for what is to come and the sincerity of Johnson’s claim that his deal finally settles the European question in his party and the wider country. There are far too many pointers to the opposite being true. Just look at the impending flashpoints and the potential for European obsessions to be stirred. Great Britain now has the ability to diverge from EU environmental, social and labour regulatory standards in the future – but in doing so it opens itself up to tariffs on exports into its biggest market. The UK may close its waters to European fishing fleets in five and a half years, but again the trade deal foresees consequences in terms of a closure of the European market to British exporters. Politically inspired demands will again rub up against their economic consequences. The deal foresees a possible renegotiation of all its terms in four years’ time if regulatory divergence and tariffs create an imbalance. That would follow a likely general election in 2024. Johnson has already claimed Sir Keir Starmer would rip up the deal to put the UK under the yoke of Brussels as a Labour prime minister. Keep Brexit done, is the mantra. The campaign lines can already be seen. Meanwhile, under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland’s assembly will vote in four years on whether the region should stay in the EU’s single market. It is a debate that will be easily framed as a choice between the EU and Britain. The Irish government has already said it will fund participation of the Erasmus+ student exchange programme for Northern Irish students after the British government opted not to pay for continued membership. Perhaps most significantly of all, the question of EU membership will be central to the next great political debate in the UK: Scottish independence. As the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, never tires of saying, no part of Scotland backed Brexit. But Johnson’s deal – outside the single market and the customs union – means as a matter of EU law that an independent Scotland, newly acceded to the EU, would need to erect a full-fat customs border with England. Johnson has his trade deal, and there should be cause for relief in that. But rather than take the question of the UK’s relationship with Europe out of British political debate, the terms of the deal plonk it right at the centre in a way unthinkable even a decade ago. And there isn’t any obvious way back."
2021-01-01T12:30:09Z,politics,Politics,"Football, flights and food: how the EU reshaped Britain","Historians of the future will judge the politics of the half century before the Brexit transition ended on 1 January 2021. What, though, of social and cultural historians, those who study how we live? Perhaps the most symbolic cultural artefacts of the last 50 years will turn out not to be a blue flag but a bottle of Blue Nun, a block of mozzarella, a Ryanair boarding printout or a ticket to a Bayern Munich v Manchester City football match. Despite half a century of belonging to the EU club, most British people say their emotional bonds to Europe are not strong. “Nearly 60% of Britons do not identify as European at all,” says Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London. Allegiance to an abstract notion or a set of institutions is a stretch even for Europhiles. The early weeks of the pandemic in March tested solidarity even among the diehard founding member states. Yet lives and lifestyles across the continent are closer than imaginable in 1973 and in ways that cannot be measured by a survey. Even if no European “society” exists for Britain’s departure to disrupt, an informal convergence of tastes and cultural assumptions that could be called “Europeanisation” has taken place over the last five decades.
We may be familiar with how burgundy passports transformed migration, education and work. Scientists, researchers, countless professionals and the Erasmus generation will be affected by the loss of freedom of movement. EU citizens who made lives in the UK, especially after the opening up to eastern Europe from 2004, are bracing for a new precarity. But what about the majority of Britons who never married a Swede, bought a holiday home in France, got an engineering job in Eindhoven or spent a year studying in Madrid? How bumpy a ride will their sociocultural readjustment be? For good or ill, the boring business of trade – integrated supply chains, the free movement of goods and common rules for everything from energy to eggs – has shaped their lives too, even if few saw themselves as participants in a post-national experiment let alone expressed it as a form of identity. The greatest irony is that much of the Europeanising process that Boris Johnson’s hard divorce settlement aims to end was not driven from Brussels but from London.
Britain entered the bloc in 1973 entirely for transactional reasons and not because it “bought into the narrative” of political integration, says Menon. If GDP alone is the benchmark of success, membership paid off. Income per person is approximately 8.5% higher than it would have been had the UK stayed out, Nicholas Crafts, a professor of economic history at the University of Sussex, estimates. He attributes this extra prosperity to increased competition, lower trade costs and higher productivity. Margaret Thatcher may have let her antipathy to the federalist dream seed the culture war that led to Brexit, but she backed the 1985 project that would from 1992 become the EU’s most far-reaching achievement: the single market. Unwittingly, in pursuing its own interests via an expansive “common market”, the UK ended up selling EU citizens a common European lifestyle and perhaps even a common identity. British fingerprints, says Crafts, were all over the project. It meant goods could be packaged, labelled, transported and safely sold across Europe without any additional paperwork. “We were pushing strongly for it,” says Crafts. “It’s very simple: if you reduce the costs of doing business, the volume of trade goes up. “British business found standardisation a bonus. Because a regulatory union – which is exactly what the single market is – reduces costs much more than tariff-free trade does.” Food, glorious food How Europeans eat and drink in 2020 compared with 1973 is probably the clearest illustration of how the single market influenced habits and at least partially rewired Britons’ expectations. The Daily Mail recently published a pictorial guide to dealing with Brexit-related food disruption. Pizza, brie and avocado could be replaced by chips, toast and mutton, it suggested. The Christmas Eve Brexit deal spares Britain hefty tariffs on food imports but new barriers and costs could reduce the year-round availability of certain foods and make them more expensive. The Mail’s much-mocked food chart was an even more useful reminder of the socio-gastronomic transformation that EU membership delivered to Britain. The shift in food quality and the democratisation of Britain’s food culture has been “staggering”, says Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City, University of London. Food, he says, has been a symbol of European integration ever since the common agricultural policy (CAP) was founded to banish the memory of wartime starvation.
In 1973, the ONS retail price index reflected the pre-common-market British palate: that year’s representative shopping basket included mutton, Smash instant mashed potatoes and tinned corned beef. Olive oil may have been on the tables of the Elizabeth David-reading English middle classes, but most people cooked with lard. Wine didn’t figure even in 1977: sky-high tariffs put anything more than the occasional bottle of Blue Nun out of most people’s price range. We can partly blame EU agricultural policy for the disappearance of traditional fruit varieties but British supermarkets found it cheaper to import granny smith or golden delicious apples, Dutch-grown tomatoes and Spanish strawberries at the volumes British customers had started to demand. Muesli, ground coffee, pitta bread, fromage frais, riesling and pesto all joined the ONS shopping basket between 1980 and 2000. “The Europeanisation of the British diet is something even Brexiters have to acknowledge,” says Lang. “Mediterranean foods and pizza-eating cafe culture used to be for the British elite. That completely changed and it is remarkable.” In 1988, domestically produced food accounted for 66% of all food sold in Britain. Today, the figure has fallen to 50% while more than 60% of the UK’s fresh food is imported from the EU. For dairy products, the EU is almost the sole supplier.
Post-Brexit, the nutritional range could narrow for poorer British families and as a House of Lords select committee report warned, food inequality could widen with those who can afford it still able to buy high quality local fresh produce. A tightly woven “highly Europeanised” ecosystem of food safety oversight, meanwhile, evolved to protect consumers, which necessarily deepened integration between EU governments, says Lang. “If there is contamination in a tin of tomatoes in Italy every member state is alerted simultaneously.” Less palatable, he says, is the concentration of giant food manufacturers – which account for half of all European food sales – and the power of a few big retail corporations. Not only have they shaped the food system, they also make “taking back control” a challenge. “The single market allowed that process to accelerate,” says Lang. “Tesco, Carrefour, Aldi and Lidl were able to go everywhere and they have done so.”
Households also reflect the UK taste revolution that coincided with seamless trade. Terence Conran brought the first “continental quilts” to Britain from Sweden in the 1960s with their promise of uncluttered easy living. Duvets, used on the continent for a century before that, weren’t in the ONS British shopping basket until the early 80s. A few years later, Brits were being sold flatpack modernism and the Scandinavian dream, with the arrival in the UK of the first Ikea store. In driving down prices, and making linguistic differences irrelevant – although another legacy of Britain’s membership is English as a lingua franca – the single market, with its network of consumer protection laws helped to turbo-charge a consumer revolution. “It might have happened without EU membership but not at the same pace,” Crafts says. “You expect, with greater integration, that relative prices become similar and that affects consumption.” A broadening of horizons The soft power of the single market reshaped the culture in other ways. A Milan to Paris airfare cost the equivalent of at least €400 in 1992. Between 1993 and 1997, the EU liberalised aviation. Enter no-frills Ryanair, initially in the UK and Irish markets, now Europe’s biggest airline. Cheaper travel has been a mixed blessing for weekend hen and stag do destinations, and disastrous for the climate. But another genie was out of the bottle: air traffic in the EU trebled in the first 20 years of the single market. Trips within the EU accounted for most British holiday travel in 2019.
A “symbiotic” relationship grew, too, between budget air fares and another British institution, says Simon Chadwick, a professor of Eurasian sport at Emlyon Business School in France. Football fans didn’t historically travel in big numbers to continental games, but from the late-1990s, La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga entered the collective vocabulary as short-haul football tourism exploded. “Europeanisation has been built through football,” says Chadwick. In 1995, a seminal European court of justice verdict revolutionised the hiring and transfer of EU players by insisting on their freedom to work in any member state. Football, it turned out, was also governed by the single market. The Bosman ruling kicked off a new era. The Italian player Fabrizio Ravanelli caused a sensation by quitting Juventus for Middlesbrough weeks after his club won the 1996 Champions League. Players, managers, coaches and staff at all levels of the game flocked to the UK. European mainland fans arrived too, fuelling a football economy for Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and other UK cities. “Fast forward 20 years, the psyche of English fans had changed,” says Chadwick. “We don’t talk now about ‘foreign players’ ,they are just players.” Wenger, Klopp and Guardiola have become household names. “People just accepted their style and approach to the game as part of the culture of English football. Many people are not aware that this exchange is part of freedom of movement within the EU.”
Brexit makes signing EU players by Premier League clubs more cumbersome with points-based work permits now required. Young English footballers such as Jude Bellingham, who plays for Borussia Dortmund, may find doors closing to them. The single market has allowed the proliferation of football broadcasting rights and any free trade impediments created by Brexit could also undermine the lucrative nature of Premier League TV deals with EU countries, says Chadwick, especially as services are not covered by the Johnson government’s deal with the EU. The Premier League’s most lucrative overseas deal, for example, is with Scandinavian EU member states. Free trade difficulties could also have an impact on Uefa’s marketing of broadcast rights, both across Europe and elsewhere in the world. “We take a lot for granted but we are on the cusp of something different,” says Chadwick. “Football is so deeply embedded in the life of the nation that people don’t realise what they have, or what they might lose.” The EU is today far more than the marketplace Thatcher helped to craft. It has a single currency, legally binding environmental standards, worker protections, social policies, a budgetary policy that attempts to level out regional disparities and a human rights charter. Its critics say the pandemic and the need for a green recovery should be the impetus for a more progressive, less “Anglo-Saxon” EU political economy to emerge. Will the same realities drive the UK’s direction, or will the conscious repudiation of a European identity built on seamless trade and integration become tangible? Perhaps, as the Lithuanian novelist and historian Kristina Sabaliauskaitė predicted, the moment that Britain starts to experience life outside the EU is the moment it learns “with a shock, how very European it was after all”."
2021-01-01T07:00:03Z,politics,Politics,"Fear, mistrust – and hope: Britain's long walk away from the EU","As a previous Tory prime minister trying to find his way through difficult times once said: this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Brexit is hardly complete. The last-minute nature of the UK’s trade deal with the EU and the fact that it barely covers whole swaths of the economy – financial services are a good example – means some negotiations will have to grind on. The new bodies set up to arbitrate between the two sides will soon have work to do. Northern Ireland remains part of the single market for goods and will be enforcing EU customs rules, the most vivid example of the deal’s contorted provisions, which may have no end of political consequences. Certainly, given that public opinion in Scotland now suggests unprecedented levels of support for independence and that elections to the Scottish parliament will take place in May, what Brexit means for the increasingly fragile union between the UK’s four countries will now start to become clearer. Over the past week, the British government and its cheerleaders have implied that in averting a no-deal exit, we have avoided all the chaos and disruption that would have come with it. But this is not exactly the view of people at the sharp end. After the deal was announced, I spoke to Rob Hollyman, the director of a haulage firm based in Purfleet in Essex, which in normal times would be doing 25 runs a week to the continent, transporting prepackaged “non-essential foodstuffs” back to the UK via the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel. “Deal or no-deal makes very little difference to where we’ll be on 1 January,” he said. He and his drivers still do not know how long new export and customs clearances for loads from Britain will take in EU countries, and what that will mean for queues of lorries on the UK side of the English channel. The worst-case scenario of the government’s border and protocol delivery group, let us not forget, involves queues of 7,000 lorries in Kent; to put that in perspective, the recent chaos when France closed its border to hauliers coming in from the UK involved half that number.
“Is it going to take minutes, or hours, or days?” Hollyman said. “The general sense is that it’s going to be chaotic for … a period. But we don’t know how long that will last.” The practicalities of Britain’s exit from the EU, then, remain full of uncertainty. Besides, proclaiming the first day of 2021 as some shining new dawn hardly suits our current reality. With the Covid pandemic reaching new peaks, hospitals reaching breaking point and most of the UK adjusting to life under increasingly stifling restrictions, this is hardly an occasion for union jack bunting and tributes to the bulldog spirit. But we should not underestimate today’s bracing significance. Our step away from the EU confirms that any idea of Britain as a country with an essentially European destiny is over, for a generation at least. The UK’s institutional arrangements are now in line with the vision of Britain that narrowly won the 2016 referendum – what Brexiters see as a proudly sovereign country, and their adversaries malign as an inward-looking, crabby place, eternally fixated on its past. If you ever had a hopeful vision of a UK that might be liberated from its history, culturally vibrant, and at last fully European (you can find it in some early Tony Blair speeches – he believed we could somehow be “a young country”), this is a moment of undeniable sadness. And there is another, even more profound reason to mourn, lost amid all that recent talk about fish species and lorry parks. What became the EU was, at heart, a response to centuries of conflict, and two wars in the 20th century whose aftershocks have still to die down. In eventually joining, the UK served notice that, whatever its innate scepticism, its people and politicians just about understood that close mutual ties were the best means of maintaining peace and stability. But after 47 years of membership and an often surreal period of politics, we are walking away. What is perhaps most mind-boggling is how unlikely this would once have seemed. Twenty or so years ago, I can recall driving around the country to interview an assortment of people who wanted Britain to leave the EU: maverick Tory backbenchers, pamphleteers, eccentric academics. At a social event in Blackpool organised by the UK Independence party’s north-west branch, I listened to long soliloquies about secret plots to end parliamentary democracy, before being asked to draw the raffle, and handing the winner a banana plant. This was a reference to the briefly famous “metric martyr” Steve Thoburn, a market trader from Sunderland who had refused to sell fruit and veg in the metric units as required by an EU directive, and been taken to court by his local council.
Back then, it was still de rigueur to write about stories like these in a tone of gentle mockery. But what people like me didn’t realise was how much hostility to Britain’s membership of the EU had already permeated the culture. As the writer and Guardian columnist Hugo Young had pointed out, British discourse about Europe “seldom moved beyond the narrow modes of complaint, lecture and demand”. Tory Euroscepticism was edging towards support for a clean break. The rightwing press was now a monolithic source of hostility to the imagined monsters collapsed into the word “Brussels”, amplifying the voices of people who – to quote a 1988 article in the Sun – had “no desire whatsoever to become politically involved with foreigners with whom we have nothing in common”. Even Blair, hailed as the first truly European British prime minister, would sometimes play to the Eurosceptic gallery (“I will have no truck with a European superstate – if there are moves to create that dragon, I will slay it,” he once told Sun readers), and was fond of expressing British exceptionalism: “Not for us the malaise of France or the angst of Germany,” he said in 2005. Anti-EU prejudices had long since gripped the kind of voters who leaned Tory, and expressed their antipathy towards the EU from a position of relative affluence. But in 2016, that alone would not have been enough bring the leave side victory and set off the fitful chain of events that led to today. What made the difference was the mistrust and resentment sown by 35 years of rising insecurity and inequality, the effects of austerity, and the way that many people’s anger and dismay was focused on immigration. In 1998, Young said it was doubtful whether Euroscepticism had “any special connection with some embittered, unrepresented, forcibly silent majority”. But as the decade that began in 2010 rolled on, this was roughly what the forces behind Brexit pulled off. For six years, as I worked with my colleague John Domokos on the Guardian’s video series Anywhere But Westminster, I heard endless voices following much the same script, all over England and Wales (in Scotland they were noticeably thinner on the ground). Just before the referendum, I was in Southway, a somewhat pinched housing development on the northern edge of Plymouth. A man in a red hatchback saw we had a camera, rolled down his window and let rip. “This country’s dying on its knees, right?” he said. “I’d come out of the common market. I’d come out of the European court of human rights. I’d cut overseas aid. I’d abolish the licence fee. I’d kick out all the illegal immigrants. I’d sort out health, education, transport, defence, law and order.”
A month or so later, I visited Kidsgrove, near Stoke-on-Trent. I was with the local Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, and 20 or so Labour activists who were knocking on doors and trying to persuade people to back remain. The fact that I had been invited along proved that they had no idea what was about to hit them. When it did, it was sometimes shrill, and ugly – but in retrospect, this was the sound of the country’s subsequent course being set. Of 24 households they canvassed in 30 short minutes, 23 were voting leave; in 2019, all three of Stoke’s parliamentary seats were won by the Tories. “We want to be British,” said one woman. “We want our government to run our country, not someone we’ve not elected in another bloody country. And that’s it. I want my country back. I’m scared for my country. Scared.”
Some people were indeed scared. If they expressed fears about immigration, it was often impossible to separate their anxieties from worries about housing, work and the effects on their immediate environment of the cuts. But equally, time spent in any town or city would usually uncover a smattering of obvious racists and bigots. And whether their opinions were expressed hesitantly or with full force, some people’s readiness to make sweeping judgments about people from other cultures and countries seemed to be plumbing new depths – not least when it came to new arrivals from the key countries that had joined the EU in 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2013, I spent time in Peterborough, a growing city in the east of England whose large Polish population and Eurosceptic Tory MP seemed to make it a perfect place to explore where the country might be heading. “There’s too many people in the country [for us] to cope, to be honest,” one man told me. “Turf ’em out. Turf as many out as they can. Not in a bad way; I’m not a racist of any sort. But if they turf ’em out, we’ll all be better off.” He was mixed race. Occasionally, it started to feel as if a certain unease about immigration had become a strange token of integration: no longer the sole preserve of the irate white men who would soon be known as “gammon”, but beyond the progressive middle class, something that felt discomfitingly universal. Yet who were the people so many had decided should not have come here? The story of people from the so-called accession countries was the same essential story of newcomers to Britain down the ages. In Peterborough and the parts of eastern England that extended from Norfolk to Lincolnshire, thousands had arrived from eastern and central Europe and stoically taken jobs as shelf-stackers, crop-pickers and warehouse workers, often working impossible hours for woefully poor wages, and ensuring that large swathes of the consumer economy ticked over. Even if such towns as Wisbech and Boston often felt divided and uneasy, the children of Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians had enrolled at local schools, and begin to develop new hybrid identities. Among the people I met who had progressed to being managers, supervisors and homeowners, there seemed to be more faith in this country’s openings for the upwardly mobile than you would find among most British people. The fact that so many voters then opted to slam the door still seems grim, not least in the age of warm tributes to “key workers”. But the anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment that cohered around Brexit are now embodied in even more legislation. The new Immigration Act comes into force on 1 January , and replaces free movement with a points-based system that looks like it may drastically affect care work, warehousing, agriculture, food processing, and more: another likely source of problems that will soon start to reveal themselves.
All this may suggest that Brexit was almost entirely reducible to a great spasm of nastiness and loathing, something that suits an age of political polarisation. But we should not forget that, whatever else swirled around the referendum, votes for leaving the EU were also founded in optimism and hope – something brought home to me by a visit in March 2019 to Wigan in Greater Manchester, where 64% of local voters had backed Brexit and the intervening three years hardly seemed to have changed anyone’s opinion. On a cold Wednesday morning, I had a long conversation with Ian, an Amazon driver, who was beginning to wonder if Brexit would ever happen. “We voted out,” he said. “To get out and repair the country … They’ve done a lot of damage in the last few years, our government. They always do. They need to pay a bit more attention to what we need. Provide the money for policing, the NHS … Let’s bring it back, [and] build this country up again.” To all intents and purposes, this is the same vision of post-Brexit “levelling up” that will be at the heart of the immediate political future.
While I was there, I also met Charlie Dale, who was doing voluntary work at a local food project, having recently lost his job as a team leader with Asda. He was on universal credit, and regularly down to his last pennies. He told me he had voted leave, and would do so again. “Hopefully, we can get some jobs back in,” he said. When I said that Brexit was surely likely to make the country poorer, he replied without missing a beat: “How can I be poorer?” We met again six months later, when taking a job on zero-hours contract that delivered precious little work had worsened his predicament. He was living on soup and powdered milk and facing eviction, and had taken to staying in his house all day to preserve calories. On the TV in his ground-floor flat, Sky News was showing increasingly ugly demonstrations outside parliament as Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement once again hit the skids. In some inarticulable way, the noise and discord on the TV seemed to be of a piece with the impossibility of his day-to-day existence. “I think somebody’s going to get killed,” he said. “I wanted to leave, but the leave I wanted has been twisted.” Gesturing at the TV, he said that if he was asked again, he would vote remain, “just for all this to stop”. Four days after Christmas, I spoke to Charlie again. Since we last met, his lot had improved; he had a job with a local firm making ready meals, and had recently gone back to work after months of being furloughed. The government’s record on the pandemic and Boris Johnson’s leadership style, he said, had sustained his sense of regret about voting for Brexit, and the trade deal had not changed his mind. “I think Boris has been stitched up, with everything being decided at the last minute,” he said. “I don’t think the EU’s going to make it any easier for us. We’re in for a tricky year, aren’t we?”"
2021-01-01T06:05:49Z,politics,Politics,First lorries cross into France as Britain and Europe wake to new Brexit reality,"Moments after the UK left the EU with an 11th-hour deal, the first trucks hauling goods across the new customs border presented their clearance documents to French agents before loading on to a train to pass through the Eurotunnel. With Britain having finally quit the EU single market and customs union, there were no early signs of feared chaos at the border in the first hours of 1 January 2021. Ivanov Shumeykov was the first driver processed by officials late on New Yearâ€™s Eve. He smiled and waved as his HGV went through Eurotunnel controls in Folkestone, Kent just after 11pm. The first arrivals on the shuttle from France following the end of the Brexit transition period were expected at around 12.23am.
Scenes in Dover have been quiet as many hauliers have been staying away to avoid being the first to test new border controls. Freight flows through the Eurotunnelâ€™s Calais terminal were extremely light in the early hours of Friday morning. Yann Leriche, chief executive of Getlink which operates the Eurotunnel, told Reuters tweaks to customs procedures might be necessary but that there would be no chaos in the weeks ahead. But Matt Smith, managing director of HSF Logistics, which ships mainly fresh meat and chilled goods between Britain and Europe, said the new post-Brexit customs systems and paperwork were largely untested. â€œWeâ€™re not too sure to be honest, it seems to be a bit of a headache,â€� he told AFP. â€œThereâ€™ll be delays along the line at some stage.â€�
British and European businesses have warned of carnage as they learn to navigate a wall of red tape and paperwork that threatens to disrupt the smooth flow of nearly â‚¬1tn in annual trade. The Brexit transition periodâ€™s end still leaves Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market for goods. Northern Ireland will also apply the blocâ€™s customs rules at its ports, even though the region is still part of the UK customs territory, to prevent the return of a hard border with the Irish Republic. To avoid disrupting cross-border trade and a return of checkpoints along the politically sensitive Irish border, the EU and UK agreed to move new regulatory and customs processes to the Irish Sea. That means checks are focused on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Many hauliers based in Northern Ireland will keep volumes light for the first few days of 2021 as they wait to see what the impact will be, industry figures have said. While the UK formally departed the EU at the end of January 2020, a transition period meant almost all tangible changes were deferred â€“ until now. From Friday morning, individuals and businesses both in the UK and beyond face a dizzying new array of red tape, a good deal of it still to be confirmed, covering everything from travel, residency, work and tourism, to the supply of goods and services. Considerable government anxiety remains focused on the situation at the Channel ports in Kent, particularly after Covid-related delays earlier in December saw thousands of lorries backed up at a disused airfield â€“ one of 10 sites prepared for possible Brexit-caused disruption. Officials are hopeful of a smooth start to the new era but are braced for possible delays next week, with government estimates suggesting that more than half of smaller businesses have not yet prepared for the end of the free movement of goods and services. Boris Johnson largely ignored Brexit in his New Year message to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic instead, heralding the end of a year â€œin which the government was forced to tell people how to live their lives, how long to wash their hands, how many households could meet togetherâ€�. But he did say that the UK had â€œfreedom in our handsâ€� and the ability to do things â€œdifferently and betterâ€� now the long Brexit process was over. On Thursday night French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK remained a â€œfriend and allyâ€�. As the clock struck midnight in the UK, Scotlandâ€™s pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: â€œScotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on.â€�
Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who played a key role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, revelled in the milestone, writing: â€œ25 years ago they all laughed at me. Well, theyâ€™re not laughing now.â€�
In a video message, Farage said, â€œThis is a moment to celebrate: 2021 as an independent United Kingdom. Cheers!â€� before leaning into the camera and saying conspiratorially: â€œShame the pubs arenâ€™t open.â€�
Thursday night marked the end of many previous freedoms for British individuals and businesses, even to the extent of restricting where freight drivers can travel within the UK. To mitigate against the buildup of lorries at Channel ports, hauliers now need what is called a Kent access permit, or â€œkermitâ€� for short, to even enter the county. From Friday, those without the 24-hour pass can be pulled over by government officers, fined Â£300, and sent back. One issue left unresolved in the trade deal, agreed between Johnson and the EU on Christmas Eve and voted into law by parliament on Wednesday, has been partially settled. A last-minute agreement between the UK government and Spain will allow Gibraltarians to move freely between the British overseas territory and the EU â€“ but the agreement will only come into force later in the year."
2021-01-01T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,'We feel in a bit of a no man’s land': Brexit brings mixed feelings in Trowbridge,"As the UK’s departure from the EU loomed, Alex Joll, who runs the Free Range Cafe in Trowbridge’s grand old town hall, thought he had better stockpile one of his key products. “It’s quite random,” he said. “Our coffee comes from Peru, but is stored in a huge warehouse in Germany before coming to the UK, where it is roasted. I thought I’d better stock up just in case. I got in an extra month’s worth a little while ago to tide us over just in case.”
Joll voted for Brexit. “For all sorts of reasons, really. I don’t think the EU was the right institution for the UK to operate in. I’ve lived in France and Spain and am married to a Spanish woman. I think they’ll let us back in when we want to go. It was time for a change.” Ben Laver, 18, who was doing a shift at the cafe, was too young to vote in the EU referendum. He would have plumped for remain. “As a young person, the economic insecurity of leaving the EU is concerning. I don’t think all that was promised – the extra money for the NHS, all the fishing rights – has come to fruition.”
Laver is a member of an alt-rock band called Enter Red. He worries that the departure from the EU will make it harder for his band, which tours the south-west of England, to venture overseas. “Usually you get the cheapest plane ticket, sleep where you can and then dash home. Paying hundreds of pounds for visas may not make it viable for us.” A majority of people who live in Wiltshire – 52.5% – voted for leave. With hours to go before the UK’s final exit, there was no sense of jubilation in the county town of Trowbridge. And for many people, there was a bit of extra work to be done, more rules to read.
Sam Rose, a director of a recruitment company, was to be found ploughing through regulations trying to work out how the changes would affect her business. “We feel in a bit of a no man’s land at the moment,” she said. Her company provides labour for many of the factories, workshops and food-processing plants on the industrial estates on the outskirts of Trowbridge. For years, a steady stream of workers from eastern Europe has arrived here.
“That has been slowing down,” Rose said. Because coronavirus has led to more British people losing their jobs, there is no shortage of labour at the moment. “But we don’t know whether that will change.” Some of the factories for which she supplies labour are reporting concerns that their supply chains with Europe will be impacted. “That could have a knock-on effect on us,” she said. Trowbridge has long attracted people from across the globe. It has large Italian and Moroccan communities and is twinned with the Moroccan city of Oujda. Serkan Ozturk, who is of Turkish origin, set up a fruit and veg shop in the centre of the town in the summer, a bold venture in the time of Covid. “It has been hard,” he said. Now he is a little worried that Brexit could lead to an increase in the price of his fruit. “But I think Brexit will be good for the UK in the end,” he said. Wiltshire’s farmers are not so sure. Nick Bush has an arable and sheep farm north of Trowbridge. He is pleased that there is a deal, but says it is just the start, rather than the end, of the next chapter for British agriculture.
“The fact we have a deal is a good starting point,” Bush said. But he worries that there still could be “hitches” at the borders and is keen to know more about the new environmental land management (ELM) scheme, which will largely replace schemes that have been available under the common agricultural policy. Farmers will not remain quiet if things do not work out. “I like the fact that the government now has to answer more directly to farmers,” said Bush. “They can’t hide behind the EU and say it’s their fault now.” The leader of Trowbridge town council, Stewart Palmen, is sad at the departure from the EU. A Liberal Democrat, he campaigned for remain and for a second referendum.
“What worries me is the ‘little Britain’ attitude. I see us as just being part of the world. My father’s Finnish and I’ve always classed myself as European. Today I’m angry about my citizenship being taken away and my identity being restricted.” His Tory counterpart on the council, Antonio Piazza, also voted for remain but said the deal was a “huge relief”. “I think people are ready for a fresh start, to get on with our lives and think about the positives, such as the new trade deals and relationships with other countries.” Piazza’s family has paperwork to do. His father, Onofrio, a barber in the town, came to the south-west of England from Italy in the 1970s and settled but still has Italian citizenship. “He has a form to complete to stay in the UK,” said Piazza. “But that shouldn’t be complicated.” Piazza said he loved the multiculturalism of Trowbridge. “That won’t change. It is possible to leave the EU and still love Europe.”"
2021-01-01T00:53:18Z,politics,Politics,"'Keep the light on': joy for some, regret for others at Brexit endgame","Politicians in Britain and the EU have expressed triumph while others voiced bitter regret after the UKâ€™s Brexit transition period ended on Thursday night. Britain left the European blocâ€™s vast single market for goods, services and the movement of people at 11pm GMT on New Yearâ€™s Eve â€“ midnight in Brussels â€“ completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since the second world war. For some, including the prime minister, it was moment of pride. Boris Johnson said the UK was now â€œfree to do trade deals around the world, and free to turbocharge our ambition to be a science superpowerâ€�. But in Scotland, which voted strongly in the 2016 Brexit referendum to remain, the pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: â€œScotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on.â€�
The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who played a key role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, tweeted: â€œ25 years ago they all laughed at me. Well, theyâ€™re not laughing now.â€�
He also wrote: â€œThis is a big moment for our country, a giant leap forward. Time to raise a glass. BrexitAtLast.â€� The UKâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, said the UK had a â€œgreat future before usâ€� with the chance to â€œbuild a better country for us allâ€�.
The Conservative MP Bill Cash, who has campaigned for Brexit for decades, said it was a â€œvictory for democracy and sovereignty.â€� On Friday morning, anti-Brexit Labour peer and former Transport minister Andrew Adonis said: â€œThe very first day of Brexit is a massive rupture of the UKâ€�.
Across the Channel the view was different. In his new yearâ€™s address, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed regret. â€œThe United Kingdom remains our neighbour but also our friend and ally,â€� he said. â€œThis choice of leaving Europe, this Brexit, was the child of European malaise and lots of lies and false promises.â€� The divorce could also have major constitutional repercussions for the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland, which shares a border with EU member the Republic of Ireland, remains more closely tied to the blocâ€™s economy under the divorce terms, a status some fear could pull it away from the rest of the UK. Many in Britain felt apprehension about Brexit taking place during a pandemic that has upended life around the world. â€œI feel very sad that weâ€™re leaving,â€� said Jen Pearcy-Edwards, a film-maker in London. â€œI think that Covid has overshadowed everything that is going on. But I think the other thing that has happened is that people feel a bigger sense of community, and I think that makes it even sadder that weâ€™re breaking up our community a bit, by leaving our neighbours in Europe. â€œIâ€™m hopeful that we find other ways to rebuild ties.â€�"
2020-12-31T23:00:53Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: in crisis, without fanfare, UK finally ends the EU era","Four years, 27 weeks and two days after a referendum that split the country almost down the middle, the UK left the EU’s orbit on Thursday night in a departure that was notably low key, and marked by warnings of likely disruption to come. In a sometimes sombre new year message, Boris Johnson largely ignored Brexit, an outcome he arguably shaped more than any other politician, to focus instead on the toll of Covid-19 and what he called “the grimness of 2020”. With the majority of England subject to tough restrictions, and hospitals warning of a calamitous winter coronavirus crisis in the weeks ahead, the chimes of Big Ben, temporarily reconnected from ongoing restoration work, sounded across near empty streets at 11pm. This was the pivotal moment for Brexit. While the UK formally departed the EU at the end of January 2020, a transition period meant almost all tangible changes were deferred – until now. From Friday morning, individuals and businesses both in the UK and beyond face a dizzying new array of red tape, a good deal of it still to be confirmed, covering everything from travel, residency, work and tourism, to the supply of goods and services. Considerable government anxiety remains focused on the situation at the Channel ports in Kent, particularly after Covid-related delays earlier in December saw thousands of lorries backed up at a disused airfield – one of 10 sites prepared for possible Brexit-caused disruption. The moment of Brexit passed without ceremony in Dover. The town had a ghost-like quality, Covid emptying it of new year’s celebrations, as it approached 11pm with half a dozen trucks trying to make it over the line before the new trade barriers were erected. Greeted by two police officers, they were told the last ferry had departed at 9pm for France. Those who had evidence of a Covid-19 test in the last 72 hours were allowed through to the small lorry park at the port where they could sleep overnight before boarding the 7:40am ferry, the first voyage from Dover under new Brexit trading rules. Officials are hopeful of a smooth start to the new era but are braced for possible delays next week, with government estimates suggesting that more than half of smaller businesses have not yet prepared for the end of the free movement of goods and services. It all adds to a prime ministerial in-tray already overflowing with the impact of coronavirus, not least the government’s decision to defer the return to school of some pupils next week, and with Labour accusing the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of “serial incompetence”. Johnson used much of his New Year message to herald the end of a year “in which the government was forced to tell people how to live their lives, how long to wash their hands, how many households could meet together”. It was a far cry from his 2019 message, where fresh from a crushing election victory, the prime minister promised “a fantastic year and a remarkable decade for our United Kingdom”. Johnson did maintain some of his trademark Brexit boosterism this time, arguing that the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was illustrative of a UK “free to do things differently, and if necessary better, than our friends in the EU”. “This is an amazing moment for this country,” Johnson said, citing what he said were boundless possibilities with trade and innovation. “We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it.” The reality, at least in the short term, is that 11pm on Thursday marked the end of many previous freedoms for British individuals and businesses, even to the extent of restricting where freight drivers can travel within the UK. To mitigate the buildup of lorries at Channel ports, hauliers now need what is called a Kent access permit, or “kermit” for short, to even enter the county. From Friday, those without the 24-hour pass can be pulled over by government officers, fined £300, and sent back. However, one issue left unresolved in the trade deal, agreed between Johnson and the EU on Christmas Eve and voted into law by parliament on Wednesday, has been partially settled. A last-minute agreement between the UK government and Spain will allow Gibraltarians to move freely between the British overseas territory and the EU – but the agreement will only come into force later in the year. Spain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, said she expected border controls, albeit lightly applied, to be required for the next six months to allow for the deal in principle to be formalised. Under the agreement, Gibraltar will be part of the EU’s Schengen free-travel zone. Checks will instead be undertaken at the Rock’s airport and ports by the EU’s Frontex border agency, a point of contention in talks with the British government. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, said: “All sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the transition period on Gibraltar, and in particular [to] ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides. We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty.” Spain has refused to allow the post-Brexit trade and security deal to be applied to Gibraltar, over which it has a territorial claim. The head of Gibraltar’s government, Fabian Picardo, said: “There will be complexity to come … we may end up with a deal on the [free] movement of people but not goods.” Northern Ireland will similarly see a more phased-in approach to the post-Brexit world, with the requirement for customs declarations when retailers in Great Britain send goods to non-business customers in Northern Ireland deferred for three months. With Northern Ireland remaining under the rules of the EU’s single market and customs union, animal-based food products shipped there from the rest of the UK will also require export health certificates from April."

2020-12-31T19:50:56Z,politics,Politics,"Dover eerily quiet on Brexit eve, but hauliers fear more chaos","After a week of mayhem, the roads of Kent are eerily deserted, almost devoid of freight traffic as lorry drivers from all over the EU avoid Dover and the Eurotunnel as the Brexit transition period ends. The only reminder of the potential for Brexit chaos are the miles and miles of detritus – plastic bottles, shopping bags, and even towels – strewn along the banks of the southbound M20 motorway to the cliffs of Dover. The government modelled plans for up to 7,000 lorries stuck in Kent in the wake of Brexit trade barriers going up at 11pm on the EU side of the channel. But all the evidence suggests importers have done their stockpiling and will be avoiding the port as the UK’s 30-year membership of the single market abruptly ends. Just a trickle of lorries entered the Eurotunnel, and there seemed to be fewer than a handful heading to Dover early on Thursday evening. Eurotunnel said traffic was usually quiet around new year; it was exceptionally so this year because so many importers had rushed to bring supplies in before 1 January, hence the heightened levels of traffic brought to a halt when the French slapped a Covid travel ban on freight just before Christmas.
Rod McKenzie, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), said: “I don’t think we will start to see things getting back to normal levels of traffic until the second week in January. Even then I think the real chaos is going to be invisible chaos. “People don’t know what paperwork they have to fill in, haven’t dealt with customs declarations before, and if they don’t get that filled in properly, they don’t get the Kent access permit to travel into the county, so they will be stuck at depots and distribution centres around the country.” The Kent access permit, KAP, or “Kermit” as it has been dubbed, is mandatory for all drivers wanting to cross the Channel after 11pm on 31 December. Officials said that so far only about 450 of these 24-hour permits had been issued. The slow take-up was feeding fears that there could be a partial repeat of the pre-Christmas chaos with lorries halted or told to turn back if they do not have the Brexit passport in the coming weeks. Drivers without a permit could be pulled over by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency using automatic number plate recognition and potentially fined £300, the officials said. The concerns have been echoed by the RHA, with estimates that 50% or more of small- to medium-sized companies might not be ready for the border checks, which could raise the prospect of chaos later in January as supply chains become forced out of Brexit hibernation. In Ashford, just a few miles north of Dover, the hum of construction continues into the night on the 66-acre lorry park destined to be a holding pen for more than 1,000 vehicles.
Many people in the area are mourning the loss of the fields and their environmental benefits. “The downs on the left and the vale on the right – you could walk right through to Mersham village. It was lovely to do on a summer’s evening, but obviously the government had other ideas,” said Hugh Tyman, who was walking his dog, Willow, at a small housing estate on the other side of a dual carriageway separating residents from the lorry park. Did he vote to leave the EU? “I did support it, but we weren’t told enough about how it would work by the politicians. Now they’ve done the deal and we don’t know the ins and outs of it either. I probably wouldn’t vote for it now that I know about all the paperwork, and the travel rules changing,” he said. Another local in a country cottage on a former rural lane shouldering the vast site was also upset and said she hoped to get compensation. “My daughter grew up looking over cornfields,” she said. “There is just a constant drone of generators and it won’t stop after construction because the refrigerator lorries will have their generators on all night. The construction workers had four days off over Christmas –it was just lovely.” Down the road, John Lang and his wife, Cherylynn, thought they had bought a rural idyll to retire to when the Guardian first told them about the government acquisition in July. Like the rest of the residents, they said, there was no warning or consultation on the lorry park. They lost their 360-degree view of farmland and now look out on a pine-yellow four-metre-high perimeter fence at two sides of their house. “It’s like living in a compound, it’s hideous,” said Cherylynn. John voted for Brexit and said he was optimistic about the future but did not think it would do much for Kent, which voted to leave the EU. “I can’t see what the benefit for us here in Kent is,” he said. He said that lorries were now accidentally coming down his country lane “because the postcode is the same as the lorry park”. He hoped ultimately it would be sorted out.
Stewart Wickham, a bus driver, was delighted that a trade deal had been reached because it meant the international driver permit lottery would no longer threaten his livelihood. “I’ve just taken the GB hockey team over to Brussels and Amsterdam, and next week we find out if we are taking to them to their winter training ground in Malaga. If there wasn’t a deal, I wouldn’t have been able to do that,” he said."

2020-12-31T15:02:57Z,politics,Politics,Tampon tax: government axes VAT on sanitary products,"The tampon tax has been abolished after the government honoured its March commitment to remove VAT on women’s sanitary products. But the campaigner who played a pivotal role in the drive to axe the tax has accused the government of using the issue as a political football, after politicians said it had been scrapped thanks to Brexit. Existing EU law prevented member states from reducing VAT below 5%. Laura Coryton, who started the Stop Taxing Periods campaign in May 2014 while a student at Goldsmiths, said the Brexit process had made it less likely that the tampon tax would be abolished throughout Europe. She said: “It is a day for celebration today, but it is just frustrating that the tampon tax is being used as a political football in terms of Brexit.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he was “proud” the government had delivered on its promise, adding that it was providing free sanitary products in schools, colleges and hospitals. Speaking at Wednesday’s Brexit debate, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the Commons liaison select committee, said: “We will be able to do things like abolish the tampon tax, which so many honourable ladies opposite railed against the government about, only because we’re leaving the EU.” Coryton said it was frustrating to hear the scrapping of the tax cited as a victory for Brexit, and hear little mention of the more than 320,000 people who had signed the petition, and campaigning MPs such as Labour’s Stella Creasy and the former Labour MP Paula Sherriff. “It’s great that the government is taking it really seriously – if the prime minister can talk about periods, surely anyone can talk about periods,” she said. “But it’s frustrating … to make this campaign into a pro-Brexit thing, because it doesn’t reflect the many different types of people who have been campaigning for it.”
Also, it’s not true, she said, adding that in 2016 – under pressure from the then prime minister, David Cameron, the European parliament had voted unanimously to start the regulatory process to allow any EU country to abolish any tampon tax. “That process has since gone cold, because we then left the EU and we were the ones pushing for it,” said Coryton. “So if anything, actually, Brexit has made it worse, because if we were to have stayed in the EU, then this piece of legislation would have gone through… then any EU member would be able to axe the tax, not just the UK.” In 2018 the European commission published proposals to change EU VAT rules, which could allow countries to axe the tampon tax in their countries, but it is yet to be agreed on by all member states. Since 2015 the £15m funds the tampon tax has raised in the UK have been directed to women’s refuges and domestic abuse charities. “The tampon tax has long been a symbol of policymaking based around men’s needs, so removing VAT is symbolically important,”’ said Mary-Ann Stephenson of the Women’s Budget Group. “But the tampon tax money has been an important source of funding for the women’s sector – the government needs to be clear about what will replace it.”"
2020-12-31T13:18:35Z,politics,Politics,Stanley Johnson confirms application for French passport on eve of Brexit,"Boris Johnson’s father Stanley has confirmed that he is applying for a French passport on the eve of Britain’s Brexit transition period coming to an end. In an interview with the French radio station RTL, he said: “It’s not a question of becoming French. If I understand correctly I am French! My mother was born in France, her mother was completely French as was her grandfather. “For me it’s a question of obtaining what I already have and I am very happy about that.” Johnson, 80, served as an MEP 40 years ago, and was one of the first UK civil servants to work in Brussels after Britain joined the European Union, then the European Economic Community, in 1973. He went on to work for the European commission. He campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU in 2016, while his son led the leave movement. Britain’s transition period will end at 11pm on Thursday, after parliament voted through the prime minister’s post-Brexit trade deal on Wednesday. The UK will no longer be affected by the EU’s freedom of movement rules, meaning among other things that millions will lose the automatic right to work in the EU’s 27 member states. Thousands of Britons have acquired EU citizenship since the Brexit vote. More than 350,000 had applied for nationality of another EU state as of January this year. Close historical ties between Ireland and the UK put the country at the top of the league of EU passports held by dual-national Britons. According to AFP, Johnson said in his interview: “I will always be European, that’s for sure. “You can’t tell the English ‘you’re not European’. Europe is more than the single market, it’s more than the European Union. “That said, to have a link like that with the EU is important,” he concluded, apparently referring to an EU passport. His plans to seek a French passport had already been revealed by his daughter Rachel in a book published in March. She wrote that her grandmother had been born in Versailles and that if her father received French citizenship she too would like to become French."
2020-12-31T12:21:53Z,politics,Politics,"View from the EU: Britain 'taken over by gamblers, liars, clowns and their cheerleaders'","Britain faces an uncertain future as it finally pulls clear of the EU’s orbit, continental commentators have predicted, its reputation for pragmatism and probity shredded by a Brexit process most see as profoundly populist and dangerously dishonest. “For us, the UK has always been seen as like-minded: economically progressive, politically stable, respect for the rule of law – a beacon of western liberal democracy,” said Rem Korteweg, of the Clingendael Institute thinktank in the Netherlands. “I’m afraid that’s been seriously hit by the past four years. The Dutch have seen a country in a deep identity crisis; it’s been like watching a close friend go through a really, really difficult time. Brexit is an exercise in emotion, not rationality; in choosing your own facts. And it’s not clear how it will end.” Britain’s long-polished pragmatic image had been “seriously tarnished”, agreed Nicolai von Ondarza, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. But trust in the UK, too, had taken a heavy battering on the Brexit rollercoaster. “That’s particularly been the case over the past year,” Von Ondarza said. “Boris Johnson has always been seen as a bit of a gambler, displaying a certain … flexibility with the truth. But observing him him as prime minister has only made that worse.” Germans tended to view international politics “very much through the prism of international law”, Von Ondarza said, so Johnson’s willingness to ignore it – in the form, particularly, of the internal market bill – was deeply shocking. “The idea that you’d willingly violate an international treaty that you’d negotiated and signed barely eight months previously … That’s just not something you do among allies,” he said. “That whole episode really damaged Britain’s credibility.” Others were more brutal still. In Der Spiegel, Nikolaus Blome said there was “absolutely nothing good about Brexit … which would never have happened had Conservative politicians not, to a quite unprecedented degree, deceived and lied to their people”. Much of the British media, Blome said, “were complicit, constantly trampling on fairness and facts”, leaving Britain “captured by gambling liars, frivolous clowns and their paid cheerleaders. They have destroyed my Europe, to which the UK belonged as much as France or Germany.” But Johnson’s lies were the biggest of all, he said: “‘Take back control,’ Johnson lied to his citizens. But all the British government will finally have achieved is to have taken back control of a little shovel and a little sand castle.” The “sovereignty” in whose name Brexit was done remained, essentially, a myth, said Jean-Dominique Giuliani, of the Robert Schuman Foundation in France. “It is history, geography, culture, language and traditions that make up the identity of a people,” Giuliani said, “not their political organisation.” It is “wrong to believe peoples and states can permanently free themselves from each other, or take decisions without considering the consequences for their citizens and partners. ‘Take back control’ is a nationalist, populist slogan that ignores the reality of an interdependent world … Our maritime neighbour will be much weakened.” The German historian Helene von Bismarck doubted Brexit would end what she described as a very British brand of populism. “British populism is a political method, not an ideology, and it does not become redundant with Brexit,” she said. Von Bismarck identified two key elements in this method: an emotionalisation and over-simplification of highly complex issues, such as Brexit, the Covid pandemic or migration, and a reliance on bogeymen or enemies at home and abroad. “Populists depend on enemies, real or imagined, to legitimise their actions and deflect from their own shortcomings,” she said. If the EU has been the “enemy abroad” since 2016, it will steadily be replaced by “enemies within”: MPs, civil servants, judges, lawyers, experts, the BBC. “Individuals and institutions who dare to limit the power of the executive, even if it is just by asking questions, are at constant risk of being denounced as ‘activists’” by the Johnson government, Von Bismarck said. “Everyone has political motives – except for the government, which seeks to define ‘neutrality’.” Brexit itself is being framed as “the grand departure, the moment the UK is finally free and sovereign, when all problems can be solved with common sense and optimism – justifying a more ‘pragmatic’ approach to rules, constitutional conventions and institutions” that actually amounts to a “worrying disregard for the rule of law”. “British populism” would continue, she said, especially when the real, hard consequences of the pandemic and Brexit started to bite. “It is naive to expect a political style which ridicules complexity, presents people with bogeymen to despise, and prides itself on ‘doing what it necessary’ even if ‘elites’ and institutions get in the way, to lose its appeal in times of hardship,” she said. Elvire Fabry, of France’s Institut Jacques Delors, said the past four years had shown Europeans and Britons “just how little we really knew each other”. They had also revealed, she said, the fragility of a parliamentary system seen by many on the continent as a point of reference. “It’s been difficult for us to anticipate, at times even to interpret, what’s happened” in the UK, Fabry said. “The direction Johnson has taken the Conservative party in – we didn’t see that coming. The course he’s setting for the country. The polarisation. And the way MPs have been bypassed since he became prime minister ….” Most striking of all, she said, was how the politics prevailing in Britain had become “detached from geopolitical reality – from the way the world is developing. It’s a political vision turned towards yesterday’s world. Ideological. The way the trade deal focused on goods at the expense of services … It’s not the way the world’s going.” Painful as the Brexit process may have been for Europeans, however, it had at least demonstrated “the reality and value of the single market, its rules and norms, and of the EU’s basis in law”, Fabry said. “Those are at the heart of the European identity – and defending them has given the union a new political maturity.” It had also, concluded Korteweg, served as a warning. “I think it’s taught us all just how vulnerable our political processes are,” he said. “Just eight years ago, leaving the EU was a seriously fringe proposition in British politics, and now look where you are. So we’ve seen how fragile it all is, what we’ve built – and how worth defending.”"
2020-12-31T11:42:06Z,politics,Politics,Passports and permits: what are the biggest changes to expect after Brexit?,"The bells of Big Ben will chime to mark the occasion but there will be no street parties or chaos on the roads for the arrival of Brexit at 11pm, when the transition period ends. Covid curbs mean the roads of Kent and streets of Dover, emblematic of the divorce from the EU, are expected to be deserted with little public sign of the abrupt end of a 47-year relationship with the EU. Industry leaders are warning, however, of “invisible chaos” in the coming weeks as businesses grapple with new trading rules and software systems required from day one for exports to the EU. While the UK has decided to phase in reciprocal checks over six months, in Northern Ireland they will be operational from day one, raising fears of immediate chaos and confusion despite a £200m support scheme put in place by the government and a grace period for supermarkets. So what are the biggest changes caused by Brexit? Immigration Those who arrive for the first time after 1 January will have to go through the new points-based system requiring a minimum salary of £25,600 for skilled workers and £20,480 for those with job offers in a shortage occupation or in possession of a PhD relevant to the job.
British nationals travelling to Europe on holiday will be able to do so visa-free for 90 days in a 180-day period but will lose the automatic right to live and work in an EU country. Passport and other checks at the airport The “arriving from the EU” lane will disappear at airports and replaced with “goods to declare” or “nothing to declare”. There will be limits on alcohol and cigarette purchases from the EU on entry to the UK. The Home Office says Border Force has recruited more than 1,000 extra officers and is training its staff on changes to policy and processes. EU citizens will continue to be subject to ID and security checks and may be asked about the purpose of their journey. Border officials will be able to check if they have settled or pre-settled status. They will only do this if there is a “specific reason to do so”, according to the Home Office. EU citizens can continue to use e-passport gates and existing queues – so no separate channel to UK nationals at airports. Some EU citizens not living in the UK may need a “permitted paid engagement” visa if they are visiting for work. EU citizens British nationals already settled in Europe have the right to remain although with restrictions on their movements to other EU countries. EU citizens in the UK before 31 December are entitled to stay but campaigners warn they have only six months to make sure they are granted settled status or pre-settled status by the Home Office. “The government says ‘you can do this’ by 30 June, but the message should be ‘you must do this or you will lose all your rights’, including your right to live and work in the country, right to healthcare and family reunion rights,” said Maike Bohn, one of the founders of the campaign group the3million. “We worry about EU citizens losing their temporary pre-settled status and not qualifying for settled status due to absences that are often Covid-related. We continue to be very worried about those who do not realise they could lose all their rights from 1 July 2021, and those who will face discrimination and obstacles because they do not get a physical proof of their rights,” she said. Landlords and employers Landlords and employers face sanctions for employing or renting to people not entitled to be in the country, but 1 January will not mean an immediate change for those employing EU citizens already in the UK. “For landlords there will be no immediate changes to what they are doing already,” said Meera Chindooroy, deputy campaigns director for the National Residential Landlords Association. “Until 30 June right-to-rent checks will continue in the same way as they do now for EU citizens, along with those from Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Landlords will not, for example, need to make retrospective checks for existing tenants from 2021,” she added. But she said it was crucial the government published clear guidance to ensure landlords understand their responsibilities from July. Will there be border chaos? Postmortems on why food and toilets could not get to the thousands of lorry drivers stuck on the roads in Kent despite two years of planning for such scenes will continue. But Eurotunnel and the ports of Dover and Calais all agree they do not expect a repeat of the horrific scenes seen on Kent roads before Christmas this weekend. They say that freight traffic is typically quieter in the first week in January but will be especially so in 2021 because so many companies stockpiled goods specifically to avoid the border in the first part of January. “There is not going to be much traffic on 1 January or the 2 January but I think what we are going to see is invisible chaos in the coming weeks because people simply haven’t done the right paperwork before they get to Dover. “There won’t be food shortages but you may well find that some supplies are delayed because people will make mistakes in filling out the new paperwork. “We keep hearing that all the time, both from traders and hauliers, that there is a lack of awareness, we don’t know what needs to be done, and therefore if they’re trying to fill in the forms especially without professional help they will make mistakes,” said Rod McKenzie, policy director at the Road Haulage Association. Customs All businesses are required to provide a customs declaration on goods sent into the EU, including Ireland and Northern Ireland (which will follow EU customs rules). They must also know if VAT is applicable and ensure fees are cleared before transit or on arrival. Lorry drivers going into Kent must satisfy HMRC they have all the correct paperwork by applying online for a Kent Access Permit, dubbed the Brexit truckers’ passport. Those carrying chilled, frozen food or animals, including race horses, will need health certificates for their cargo to prove to the French they are disease- and pest-free. Businesses also have to have an economic operators registration and identification system (EORI) for the exporter and the recipient, including special numbers for Northern Ireland prefixed by XI. Freight owners who have not supplied drivers with the correct customs paperwork or health certificates for food consignments will not get the Kent Access Permit they need to get into the county and “will be stuck in depots and distribution centres around the country and that’s what I mean by invisible,” said McKenzie."
2020-12-31T08:00:35Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: what are consumers' rights on holidays, banking and more?","Holidays Will my Ehic card still work? Yes and no. Under the agreement if you have a European health insurance card (Ehic), which entitles visitors to necessary state healthcare (such as accident and emergency) for free or at a reduced cost, it remains valid in the EU until it expires. The good news is that a last-minute replacement is being developed, called the global health insurance card (GHIC). It will remain free, and while you cannot apply for a GHIC yet, applications will open in the new year. The bad news is that details about it are at best sketchy. In background briefings, the government is saying that it will operate like the Ehic scheme, with a few important differences. It will cover you for travel in EU countries, but not if you are going to Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Transitional arrangements have been put in place for Norway allowing UK nationals to use their UK passport to access state provided medical treatment if necessary. The government is also negotiating new arrangements with Switzerland and the EEA/Efta states that could result in Ehic-style reciprocal healthcare cover there. A UK national who doesn’t have an Ehic or GHIC is still entitled to necessary healthcare if needed when travelling in the EU. People should contact NHS Business Services Authority, which can issue a provisional replacement certificate that will cover the same costs. Will I need travel insurance? It is not a legal requirement that a traveller buys insurance when visiting the EU, but for the vast majority of people it would be daft not to, with scores of annual multitrip policies costing less than £50 a year available for travel to Europe for next year. There have been widespread concerns about the cost of travel insurance post Brexit as the Ehic is withdrawn – particularly for those with pre-existing conditions – but that has been somewhat allayed by the last-minute introduction of the GHIC (see above). Can I still drive abroad? Your UK driving licence will be valid in Europe after 1 January. Previously it was understood that UK drivers would have to apply at the Post Office for one of two (or both) international driving permits depending on the destination country. However, if you are taking your own car or other vehicle abroad, you will need to apply to your insurer for a green card, which is proof that you have cover. There shouldn’t be a charge – except perhaps an administration fee, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which says it will probably arrive via email. You should print it out and be ready to show it if asked by the police or other authorities. Note that Northern Irish drivers who cross to the Republic will also need one. The ABI says the EU could end the green card requirement in the coming months, but until that changes you will need one.
Can I take my dog to Europe? The old EU pet passports are no longer valid. Instead the EU has agreed that Great Britain should be given “part two listed” status, allowing pets to travel within its borders providing the owners obtain an animal health certificate (AHC). This confirms that your pet is microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. You will need to get a new certificate each time you travel up to 10 days prior to travel. The AHC will be valid for four months. MB Will I still get compensation for delayed flights? There had been concerns that the EU flight compensation rights – which enabled passengers to claim up to €250 (£225) to €600 on delayed or cancelled flights – would be lost after Brexit. The regulations are now enshrined in UK law but as they are no longer protected by the EU, the UK government could in future make changes to the levels of compensation. Consumer rights Will I pay more for cross-border shopping? Any item bought online from the EU and sent to the UK may incur VAT charges and handling fees, depending on its value, and whether it is a gift or commercial goods, according to Royal Mail. “For items under £135 (with the exception of gifts), VAT will be collected directly when they buy the goods online. For goods with a value over £135 (and gifts over £39), Royal Mail may collect the VAT and customs duties from the customer prior to delivery,” it says.
Will it be more expensive to use my mobile phone in the EU? The right to use your UK phone allowance while in Europe has ended, meaning there is nothing to stop the phone companies reintroducing roaming charges. The big four main providers – EE, 02, Vodafone and Three – have said they have no plans to do so. As part of the “deal”, the UK and EU have agreed to cooperate on “fair and transparent” rates for mobile roaming. It remains to be seen what that means. UK nationals in Europe Will I still get a UK pension? Yes. UK pensioners who have retired to an EU country have already been guaranteed that they will be able to receive the UK state pension, and benefit from any annual increases. For people who intend to retire to the EU nation in future, the same applies. If you are receiving a private pension – such as an annuity – from the UK but are resident abroad, the government says you should contact your provider. But in general it says: “UK law allows for workplace pensions to be paid overseas. The government does not expect this to change because the UK has left the EU.” Can I have a UK bank account? Thousands of Britons resident in the EU were told in September that they will have their UK bank accounts closed by the end of the year. UK banks have operated across the EU under passporting arrangements that expire at the end of the year. Account holders who bank with firms that own an EU-based subsidiary will see their accounts transferred to that entity. But where that is not the case, accounts are likely to be closed. The Netherlands is particularly affected: Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide and Co-operative banks have withdrawn services. Lloyds Group, which includes Bank of Scotland and Halifax, says those affected are retail (personal) accounts in the Netherlands and Slovakia, and business banking customers in the Netherlands, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Portugal. Nationwide will no longer serve Italy. Barclays is closing accounts for customers in Belgium, Estonia, Italy and Slovakia and Barclaycard accounts across the EEA will be closed unless linked to a UK address.
EU nationals in the UK Will I need extra paperwork to apply for a rented home or credit? The controversial “right to rent” rules were introduced in 2016 in England and require a landlord to check the immigration status of a tenant or face hefty penalties. Currently, EU citizens can do so by showing a passport or national identity card, but from July 2021 they will have to prove they have “settled” or “pre-settled” status. The government’s guide for landlords says: “New guidance on how to conduct right to rent checks on EEA and Swiss nationals after 30 June 2021 will be provided in advance of this date.” So for now, it’s not absolutely clear what tenants will have to do. But the3million.org.uk group, which represents EU nationals in the UK, is concerned that proof of settled status is only provided digitally and that they are “guinea pigs” in a Home Office trial. Under the digital scheme, tenants can provide a share-code to prospective landlords so they can check their status. Will I be able to claim benefits? EU nationals will need to apply to the EU settlement scheme by 30 June 2021 to remain in the UK and be eligible to claim benefits. Settled status proves the individual’s right to reside, which is a key element in determining benefits. They will also have to prove that the UK is their main home and they plan to stay – known as being “habitually resident”. Citizens Advice has a guide for EU nationals wanting to know more. • This article was amended on 5 January 2021. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the new animal health certificates would allow “travel to and from the EU multiple times” within a four-month period. They are valid for only one entry to and one exit from the EU in this period."
2020-12-31T00:42:46Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's post-Brexit trade deal passes into UK law,"Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels has passed into law following a whirlwind 14-hour parliamentary process that has radically redrawn the UK’s ties with Europe. The prime minister thanked MPs and peers for passing the European Union (future relationship) bill in one day, in a statement urging the nation to “seize” the moment when the transition period with the bloc ends at 11pm on Thursday. It was announced that the Queen had given approval to the European Union (future relationship) bill at 12.25am on Thursday morning. Her signature puts the UK-EU agreement into British law, preventing a no-deal Brexit at 11pm on Thursday when the transition period ends. It followed the recall of parliament for an emergency one-day session to approve the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement, concluded by the prime minister and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Christmas Eve.
Johnson said: “The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands. We take on this duty with a sense of purpose and with the interests of the British public at the heart of everything we do. “11pm on 31 December marks a new beginning in our country’s history and a new relationship with the EU as their biggest ally. This moment is finally upon us and now is the time to seize it.” The House of Lords gave the bill an unopposed third reading late on Wednesday, hours after MPs had voted it through by 521 votes to 73 – a majority of 448. The deal comes four and a half years after the Brexit referendum vote to take the UK out of the European Union, but its rapid approval has raised concerns from MPs and peers that the bill has not been properly scrutinised.
Parliamentarians raised concerns over the document, saying it had failed to secure access to security databases, broke promises over fishing rights in UK waters and left unanswered border questions in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland. Johnson’s deal passed through the Commons with ease with Labour’s support, though the Liberal Democrats, SNP and Democratic Unionist party voted against it. After four hours of debate, MPs voted by 521 to 73 to give the bill a third reading. Johnson opened the Commons debate on the UK’s post-Brexit trade deal with the EU shortly after 10am on Wednesday. The prime minister told MPs the deal would redefine the UK’s relationship with the EU. “We now seize this moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbours, based on free trade and friendly cooperation,” he said.
“We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic, and we have pressed ahead with this task, resisting all calls for delay, precisely because creating certainty about our future provides the best chance of beating Covid and bouncing back even more strongly next year.”
Labour failed to amend the bill, which will bring the trade deal into force from 11pm on 31 December, to include additional protections for workers’ rights and environmental standards and support for business preparedness. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, described the deal as “thin”, but said Labour would back it because the alternative would be devastating for the UK."
2020-12-30T18:31:00Z,politics,Politics,Brexit deal: Boris Johnson signs EU-UK trade deal after MPs vote to pass agreement - as it happened,"The legislation implementing the UK-EU trade deal is in course to become law late tonight, or in the early hours of tomorrow morning, after MPs voted for it by by 521 votes to 73 - a majority of 448. The EU (future relationship) bill is still being debated by peers, but it is due to pass all stages in the Lords without amendment by around 11pm tonight. However, peers are expected to pass an amendment expressing reservations about the deal. (See 5.28pm.) Three Labour MPs have resigned as junior frontbenchers after defying Keir Starmer and refusing to vote for Boris Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal. But, although Starmer infuriated many in his party by ordering his MPs to vote for a deal that they view as bad for Britain, only one MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, actually voted against. Another 36 abstained. (See 3.47pm.) Starmer was widely criticised when he ordered his party to abstain in a vote on Covid restrictions earlier this month - he was accused of being indecisive on a matter of national importance - and although his decision to back the government today angered hardline pro-Europeans and leftwingers, it was firmly in line with what the public expect. According to a YouGov poll, the public wanted MPs to back the trade deal bill by a margin of more than six to one. (See 12.22pm.) Johnsonâ€™s Brexit trade deal has been resoundingly rejected by the Scottish and Northern Irish parliaments, as the UKâ€™s devolved nations branded it disastrous and damaging. Johnson has refused to accept that his deal will create new barriers to trade with the EU. In an at times bizarre interview with the BBC, he also suggested having to fill out customs forms for the first time could benefit firms exporting to the EU - because it would mean the same rules applying for exports to any part of the world. (See 6.11pm.) Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight - and for 2020. Happy new year everyone. Thank you for your time and your interest, and your contributions, and your support. Iâ€™ll be back on Monday next week."
2020-12-30T17:32:34Z,politics,Politics,Three Labour frontbenchers quit after defying Keir Starmer on Brexit deal,"Three Labour MPs have resigned as junior frontbenchers after defying Keir Starmer and refusing to vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Within hours of the agreement being clinched on Christmas Eve, Starmer announced he would whip his party to support it, despite criticising the substance of the deal as “thin”. But some Labour MPs felt uncomfortable supporting a deal they believed would damage the economy, and feared it would be difficult to criticise the deal if the party backed it. Tonia Antoniazzi, the MP for Gower, Helen Hayes, the Dulwich and West Norwood MP, and Florence Eshalomi, the MP for Vauxhall, resigned from their junior frontbench posts so as to abstain as MPs voted on the legislation implementing the agreement. In a statement on her website, Hayes, who was a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “This is a bad deal which will make our country poorer. It will cost jobs, undermine our security, weaken our standing in the world, risk workers’ rights and environmental protections, and limit opportunities for our children and grandchildren.” In total, 36 Labour MPs abstained in the vote, including staunch campaigners against Brexit such as Stella Creasy and Neil Coyle, and leftwingers such as Rebecca Long-Bailey and Diane Abbott. Just one Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham, went further and voted against the deal. During the debate on Wednesday, Starmer made the point forcefully that to vote against the deal would be to countenance a no-deal exit from the Brexit transition period. He said: “The choice before the house today is perfectly simple. Do we implement the treaty that has been agreed with the EU, or do we not? If we choose not to, the outcome is clear: we leave the transition period without a deal. Without a deal on security, on trade, on fisheries. Without protection for our manufacturing sector, for farming, for countless businesses. And without a foothold to build a future relationship with the EU.”
Several senior Labour MPs, including the Brexit committee chair, Hilary Benn, spoke in support of Starmer’s position, despite their reservations about Johnson’s deal. But others including Clive Lewis, Diane Abbott and Kevin Brennan said they could not follow Starmer’s lead and vote for the legislation, which was being rushed through both houses of parliament in a single day. Brennan rejected Starmer’s characterisation of the vote as deal versus no deal. “While I understand the desire to move on I simply don’t understand why it’s necessary for those who believe this is a bad deal to vote for it, and dip their fingertips in this abject failure of national ambition,” he said. Lewis lambasted the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of the agreement, saying: “Does the restoration of sovereignty not extend to democratic oversight by elected members of this house?” He called it “false framing, used to hold this house to ransom” to suggest that opposition to it would mean accepting no deal. “Let’s be clear about what’s being asked for this house today: that’s for a blank cheque to be issued to this government to implement a deal that is devoid of democratic oversight,” he said.
Creasy said in a statement on her website: “Whatever Labour does, the Conservatives will cry foul, suggesting any attempt to scrutinise the deal after it is passed reveals a true intention to fight Brexit. The road ahead will be rocky for all concerned. To abstain is not to refuse to be part of that fight but to refuse to do so on the prime minister’s terms.” Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s former leader, also declined to support the deal. “I cannot vote for this deal, which this government will use to drive down rights and protections, and step up the sell-off of our vital public services. We need instead to break with failed race-to-the-bottom policies and build a Britain that puts people before private profit,” he tweeted. Corbyn is now sitting as an independent after the whip was withdrawn over comments questioning the scale of the antisemitism problem in Labour under his leadership. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said Starmer’s insistence that voting against the deal meant backing a no-deal Brexit was ludicrous. “Whatever the opposition parties do, this government has a majority of 80 and this deal will pass,” she said. “Now more than ever, people deserve principled leadership based on conviction, not party political calculation.” She said she was not willing to acquiesce on a deal that “cuts British jobs, sidelines our services sector, undermines hard-won protections for the environment, workers’ rights and consumers, and turns Kent into a diesel-stained monument to hubris and political myopia”."
2020-12-30T17:19:34Z,politics,Politics,Holyrood and Stormont reject 'disastrous' Brexit trade deal,"Boris Johnson’s Brexit trade deal has been resoundingly rejected by the Scottish and Northern Irish parliaments, as the UK’s devolved nations branded it disastrous and damaging. Holyrood and Stormont passed motions condemning the deal by large majorities after all three devolved parliaments were hastily recalled from their Christmas recesses to debate the UK government’s last-minute agreement with the EU. Only the Labour-dominated Welsh Senedd backed the deal after Mark Drakeford, the first minister, said the “thin and disappointing” agreement was at least “a platform on which better arrangements can be negotiated in the future”. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told Holyrood the trade deal rode roughshod over the wishes of Scotland, which had repeatedly voted against leaving the EU and then called for the UK to remain inside the single market. The deal betrayed Scotland’s fishing industry and was a “democratic, economic and social calamity” and “disastrous”, she told MSPs. Signalling the Brexit agreement would fuel her party’s push for a second independence referendum in May’s Holyrood elections, she said that it established again that only independence would protect Scotland’s interests. “The Westminster system is beyond repair,” she said. “We deserve the best deal of all, as an independent European country.” Scottish Labour endured widespread criticism after it backed Sturgeon’s motion, despite Keir Starmer’s demand that the party back the deal in Westminster and Welsh Labour’s endorsement of it in Cardiff. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, rejected accusations that his party was in disarray, voting different ways in different parliaments. He said Sturgeon’s carefully worded motion, which was also backed by the Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats, focused on Johnson’s failure to properly consult the devolved nations and accepted that a no-deal outcome had to be avoided. In a small victory for Labour, a large majority of MSPs backed Leonard’s amendment calling for cross-government efforts to improve workers’ rights and fully replace the Erasmus student exchange programme scheme, and for Sturgeon’s government to spend the £300m it has in reserve to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit. The Holyrood vote was symbolic, rather than legislative. In the Commons vote on Wednesday, which did have legal effect, the SNP joined the Liberal Democrats, all Northern Irish parties that sit in Westminster, Plaid Cymru, the Greens’ one MP and a Labour rebel in voting against.
The bill passed by 521 votes to 73 – a majority of 448. In Stormont, assembly members lamented the deal as a blow to Northern Ireland but disagreed over the damage and who was responsible.
While the main motion merely “noted” the deal, the chamber voted 49 to 38 in favour of an amendment sponsored by the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) that stated Stormont “rejects” Brexit in line with Northern Ireland’s vote to remain inside the EU in 2016. There was widespread relief that a no-deal crash out – and the spectre of tariffs – had been avoided but speakers voiced concern at the disappearance of EU funds and the costs to businesses of customs barriers between the region and the rest of the UK. Unionists also expressed anxiety at the constitutional implications of a de facto border down the Irish Sea. The nationalists of Sinn Féin and the SDLP found common cause with the Ulster Unionists and the non-aligned Alliance in pointing the finger at the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), the only group that had backed the UK’s departure from the EU. “Those who told businesses their products would be sold in free trade deals around the world are responsible for those businesses now being less well off. So you own it all,” said Sinn Féin’s John O’Dowd. Christopher Stalford of the DUP said other parties had created the sea border by opposing checks on the land border with the Republic of Ireland. “You campaigned for this, you delivered it, you own it – not us,” he said. This article was amended on 1 January 2021 to add Plaid Cymru to the list of parties to vote against the government’s Brexit trade deal in the House of Commons."
2020-12-30T16:20:05Z,politics,Politics,"On Boris's big day, Tories kid themselves this is the deal they always wanted | John Crace","Who would have guessed? When push came to shove it turned out that a bad deal was better than no deal after all. The first deal in history to put more barriers in the way of free trade than the one that preceded it. A 1,200-page treaty and 80-page bill that was granted a mere four and a half hours of what passed for scrutiny in a recalled House of Commons to allow it to become law before the end of the year. In most countries this would be called a farce: here in the UK we call it a return of parliamentary sovereignty. At least that’s the way Boris Johnson was selling the deal to his eager backbenchers, who were all desperate to applaud his negotiating skills and brinkmanship, as he opened the debate. Such as it was. The sense of anticlimax was almost tangible. Almost as if the Tories were also having to kid themselves that the deal was the one they had always wanted.
But this was Boris’s big day out, and he was determined to milk it for all he could. It’s not often he can just about claim to have delivered on a promise, even if much of what was in the promise bore little similarity to the earlier promises he had made. Then the truth has always been a moving target for Johnson. There was certainly nothing about an extra £350m for the NHS each week. But then that bus left years ago. The prime minister began with the good stuff on no trade tariffs or quotas and rather skated over all the potential downsides. There was certainly nothing on Brexit levelling up the UK economy: it seems to have slowly dawned on Boris that it had been 10 years of Tory governments and not the EU that had widened the equality gap in the country. Rather Johnson tried to sell the deal as doing a favour not just to the UK but to the EU as well, because it would mean that we stopped behaving like a country that was unhappy in the relationship and kept having affairs. It’s not you, darling, it’s me. So now we would be moving on to a more open marriage where a bit of infidelity was tolerated. You got the feeling he’s used this line plenty of times in the past. To round it off, he concluded by saying that no one loved Europe more than him and to think of Brexit as a resolution rather than a rupture. Which hardly squared with Boris’s years of anti-European rhetoric. But then consistency has never been his strongest suit. In reply, Keir Starmer first declared that Labour would be supporting the bill as the alternative of a no-deal Brexit would cause even more disruption and put more companies out of business. But having played the national interest card, the Labour leader did a quick recap of some of Johnson’s lies – only last week he had given a speech claiming there would be no non-tariff barriers when the reality was a bureaucratic pile-on – before moving on to the deal’s limitations. Starting with the complete absence of detail for the service sector, especially financial services. The Tories had just bargained away 80% of the economy to secure the headline trade deal: the French and the Germans were laughing all the way to the bank. Then there was the lack of access to European criminal databases along with a lack of recognition for UK professional qualifications. He could go on. This was the thinnest of deals, one that had only been reached through the UK’s desperation to leave the EU before the end of the year. Though she pledged to back the bill, Theresa May was lukewarm in her support, pointing out that she had had a much better deal on the table that would have passed if Labour had been prepared to back it. She had a point. To no one’s surprise, the SNP leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, said his party would not be supporting the bill as Scotland had voted to remain in the EU and Johnson’s deal offered them next to nothing. He, too, had a point. As the debate progressed, it became clear that Johnson had at least managed to achieve something no Tory leader had managed in decades. He had united his party – if only temporarily – over Europe. So it was job done for Boris, as Brexit had mainly only been about divisions within his own party. It was just a shame he had had to remove all the talent from the benches and replace them with yes men and women in the process. Even the Brexit headbangers of the European Research Group rolled over like pussycats. In years gone by William Cash had been prepared to defend the British fishing industry and the integrity of Northern Ireland within the the UK. Now he was happily prepared to sacrifice both. Northern Ireland could become a colony of the EU and who gave a shit about fish anyway? Cash compared Johnson to Pericles and Alexander the Great. The rest of the Commons compared Cash to a man without conscience or qualities. David Davis meanwhile proved equally absurd, insisting that a worse deal with the EU was in reality a better deal than one where we retained the same benefits. Go figure. Liam Fox claimed that the union would be stronger due to Brexit. It hadn’t sounded that way. Kevin Brennan was the first Labour MP to break with the party line by saying he would not be voting for the deal. His logic that parliament should be allowed more time for scrutiny by extending the transition period was impeccable. Up until the point you remembered that Johnson was a career psychopath and would have taken the UK out of the EU on 31 December with no deal if he didn’t get his own way. Which was pretty much the point that Rachel Reeves made in her closing speech as she reiterated Labour’s support for what was a crap deal, pointing out the seven amendments it had tried to table in the process, as the lesser of two evils. Closing for the government, Michael Gove was his usual insufferable self. Smug, graceless, short of self-awareness – he somehow believes extra bureaucracy will make businesses “match fit” – and still prioritising point scoring over trying to bring the country back together. The session ended with a whimper as the bill raced through its second, committee and third readings at breakneck speed by a large majority. But anyone who imagined that was the last we would hear of Brexit had rather missed the point. The lack of detail in the trade bill and the methods of conflict resolution promised a whole new world of pain. Months and years down the line, Tory MPs might not be so easily bought off if the economy flatlines. Boris had better watch his back."

2020-12-30T15:16:17Z,politics,Politics,MPs pass Brexit trade deal by 521 votes to 73,"Boris Johnson’s Brexit trade deal with Brussels has cleared the House of Commons as the government attempts to rush through complex legislation in just 14 hours. The prime minister described the historic deal as “not a rupture but a resolution”, before MPs voted through the European Union (future relationship) bill by 521 votes to 73 – a majority of 448. It meant the bill continued to the House of Lords and is expected to be given royal assent shortly before midnight. That would pave the way for the deal to take effect at 11pm on Thursday when the Brexit transition period ends. Parliament was recalled for an emergency one-day session to approve the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement, concluded by Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Christmas Eve. Conservative, Labour and the Scottish National party MPs criticised the government for allowing for so little time for parliamentary scrutiny of the bill. Johnson opened the debate on the UK’s post-Brexit trade deal with the EU shortly after 10am on Wednesday.
Johnson’s deal passed with ease with Labour’s support though the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) voted against it. The prime minister told MPs the deal would redefine the UK’s relationship with the EU. “We now seize this moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbours, based on free trade and friendly cooperation,” he said. “We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic, and we have pressed ahead with this task, resisting all calls for delay, precisely because creating certainty about our future provides the best chance of beating Covid and bouncing back even more strongly next year.” Most Conservative Eurosceptic MPs were jubilant. Sir Bill Cash, who founded the Maastricht Referendum Campaign in the early 1990s, said: “Like Alexander the Great, Boris has cut the Gordian Knot.” Mark Francois, one of the self-styled Spartans who held out against Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement, told fellow Eurosceptics they could now “lower our spears”.
Labour backed the deal, despite misgivings from 37 MPs who defied the party whip to abstain or vote against it. Keir Starmer, the party’s leader, described the deal as “thin”, but told the Commons that Labour would back it because the alternative would be devastating for the UK. “It’s often said there’s nothing simple about Brexit, but the choice before the house today is perfectly simple,” he said. “Do we implement the treaty that has been agreed with the EU or do we not? “That is the choice. If we choose not to, the outcome is clear. We leave the transition period without a deal, without a deal on security, on trade, on fisheries, without protection for our manufacturing sector, for farming, for countless British businesses and without a foothold to build a future relationship with the EU. “Anyone choosing that option today knows there is no time to renegotiate.” Three junior shadow ministers – Helen Hayes, Tonia Antoniazzi and Florence Eshalomi – resigned from their posts after abstaining over the bill. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, voted against the agreement.
The trade and cooperation agreement with the EU runs to more than 1,200 pages. The bill is 80 pages. The Hansard Society, the leading procedural thinktank, published a blog by its senior researcher, Brigid Fowler, describing the process as “a farce”. The Conservative former Brexit secretary David Davis said the agreement left “issues to deal with” including Northern Ireland, fishing and Gibraltar. He told the Commons: “It’s not over. All will lead to uncomfortable decisions in the near future.” Davis said one day was not enough time to deal with a 1,200-page treaty and further time must be given to it to enable the UK to develop its strategy. “The EU will use the treaty to its own advantage … We have to come back to this treaty and look at it in detail at all 1,200 pages so we don’t get into conflict, don’t fall into traps, don’t get into acrimonious disputes with them [the EU],” he said. Almost all Tory MPs approved the agreement, although former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstained. Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said he was “very torn” over the deal because the region was divided from the rest of the UK. “I’d love to vote for this today but I really can’t vote for a measure which actually divides the UK as a different regime on tax as part of the customs union that’ll be under the ECJ, single market etc,” he said. Opposition to the bill from the SNP and the DUP appeared to be a sign that Brexit has increased tensions over the union. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP in Westminster, said many Scots would prefer to live in the EU than in a “broken Brexit Britain”. Earlier in the day, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European council president, Charles Michel, formally signed the agreement. Following a brief ceremony in Brussels, the leather-bound documents were then flown to London by the RAF to be signed by Johnson."
2020-12-30T10:53:27Z,politics,Politics,From Brussels to the Palace: how Brexit deal will be passed in a day,"MPs and peers are expected to approve the Brexit trade deal with the EU on Wednesday, in a frantic day of parliamentary activity. What is parliament being asked to do? To pass the EU (future relationship) bill, which allows Boris Johnson’s government to sign and ratifty the 1,246-page treaty sealed on Christmas Eve, the bill is set to pass all of its stages in the Commons and Lords – and receive royal assent – on Wednesday, before the expiry of the Brexit transition period on New Year’s Eve. What is the Commons timetable for the day? Pretty packed. MPs will assemble – or rather the majority will log on from the constituencies, given London is under tier 4 coronavirus restrictions – from 9.30am, and must first approve a formal business motion for the events of the day, which also sets out the plan for remote proceedings. Once this is done, Johnson will open the debate on the second reading, followed by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. Michael Gove will close for the government. The whole of the debate, and votes on all remaining stages of the bill are meant to be completed by 2.30pm, when MPs will turn their mind to debating Covid. Then what happens? From about 3pm, peers will take over. The final vote is expected in the Lords at about 11pm. The Queen is, we are told, “on standby” at Windsor Castle to give royal assent to the bill. This would then be announced to the Commons. What about the Brexit treaty itself? This has already been signed in Brussels, in a brief ceremony on Wednesday morning, by Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the heads of the European commission and European council respectively. EU ambassadors gave interim approval for the deal earlier this week. Two copies of the treaty, both bound in blue leather, are being flown to London in a Royal Air Force plane for Johnson to sign. One will remain in London and the other – the one embossed with gold stars – will go back to Brussels.
This isn’t much time for scrutiny, is it? No. The Commons has 84 MPs listed to speak, with 145 peers listed in the Lords, leaving just minutes for each. In a report on Wednesday’s proceedings, the parliamentary thinktank the Hansard Society says the last time a bill went through all parliamentary stages in a single day was a 2007 measure connected to Northern Ireland, which had just two clauses. The EU bill is 85 pages long. Is it enough time? A number of people think not, not least quite a few MPs. The Hansard Society has called the proceedings “a farce”, noting that the parliamentary process takes place just six days after confirmation there would be a treaty, four days after the treaty was published, and less than two days before the treaty is due to come into force, with the only other option being no deal. The society also notes that it is still unclear how the hybrid proceedings in the Commons will handle basic procedures, such as amendments and proxy votes, especially given the enormous time pressures."
2020-12-30T00:06:20Z,politics,Politics,Johnson to hail 'historic resolution' as Brexit bill comes before Commons,"The UK’s post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels delivers a “historic resolution” making the country a “friendly neighbour” to the EU, Boris Johnson will tell MPs on Wednesday as they vote on the agreement. The deal is expected to sail through the parliamentary approval process in just a day, with the backing of Labour and after the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Conservative MPs indicated on Tuesday that it would support it. In a speech to parliament ahead of the vote, the prime minister will hail the deal sealed on Christmas Eve, arguing that it represents “how Britain can be at once European and sovereign”, as well as praising negotiators for securing it at “astonishing speed” in the “teeth of a pandemic”. Despite a hostile response to the deal from fishing industry leaders and boat owners, the legal advisory committee of the ERG declared that it “preserves the UK’s sovereignty”. The verdict from the group’s so-called “star chamber” – which has been poring over the fine print of the 1,246-page trade agreement – represents a boost for Johnson. The ERG, thought to number about 70 Tories, represented a constant thorn in Theresa May’s side over Brexit during her turbulent time in No 10. Keir Starmer has urged his MPs to vote for the agreement, but the Labour leader is facing a high-profile rebellion over concerns that he is “falling into the trap of rallying around this rotten deal”. Regardless, the European Union (Future Relationship) bill is expected to pass easily, despite the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Democratic Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party and Alliance all indicating that they will not support it. The government published an 80-page draft version of the bill on Tuesday, giving MPs less than 24 hours to study it ahead of parliament being recalled for a day on Wednesday to approve the deal. The bill, expected to be voted on by MPs at 2.30pm, will then also have to clear the Lords before it receives royal assent either late on Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. The fast-tracking of the legislation has been strongly condemned by the Hansard Society, a leading source of independent research on parliamentary affairs. Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher who is a highly respected expert on parliamentary processes, said it amounted to an “abdication of parliament’s constitutional responsibilities to deliver proper scrutiny of the executive and the law”. A report by the cross-party Brexit select committee said that the deal’s compressed parliamentary timetable was “unavoidable but concerning”. “One concerning consequence of the agreement being reached so late is that members of the parliament have been left with very little time in which to read the [deal],” it read. “This means the [deal] will not be subject to detailed scrutiny before a vote in the Commons, which is an unsatisfactory but now unavoidable outcome.” Opening Wednesday’s debate, Johnson will tell MPs that the central purpose of the legislation is to “accomplish something which the British people always knew in their hearts could be done, but which we were told was impossible”. He is to add: “This bill demonstrates how Britain can be at once European and sovereign. And our negotiators accomplished their feat with astonishing speed … We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic. “We will now open a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world, adding to the agreements with 63 countries we have already achieved, and reasserting global Britain as a liberal, outward-looking force for good. “Those of us who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU never sought a rupture with our closest neighbours … but a resolution, a resolution of the old and vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which bedevilled our post-war history.” He is expected to conclude: “With this bill, we shall be a friendly neighbour, the best friend and ally the EU could have, working hand in glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws, made by their own elected parliament. That is the historic resolution delivered by this bill.” In a statement on Tuesday, the ERG’s legal advisory committee said: “Our overall conclusion is that the agreement preserves the UK’s sovereignty as a matter of law and fully respects the norms of international sovereign-to-sovereign treaties. “The ‘level playing field’ clauses go further than in comparable trade agreements, but their impact on the practical exercise of sovereignty is likely to be limited if addressed by a robust government. “In any event they do not prevent the UK from changing its laws as it sees fit at a risk of tariff countermeasures, and if those were unacceptable the agreement could be terminated on 12 months’ notice.” David Jones, the ERG’s deputy chairman, told the Guardian he would be voting for the deal, adding: “What this does is replaces the arrangements under the treaty on [the] European Union, which is what we were in before as a member state, with something that is a straightforward, clear, free trade agreement of a sort that Conservatives are supportive of.”"
2020-12-29T22:00:00Z,politics,Politics,Labour will not seek major changes to UK’s relationship with EU – Keir Starmer,"Labour will make a clean break from its divisions over Europe and will not seek major changes to the UK’s relationship with the EU, Keir Starmer has told the Guardian, vowing to shift Labour’s focus to “Britain in the 2030s” rather than the battles of 2016. Evoking Tony Blair’s election slogan of “forward not back” on the eve of the vote on the post-Brexit trade deal, Starmer said he wanted to lead a party that was focused on the future – saying it was unlikely Europe would even feature on his party’s election leaflets. The Labour leader, who said the aim of his first year had been listening to voters about the party’s general election loss, said his party would now begin to spell out its vision of a future Labour government. Starmer said 2021 would be the time to define his vision and values as a future prime minister – with a focus on the economy and the NHS. In a nod to his angry backbenchers, dozens of whom are expected to refuse to endorse the Conservative deal, Starmer said he knew there were difficult choices, but said the vote for the deal would bring some closure. Johnson has often sought to characterise Starmer as a “remainer lawyer” and one of the most outspoken advocates for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. But Starmer said he would now define his own image. “I’m determined the next general election will be fought on our terms, not somebody else’s terms,” he said. “We’ve left the EU and the remain/leave argument is over. Amongst the reasons for voting for the deal is to allow that closure. In our general election campaign in 2024, we will be a future-looking Labour party and a future Labour government, not one that looks behind us.” In his interview, Starmer also warned about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month, saying the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Labour will attempt to amend the bill which will enforce the trade deal from 11pm on 31 December – including additional protections on labour and environmental standards and support for business preparedness but none are likely to succeed. Johnson’s deal is likely to pass with ease with Labour’s support – though the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have said they will vote against the deal. Starmer suggested he had been convinced of the need to vote for the deal for some time – and defended his decision to announce Labour’s position shortly after the deal had been published. “I have been up to my ears in the details of the Brexit negotiations,” he said. “I’ve read everything available on all the negotiating positions and the details of them. We had a very, very good idea of what this deal was going to look like – borne of four years of studying every twist and turn of this along the way.” The Labour leader has faced some criticism from his backbenchers for his framing of the vote as a choice between deal and no deal – when many would favour abstaining and thus withholding any implied endorsement. “If you vote against it, you are voting for no deal. That’s the SNP’s inexplicable position. The consequence of that, if they succeed, will be no deal.” Starmer said accepting the deal that was on offer meant accepting that it would be the relationship in place if Labour entered government in 2024. “This is a tough choice, I absolutely understand that.” “We vote tomorrow in the mindset of the next general election in 2024. If we come into government in 2024 – and I hope we do – we will inherit this deal. The public in Britain would expect us to make this deal work.” Starmer said he could not envisage Europe or Brexit playing any part in the election campaign of 2024 – or featuring on any Labour MPs’ election leaflets – despite the opportunity for a review of the treaty in 2024, which is spelled out in the current deal. “It’s pretty unlikely. The focus will be on Britain and on Britain’s role in the world,” he said. “Will the renegotiation of the treaty be central to the manifesto? No. “If we are still arguing in 2024 about what has gone in these past four years, we’re facing the wrong way as far as I’m concerned.” Starmer said there was a case Labour would make over the coming months and years about ways to improve the UK’s relationship with the EU, including access to security data and the ability of artists and musicians to operate across Europe. “But there will not be an appetite for renegotiating the entire treaty.” Starmer plans to make 2021 a more proactive year for Labour’s policy offering but was cautious about making any concrete promises about what will be in the party’s next manifesto. “We are still four years from a general election,” he said. “But my priority going into next year and central to our arguments going into 2024 will be the economy.” He is reluctant to specify what exactly that offering would be, but said the primary focus would be jobs and “how we support good businesses and good jobs … I don’t just mean pay, I mean dignity in jobs – and how we support the economy across the different regions and nations.” Starmer is likely to find Boris Johnson attempting to fight on Labour’s terms with his “levelling up” agenda where new Tories in the red wall are able to point to infrastructure and high street investment in their seats. But Starmer said he believed the drive would be cosmetic. “Levelling up is going to turn out to be a version of David Cameron’s big society, which is words that don’t mean anything or achieve anything,” he said. “There was no levelling up when the government was fighting Andy Burnham in the north-west. If the prime minister thinks that building the odd thing in places across Britain and sticking a Tory MP’s photo on it is levelling up then he is misdescribing anything he is likely to achieve.” Starmer’s second – and most obvious – focus will be the fallout from the pandemic and its effect on the NHS. “We are the country with the highest death toll from Covid in Europe, and also the likely deepest recession of any major economy,” he said. “We’ve been only a matter of weeks out of that second lockdown and we’re effectively staring down the barrel of the third lockdown. Everybody understands that the government will make mistakes in trying to handle a pandemic, but a government that just repeats the mistakes really is incompetent.” Starmer said he knew he would need to continue to navigate his biggest challenge as an opposition leader – “supporting the government where it’s necessary to do so and criticising and challenging where it is necessary to do so.” Once the constraints of the pandemic begin to ease, Starmer said he hoped to spend much of 2021 on the road. “We’re very determined that I’m going to be out at least twice a week in different places across the UK, mainly going to places that we’ve got to win votes in a places where we lost,” he said. “The sooner we can do that, the better. It’s really frustrating that we’ve not been able to do it in the way we wanted.”"
2020-12-29T18:55:51Z,politics,Politics,Obsolete software from 1990s features in Brexit deal text,"The EU-UK Brexit deal refers to defunct decades-old computer software such as Netscape Communicator as “modern”, raising suspicions that some of the text may have been copied and pasted in. Online commenters gleefully shared the observation that page 921 of the painfully birthed trade agreement refers to Netscape Communicator – released in June 1997 – and Mozilla Mail as being “modern e-mail software packages”. A section on encryption technology also gave rise to suspicions that officials simply pasted large chunks of text from previous documents into the deal, which has been lauded by its backers as the beginning of a new chapter in relationship between the UK and the EU. Computer scientist Prof Bill Buchanan reminded followers of what Netscape looked like back in the day, tweeting: “One day we will build a digital world fit for the 21st Century ...”
The references sparked a wave of nostalgia on Twitter and the trading of memories about old internet browsers such as Netscape, which was edged out in the 1990s by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The text of the deal reads: “s/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-mail software packages.” Other eagle-eyed observers noted how the agreement recommended the use of 1024-bit RSA encryption and the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, both of which are susceptible to cyber-attacks on account of their age. Liz Truss kicked off trade talks with Japan in June with a promise that the UK could establish itself as a “global technology superpower”. “I really do feel that we are world-leading in technology,” said the secretary of state for international trade. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The provisions in the relevant annex to the agreement set out the legally prescribed measures for cooperation. We currently use the latest technology to share this data, which is properly protected and in line with the guidance from the National Cyber Security Centre.” Separately, the UK announced on Tuesday that it had signed a free trade deal with Turkey, its first since agreeing a Brexit deal to leave the EU. Parliament will be recalled on Wednesday in order for MPs to debate and vote on the bill to enact Downing Street’s trade agreement with the EU. An 80-page draft version of the bill was published on Tuesday, leaving little time for members of parliament and others to scrutinise it."
2020-12-29T17:42:45Z,politics,Politics,'Boris is a kipper': fury and frustration at Brexit fishing deal in Brixham,"Anton Bailey had just taken a delivery of a new set of fishing nets and was patiently sorting them on the harbour-side at Brixham in Devon. The skipper, who first boarded a fishing boat four decades ago when he was just three, was feeling a mixture of optimism and frustration. He is optimistic that when he chugs out to fish for pollock with his fresh nets in the new year he will be lucky and return with a good catch, but frustrated that, to his mind, the Brexit fishing deal has sold the British industry short. “The Europeans always get what they want. It’s a simple as that,” said Bailey.
His main gripe is that under the deal EU boats will be able to operate up to six miles off the UK coast while British boats will have to remain 12 miles off the beaches of mainland Europe. “How is that fair? We’re not allowed inside their 12, I don’t see why they should be allowed up to our six.” Andy McLeod, who owns and skippers the Brixham beam scalloper van Dijck, is also puzzled over the six/12 mile disparity. “One thing I did hope for was that we would get the 12-mile limit,” he said. “It should be a level playing field.” But he is not one of those who feels that every fish off the coast of Britain belongs to UK fishers. “I thought it was a bit harsh to try to cut the rest of Europe off from our fish completely,” he said. “To be honest we don’t have the fleet to catch all the fish. If they suddenly said: ‘All the fish is yours’, actually we don’t have anything to catch it with.”
Brixham bills itself as the birthplace of the trawling industry. It has been a fishing port since the middle ages, but in the 18th century pioneered the use of sailing trawlers, fast powerful robust boats that targeted demersal fish – cod, sole, plaice, haddock. The port boasts England’s largest market by value of fish sold and this year enjoyed a run of million-pound weeks, with sales of the more than 40 types of fish landed here regularly reaching seven figures. But, as McLeod points out, most of the Brixham boats have seen better days. McLeod’s vessel was already 16 years old when it arrived in Devon from the Netherlands 30 years ago. “There’s never been much help for the fishing industry in the UK compared to other countries where their governments back them, give them grants for new boats,” he said. “That’s why our fleet is second-hand Dutch and Belgian boats. They get the grants, run them for 20 years and sell them to us.” A seal bobbed its head up as Matt Shepherd, at 32 one of the younger skippers, prepared his small boat for a trip out. “You hear a lot about Brexit and the EU all the time. Some are for, some are against. I’m just trying to get on and make a living.”
But it is hard to forget Brexit. On the way into the town a “Fishing for Leave” banner with the slogan “Save Britain’s fish” still flutters in a farmer’s field. Mike Sharp, the owner of two Brixham beam trawlers, took part in the Fishing for Leave protest on the Thames in London during the EU referendum campaign. Four years on, he is furious at the EU deal. “I’m hoping the deal gets voted out by parliament. I doubt it. Boris came to Brixham and promised us everything. He’s used fishing as a lever to get whatever he wants. Fishing’s not important to them. I have a fish merchant friend who calls two-faced people kippers. Boris is a kipper.” The government has promised a £100m funding package for the industry. “But £100m goes nowhere,” said Jim Portus, the chief executive of the South West Fish Producers Organisation. “You won’t be able to replace old vessels with new ones. You’ll just be patching up in the same way we have been doing for the last 20 years.” Brixham-born Sean Irvine, 61, who has been fishing from the port since the early 1990s, said he was glad, at least, that there had been a deal but he is concerned about the new paperwork that will be needed to send fish to mainland Europe – as much as 80% of Irvine’s catch is exported. “We’ll be catching the same fish in the same water as the French but we’ll have to produce a mountain of paperwork for it. It seems to me what we have achieved is minuscule when you think of the upsets it has caused in families and communities. All that effort for so little.”"
2020-12-29T17:30:25Z,politics,Politics,What's the timetable for parliament's vote on the Brexit trade deal?,"It is a time of year when MPs might typically still be at home chomping through Christmas leftovers. But, instead of devouring turkey sandwiches during the festive break, they will probably be leafing through pages of draft legislation in preparation for Wednesday’s vote on the historic Brexit trade deal with the EU. What’s happening? As parliament is in recess for Christmas, it is being recalled on 30 December so that MPs can debate and vote on the bill to enact Downing Street’s trade agreement with the EU. Recalling parliament is a rare event, having only taken place 30 times since 1948. In a fast-forwarding of normal proceedings for legislation, the government will get the European Union (future relationship) bill, which covers the government’s trade deal with the EU, through the Commons and Lords in just a day. An 80-page draft version of the bill was published on Tuesday, leaving MPs little time to look through it. What’s the timetable? The action is due to kick off in the chamber at 9.30am, when there is expected to be a motion to provide for virtual participation in debate. Presently, rules on virtual proceedings in the Commons only apply to scrutiny proceedings, such as questions, urgent questions and statements. But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, has confirmed that the government intends to bring forward a motion to extend remote participation to “substantive” proceedings – such as debates and legislation – in the chamber when the house next sits. Once passed, it means MPs will be able to debate, virtually, on the bill. Boris Johnson will be opening the second reading debate, and it will be closed by Michael Gove, with both due to appear in person. The vast majority of MPs are expected to participate remotely with their votes being made via proxy, although the chamber has capacity for up to 50 MPs. Debate on the second reading of the bill, followed by all remaining proceedings in the Commons, including any potential amendments and third reading, are expected to last until 2.30pm, when there will be a vote – meaning just five hours of parliament’s time in the chamber has been set aside to pass a deal which has taken months’ worth of hard-fought negotiations. What about the Lords? Once all business is finished in the Commons, peers will debate the bill in the Lords and vote. Proceedings in the Lords are expected to start at around 3pm, lasting until as late as 11pm. Once the bill overcomes the hurdles of both the Commons and Lords, as is expected, it will receive royal assent late on Wednesday night or early Thursday morning."
2020-12-29T15:59:57Z,politics,Politics,UK signs free trade agreement with Turkey,"The UK has signed a free trade deal with Turkey, its first since agreeing a Brexit deal to leave the EU – a development that will strengthen ties between the two European outliers. The continuity agreement, signed by both trade ministers on Tuesday in a video conference call, takes effect on 1 January and ensures that the existing flow of goods will not be affected when the UK formally leaves the EU at the end of the year. Trade between London and Ankara was worth £18.6bn in 2019, and the UK is Turkey’s second-biggest export market, mostly for precious metals, vehicles, textiles and electrical equipment. While Turkey is not an EU member, it does have a customs union with the EU, meaning that the new UK-Turkey deal could not be struck until after the Brexit deal was finalised. “Today’s deal delivers vital certainty for business and supports thousands of jobs across the UK in the manufacturing, automotive and steel industries,” said the international trade secretary, Liz Truss. “It paves the way for a new, more ambitious deal with Turkey in the near future, and is part of our plan to put the UK at the centre of a network of modern agreements with dynamic economies.” Turkey’s trade minister, Ruhsar Pekcan, called the deal a landmark in UK-Turkish relations. “Without a deal, about 75% of Turkish exports to the UK would be subject to tariffs, causing the loss of some $2.4bn (£1.78bn); this risk is now gone,” he said. The deal has been met with relief by the struggling Turkish lira, which rose for a fifth straight day before the signing. According to the Department for International Trade, the new deal will secure existing preferential tariffs for 7,600 UK businesses exporting machinery, iron and steel to Turkey, and protect automotive and manufacturing supply chains. The accord also commits both countries to discussions aimed at expanding the scope of the agreement to include services and agriculture within the next two years.
Turkey launched membership talks with the EU in 2005, but the accession process as well as efforts to expand its customs agreement with the bloc have so far come to nothing: member states have made clear their disapproval of the country’s democratic backsliding. The EU is also considering sanctions over Turkey’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy. The UK-Turkey agreement will come into force from next month despite the fact that there was not enough time to ratify it in either of the two countries’ parliaments before the year’s end. The deal with Turkey is the fifth-biggest free trade agreement the UK has negotiated after deals with Japan, Canada, Switzerland and Norway. Trade agreements with 62 countries have now been signed in preparation for the UK’s formal exit from the EU single market on 1 January."
2020-12-29T14:58:45Z,politics,Politics,UK performers raise alarm as Brexit deal threatens EU touring,"Actors, musicians and comedians have reacted with alarm to provisions in the Brexit trade deal that will prevent British performers moving around many European countries without a work permit. Leaders of the culture sector fear the clauses will severely curtail the ability of performers to go on tour in Europe, and will hamper the recovery of the arts after the devastating impact of the pandemic. The clauses in the deal will affect tens of thousands of people in the UK’s creative industries, including film-makers, technicians and models as well as performers. Prominent performers including the actor and comedian Dawn French and the musicians KT Tunstall, Ronan Keating and Gary Kemp are among more than 170,000 people who have signed a petition calling on the government to negotiate a free culture work permit for UK performers in the EU. The petition was started by a video technician, Tim Brennan, who said he wanted to highlight how thousands of technicians as well as performers would be hit by the change. It reads: “The UK has a huge music / event touring industry which has suffered immensely due to Covid. “We face further hardship when trying to tour the EU on a professional basis, with potentially each country asking for its own visa, that would be valid only for one trip. As a freelancer I and many like me travel through the EU countless times a year on different tours and events, this will become impossible due to cost and time if we do not have visa free travel.” The actors’ union, Equity, which is backing the call, said creative workers had been forgotten in the trade deal’s visa-free travel arrangements. The Labour frontbencher Thangam Debbonaire is also backing the petition. She tweeted: “After an awful year a further kick from the govt who appear to have simply written off EU touring in their Brexit trade deal.” She said many Labour MPs, including the shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, had repeatedly raised the need for touring visa provisions in the trade agreement. The agreement allows people to make visa-free business trips to the EU for 90 days in any given six-month period, but there are restrictions on the activities they can perform. Activities such as meetings, attending conferences and conducting research are fine, but selling goods or services directly to the public will require a visa. A trade body, the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM), said it was “deeply concerned about the absence of visa-free travel provisions for working musicians”. It said that under the deal UK performers would be considered as third-country nationals, meaning that they would have to adhere to the immigration rules of each EU member state in which they worked. It pointed out that some countries, including France and Ireland, allow performers to work at least for 90 days. But others – including Denmark, Italy and Spain – require permits. It said: “This will have huge implications for UK musicians who work within the EU, as the ISM’s most recent Brexit report found that 78% of musicians visit EU/EEA at least once a year to perform.” Deborah Annetts, the ISM chief executive, said: “It is hugely disappointing to see that musicians and other creatives will not be covered by visa-free short-term business trip provisions. After everything that the sector has been through over the past 10 months, how has this happened? It is high time that the value of music to our lives and our economy is recognised fully.” Speaking to Times Radio, she added: “It cannot be stated enough how badly this will affect touring.” UK Music’s chief executive, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, agreed. He said: “There is a real risk that British musicians will not be able to bear the cost of extra bureaucracy and delays which would put some tours at risk. If musicians and creators from overseas face barriers and costs getting into the UK, audiences here could miss out on seeing some of their favourite acts.” Musicians and other performers requiring equipment face the added burden of having to fill out a carnet, a passport for goods that involves paying a deposit on the gear involved. Ian Smith, the director of the international music agencies Frusion and Frizzion, said the new arrangements would add thousands of pounds to the cost of small bands touring in the EU. He said: “For small emerging bands it is going to be a very onerous cost. The Musicians’ Union have been warning about this for four years, but it has been ignored. It could hit 150,000 musicians at least.” He also pointed out that from January musicians face the added risk of having their instruments confiscated if they contain rare wood or ivory and don’t have the correct paper."
2020-12-29T14:17:22Z,politics,Politics,Scotland faces cuts to cod and haddock fisheries under Brexit deal,"Scotland’s fishing fleets face cuts to valuable fisheries such as cod and haddock under the Brexit deal negotiated by the UK, the Scottish government believes. It said its analysis showed there would be increases in the quota available for Scottish trawlers in only five of 13 fishing areas around or close to Scotland, with clear falls in several of the largest such as North Sea cod. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish cabinet secretary for the rural economy, said that despite claims by the UK government that the deal would greatly increase the catch for domestic trawlers, many fleets and ports would experience adverse impacts. That was “deeply troubling”, he said. “This is a terrible outcome for Scotland’s coastal communities. The small gains in quota for mackerel and herring are far outweighed by the impact of losses of haddock, cod and saithe [coley] – and that threatens to harm onshore jobs and businesses too linked to harbours, fish markets and processing facilities.” However, a senior member of the UK negotiating team said they “don’t recognise” the Scottish government figures, adding that overall the deal would benefit Scotland’s fish processing, salmon farming and seafood industry as a whole, as well as deep sea fleets. He said winning a free trade deal meant there would be no tariffs or quotas imposed on any UK fisheries and seafood exports into the EU; by contrast Norway, which also has substantial fisheries and seafood exports, pays tariffs on its sales to the EU. The UK government had also negotiated increases in the quotas requested by Scottish ministers over the five and a half year adjustment period which ends in 2025, including blue whiting, North Sea Angler fish, megrim and west of Scotland saithe, the source said, adding that the UK’s substantial North Sea herring quota had increased 10%. He said the UK had to recognise that in striking a free trade deal, the impact of any cuts in quota for EU fleets had to be considered to ensure both sides interests were addressed. “It’s absolutely clear that the deal we have done will deliver huge value to Scottish fishers over the transition and beyond,” the source said. The Scottish government analysis found that in six fisheries, the percentage of the quota available to UK fleets during the adjustment period would fall, particularly for the most heavily fished species of cod, haddock and whiting. Those quotas include North Sea cod, one of the most valuable white fish fisheries, which would fall from 63.5% to 57% for the UK. North Sea haddock, another valuable fishery, would fall from 92.5% of the quota to 84.2%. The Scottish government analysis, which did not include financial or tonnage data, said the quota would increase in five fisheries, including Irish Sea and west of Scotland haddock. UK government data show those fisheries are about two-thirds smaller than their North Sea equivalents. It would remain static in two fisheries. Ewing said the fine detail of the deal showed many of the apparent gains were either unrealisable because they were technical, or irrelevant because EU fleets were not catching their full quota allocation. The deal also meant UK fleets could not swap quota with EU fleets. “The quota either being given up by the EU or negotiated as a win by the UK government is of no worth nor value to Scottish fishing interests,” Ewing said.
Mike Park, the chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, said his members were “deeply aggrieved” about the immediate future. It was far from clear whether fleets would benefit greatly once the transition period was over. “The issue of sovereignty and our future ability to negotiate additional shares after the five-and-a-half-year window would seem clouded by so much complexity that it is difficult at this time to see how the UK government can use its newly recovered sovereignty to improve the situation of my members,” he said. The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations has condemned the deal as Boris Johnson’s “Ted Heath” moment, in reference to the then prime minister’s capitulation to the founding members of the European Community’s demand for access to British waters. They say the UK team has jettisoned their interests and the deal does not stop French, Spanish trawlers fishing within six miles of the UK’s coastline. The negotiating team denied this, saying the UK had regained sovereign control of British waters, albeit after a transition period, and this was “the diametric opposite of what happened in 1973”."
2020-12-29T06:00:35Z,politics,Politics,UK government accused of pursuing 'white nationalist' agenda,"The head of a race equality thinktank has accused the government of pursuing a divisive “white nationalist” agenda, prioritising the white working class at the expense of ethnic minorities in an attempt to win votes. In her first interview since being appointed director of the Runnymede Trust, Halima Begum said ministers had failed to respond meaningfully to the “seismic shifts” represented by Black Lives Matters (BLM) protests and the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic (BAME) Britons. She said that while companies such as Penguin, Goldman Sachs and Apple had been approaching Runnymede to find out what they could do to tackle structural racism, and the public and even civil servants were engaging on the topic, the government was denying its existence. “I think the government’s long-term plan is to work up white nationalism for the next elections,” said Begum. “What we should be saying is that working-class black and white communities have been left behind, because they’ve seen industries demolished in the north of this country. We haven’t seen the economies built back, we haven’t seen investment in our education system for years so that our black, white and Asian working-class children will thrive. “What I see instead is the Conservatives pushing through [a narrative of] a white working class that’s been left behind, which by the way is where [Donald] Trump was at about six years ago.” Runnymede was formed in 1968, the same year as Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech. Much has changed since then but BLM and the health and economic impacts of Covid on BAME people have highlighted longstanding inequalities. Begum, who joined Runnymede at the end of August, said this year’s events shifted the public discourse. By contrast, she said the government had been slow to address the increased risk to ethnic minorities from Covid and had used BAME appointments to its commission on race and ethnic disparities and to ministerial roles to propagate its denial of structural racism, citing as an example the equalities minister Kemi Badenoch’s rubbishing of critical race theory. “If you have white liberals pushing a white nationalist agenda, it’s very easy to challenge for other white liberals who don’t agree,” said Begum. “But if you can actually put in more black and minority leaders pushing hard on white nationalism, [it’s] much harder to challenge … It’s really important that we understand why these leaders are appointed. It is not to promote inclusiveness, it is actually to promote divisions.” Begum said she believed the Conservative government was inspired by the electoral success of rightwing politicians such as Trump in 2016 but also the party’s “individualistic notion of society and the economy”. She said: “There’s nothing wrong with the values of the Conservative party, which is to create more wealth … What they don’t see is that when they talk about the level playing field, they think the level playing field is not level for white people. What they don’t see is that the playing field is not level for black people, it hasn’t been for years … What I’d like them to think about is a formula that brings black working-class people with them as well and then I think if they did win [the election] good on them, they’re actually taking the whole voter base with them.” Despite her damning critique, Begum said she remained committed to working with the government and had recently met Boris Johnson’s special advisers. She also said her concerns were not limited to the Conservatives, warning a “nervous” Labour party against pandering to white nationalism and thinking “we’ve got to try some of that ourselves”. Begum said that while white working-class communities were disadvantaged, “they are not discriminated against because of the colour of their skin and that is what we mean by structural racism”. A government spokesperson said: “The independent commission on race and ethnic disparities was set up to examine where inequality exists across the whole of society. Both the prime minister and the commission remain fully committed to tackling racism, and we reject the divisive idea that the government is prioritising one group over another. “The PM is thrilled to have assembled a group of talented and diverse commissioners, who each bring a wealth of experience from across a range of important sectors. The evidence-led commission has been undertaking research and inviting submissions from various stakeholders – with the aim of delivering a positive agenda for change.”"
2020-12-28T22:00:24Z,politics,Politics,Starmer faces high-profile Labour rebellion before Brexit deal vote,"Keir Starmer is facing a high-profile rebellion against Labour’s Brexit position on the eve of the vote in parliament, as prominent MPs including John McDonnell and Clive Lewis accused him of “falling into the trap of rallying around this rotten deal”. Labour is likely to contain a major rebellion of frontbench MPs but an increasing number of prominent supporters are urging Starmer to change course. Backbenchers have also raised concerns on private WhatsApp groups that Labour’s endorsement for the deal has been given without the legislation being published. Tory Brexiters who are studying the trade deal will deliver their verdict on Tuesday afternoon. The European Research Group (ERG), the influential group of Eurosceptic backbenchers, will take its cue from its so-called “star chamber”, which includes the ERG deputy chairman David Jones, Sir Bill Cash and the QC Martin Howe, and is scrutinising the deal. It is understood senior members of the ERG are broadly supportive of the document but have identified issues – including fishing rights – where members plan to raise concerns. Those who signed the Labour statement urging Starmer not to support the deal come from across the political spectrum, including the former shadow chancellor McDonnell and Ben Bradshaw, a former cabinet minister who is a staunch supporter of Starmer. “This deal is a substantial downgrade of the UK’s relationship with the EU,” the statement warns, “and is designed to open the door to rampant economic deregulation – a loss of rights and protections for workers, the environment, food standards and many other areas of life.” Two former Labour leaders in the European parliament, Richard Corbett and Glyn Ford, as well as the former MEPs Julie Ward, Mary Honeyball, David Martin and Jude Kirton-Darling have also signed, along with the former Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis. The statement, organised by Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a Socialist Europe, has also been endorsed by two former MPs who lost their seats in the 2019 election, Anna Turley and Sandy Martin. Activists including Laura Parker, the former head of Momentum, the film-maker Paul Mason and Michael Chessum, from Another Europe Is Possible, who coordinated leftwing second-referendum efforts under Jeremy Corbyn, have also signed. The group that signed the statement, which also includes local activists and councillors, says the task of the opposition is proper parliamentary scrutiny and setting out an alternative. “That task gets harder if opposition parties fall into the trap of rallying around this rotten deal,” it says. “We are witnessing an act of vandalism against our livelihoods, our rights and our horizons. We call on Labour, the Labour movement and other opposition parties not to support the Tories’ Brexit deal when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons.” The UK parliament has been recalled to sit on Wednesday 30 December to debate and vote on the legislation but MPs are widely expected to pass the post-Brexit trade and security deal by a substantial margin after Starmer confirmed Labour would support it. The Lib Dems and the SNP are to vote against the deal. Any Tory Brexiter rebellion is likely to be small, though most said there would be no “whipping” arrangements for group members. “It will be up to individual colleagues to decide how they vote,” one MP said, a contrast to the heavily coordinated opposition of the Theresa May era. The Democratic Unionist party said it would be voting against the Brexit deal “on a point of principle” and not because it supported no deal, it said. The party’s leader, Arlene Foster, said she recognised it reduced the impact of red tape on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but “we still have many negative issues” arising from the Northern Ireland protocol. Other Northern Ireland MPs from the SDLP and Alliance parties will also vote against the deal. On Monday EU member states unanimously backed the deal, paving the way for the new arrangements to come into force on 1 January. At a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, the 27 member states gave their support for the 1,246-page treaty to be “provisionally applied” at the end of the year. The European parliament is delaying its vote until February or March, when it is hoped MEPs will return to Strasbourg to complete the formal EU ratification process. Speaking on Monday morning, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, hailed the deal but said British businesses faced a “bumpy” period from 1 January. “Businesses will need to make sure that they’re ready for new customs procedures and we as individuals will need to make sure that our passports are up to date because they need to have at least six months before expiry on them in order to be able to travel abroad,” he said. “I’m sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path.” There has been mounting anger from Britain’s fishers about the extent of EU boats’ fishing rights in UK waters. Under the terms of the agreement, 25% of EU boats’ fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a five-and-a-half-year transition period. Gove said UK fishers would be “getting a significant uptick … we will have by 2026 about two-thirds of the fish in our waters”. However, Andrew Locker, the chairman of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said they would be “absolutely worse off” as a result of the deal. “What we have got now is a fraction of what we were promised through Brexit. We are going to really, really struggle this year.” Many MPs on all sides have told whips they do not plan to be present on Wednesday given London’s tier 4 coronavirus restrictions. The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has strongly urged MPs to participate virtually and to use proxy votes."
2020-12-28T17:55:21Z,politics,Politics,EU states unanimously back Brexit trade and security deal,"The post-Brexit trade and security deal has been unanimously backed by EU member states, paving the way for the new arrangements to come into force on 1 January. At a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, the 27 member states gave their support for the 1,246-page treaty to be “provisionally applied” at the end of the year. The decision will be formally completed by written procedure at 3pm central European time (1400 GMT) on Tuesday. A spokesman for the German presidency of the EU, organising the bloc’s affairs, said the treaty had been given the green light.
The only obstacles standing in the way of the deal coming into force are votes by MPs and peers in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The UK parliament has been recalled to sit on Wednesday 30 December to debate and vote on the legislation. The European parliament is delaying its vote, to February or March, when it is hoped MEPs will return to Strasbourg to complete the formal EU ratification process. MEPs had said they did not have sufficient time before the end of the year to scrutinise the deal. Following a phone call with Boris Johnson on Monday, the European council president, Charles Michel, said he hoped the trade and security deal would be a platform for further cooperation. “Looking forward to cooperate on Covid, a possible treaty on pandemics; climate ahead of Cop26 and foreign policy issues as allies sharing common values,” Michel tweeted. Johnson said the deal would be a “new starting point for our relationship, between sovereign equals”. He tweeted: “We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change.” In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, Michel Barnier said there was a risk the treaty would lead to a rancorous EU-UK relationship, given the options to apply tariffs in the event of regulatory divergence over time. “There is evidently a risk … but I won’t make any unfounded accusations here. This agreement must be the basis of a smart and sustainable cooperation between Europe and the UK,” the EU’s chief negotiator said. Barnier said he had mixed feelings about the deal. “Can we be happy about a divorce?” he said. The deal, he said, had been “on the verge of breakup several times” including “a month ago and in Brussels more recently”. “The British have experienced diplomats who don’t give up and always ask for more,” he said. Speaking on Monday morning, the cabinet minister Michael Gove hailed the deal but said British businesses faced a “bumpy” period from 1 January. “Businesses will need to make sure that they’re ready for new customs procedures and we as individuals will need to make sure that our passports are up to date because they need to have at least six months before expiry on them in order to be able to travel abroad,” he said. “I’m sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there in order to try to do everything we can to smooth the path.”"
2020-12-28T17:40:18Z,politics,Politics,UK shoppers face Brexit duties on holiday and online purchases,"Holidaymakers or online shoppers who buy items from the EU that are valued at more than £390 will have to pay customs duties, the government has revealed. VAT and handling fees may also apply on some items, while parcels may be held up in post offices until all duties and fees have been cleared by the recipient in the UK. The additional red tape and charges from 1 January will be one of the most visible consequences of Brexit for consumers, hitting them in just the same way as business, albeit on a smaller scale, with implications for online shopping. It will also herald the end of “booze cruises” to the wine shops of Calais to stockpile drink for special occasions, as unlimited alcohol allowances are ending. Alcohol from the EU for personal consumption will be restricted to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine and 4 litres of spirits or liquors over 22% in alcohol. Personal tobacco allowances will be limited to 200 cigarettes. Posting to friends and family in the EU including Ireland is also going to become more bureaucratic. Those sending parcels from 1 January will be required to complete customs declaration forms, CN22 or CN23, detailing the type of good, its value and its weight.
Letters and documents can be sent to the EU as normal but the Post Office is advising customers to complete customs declaration forms on all goods destined for the EU from 29 December so the parcels are Brexit-compliant on arrival. Royal Mail says all consumers who receive goods from the EU will have to ensure they comply with customs regulations and warn they may have to pay duty, VAT or handling fees before they can pick up their package. This could have inconvenient consequences for online shopping for UK customers buying goods from the EU and for EU residents buying goods from the UK. Newly published government guidance on bringing goods into the UK spells out the post-Brexit rules. Goods up to the value of £390, or £270 for those arriving by private plane or boat, will be allowed through the green channel at airports. The notice states: “If a single item is worth more than your allowance you pay duty or tax on its full value, not just the value above the allowance.” Those importing goods purchased on a holiday or a business trip will be charged 2.5% duty on goods worth between £390 and £630, with other rates applying for more expensive goods depending on the type of good. Any amount over will incur excise duty and VAT. There may also be VAT charges and handling fees depending on the value of the item they are sending and whether it is a gift or commercial goods, said Royal Mail. It said: “For items under £135 (with the exception of gifts), VAT will be collected directly when they buy the goods online. For goods with a value over £135 (and gifts over £39), Royal Mail may collect the VAT and customs duties from the customer prior to delivery. These charges are applied on behalf of HM Revenue & Customs.” The government says it is “well placed” to manage the impact of changes to customs processing which already apply to goods going to non-EU countries, adding: “We are working closely with government and other stakeholders to ensure that all cross-border mail continues to flow efficiently.”"
2020-12-28T17:28:39Z,politics,Politics,"Committees, visas and climate change: Brexit experts' verdicts on the deal details","Experts are still poring over the 1,246-page Brexit trade deal, but the devil is always in the detail. Dozens of UK-EU committees overseeing all aspects of the deal will now have to be set up, committing the UK and the EU to semi-permanent Brexit negotiations. New business travel rules will mean fashion models and musicians may need work visas for Europe. And the economic damage from restoring trade barriers previously demolished could be felt for years to come. While the deal is thin, as expected, there are positives, including, say experts, on climate change, aviation and haulage. Here, three Brexologists shed light on some other details they have found so far in the deal. Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law, University of Cambridge On Christmas Eve, Boris Johnson declared: “We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation, in a way that is complete and unfettered.” All sorted then? No – the deal shows it’s not that simple. The effervescent rhetoric failed to mention a swathe of machinery that the new UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), will introduce, with the powers to make legally binding decisions. At the top is the partnership council (PC), a political body to be comprised of representatives of the European commission and UK government ministers. It will consider “any issue relating to the implementation, application and interpretation” of the TCA. It even holds the power, in certain circumstances, to amend the agreement itself. Decisions are by mutual consent, including on jots and tittles. Next comes a slew of technical committees. There’s the trade partnership committee, which can assist the PC, and 10 “trade specialised committees”, covering matters such as rules of origin and services. Then there are eight specialised committees covering matters such as air and road transport and four working groups on matters such as motor vehicles and parts and social security coordination. Staff in the UK’s slimmed-down Brussels office are going to be very busy. Much of this mirrors many other trade agreements. Yet these bodies, especially the partnership council, will make decisions that will affect UK businesses for years to come. So how much will the public and their elected representatives know of what is being decided? Who will sit on the PC, what is their mandate, and will the agenda and meaningful minutes be published? The practice of the joint committee, the equivalent of the PC under the withdrawal agreement, which was chaired by Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, is not promising. The minutes of its fifth meeting, on 17 December 2020, ran to a single page. Equally, who will scrutinise the work of the PC and its various committees? There must be a role for Westminster, but will that extend to the devolved administrations? The TCA makes provision for a parliamentary partnership assembly, with members drawn from the European and UK parliaments, which can be kept informed of the PC’s work and can make recommendations to it. There is a (weak) role for civil society too. Taking back control of our laws was central to the Brexit promise. Starting with Wednesday’s scrutiny of the deal, Westminster needs to look very closely at what is being done in the UK’s name. It is time for parliamentarians to assert control over the future that has so loudly been promised. Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform Beyond tariffs, quotas and fish, the TCA contains a variety of provisions. Among those with implications for everyone engaged in business travel are the rules governing what Britons entering the EU are, and are not, allowed to do from 2021 onwards. The TCA allows for British short-term business visitors to enter the EU visa-free for 90 days in any given six-month period, but there are restrictions on the activities they can perform. Crudely speaking, the list of permitted activities shows that while meetings, trade exhibitions and conferences, consultations and research are fine, anything that involves selling goods or services directly to the public requires an actual work visa. For example, from the beginning of next year a British fashion model could still go to Italy for meetings and to make connections, but if they wanted to take part in a paid fashion show or photoshoot, they would need to obtain an Italian work visa.
Similarly, touring musicians will now probably need to get a work visa (or multiple work visas) if they are to gig in venues across the continent. Even for those activities seemingly permitted by the TCA, all might not be what it seems. Different EU member states have their own immigration regimes, which might allow additional activities or apply further conditions. Austria, for example, requires a work permit for market research. There also might be additional necessary criteria, such as a recognised qualification. From 1 January, many businesspeople will probably be unaware of the new restrictions and continue to act as they did before. They might get away with it, or they might not. But breaching the terms of a visa could lead to fines, deportation and at the extreme end, being banned from entering the EU in future. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy The climate change measures in the deal are new and welcome. Reading trade deals is not for the unwary, written as they are in legalese drawing heavily on precedent to such an extent that there really is a reference in the UK-EU agreement to the software product Netscape Communicator 4, out of date since 2000. Even when it seems something is new in an EU deal, a check on a previous trade agreement will find something similar, or a fellow trade wonk will point out it has been lifted from some other obscure source. Such a reliance on precedent partly explains why the rules governing trade at the WTO and in bilateral agreements have come to seem increasingly outdated with respect to modern trade, for example in having little to say about e-commerce. Thankfully, in at least one area the UK and EU have broken new ground, and that is in the battle against climate change. Previous EU trade agreements talked a good game without much substance; this one enshrines commitments on reducing emissions, including those from aviation, and implementing carbon pricing. There are also enforcement mechanisms, both domestic and through the trade agreement. The EU is discussing implementation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism, essentially subjecting imports to a similar carbon-pricing regime as that in place domestically, to ensure no outsourcing of emissions. The details are likely to be complex, but the UK should be exempt when trading into the EU because it has already signed up to carbon pricing in the trade deal, and may even want to follow the EU’s lead in applying carbon emission analysis to imports into the UK. The US under President Biden is also likely to incorporate climate-change measures in new trade deals. Climate change isn’t the only global issue where there is a strong case for ensuring imports meet domestic standards, and which trade deals are starting to address. Antimicrobial resistance, linked to the overuse of antibiotics in farmed animals, and animal welfare are others. Both are referenced in the deal, with the parties agreeing to cooperate, but on this occasion without firm commitments. That’s another thing about trade deals: they rarely go far enough. They are, after all, predominantly about trade. But on all of these issues the UK can and should go further in future agreements."
2020-12-28T17:23:47Z,politics,Politics,'Betrayed': UK fishing industry says Brexit deal threatens long-term damage,"The UK’s fishing sector will face immediate hardship and long-lasting damage under the new European Union deal, industry leaders and boat owners have claimed. There is anger that “marginal” gains on the share of fish the UK fleet will be allowed to catch may be outweighed by the end of the system of “quota swapping”, which has until now enabled deals to be made between British boats and their counterparts from mainland Europe. Many fishers, especially those on the south coast of England, are also furious that EU boats will be able to work up to just six miles off the British coast. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Monday the agreement the UK had struck with the EU was the “best possible deal” for the fishing industry as a whole. Gove also said a “major funding package” would be announced for the sector in the “very near future” to help it take full advantage of Brexit. Writing in the Scotsman, Gove argued that at present British fishers were entitled to around half the fish in the country’s waters but by 2026 this would rise to two-thirds. But the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations (NFFO) claimed the gains were marginal. Speaking after Gove’s remarks, the NFFO’s chief executive, Barrie Deas, said there was a growing feeling of disappointment and frustration in the industry. He said: “There have been some marginal changes on the quota shares but we’re tied back into an arrangement that gives access to the EU fleet to our waters up to the six-mile limit. We thought an exclusive 12-mile limit was an absolute red line for the UK. That hasn’t held.” The NFFO said that for now the UK’s share of some stocks was only increasing slightly – 10% to 20% for Celtic Sea haddock, for example, while North Sea saithe (coley) was rising from 23% to 26%. Andrew Locker, the director of the family-run business Lockers Trawlers, which operates two fishing boats out of Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, said 2021 was going to be challenging for many who worked on the North Sea because the system of quota swapping was being lost. “I don’t know how the hell we’re going to get through 2021,” he said. “We used to swap quota we didn’t want with quota the French or Germans didn’t want and that enabled us to put together an annual fishing plan. “This year we’re going to be woefully short of the amount of saithe, hake and cod we can catch. I’m angry, disappointed and betrayed.”
Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said she did not believe the deal delivered what had been promised. She said: “The principles that the government said it supported – control over access, quota shares based on zonal attachment, annual negotiations – do not appear to be central to the agreement. After all the promises given to the industry, that is hugely disappointing.” There is also concern about export of fish from the UK to mainland Europe. Tavish Scott, the chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers’ Organisation, said: “Brexit means the Scottish salmon sector now face the reality of lots more red tape, bureaucracy and paperwork which are the reality of the extra trade barriers.” Irish fishing groups condemned the Brexit deal as a grave setback. “The deal is a really bad fish deal for Ireland,” Seán O’Donoghue, the chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation, one of the industry’s biggest groups, said. He claimed the terms looked “even worse” than first appeared last week when the organisation issued a blistering condemnation of the deal’s impact, especially on mackerel fishing. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, met representatives of fishing organisations on Monday afternoon. Martin acknowledged the severe impact that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations would have on the fishing industry in Ireland and said a “comprehensive plan” would be developed to address their concerns."
2020-12-28T08:30:08Z,politics,Politics,"'If anyone had said our mining town would go Tory, I'd have thought they were mad'","I first met George Bell on the 20th anniversary of the 1984-85 miners’ strike when he and many fellow miners had swapped the camaraderie of the coalface for jobs in the public sector and charities helping communities devastated by the closure of the local pits. He had become a homelessness officer for Bassetlaw district council in Nottinghamshire, and was an active Unison branch secretary, using skills gained from his days in the National Union of Mineworkers to fight for employees’ terms and conditions, when the council transferred its housing staff to a new organisation. Almost two decades on, I decided to track down Bell and the others – now in their 60s and 70s – to find out how the seismic shifts in this part of the east Midlands, where the history of the mines and the strike still casts a long shadow, had affected them and their families. “If anyone had said back then that we’d go Tory, I’d have thought they were mad,” says Bell, now 72. “Mind you, I could see the result coming. A lot of it was down to the anti-Corbyn rhetoric.” A former fitter at Shireoaks colliery, near Worksop, Bell is retired and volunteers on the Chesterfield Canal – a 46-mile stretch of water created in the 18th century to transport coal and which until last year ran through traditional Labour heartlands. Phil Whitehead, 61, had been an electrician at Shireoaks. He went out canvassing for Labour at the last election and says he heard the same two things on the doorstep: “‘I’m voting for Boris ’cos he’ll get Brexit done’ and ‘I don’t trust that Corbyn’. They didn’t trust Labour to follow Brexit through and enough believed the Corbyn caricatures in the tabloids.” Whitehead gained a sociology degree and an MA in housing when the pits, which he first entered aged 16, closed. He has worked in senior roles for a number of housing associations across the region ever since. Born and bred in Worksop, once the area’s industrial powerhouse, Whitehead believes demographic changes also have a lot to do with Labour losing a quarter of its votes in Bassetlaw at the last general election and a 7% swing to the Tories in neighbouring Bolsover, where Dennis Skinner lost his seat after 49 years. “Worksop was where the miners lived and had always voted Labour, but a lot of them are dead now,” says Whitehead. “They’ve been replaced by young families buying four-bed houses in new upmarket housing estates, who have little attachment to the area or its history. They’re here because of reasonable housing prices with good links to the M1 and rail services to Nottingham and Sheffield where there are decent jobs.” The big employers locally are out-of-town warehouses and distribution centres. “A lot of it is low-paid, non-unionised work,” says Bell. “The electricians, brick works, timber yards and other industries that used to service the mines are all long gone.” And there are now at least eight food banks.
Sitting in the living room of the council house he bought under right-to-buy with the payoff when he left Shireoaks, the irony’s not lost on Bell that he benefited from one of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policies, but he says he didn’t know if he’d ever work again so he needed to keep the roof over his family’s heads. He adds that although he and his wife, Christine, a former care assistant, are “comfortably off”, he voted leave in the EU referendum, hoping it would be a catalyst for change for the area. “I just thought things couldn’t get any worse for a lot of people round here and maybe it would lead to more internal investment if we left.” Whitehead was another Brexiter. He says: “I was never a lover of the EU. I always thought it primarily represented the interests of bosses, big business and the banks, it rarely did anything for ordinary people. I accepted that it could initially put the British economy in a tough position, but I thought we could get a deal like Norway has. I never voted leave for a no deal.” Now, Whitehead says, “I’d probably vote differently,” if given the opportunity again. “We also underestimated how it has in some ways ‘legitimised’ xenophobia and racist opinions.” Bell agrees. “We’ve opened Pandora’s box. In the pub, they say things like ‘If they [foreign workers] are in our factories we haven’t got control. We want them out. Brexit is our way of getting those people back to where they came from.’ I challenge them but it gets really nasty. People feel emboldened to say things they wouldn’t have done before.” But Adrian Gilfoyle, 69, and Dave Potts, 67, who worked at Bassetlaw’s Manton colliery – the last local pit to close in 1994 – don’t regret their decision to vote leave. “Why should we do what other countries tell us? All these foreign countries want to do business with us – they can’t afford not to. Most people don’t like change, but they’ll get use to it,” says Gilfoyle, who is semi-retired from the council caretaker job he still loves after 17 years. For Potts, who was sacked from Manton after being jailed during the strike in 1984, the betrayals during the miners’ strike still loom large. “Arguments about how we’re stronger together staying in the EU don’t hold true,” he says. “I’ve come from a miners’ strike that fell apart. We don’t stand together.” Although he voted Labour 12 months ago, Potts has since left the party after 40 years, including a stint as a local councillor. He is disillusioned with politics. “I look back and realise they’ve done nothing for us. For too many politicians it’s the career that’s important to them, not the people they represent. We seem to be forgotten.” Potts was out of work for eight years, before North Notts FE College employed him to coordinate support for students. And his family waited for a council house for 27 years. “That uncertainty takes its toll on your mind,” says Potts. A stroke seven years ago forced him to retire from Bassetlaw Learning Centre where he was working with pupils excluded from school. John Scott, 73, another ex-Manton miner, worked for a local charity providing second-hand furniture for homeless people and people on low incomes. When funding for his post as deputy manager, and then volunteer coordinator, ran out, he stayed on as a driver until he retired eight years ago. Since then he has volunteered for another furniture project and was a local ward councillor for a term. He says he was one of the few people he knew who voted both remain and Labour. Yet once the country voted to leave, however, he believes Labour should have accepted the decision and fought for a proper deal. He is in no doubt that the party’s position cost it the 2019 election. “No one understood what Labour stood for. Lots of my friends voted Tory for the first time to get out of the EU,” he says. A poll for Channel 4 earlier this month of 45 “red wall” seats won by the Tories in the North and Midlands in 2019, found that 16% of 2019 Conservative voters say they do not know how they would vote now, while 7% say they would switch directly to Labour. Many cited confusing messaging over Covid, and Dominic Cummings’s trip to Barnard Castle as the reason for their change of heart. Scott says while some of his friends may be less enamoured with Boris Johnson after his mishandling of Covid, Keir Starmer has still to prove himself. Each July (until Covid struck), the men I spoke to usually make the journey up to the Durham Miners’ Gala, where some 200,000 people gather on the second Saturday of the month to commemorate the country’s rich mining heritage, show solidarity and reminisce with old friends.
“I usually end up singing in a bar somewhere with George,” says Dave Anderson, 67, a gala committee member. I had spoken to Anderson in 2004 when he had gone from being a fitter at the Eppleton colliery in Durham to a care services officer for Newcastle city council. He then worked nationally for Unison and in 2005 became Labour MP for Blaydon, in Gateshead. He stood down in 2017. The north-east has also seen profound changes in the politics of its residents. During the EU referendum campaign he recalls having a remain stall in town, which was quickly dismantled when it became apparent his supporters were going to vote Brexit. “I didn’t want to antagonise them and weaken Labour’s chances at the next election,” he explains. (They hung on with a 5,000 majority in 2019). “Our part of the country benefited from huge amounts of EU money for infrastructure but people didn’t realise that. They stopped listening to the arguments [to stay in]. It [voting leave] was an emotional response to a feeling that they’d been betrayed for 30 years.” “If there had been more working-class MPs listened to in the Blair years, it would have been different, but he ignored them, and took it for granted that people in this part of the world would always vote Labour because they had no alternative.” “People say to me, it must have been awful working down the pit,” says Anderson. “Don’t get me wrong, most people’s standard of living and health are miles better off now than they were in the 70s, but people felt secure then and for them everything looks rosy going back.” That’s certainly true for Potts, who says nostalgically, “I stand in the square in Durham on the Saturday morning [of the miners’ gala] when all the banners go past and I just think, how the hell did we ever lose [the strike]? I just can’t imagine it.” As for Whitehead, he believes Thatcher has finally achieved what she set out to do when she took on the miners almost four decades ago in Labour’s heartlands. Today they feel they owe their allegiance to no one, he says: “Ultimately, her legacy is a fragmented, individualised society.”"
2020-12-28T08:29:44Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Sunak suggests EU access for financial services will exceed deal,"Rishi Sunak has offered financial services firms the prospect of closer access to EU markets than outlined in the Brexit trade deal, after Boris Johnson conceded that this aspect of the agreement fell short of UK hopes. With MPs and experts still poring over the 1,246-page details of the agreement ahead of votes in the Commons and Lords on Wednesday, increasing focus has fallen on the relative lack of provision for the service sector, which makes up about 80% of the UK economy. Johnson hailed the deal, finally agreed on Christmas Eve, saying it managed what many had believed impossible in getting a trade deal that allowed divergence from EU standards. On services, which also make up 50% of UK exports, Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph that there had been “access for solicitors, barristers” and a “good deal for digital”. But with financial services, he said the deal “perhaps does not go as far as we would like”. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Sunak said the aim was to firm up agreements on the system of equivalence, whereby UK banks and other financial institutions can trade, on a regulatory basis, as if they were still in the EU. The chancellor said he hoped a planned memorandum of understanding on the issue between the UK and EU in the next few months could smooth over many obstacles. “This deal also provides reassurance because there’s a stable regulatory cooperative framework mentioned in the deal,” Sunak said. “I think [that] will give people that reassurance that we will remain in close dialogue with our European partners when it comes to things like equivalence decisions.” However, the impact on many service-based businesses will be immediate. Sally Jones, who leads on Brexit issues for EY, said that as of 1 January, UK accountancy and auditing qualifications would no longer be recognised in the EU. “We won’t be able to send audit partners who hold UK audit qualifications to sign audit reports overseas any more, which means the quality of audits will be that little bit lower, if the best person who could have given that audit opinion is a Brit,” she told the BBC. “If I want to practise in Italy or Germany or Spain, I’d have to re-qualify, which would involve sitting horrendous exams and, worse, three or more years of professional experience.” Despite such concerns, the trade deal is set to pass through the Commons easily after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, announced last week that his party would back the plan, saying it was better than the prospect of no deal. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said on Sunday that this support came with many reservations. “Businesses have been through so much, the last thing that they need now is yet more legal uncertainty,” she told Sky News. “But this is a thin deal. It is not what the Conservatives promised, but Labour’s not going to stand in the way to getting those measures implemented. They are needed now. Businesses are calling out to have as much certainty as possible in this challenging time.” One Labour MP who opposes Starmer’s decision said they expected relatively few of the predicted resignations by shadow frontbenchers over the vote on Wednesday. “I think a lot of them feel in their bones that Keir is making a mistake here,” the MP said, saying some even believed it could cost Labour the next election. “But it’s his mistake and years away. The pain of resignation is immediate, so they’ll roll with it.” The Scottish National party confirmed on Sunday that its MPs will vote against what it called “Boris Johnson’s extreme Tory Brexit” next week, saying the deal reinforced the case for Scottish independence. On the Conservative side, Brexit-minded MPs from the influential European Research Group (ERG) have yet to give an official verdict, with some legally-qualified MPs and others from the organisation studying the deal. However, some MPs associated with the group told the Guardian they do not expect the ERG’s self-styled “star chamber” to uncover any elements to which the group would vehemently object, and so expected that any Tory revolt will be small."
2020-12-28T05:00:04Z,politics,Politics,European parliament begins scrutiny of post-Brexit trade agreement,"Members of the European parliament will start belated scrutiny of the post-Brexit trade agreement on Monday, after EU and UK negotiators finally struck a deal on Christmas Eve. The delays in finalising the agreement have left MEPs with no chance to approve the deal before it comes into force on 1 January. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will start a round of national and party consultations with MEPs. MEPs from all factions are angry that they will be unable to scrutinise the deal fully in advance, but the chances of them rejecting it are low because the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has kept them fully informed throughout the talks. Some MEPs, however, feel the sovereignty of the parliament has been systematically undermined either by Boris Johnson’s negotiating tactics or the commission’s indifference to MEPs right to ratify treaties. Some German Green MPs have demanded greater scrutiny and clear sanctions if the UK breaks the rules, pointing to the plethora of joint committees and working groups that will now be set up between the UK and the EU. MEPs have also called for more detail about how Brussels will be able to ensure a Conservative-led UK government does not use its new freedoms to diverge from key social and environmental standards in the years ahead. There are no provisions in the deal to prevent the UK shifting to a lower tax economy, although in practice the deficits run up as a result of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to lead to tax increases in the coming years. Many MEPs are also concerned about Brexit’s implications for the continued unity of the UK. Some insist the European parliament should make it clear it would welcome an independent Scotland joining the EU, a stance that would cause concern in Spain faced by a separatist Catalonia. The president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, welcomed the deal on Christmas Eve and implied that most of its red lines had been preserved. “The parliament is now ready to react responsibly in order to minimise disruption to citizens and business,” he said. “The parliament will continue its work in the responsible committees and the full plenary before deciding whether to give consent in the new year.” Udo Bullmann, a German socialist member of the parliament’s trade committee said MEPs would “put the agreement through its paces over the next few weeks and then decide on its value. The rules on competitive conditions and market access will be examined in particular so that no new loopholes for dumping practices and tested EU standards arise.”
David McAllister, the parliament’s Brexit commissioner, said in an interview with Die Welt that the deal “would have far reaching consequences for people, companies and public administrations. Trade between the EU and the UK will no longer run as smoothly as it would when when we jointly tackled the internal market and the customs union.” Iratxe García, the leader of the parliament’s socialist group, emphasised that the deal could not set a precedent for the way the commission consults the parliament on future trade deals. “This is a unique situation and there has and never will be an agreement quite like it, either in its nature or its procedure,” she said. Pedro Silva Pereira, the socialist representative on the Brexit coordination group, said: “We will now analyse the final outcome of negotiations but, having had regular contact with the EU negotiating team, we believe that this agreement deserves our full support since it ensures a new relationship based on fair trade and high standards, avoiding social, environmental and regulatory dumping, and protecting our fishing communities.” He is one of many MEPs who hopes the UK will come to see purpose in cooperating on a common foreign policy, something that is not covered by trade agreement."
2020-12-27T17:57:53Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit deal threatens UK labour and climate standards, thinktank warns","UK workers’ rights and climate and other environmental protections are at serious risk of being eroded under the Brexit trade deal, a leading thinktank has warned. The Institute for Public Policy Research said that under the agreement struck on Christmas Eve, to be debated by MPs this week, commitments on workers’ rights and environmental standards to maintain fair competition between UK and EU businesses were considerably weaker than expected and would make it hard to prevent standards diverging over time. The “delicate compromise”, designed to secure UK sovereignty while also ensuring tariff-free trade, will be especially difficult to enforce if the UK fails to keep pace with improved EU levels of labour standards or environmental protection, the thinktank said. The IPPR’s analysis highlighted three important benefits from the deal, which it argued made the agreement preferable to a no-deal outcome: tariff-free and quota-free trade in goods, continued social security coordination between the UK and the EU, including healthcare coverage, and continued data sharing for security purposes. There is a protocol with arrangements for the coordination of social security benefits for UK and EU citizens – for example, UK citizens living in the UK and working in the EU, UK citizens temporarily visiting the EU, and UK citizens moving residence to the EU (and vice versa). This covers a range of benefits, including sickness, maternity and pensions. However, the IPPR said the new process agreed for safeguarding a “level playing field” between UK and EU businesses after Brexit set such a high bar for proof that UK standards could easily be watered down. Under the agreement, if the UK fails to keep pace on EU levels of labour, social or environmental protection and this affects trade or investment, the EU could take proportionate measures in response, such as introducing tariffs. But there are strict criteria: any assessment of the impact of divergence must be based on “reliable evidence” and not mere “conjecture or remote possibility”, the agreement states. Even then, proposed “rebalancing measures” – sanctions in the form of tariffs, designed to compensate one side for an unfair disadvantage – could be referred to an arbitration tribunal before they can be introduced if one side requests this. The arbitration panels are likely to include foreign judges, but the European court of justice will not be involved after pressure from the UK. As a result, the IPPR said, “rebalancing measures are only likely to be used in a rare number of scenarios”. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said there would be a review after four years to ensure that the level playing field was working.
Boris Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph that the deal would provide new “legislative and regulatory freedoms to deliver for people who felt left behind”. However, Marley Morris, the IPPR’s associate director for immigration, trade and EU relations, said: “This thin deal is better than no deal at all, but still creates major trade barriers with our closest neighbour, which will inhibit growth and slow the economic recovery. “The protections it offers on labour and environmental standards are also surprisingly weak and appear to leave considerable scope for a UK government to weaken EU-derived protections. This leaves protections for workers, climate and the environment at serious risk of being eroded.”"
2020-12-27T15:27:57Z,politics,Politics,SNP confirms it will vote against 'extreme Tory Brexit' deal,"The Scottish National party has confirmed its MPs will vote against what it called “Boris Johnson’s extreme Tory Brexit” next week, saying the newly agreed deal reinforced the case for Scottish independence. The expected decision, made following a meeting of the SNP’s Westminster parliamentary group, guarantees at least some formal opposition when the deal is put to the Commons on Wednesday. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: “Boris Johnson’s extreme Tory Brexit is an unforgivable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity, which will cause lasting damage to the economy and leave the UK much worse off at the worst possible time – during a pandemic and economic recession. “Scotland has been completely ignored by Westminster throughout the Brexit process and we are being forced to pay a devastating price. It is clear that the only way to protect Scotland’s interests, and regain the full benefits of EU membership, is to become an independent country.
“This is a very bad deal for Scotland, which will terminate our membership of the EU, rip us out of the world’s largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape, added costs and barriers to trade for Scottish businesses. The blame lies squarely with the Tory government.” Noting that Keir Starmer has said Labour will support the deal, finalised on Christmas Eve, Blackford said it was evident the plan would be passed anyway, “but it is not being done in our name”. He said: “Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. The people of Scotland have a right to determine our own future as an independent European country.” Labour has expressed disappointment with the deal but will impose a maximum three-line whip for its MPs to vote in favour, with Starmer saying it was vital to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The stance has prompted opposition among some Labour MPs, with the possibility that some shadow frontbenchers could resign their posts to vote against the plan. The Liberal Democrats have condemned the deal, but the party’s leader, Ed Davey, has said only that his MPs will “not be supporting it”, rather than explicitly committing to a vote against. MPs are being recalled to consider and vote on the deal on 30 December, with the government’s aim being for both the Commons and Lords to approve the plan on the same day."
2020-12-27T12:35:47Z,politics,Politics,Why Boris Johnson is perfectly happy to own his Brexit trade deal | Larry Elliott,"Thirty years ago this month there were crunch trade talks in Brussels. After four years of discussions, attempts to secure a new global deal were not going well. Inside the negotiating room, the US and EU teams were at loggerheads. Outside, on the streets of the Belgian capital, farmers were rioting over proposed cuts in agricultural subsidies. As deadline time for the first editions of the UK papers loomed, the press room was graced by the arrival of the Daily Telegraph’s man on the spot: a young Boris Johnson. The paper’s news desk had belatedly twigged that there was a story in these collapsing trade talks and had told Johnson to find out what it was. Britain’s future prime minister did what any other journalist would do in the circumstances: he turned on the charm and asked his fellow hacks to fill him in. From memory, he wasn’t too bothered about the nitty-gritty but just wanted the big picture. That was smart. By and large, people find the details of trade negotiations boring and often incomprehensible. There will be those who read and understand every clause of the agreement signed last week by the UK and the EU, but they will be as small in number as those who made it past page 5 of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. As such, it’s reasonable to assume that for most voters the details of the deal between London and Brussels will become fuzzy quite quickly. They will recall that it had something to do with fish but will need to do a Google search to find out precisely what it was. The big picture will matter; the small print won’t. Those on the left who have been urging Sir Keir Starmer to vote against the UK–EU deal would do well to bear this in mind. Labour, it is said, should make sure that Johnson has to “own” the accord, so that when its “disastrous” consequences become evident the prime minister will suffer the political fallout. This is wishful thinking for a number of reasons. There is zero evidence that the UK’s trade performance has any political salience, despite the fact that this country has been running a whopping deficit in manufactured goods in every year since the early 1980s. Moreover, what matters to a nation’s trade performance is the quality of the goods and services it provides rather than the trade deals it negotiates. The EU’s single market is much more advanced for goods than it is for services, yet that hasn’t prevented the UK from running a hefty surplus in services trade. Why? Because since joining what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 the structure of the UK economy has changed. Manufacturing has been hollowed out but the services sector has grown and become highly competitive internationally. A potted history of the three decades goes something like this. The Brussels trade talks took place less than a month after Margaret Thatcher had been defenestrated as prime minister and two months after the UK had joined the European exchange rate mechanism. At a time when communism was collapsing, plans were afoot for European monetary union and a new single currency. In the 1990s Britain crashed out of the ERM on Black Wednesday, the single currency became a reality, and we saw the arrival of fully turbo-charged globalisation. It became axiomatic – for parties of the left as well as the right – that there was little that could be done (or should be done) to meddle with market forces. People, goods and money should all be free to move around the world. Nation states were deemed to be redundant and the focus of politics changed. There was no longer any real debate about economics; instead, radicalism was increasingly challenged towards cultural change. In the 2000s, Labour’s traditional coalition started to come apart. The university graduates and white-collar public sector workers who increasingly came to dominate the party embraced the mix of economic and social liberalism. The party’s blue-collar wing, which tended to favour economic activism and social conservatism, did not. A particular cause of friction was the sharp increase in net migration after countries in eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004. Gradually, Britain became two countries. One half did well out of globalisation; the other half did not. One half liked the idea of unrestricted free movement of capital and people; the other half did not. One half was broadly satisfied with the status quo; the other half was not. To make matters worse, when those who were unhappy sought to voice their concerns they were ignored or told to pipe down. The EU referendum in June 2016 provided them with an opportunity to be heard and they took it. It was a sign of the boiling resentment that they were willing to ignore the wildly hyperbolic claims of imminent disaster from both the domestic and political establishment and to vote for Brexit. Having done so, they expected the normal rules of democracy to apply. What they didn’t expect was to be vilified and for the losing side to do everything in its power to overturn the result. They found the idea of being told to think again in a People’s Vote an insult, which indeed it was. The demolition of Labour’s “red wall” in the 2019 general election was the result. As Starmer now seems to have belatedly realised, there is little political mileage in continuing to carp about the decision made in June 2016. Johnson is happy to “own” his trade deal because it allows him to say that he will use the freedom provided to address the grievances of leave voters. He would be delighted to see Labour oppose it."
2020-12-27T10:30:42Z,politics,Politics,"What does Brexit mean for you? Shopping, mobile calls, flying, driving …","Will I see prices rise at the supermarket? There had been warnings that products such as meats, dairy and cereals sold in the UK could have faced tariffs of as much as 50% under World Trade Organisation rules. But the deal means there will be no tariffs on products sold between the UK and the EU, allowing companies on both sides to keep trading in a similar way to now. This should prevent price rises and keep shelves stocked. However, there will be considerably more bureaucracy. And where there is red tape, there is inevitably a cost incurred to negotiate it. The UK’s food chain could well be “slower, more complex and more expensive for months if not years”, according to the Cold Chain Federation. What of travel to EU countries? Rules for business trips and holidays will change as free movement of people between the EU and UK comes to an end. UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK. UK citizens wishing to travel to Europe should have at least six months left on their passport before they travel. From 2022, they will have to pay for a visa-waiver scheme to visit many EU countries. The European Commission says the choice to end free movement “inevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is”. People are advised to check with the member state they are travelling to. Will I notice any difference when I land in Paris or Frankfurt? British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and borders. What about the cost of mobile phone calls abroad? Free mobile phone data-roaming will end. However, UK customers may notice little change. The four main providers in the UK – EE, 02, Vodafone and Three – have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming charges. May I take my pet abroad? The pet passport scheme between the UK and the EU ends on 1 January. However, Britain will be given “part two listed” status, allowing pets to travel within EU borders. Owners will need to ensure their animal has been vaccinated against rabies and microchipped, so that they can obtain an animal health certificate, which reportedly might take up to a month to organise. The new certificate must be obtained at least 10 days before travelling, and will be valid for only four months and only for a single trip. Will my European health insurance card still work? All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid – but only until the date of their expiry. The UK is to issue a new card called the global health insurance card which, like the EHIC, covers chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies. The Brexit agreement says that any specialised treatment, such as cancer treatment, “must be subject to a prior agreement between the insured person and the unit providing the treatment”. What about driving in EU member states? Motorists with a driving licence issued in the UK will not need to use an international driving permit in the EU, as had previously been thought likely. However, they will need a car insurance green card to prove that they are insured in the UK. Watch out for this, as it reportedly can take up to six weeks to obtain. Will my professional UK qualifications be recognised by other EU member states? Not automatically. A framework is being drawn up that might help facilitate some form of mutual recognition in the future. But it may turn out to be the case that each UK qualification body ends up having to negotiate a bilateral agreement with its counterpart in each respective EU member state."
2020-12-27T09:51:31Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson admits Brexit deal falls short for financial services,"Boris Johnson has conceded that the Brexit trade deal “perhaps does not go as far as we would like” over access to EU markets for financial services, while insisting he had achieved an accord his critics said would be impossible. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, the prime minister said he had defied accusations of “cake-ism” – seeking the impossible – in getting a trade deal that allowed divergence from EU standards. It had been, Johnson said, billed as out of the question “that you could do free trade with the EU without being drawn into their regulatory or legislative orbit”. While service industries, the bulk of UK exports to the EU, could face potential regulatory or other non-tariff barriers, Johnson said there had been “access for solicitors, barristers” and a “good deal for digital”. But on financial services, he said the deal “perhaps does not go as far as we would like”. There are measures in the agreement for the possible imposition of tariffs if the UK diverges notably from existing standards. Johnson said this should not be viewed by Brexit-minded Conservative MPs as too restrictive. “All that’s really saying is the UK won’t immediately send children up chimneys or pour raw sewage all over its beaches,” he said. “We’re not going to regress, and you’d expect that.”
Saying it was “unlikely” the UK would impose its own tariffs, Johnson added that any imposed by the EU “would have to be proportionate and approved by the arbitrator”, and if that happened regularly, the UK would revert to World Trade Organization trading terms. However, Johnson told the paper, the UK could and would set its own path in some areas, mentioning as one idea the notion of so-called free ports, low-tax trade zones which advocates say boost economic growth, but which have been accused of helping tax evasion. Free ports exist within the EU, although with some restrictions. The prime minister said more plans would emerge now the trade deal was finalised: “A great government effort has gone into compiling these and we haven’t necessarily wanted to talk about them much during this period because that perhaps would not have been fruitful.” He added: “We want to see what we can take forward. We don’t want to diverge for the sake of diverging. But we’re going to want to do things differently where that’s useful for the British people.” MPs and peers will gather on 30 December to scrutinise and vote on the deal, before the 1 January expiry of the current Brexit transition period. While the fact Labour has said it will vote for the deal guarantees it will pass easily, Johnson could still face anger from the strongly pro-Brexit wing of his party, who are currently examining the details of the agreement. In the interview, Johnson sought to portray the deal as the ultimate conclusion of Margaret Thatcher’s 1988 speech in Bruges, in which she railed against the idea of a “European superstate”, calling Thatcher’s address “prophetic”.
“It’s the end of a long and fractious period, in which we kept trying to pretend to ourselves that we could go along with all sorts of things we didn’t really want to do for the sake of keeping up with the great project of European Union,” he said of the trade deal. “I think this gives us a basis for a new friendship and partnership that should attract people who love Europe and want to have a great relationship with it, who want to feel close to it. “But it should also be something that is welcome to people who see the advantages of economic and political independence. I think the country as a whole has got itself into a new and more stable footing. It’s a better relationship and a healthier relationship.”"
2020-12-27T09:45:41Z,politics,Politics,Britain’s trade deal with the EU sets the scene for arguments to continue | Sam Lowe,"The new EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement will make trading goods and services between the two partners more difficult. While the trade agreement delivers duty- and quota-free trade (so long as exports meet stringent local content requirements), it does little to facilitate trade in services, and the UK did not manage to substantially reduce the need for more post-Brexit controls and bureaucracy. The government explicitly prioritised regaining the ability to set its own laws over retaining the economic benefits of EU membership. Against this metric, the negotiations can be deemed a partial success. The UK successfully rebuffed EU demands to follow its subsidy rules now and for ever, to keep specific environmental and labour rules, and to have the European court of justice involved in trade disputes.
But it did not avoid signing up to strict conditionality. Great Britain now has the ability to diverge from EU rules in future – but doing so could lead to it losing the benefits of the trade agreement, and tariffs being reimposed, for example. Freedom, but not cost-free. Where the UK did attempt to maximise trade opportunities, its efforts largely fell flat. British negotiators failed to convince the EU to reduce the frequency of border checks on food products imported from the UK (such as langoustines and lamb); failed to ensure that UK professional qualifications would be recognised across the EU; failed to include provisions allowing UK-based testing centres to continue certifying products for the EU market; and failed to win the argument in favour of allowing imported foreign parts (such as car components) from Japan and elsewhere to count towards the agreement’s rules-of-origin thresholds, which determine whether a product can be traded tariff-free or not. This is not to say the UK did not get anything it wanted. The EU did agree to make it easier for electric vehicles and batteries to qualify for tariff-free trade, for example. But the concessions are not as generous as the UK would have liked, and are only temporary. Neither is this trade deal the end of the story. It marks just the beginning of the UK’s new relationship with the EU, and will inevitably evolve over time. Next year, for example, the UK will need to decide whether to link its own domestic carbon-pricing scheme with the EU’s, find out whether the personal data of EU citizens can still be stored on UK servers, and re-enter discussions on the working of the sea border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There is also the outstanding question of financial services equivalence – a unilateral EU decision whether to allow certain UK-based financial businesses to continue selling directly to EU-based clients. Even if such permission is granted, we should not assume it will be permanent. The UK will also need to decide whether to use the new-found freedom to diverge from EU rules and approaches, and if so whether it is willing to accept the consequences of doing so. If it chooses to do so, years and years of disputes and reviews await. In the longer term, it is inevitable that every successive UK government will want to renegotiate, or alter, aspects of the relationship with the EU. This could involve promises to re-enter the Erasmus scheme or commitments to deeper regulatory reintegration in order to soften the border both between Great Britain and the EU, and Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We could also see a government elected on a mandate of tearing up the deal and starting again. But whatever the future holds, the difficult decisions will not go away – greater liberalisation of services trade, for example, would at the very least require the UK to accept freedom of movement. And negotiating with the union from the outside will remain an unpleasant experience: just ask the Swiss. The EU-UK relationship will slip down the news agenda, but it will not disappear entirely. Our proximity to each other, and the fact that the EU remains the UK’s most important economic partner, means negotiations over something or other will continue for decades to come.

2020-12-27T08:15:39Z,politics,Politics,What the European Union has meant to us,"Ed O’Brien Musician, Radiohead Being part of the EU means being part of a world reaching out, embracing other cultures and ideas. The little island mentality makes no sense when you look at our history. The Celts and the Anglo-Saxons are from Europe, the Normans from Norway via France. We’re part of Europe however much some of us pretend that we’re not. Growing up in Britain, I’d rarely met people from other places in Europe. When I started touring in 1993, freedom of movement enabled so many different connections for us. We took for granted all the cross-cultural pollination we experienced, all those cities we got to explore. We weren’t great when we started, and those experiences shaped us. Economic borders and boundaries get in the way of creativity, as well as live performance. The EU has been brilliant for the arts. The EU copyright directive brought in last year stuck up for artists against big tech companies [it now limits how copyrighted content is shared online]. That could have only happened with a big, powerful union – one country couldn’t have done that alone. I worry about how quotas will affect the number of bands that can tour – young and upcoming musicians will be so badly affected. Lots of vinyl is produced in Europe too, and we still don’t know what the tariffs will be. There’s also a sense of respect for musicians across the EU that we just don’t have here. Even with Radiohead: we’re held up as artists across Europe, but you sense that the government still thinks of us as a bunch of people having a laugh bashing away at three chords. Musicians are trying to communicate something much bigger than that. The EU to me is about that expression, about a love of culture and togetherness, enjoying all our differences under one umbrella together.
John Palmer Former Guardian Europe editor (1974-1996) and founder/political director of the European Policy Centre The EU was so much of my working life. I first went to Brussels in 1974, when there were only nine member states – Britain, Ireland and Denmark had just joined. Early on, I remember endless overnight summits about herring quotas, and the news desk rather dutifully taking my copy, but the pace of events sped up with the decades because of enlargement and the succession of treaties. In 10 years, the press centre went from a few hundred people to many thousands. I remember three Mexican TV channels with their own correspondent. That’s just one measure of the rapid expansion of this particular political universe. To me, the EU meant travel: I’ve been to all 27 member states, as meetings used to rotate around the different countries. The union showed how ideas from smaller countries could affect things, such as Sweden’s openness with its law, and Ireland’s political situation. More of an anti-European populist current came after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Daily Telegraph had taken a pretty sober approach to the EU until it sent its new blond-haired correspondent – he’d recently lost his job on the Times for making up stories. He asked me about the European commission president, Jacques Delors, and about British and French plans to coordinate European defence policy, a story I’d done. The next day, the Telegraph ran a big splash under the headline: “Delors to run Europe’s army”. Boris Johnson knew what he was doing, of course. He was operating on the fringes of populist reporting and fantasy. And here we are. If you’d told me back in 1974 that in my dotage I’d be seeing us leave the EU, I’d have said that was impossible. Mad. I wouldn’t have thought the EU would have been so developed, nor that Britain would wash its hands of the EU. The EU is such a major sphere for Britain’s influence. Retreating from it will lead to a spiral of decline. This will get worse if the shock of Brexit starts to see Scotland and Wales break away, and cause Ireland to reunify, all of which could happen. Britain was always such an important telephone exchange between the US and Europe, too. Now they’re going to ring straight through.
Giorgio Locatelli Chef The EU completely changed how British people eat, which means a lot to me. I came to London on an EU green card in 1995, and after certification arrived [from the European Food Safety Agency, founded in 2002 to guarantee food safety and quality], the quality of speciality food coming in from across Europe went up and up, as did quantity and choice. Restaurants could suddenly bring in a fantastic new small producer of, say, salumi, who could sort out their own certification and then get their product to the UK smoothly. That knowledge then trickles down to the supermarkets and the consumers themselves. Driving up quality educates us all. The movement of ingredients is very important to restaurants such as ours, but we still don’t know what the tariffs will be. We must remember the UK imports 30% of its food from the EU, and 85% of that food will face tariffs. That’s why Brexit will be a killer for everybody working within the food industry, for the supermarkets, for the supply chain and the farming community. I was in my 20s when the Berlin Wall came down and Europe started opening up. Now I worry about my English wife being stuck in the passport queue while I sail through with my European one, and that’s crazy to me. The UK thinking about leaving Erasmus [the EU student exchange programme] is also something I can’t understand. Get young people from Europe to come here! They’ll go home and talk about the respect they’ve gained for Britain, respect that will become embedded in the very idea of our country, which will grow. That respect is why Britain has always been seen as a great leader of European culture, music and everything else. To dismantle all that seems ridiculous to me.
Sarah Chapman and Ron Peeters Professional viola player; sound engineer I’m from Cheshire and my boyfriend is from a small town just south of Utrecht in the Netherlands. We got together two years ago, working for the Heritage Orchestra, which is run from the UK, but tours round Europe. The EU allowed us to work together, and to be together, back and forth. Right from the start of our relationship, Brexit was on our minds. I was hanging on to the hope that it wouldn’t happen, that there’d be one disaster after another, and everyone would come to their senses. I had rose-tinted glasses on until six months ago. It has been awful. My boyfriend still doesn’t know if he’s going to be able to work in Britain. His friends say we’re the laughing stock of Europe. They share memes of Boris Johnson on his chair on the edge of a cliff in a jokey way, but it’s way more serious than that. This summer, I applied for Dutch residency, as it felt like it was the only option I had. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. It feels like there is no respect for creative people, or for anyone wanting to have a bigger view of the world, in the considerations about leaving Europe. Who wants to be stuck on a little island floating off by itself into the North Sea? I keep thinking about the EU Youth Orchestra, which I played with, and how much I loved the feeling of being included in a European community at a young age. It used to be run from the UK. It has now moved to Italy. That’s all gone, and now I’m going too.
Sunny Singh Professor of creative writing and inclusion in the arts, London Metropolitan University I’m a migrant to the EU from India. My PhD is from Spain, and I’ve lived, studied and taught all across the EU, having access to so many libraries, classes and intellectuals. The idea of choosing to actively shut yourself off from 27 countries and all the resources – not just money – is mind-boggling. There is lots about the EU that I don’t agree with, don’t get me wrong. The euro shouldn’t have been introduced and expanded in the way it was. It may have served a political purpose, but it also doomed some economies, such as Greece, into a trap they couldn’t get out of. The EU turning into Fortress Europe by outsourcing human rights violations, especially in regards to the refugee issue, is shameful. So is the way it expanded eastwards to include countries that did not meet democratic and human rights thresholds, like Poland. Many EU countries bought into the aspirational logic that if you let people into your club they’ll be nudged towards democratic norms, which I didn’t agree with then, and don’t now. Ultimately, genocidal, fratricidal war on this continent led to the founding of the EU. Let’s not forget that. But let’s not forget the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Court of Justice, major protections for everyone in the EU. Do they work perfectly? Of course not. But certain principles hold firm. The EU also offered many opportunities for British students in redbrick and new universities, especially the working classes. Those doors have been slammed shut for them. Then there’s the impact of the loss of EU funding, and entire towns around Britain that rely on these universities and student income. EU students aren’t coming here in numbers any more. But why would anybody choose to come to study in a country so culturally and intellectually impoverished, that chose to make itself so? I find it appalling that in a world that’s inextricably connected – as Covid and the vaccine have shown – we’re prancing off into a self-isolation hellhole. Any kind of cultural, creative intellectual wealth requires open doors, open minds. It requires interaction with the world."
2020-12-27T08:13:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: fishing chiefs cry ‘betrayal’ as MPs fear rush to ratify deal,"Senior Conservative MPs late on Saturday expressed alarm at plans to rush the historic UK-EU trade deal through parliament in just one day, as fishermen’s leaders accused Boris Johnson of “caving in” at the 11th hour to clinch agreement on Christmas Eve. And there were growing fears among senior Tories, who will spend the next three days poring over the 2,000-page agreement published on Saturday, that details in the fine print could still allow the EU to impose punitive tariffs on British exports if businesses fail to follow European rules. While the deal unveiled by the prime minister and European commission president Ursula von der Leyen looks certain to pass through the Westminster parliament, largely because Labour will back it, pro-Brexit MPs remain determined not to fall into the trap of endorsing the full agreement before having subjected every clause to full scrutiny. Downing Street’s chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, said the agreement would allow “national renewal” and permit the UK to “set its own laws again”. But as he did so, British fishermen increasingly vented their anger, saying promises made by Leavers that they would regain control of all UK fishing waters by voting for Brexit had been broken. Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, claimed his industry had been betrayed in order to win a wider deal. “In the endgame, the prime minister made the call and caved in on fish, despite the rhetoric and assurances that he would not do what Ted Heath did in 1973.” UK Fisheries chief executive Jane Sandell was less outspoken but agreed that pledges made had not been honoured: “We’re pleased that the UK-EU deal will bring some kind of certainty to parts of our industry, although we’re still looking for the ‘prodigious amounts of fish’ we were promised, and for us it changes nothing.” MPs will have just one day to debate and vote on the deal that will effectively seal Brexit and create a future framework for the relationship between London and Brussels, on Wednesday. The UK left the EU on 31 January this year, triggering an 11-month transition period in which to implement the decision. This will end on New Year’s Eve, making it the moment the country leaves the single market and customs union. The Tory MP and former Brexit secretary David Davis told the Observer he wanted reassurances that the deal would not allow the EU to impose a wide range of tariffs on UK goods if there were future disagreements over fishing rights. Davis also said more time should be taken to scrutinise and debate such a hugely important issue and historic change in the UK’s international relations. “Whatever you think of this treaty it is going to affect the rest of our lives. It is a treaty that is going to bring to an end an argument that has dominated the first half of our lives, and the outcome is going to be for the rest of our lives, and it does require more than just a rubber stamp,” he said. Davis added that one day’s debate was “too fast”.
“I am perfectly happy to give my in-principle agreement in one day if I reach that view but [only] in-principle agreement … because the European parliament will take days to look at this, having had longer to read it, and all the European parliaments will take longer,” said Davis. Another senior member of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers said: “There are concerns among colleagues. We need time to look at this very carefully to be sure it passes the sovereignty tests.” Peter Bone, the veteran MP for Wellingborough, said he understood that time was very limited but likened the issue to budgets, which often seem to please everyone when first unveiled – but then turn out to be riddled with problems and loopholes. “It is exactly like a budget. Most of us think this looks good, but let’s just have time to check back and establish that it is what it appears to be.” On Saturday, legal experts from a so-called star chamber of judges and lawyers appointed by the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group were beginning to comb through the fine print. Asked when the white smoke of approval might emerge, another senior MP said it was premature to think Eurosceptics would give the deal unqualified backing: “It might not be white smoke. It might be black smoke.” Although the prime minister can be confident that legislation to implement the deal will reach the statute book, he is desperate to minimise any Conservative party rebellion or discontent, and would like draw a line, finally, over internal arguments that did so much to destroy the premierships of three of his predecessors – Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. While fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy, it has been one of the most politically sensitive issues and was used by the Leave campaign in 2016 as one key area where Brexit would allow the government to “take back control”. In the Christmas Eve deal the UK government and Brussels agreed that 25% of EU boats’ fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to this country’s fishing fleet over a period of five-and-a-half years. The UK had originally demanded that the EU’s rights be cut by 80%. The UK did, however, reduce the number of years over which the change will be introduced to well under half of what the EU originally demanded. After this period, the two sides will negotiate over future fishing rights, with the deal allowing for either to impose tariffs on the other’s exports of fish in the event of serious disagreements. Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, described this kind of arrangement in a trade deal as “unusual”. MPs are also concerned about the potential of the EU to impose tariffs on other types of exports, including cars, if UK-based manufacturers do not comply with Brussels’ rules on the origins of components used in production. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on Saturday complained that promises made to her country’s fishing sector had been broken, insisting this was “yet another example of Tory governments forcing Scotland in the wrong direction”. She added that an independent Scotland could be a “bridge-builder between the UK and the EU”."
2020-12-27T07:15:38Z,politics,Politics,Top Tory MP warns against international aid budget cut,"The government’s decision to cut the UK’s budget for international aid will deprive half a million girls in poorer nations of funding for their education and damage the global fight against diseases including Covid-19, says a senior Tory MP.
Writing in the Observer, the former Conservative minister Caroline Nokes, who chairs the House of Commons select committee on women and equalities, says the move would be a “massive blow” to those dealt the worse hands in life and amount to “the wrong policy at the worst possible time”. Her strongly worded intervention comes as other Tory MPs opposed to the action – which breaches a commitment in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto – seem increasingly confident of defeating legislation to impose the cut, expected to be introduced in the House of Commons early in the new year. With all opposition parties expected to vote against, and around 40 Tories already having expressed disquiet, the government now faces an uphill struggle to force the plan on to the statute book.
Speaking in the Commons last month, the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said that sticking to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid was “difficult to justify to the British people” at a time when the pandemic was piling so much pressure on domestic spending. Sunak said aid spending in 2020-21 would be cut to 0.5%, around £10bn, although he hoped the 0.7% target could be restored when the UK’s finances allowed it. In a sign of an increasingly rebellious mood on the Tory backbenches, Nokes says she and her committee are “not afraid to take the prime minister to task when his policies fall short in providing for the marginalised and under-represented”. Imposing the cut at a time when the pandemic is threatening the poorest communities is not acceptable, she says. “With news of a new variant of Covid-19 sweeping through South Africa, this looks increasingly like the wrong policy at the worst possible time. The truth is that we can’t beat Covid anywhere unless we beat it everywhere.” Among other senior Tories who have already expressed unhappiness at the proposed cut are former international aid secretary Andrew Mitchell, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Nokes says the Tories’ “good track record” on supporting girls’ education through aid programmes is in danger. “Reducing our aid budget by a third will mean supporting around half a million fewer girls through education a year. “Coming a year after the budget has already significantly shrunk due to the impact of the pandemic on our economy, this means that the UK can no longer put its money where its mouth is in ensuring that girls get the same opportunities as boys, and it’s fair to assume that the manifesto promise on girls’ education will go the same way as the one on 0.7%.” Mitchell said recently that he would not like to be the minister having to defend the plan in the House of Commons. “It would be an extraordinary decision at the very point at which Britain is about to take over the chairmanship of the G7, with a new administration in the White House which will strongly champion the international system. It will diminish us on the world stage,” he said. Cross-party groups of peers in the House of Lords are also expected to mount stiff opposition to the plan."
2020-12-27T06:15:36Z,politics,Politics,The Brexit deal is done – but many crucial issues are unresolved,"Downing Street’s chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, exhausted from months of intense talks, could not hide his glee on Saturday as he hailed the Brexit deal struck between the EU and Brussels as “one of the biggest and broadest agreements ever”. Its effect, he said, would be to allow the UK to “set its own laws again”. “There’s no more role for the European court of justice, there’s no direct effects of EU law, there’s no alignment of any kind, and we’re out of the single market and out of the customs union, just as the manifesto said we would be,” he declared. “This should be the beginning of a moment of national renewal for us. All choices are in our hands as a country and it’s now up to us to decide how we use them and how we go forward in the future.” Frost was right to emphasise the importance of reaching some form of agreement. By avoiding no-deal, the two sides have ensured that trade between the UK and EU will not be subject, routinely, to tariffs or quotas, as would otherwise have been the case. The resulting higher costs to business and consumers on both sides have been avoided, though Brexit will of itself lead to more bureaucracy, form-filling and checks on goods traded, and therefore delays.
But no one should believe that this marks the end of wrangling between the EU and UK. It does not represent finality. It was, as the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Christmas Eve, a “thin deal” that leaves much not settled, struck to avoid catastrophe by kicking much down the road. The UK under the government of Boris Johnson pursued Brexit – he always claimed – to take back control of our laws, borders and money. But even after we have left, his government still wants to benefit from European programmes, including those affecting our security, our financial services sector and our data, and to enjoy the benefits of the European single market wherever it can. Johnson wants UK professionals to be able to work freely in other EU countries, but this deal achieved nothing for them. Those arguments are to come; the tussles will go on. Toby Helm Security Mark Townsend Priti Patel wasted little time in claiming the deal made the UK safer. Her assessment left most security analysts wondering what the home secretary knew that they didn’t. Few have avoided the conclusion that, in the short term at least, the deal leaves Britain less secure. Not only are key lines of cooperation severed, but UK policing has forfeited some of its most valued tools. Chief among these is the Schengen Information System (SIS), a vast database providing real-time alerts to locate terrorists and serious criminals. On an average day, British police access the SIS more than 1.65 million times. With no obvious sign of a substitute system, urgent negotiations are needed to agree a scheme that can fill this huge intelligence void. Similarly, losing a seat at the EU’s policing agency, Europol, where the UK was a forceful presence, creates potential complexities with fast-moving cross-border criminal and terrorism investigations. New agreements might be required with each EU member state to restore previous relationships – again, holding out the promise of more long-winded negotiations. Extra talks will also be needed to replace the work of Eurojust, the agency responsible for judicial cooperation in criminal cases across member states. Downing Street claims Britain had got more than it had envisaged on security and policing matters – and it is true there are some noteworthy victories, including a fast-track extradition system to replace the European arrest warrant and the continuing exchange DNA and fingerprint data. But it is also true that much still needs to be negotiated – and won. In the meantime, Britain’s law enforcement apparatus is diminished. Data sharing Jamie Doward Ensuring the smooth flow of data between the EU and the UK is crucial to the future prosperity of both. The Institute for Government notes that “volumes of data entering and leaving the UK increased 28 times between 2005 and 2015, and three-quarters of these data transfers are with EU countries. Any restriction placed on data flows would act as a barrier to trade, putting UK businesses at a competitive disadvantage.” According to the summary issued by the UK government, “the agreement confirms strong data protection commitments by both the UK and the EU, protecting consumers and helping to promote trust in the digital economy.” However, much has yet to be resolved. Experts say we should expect to hear a lot more about an “adequacy decision” that will relate to data transfers between the UK and the EU. Data adequacy is a status granted by the European commission to countries outside the European Economic Area. When a country has been awarded this status, information can pass freely between it and the EEA without further safeguards being required. This will not be sorted out quickly. The quickest data adequacy agreement between the EU and another country – Argentina – took 18 months to finalise. So, there will be an interim solution under which the UK will suspend its own data protection rules. This solution will run for a maximum of six months, according to EU sources. For this reason there is pressure to achieve an adequacy agreement before the interim solution expires. Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, the director general of Digitaleurope, a trade body representing more than 35,000 businesses in Europe, said: “The EU has yet to reach an adequacy decision regarding the UK – there is an urgent need to make progress here so that data can continue to flow between our economies and our businesses. Our recent study showed that 6 out of 10 European companies transfer data between the EU and UK.”
Services sector Phillip Inman The government must return to the negotiating table to secure access for services companies excluded from the “thin” Brexit deal, business leaders have urged. Professional services firms and City banks, insurance companies and accountancy firms are among thousands of businesses that face restrictions on EU trade from 1 January unless ministers can expand arrangements in a further round of talks in the new year. The services sector accounts for 80% of the UK economy and was largely left out of the Brexit deal, which centres on eliminating tariffs and quotas on goods shipped between the UK and EU. But while the UK had an overall trade deficit of -£79bn with the EU in 2019, it had a surplus of £18bn from the trade in services. TheCityUK, the lobby group for the financial services industry, said that while banks had an agreement covering basic transactions, there were up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities in the financial services industry that needed to be renegotiated. “We have known for some time that the services sector was going to be left out of the initial deal. The hope is that now some of the political heat has gone from the discussions, we can tackle other important issues,” he said. EU leaders, fearing that the UK will seek to undermine regulations in the single market and customs union, have also blocked agreement on data rules that allow firms to keep information on their customers. Brussels has indicated that, on many issues affecting services companies, it wants to wait until later in 2021 to see if the UK diverges with existing EU regulations before striking further deals. While the EU agreed to allow business executives to move from the UK to EU countries to manage their continental operations, it remains unclear whether UK professionals will be able to do the same after professional qualifications were excluded. Michael Izza, chief executive of the accountants’ professional body, the ICAEW, said an agreement covering legal services was welcome, but should be extended to other professions, including accountants, surveyors and architects.
Professional qualifications Jamie Doward From accountants to ski instructors, before Brexit the British qualifications of UK citizens who work abroad in EU countries were recognised across all member states. Now, though, things will change and it will become harder for UK citizens seeking to work in the EU to prove that their qualifications are the equivalent of those recognised elsewhere in Europe. This is a setback for the UK. Proposed drafts from the British side clearly show it wanted mutual recognition of qualifications. “The UK had originally asked that the EU would agree that UK qualifications would be automatically recognised, perhaps subject to a further test if necessary,” said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. “Instead, what we have is a framework that allows for qualification bodies in the EU and the UK to put forward a proposal for mutual recognition to exist in the future.” This is similar to what the EU has permitted under other trade agreements. But Lowe is not convinced of its merits. “It relies on fairly protectionist – often private – bodies deciding to recognise each others’ ability to grant qualifications in a specific field.” However, the UK did agree an important caveat. In the absence of an EU-wide agreement, Brussels will allow UK bodies to pursue other ways of agreeing the mutual recognition of qualifications on a bilateral basis. So, a UK-based qualification body working with its counterpart qualification body in an individual member state – say Ireland or Germany – may be able to negotiate its own agreement. But there is no guarantee of success. These talks could be complex, protracted, and only achievable on a country-by-country basis."
2020-12-27T06:05:36Z,politics,Politics,Splendid isolation … or just a bit-part player? Europe reacts to British ‘victory’,"Questions about how the full details of the Brexit deal would be received, and warnings of the negotiations that will continue after its implementation, tempered widespread relief in Europe that a last-ditch agreement had been reached. Many commentators also wondered how Britain would negotiate the reality of life outside the European Union after years of unsettled argument even within the pro-Brexit camp about the country’s strategic direction. Le Monde said the country was now facing a dilemma from over half a century ago. “The United Kingdom finds itself once again facing a question that was never resolved after 1945: its place in the world,” wrote Philippe Bernard. “Its like Back to the Future, from the 1950s. “While Germany and France launched themselves into building Europe, the British refused to join this project, too limited for their ambitions and initiated by two countries they considered, unlike themselves, losers of the war.” On the day after Christmas, officials in Brussels and the capitals of the EU states began scrutinising more than 1,000 pages that made up the deal, as did people whose livelihood may be on the line. “The only certainty today is that we need to find, during the transition period, more deals within the deal,” said Frédéric Cuvillier, mayor of the northern French city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, which has a large fishing industry. The agreement left much obscured, he warned. “Relief for our fishermen, but what will be the impact on stocks? Who, for example, will be handling the controls? And over what time?” he told Europe 1 radio. Despite challenges from him and others unhappy with the agreement, it is widely expected that the deal will be “provisionally applied” at the end of the year by the EU in order to avoid a no-deal outcome, with MEPs voting later in January. The House of Commons will be recalled and hold a vote on the new treaty on 30 December. But Britain and Europe should expect years of continued wrangling over trade, warned Björn Finke in Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. “Those who think the Brexit drama comes to an end with this deal will be bitterly disappointed,” he wrote. “In the coming years and decades, there will be plenty of reasons to call on the arbitration bodies envisioned in the deal, likely under the threat of tariffs. The drama will carry on. Sadly.” The triumphalism that marked Boris Johnson’s presentation of the deal at home was largely absent in Europe, perhaps because many there felt that Britain had not emerged with the clear victory its leader claimed. That may be one of the few opinions they share with hardline Brexiters in Britain, who are now poring over the deal to decide if they will back it.
French Europe minister Clément Beaune said it was a “good agreement” and stressed that the EU had not accepted a deal “at all costs”. Irish PM Micheál Martin welcomed it as representing the “least bad version of Brexit possible”. Unbound by diplomatic niceties, France’s Libération newspaper was more blunt, describing the agreement as offering only “a facade of commercial freedom for the UK”, while committing London to maintaining standards on the environment, workers’ rights and climate change. From Spain to Germany, there was praise for the role European unity played in achieving what Süddeutsche Zeitung also considered a “relatively advantageous deal”. “It averts tariffs for the goods trade, which is especially important for the EU since its states export a lot more to Great Britain than they import. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has a trade surplus in services. But here the deal barely lessens the complications that come with an end of EU membership.” For Spain’s El País, there was a particular historic significance in how Germany and France shrugged off last-minute attempts by Britain to fracture their solidarity, including refusing Johnson’s request for individual phone calls with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel at a critical point in negotiations. “Bells are tolling for the ‘divide and conquer’ tactics London used for centuries to block the emergence of a dominant European power,” the paper said. Der Spiegel’s Markus Becker suggested that the realities of Brexit would deal a heavy blow to the British exceptionalism that helped drive the departure from the EU. “Many politicians and citizens in Great Britain do not perceive themselves to be Europeans among many other Europeans,” he said. “And Great Britain does not think of itself as one European country among many, but a very special or even chosen one. “Of course, not all Brits think like that. But sadly they are not the ones currently in charge. That is why their country’s departure from the EU is not an unreasonable development. “The EU will be freer to take the steps it needs to take in order to assert itself against the USA and China – because it is running out of time to do so. Great Britain, on the other hand, might need Brexit to realise how small the bit part it will play on the world stage will really be.” Some on the continent expressed hope that, with Brexit complete, the ideological impetus for anti-European Union sentiment would dissipate, and a rebuilding of close ties could commence. José Ignacio Torreblanca, senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that Brexit marks not only Britain’s lowest ebb, but the “most damaging, and irreversible” outcome of the waves of populist sentiment that swept through many western democracies in 2016. Writing in El Mundo, he painted a picture of an out-of-touch Britain obsessed by past glories while the rest of the world got to grips with 5G and artificial intelligence: “While the US is shaking off Trump’s 2016 win, to restore their role, influence and image in the rest of the world, Britain is consumed by the eccentric plan of the conservative elite to return to exerting [global] influence from a position of splendid isolation.”"
2020-12-27T06:00:36Z,politics,Politics,We're out of the European Union. Just how did we get here?,"The metaphor of divorce has never felt wholly adequate to describe the complexity of ending 47 years of union with our 27 European neighbours but it has always captured the emotional brutality of the choice. How else, anyway, to imagine that morning this week when, after all these years of angst and haggling, the UK will finally hear the door slam on its long-time family home and find itself suddenly alone with all its baggage in the chill air outside, contemplating what’s next, while the locks are changed? For many, that moment will retain the liberating bravado of bedsit independence, an opportunity to refresh a midlife crisis Tinder profile. For more of us, though – even many of those, I’d guess, who had vaguely wanted out – there will be instead a powerful sense of “what have we done?” And a dawning knowledge that all we have helped to build in Europe since 1973 – for better and worse – will now carry on without us. The 1,650 days of the troubled transition will melt away – all the exhausting wrangling over visiting rights and the price of fish; the costly delays and the desperate triumphalism – and we will be left with the starkness of that decision made in June 2016: we’re out. Of all the false promises made in the Leave campaign, among the first to ring hollow will be the boast that, post-Brexit, Britain will not have to occupy its thoughts with the EU any more, and can concentrate exclusively on itself. Rather, from next week on, we will no doubt discover just how much the magic of frictionless trade and free movement has allowed us to take for granted the benefits of union with our closest neighbours. We will reacquaint ourselves with the fact that borders are made of wasted hours and red tape. “We’re going. No ifs or buts,” Johnson repeated, in one of several juvenile platitudes from the last election. Our self-imposed barriers have, however, instead ushered in an era of enormous if-or-but uncertainty for countless businesses and families. There are those who assume, because of this, that from day one “remainers” will immediately become “rejoiners”. I’m not sure that’s true. In the foreseeable future, it would be a brave politician who sought to reopen the tribal wounds of the past five years to argue for a return to the EU on terms inevitably inferior to those “best of all worlds” arrangements which Britain had won for itself by 2016. More likely, that 52-48 referendum choice will quickly harden into history. Within a decade, schoolchildren will be faced with a staple question on their A-level papers: “What were the reasons that led the UK to Brexit?”
And generations of kids will trot out a memorised list of accepted motivations, just as they have learned to recall the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and shifting alliances to explain the carnage of 1914-18. Those model Brexit answers will have to include the stubborn Euroscepticism that always characterised Britain’s relationship with the union as it inched toward federalism, just as they would note the immediate crises of the Greek financial bailout, and the migrant chaos brought on by the collapse of Syria, and examine how they coincided with long years of stagnant wages and austerity at home. The marking scheme might look, too, for reference to the geographical inequalities of Britain – the sense that the vote against Brussels was also for many a cathartic “up yours” to London and Westminster. And examiners could also give a tick to mention of the role played by tabloid media, owned by offshore plutocrats with a vested interest in deregulation and a reliably profitable line in raucous jingoism. The top grades might be reserved for those framing these arguments with introductory paragraphs on the rise of populism fuelled by the unchecked influence of Facebook and fake news – and perhaps the unique combination of a prime minister in David Cameron who was the opposite of a man of the people, and a throwback opposition leader in Jeremy Corbyn, seeking to hide doubts not only about the EU but also Nato, by not showing up.
The colour in those accounts will be provided by a few of the characters who whipped up latent fears of threatened sovereignty: Nigel Farage, bothering asylum seekers in his union jack loafers and Arthur Daley coat; Dominic Cummings, the self-styled “disruptor” who found new ways to use social media to stoke the oldest prejudices about “foreigners”; and diehards like Bill Cash MP, the emblematic old soldier of the struggle, who spent a political lifetime seeking to “avenge” the death of a brave father killed in the Normandy landings. As with the answers about the lead-up to the first world war, however, none of those factors will ever quite seem sufficient to explain the sudden fervour of Brexit, in which irrational events took on a momentum of their own. As Bertrand Russell once observed, one of the overlooked sentiments in 1914 was that war was welcomed by many simply “as an escape from boredom”. In similar terms, a neglected part of the answer to the question “why did Britain leave the EU?” might well be that on 23 June 2016, a few days after England had been held to a tedious goal-less draw in the European football championships by Slovakia, enough people decided to disregard the weight of evidence and vote leave because, well, something had to change. In that respect, they found their perfect leader in our current attention-deficit prime minister, who could never be arsed to do his homework as Brussels correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, so instead made up amusing caricatures about bendy bananas and condom regulations (as if history hadn’t taught the world often enough to beware Old Etonians with an unchecked sense of personal destiny and a mortal fear of appearing dull).
One way of breaking down the referendum result was between those who could recall life before the EU with curdled “you’ve never had it so good” nostalgia, and those who had been born into it and never found it anything less than agreeable; between a younger generation that generally values the idea of joining in and mixing, and one generally more comfortable in bristling at any change. I’m just about in that category who can remember the before – but only that immediate three-day week era in which common cause with Europe seemed the only way to save a desperately uncompetitive economy and maintain influence in the world – the bit that nostalgists conveniently forget. One of the social media memes that has proved most enduring in recent years is that clip of Tony Blair visiting the European parliament during the UK’s turn at presidency in 2005. In it, in response to a typical sneering harangue from Farage, Blair jabs a finger at the Ukip leader, saying: “You, sir, sit with our country’s flag, but you do not represent our country’s interests. This is the year 2005, it’s not 1945. We are not fighting each other any more, these are our partners and our colleagues and our future lies in Europe!” That contrast Blair expressed, between those who wanted to turn back the Bakelite clock and those who wanted to embrace the complexities of the future, looked inescapable – particularly to anyone who had lived through the expansion of the European Union to the east with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The determination of some of those who refused to see the EU as one guarantor of such freedoms proved far more durable than Blair could have imagined, however. I’ve reported on many of the marches and demonstrations for and against Brexit in the past five years. One of the stranger anomalies of those events is that any pick-a-fight anger has been concentrated not among those who had lost the referendum vote, but those who had won. One of the abiding failures of the Leave campaign, it seemed to me, has been its inability to articulate any vision of the future of Britain that does not involve embittered aggression.
At the moment the Brexit transition agreement came into force in Parliament Square on 31 January, the only shouts among the assembled crowd to be heard were “Fuck the EU!” It comes as no surprise that the policies that most excite the most ardent supporters of “global Britain” are the withdrawal of foreign aid and the deployment of the gunships of the Royal Navy against desperate migrants in rubber dinghies. Meanwhile, one of the pointed ironies of the long farewell of Brexit has been that nothing has become the EU quite like Britain’s leaving it. Having tried hard for 70 years to find a single theme that unites the disparate nations of the continent, the EU has finally discovered common cause in the spectacle of serial foot-shooting that has marked Britain’s efforts to depart. As delay led to extension and to prorogation, the approval ratings for the EU never soared so high. Guy Verhofstadt, the Brexiters’ pantomime villain in Brussels, told me last year that Britain has come to represent to Europeans the consequences of not standing up to divisive populism. “You want to see what nationalism does? Come to London.” The sadness of that observation is a reminder of Britain’s failure to bring to Europe the values with which we were once more clearly associated: democracy, scrutiny, a robust sense of fair play. Rather than successive governments insisting on a semi-detached “we know best” approach to Europe, for fear of riling the tabloid press, there would have been more courage in wholeheartedly engaging to reform its institutions. Britain, in retrospect, perhaps always flirted with crashing out because it misunderstood Europe from the start. The best articulation of that misunderstanding that I’ve heard came from Neil MacGregor, embodiment of a tradition of British soft power and cultural diplomacy that is vanishingly absent from the tone of the current government. MacGregor, inspirational director of the British Museum for many years, left the UK in 2015 to chair the board that would create its German equivalent, the Humboldt Forum in Berlin. As effective curator-in-chief of the cultural memory of both countries MacGregor – born in 1946 with the continent in ruins – explained how he had come to understand that the British and Germans mean completely different things when they used that charged word “sovereignty”.
Partly because of the ways it has confronted its own deeply traumatic experience of nationalism, in Germany, MacGregor suggested, sovereignty is always taken to mean the capacity for effective coalition. The European debate in Britain looked so bizarre from Berlin for precisely this reason, he suggested. “German people see the whole purpose of a political leader is to make successful alliances. The proper use of sovereignty is all about pooling it to achieve your aims. The British idea that you should entirely do these things on your own and try to assume total control over your environment is unthinkable.” Among those who argued for the benefits of remaining in the EU, there will, in the coming weeks and months, be a temptation to sit back with a double shot of schadenfreude and watch the fantasy of “taking back control” meet with the real world. There is little to be gained in that “I told you so” sentiment. The English nationalism that emerged in the referendum now occupies several seats round the cabinet table. The required enemy without is already being recast as the enemy within. The failures and problems that could once be blamed on bureaucrats in the EU curtailing our freedom to do as we like, will no doubt now be blamed on those covert “rejoiners” at the BBC who report that everything in Brexitland is not as forecast; or on the imaginary “deep state” of the civil service casting shadows of reality on sunlit uplands; or on Ahmed and his family who have just moved in up the road. (Even as I write this, a video of flat-capped Nigel Farage pops up on my timeline, on a tour of green belt sites in the home counties, spreading the idea that they are due to be converted into refugee camps.) As the debt burden of Covid bites and the £350m-a-week promises made in 2016 vanish into air, the debate over what kind of country we want to become will never have been more urgent.
Among the stories that remainers will be trolled for mentioning in the coming weeks are those polls that suggest a significant proportion of people have changed their mind since the Brexit vote, and that demographics have also shifted. The strong likelihood, after all the political trauma, is that we are leaving the EU, on terms no one imagined, with a majority of the population much preferring to stay in. In that regard it will be worth holding on to the fact that the saving grace of black irony has always been a vital component of life in this country. In all the hours and weeks and months that I have listened to the entrenched arguments around Brexit, my favourite answer to the question of how we got here came from that caller, named Mark, who contacted Farage’s LBC phone-in show last year, to thank him for everything he had done for Britain. “I used to be an ardent remainer,” Mark said. “I believed in the European project and that staying in the union was the best thing for us, and then something monumental happened and I completely changed my opinion on all of it.” “And what,” Farage asked, “was that monumental thing that happened, Mark?” “I was kicked in the head by a horse.”"

But the treacherous British elites have sniffed the international lifestyle of Rome, and are soon going there to hand over a small percentage of tribal GDP as offerings at the Capitol. By 43, they understand modern financial vehicles known as coins and are worth annexing by Emperor Claudius’s European superstate. Boadicea (despite probably not existing) tries to take back control, but the wheels come off her chariot, and for the next 350 years the Britons are ruled by a snappily toga-ed continental elite and their collaborators. 409-443 Brexit #1 The legions exit Britannia, to fight one another where it matters. Tired of taxation without defence, the Britons cry freedom and go it alone. But they are unable to obtain mutually acceptable bilateral trade deals with the Picts and Scots, who insist on their right to attack in coracles. So the Britons beg the Romans to let them back in. The Romans are too busy trying to hold the newly acceded Hungarians to European norms of behaviour, so the desperate Britons turn to some obscure Germans called the English, who record the approach thus: AD443 This year sent the Brit-Welsh to Rome & them assistance bade against the Picts, but they gave them none, for that they fought with Attila, King of the Huns, & then sent they to the English. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle The English agree to do the fighting in return for residency rights in the south-east. But they soon call over their dependants, swamp the Britons, and impose their own culture. 793-1042 Scandinavian Efta By 790, the new England is closely aligned with Charlemagne’s Europe. Then freedom-loving Scandinavians swamp the north and east, and ultimately enable Cnut to make England part of his Danish empire. Three Danish kings are followed by Edward the Confessor (half-Norman) and Harold Godwinson (a half-Danish Wessex warlord, hated by everybody north of the Thames). It’s hard to work out what English sovereignty means.
1066 Reunion with Europe William the Conqueror creates a new single market with northern France. Being English now means tending pigs, sheep and cows so that the French-speaking elite can feast on pork, mutton and beef. For the next 900 years, any monoglot Englishman is not quite comme il faut. And if you don’t understand that, well, it just goes to show. 1533 Brexit #2 Henry VIII wants a divorce, really, really badly; a would-be new elite wants to disrupt the Catholic church. They use cutting-edge German social-media technology – printing – to invent fake news: if England breaks with Rome, there will be a financial dividend for everyone, and a boost for the Tudor NHS. ‘Then shall these great yerely exaccions cease … Then shall we have ynough and more then shall suffice us, whiche shall be the best hospitall that ever was founded for us.’ Supplycacion for the Beggars (1528/9) 1689 Back into Europe Brexit #2 plunges the British Isles into ferocious wars. At last, the desperate English invite the Dutch to invade and sort things out. So England gets a Dutch king who can barely speak English, then ceases to exist in 1707 when a new thing called Great Britain gets a German king who can barely speak English. But that’s fine because both kings, like the entire English elite, can speak French. 1815 Brexit #3 At Waterloo, the new United Kingdom fields 28,000 men, more than half of them Irish or Scottish, and beats Napoleon thanks to another 90,000 European soldiers. But being European is hard work, so we get out. Our exit strategy is brilliant: hand the wealthy industrial Rhineland to militarist Prussia – thus dooming the Danes, Poles, Austrians, French and pretty much everyone for the next 130 years.

When it’s too late to stop the deluge, we at last plump for France and the ghastly dictatorship that is tsarist Russia. 1914-75 Two world wars and one sane act Having won at appalling cost, we again pretend to be non-Europeans, until we have to join France and the ghastly dictatorship that is Stalinist Russia to do it all again 20 years later. But we can’t tell the difference between “we held out bravely until the bigger players turned the game around” (true) and “we won the second world war” (false), even though the Americans now clearly run the world and we clearly no longer have an empire. Boldly facing down this national delusion, Edward Heath, backed by Margaret Thatcher, just beats Labour and the Powellites (’fraid so) and gets us into Europe again. In 1975, we agree by a very large majority to stay there. 2021 Ourselves, alone Thatcher is kicked out by her own party for turning into an American libertarian.

2020-12-26T10:46:47Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson urges Tory MPs to back Brexit deal as full text published,"The EU and the UK government have published the full text of the Brexit trade deal less than a week before it is due to be implemented, as Boris Johnson urged his backbenchers to support the agreement when it reaches parliament next week. The deal, which comes to more than 1,250 pages, will be voted on in the House of Commons on Wednesday, a day before the Brexit transition period ends. The prime minister urged Conservative Eurosceptics to back the deal, saying it made good “on every one of our manifesto commitments”, and he implored them to remember “what the public want us to do”. With Labour’s backing, the deal is likely to be passed, but Johnson is keen to win over the European Research Group, a parliamentary pressure group of hardline Conservative MPs who want a clean break from Europe. The group has said it will reconvene what it describes as its “star chamber”, a panel of lawyers who scrutinised Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement in 2019, to examine the trade deal before deciding whether to back it. The chairman of the “star chamber” said its examination of the deal was under way. Sir Bill Cash said he was in “constant communication” with the rest of the group, having received the full text of the treaty by courier from No 10 on Boxing Day. In a WhatsApp message sent to Tory MPs, Johnson said he was confident the deal would withstand “ruthless” legal scrutiny from the “star chamber legal eagles” . On Saturday the Conservative former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told BBC Breakfast: “I very much hope this treaty stands up to scrutiny and I hope to be able to support it. But I was elected on a manifesto which promised to get Brexit done, so I need to read [the document] before I can work out whether this actually enables us to do that or whether it traps us in the regulatory orbit of the European Union.” The EU’s 27 member states have indicated they will formally back the deal within days. EU ambassadors were briefed on its contents by Michel Barnier, who led Brussels’ negotiating team in the talks with the UK. After a highly unusual meeting on Christmas Day – with at least one diplomat wearing a Santa hat and another a festive jumper – they agreed to write to the European parliament to say they intended to take a decision on the provisional application of the deal. Downing Street’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, hailed the “beginning a moment of national renewal” and said the deal ensures the UK “sets its own laws again”. “The way we’ve achieved that is there’s no more role for the European court of justice, there’s no direct effects of EU law, there’s no alignment of any kind, and we’re out of the single market and out of the customs union just as the manifesto said we would be,” he said. “This should be the beginning of a moment of national renewal for us. All choices are in our hands as a country and it’s now up to us to decide how we use them and how we go forward in the future.” According to the BBC, the deal goes beyond the bloc’s so-called “Canada-style” trade accord. The document, which includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes, reportedly includes a late compromise on electric cars. The EU had sought to offer tariff-free access only to those British vehicles that are made mostly with European parts. This measure will now be phased in over six years but is less generous than the UK requested. There is also a commitment not to lower standards on the environment, workers’ rights and climate change, with mechanisms to enforce this. There is a mutual right to “rebalance” the agreement if there are “significant divergences” in future that are capable of “impacting trade”. The dispensations go beyond standard free-trade agreements such as those between the EU and Canada or Japan, reflecting the UK’s history in the single market, which was established in 1993. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, suggested the agreement would provide a fresh start for the UK and the EU, enabling them to build a “special relationship … between sovereign equals”. Writing in the Times, Gove said he hoped it would spell an end to the “rancorous and, at times, ugly politics” seen since the EU referendum. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is facing the prospect of a revolt within his party after instructing MPs to vote in favour of the deal. Sources confirmed to the Guardian that several frontbenchers were likely to resign over the vote.
Many Labour MPs had urged Starmer to recommend abstaining in the vote, warning that he would be unable to criticise the government for the economic consequences of the deal if Labour supported it. But Starmer said “leadership is about taking the tough decisions in the national interest” and being a “serious, responsible opposition.” He said: “At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, suggested on Saturday morning that his party was likely to vote against the deal. “If the details turn out to be what we’re hearing, we cannot support it,” he said. “This will be so bad for British business, so bad for families to mean they’re less safe. How can a responsible party support such a bad deal?” Davey also expressed concerns that the deal would make it more difficult for law enforcement bodies to share information. “British families will be less safe as a result of this deal. The criminals will be cheering as a result of this deal. That’s not acceptable.”"
2020-12-26T06:00:08Z,politics,Politics,"Heroes, villains and top TV: John Crace dishes out his awards for 2020","Heroes In such an unremittingly grim year, one of its most uplifting features has been the sheer number of people who have gone out of their way to make life more bearable and as normal as possible. From the NHS, care home and mental health workers to the delivery drivers, shop staff and waste collectors. My family, friends and colleagues have all done more than their fair share of keeping me more or less sane. But there have been a few people who have stood out, and in most years the award would have gone to Capt Tom Moore, who set out to raise £1,000 by walking around his garden in the weeks leading up his 100th birthday. He ended up raising nearly £33m and was rewarded with a knighthood.
Yet the clear winners have to be the German husband and wife team of Dr Uğur Şahin and Dr Özlem Türeci, who founded the pharmaceutical company BioNTech that developed the first coronavirus vaccine to be approved. It’s quite something to know your work could save the lives of millions of people. Best TV drama series Having spent most evenings watching television for the last 10 months, I feel better qualified than usual to make this award, though there have been some tough choices to make. I was late to the Succession and Ozark parties, so had a lot of catching up to do as they entered their second and third series respectively. I also loved The Queen’s Gambit, and The Undoing was all set to be in my top five up until the last episode. I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to finish the series, but the reasons will probably be fairly obvious to anyone who has. But my runaway favourite was the fifth and penultimate series of Better Call Saul, the prequel to Breaking Bad, featuring Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman. I’ve been watching the series right from the off and the way it has slowly built up the tension as events get closer to the start of Breaking Bad has been a masterpiece of storytelling. I’m also desperate to know what happens to Kim Wexler as she doesn’t feature in the first series of Breaking Bad …
Best documentary series Again, I’ve been spoilt for choice. Devon and Cornwall, a series that thrived on showing nice people doing nice things in Devon and Cornwall, was perfect lockdown TV. As was This Farming Life, which followed the lives of farmers in Scotland and the north of England throughout the year. It also featured a lot of dogs, which is a serious bonus for any telly programme. But my top pick has to be the fourth series of The Crown for not putting a foot wrong and never mixing up timelines or using artistic licence to enhance the drama. So it was fascinating to learn for the first time of the real conversation Michael Fagan had with the Queen when he broke into Buckingham Palace. And it was uncanny to discover that Diana went out with the Duke of Edinburgh on her first trip to Balmoral to kill a wounded stag. In a straightforward drama series, that could so easily have been confused for a metaphor for Diana being hunted down by the royal family as a sacrificial wife for Prince Charles. Driver of the year It would be far to easy to nominate Lewis Hamilton, who has now won more grands prix than any other racing driver and has equalled Michael Schumacher’s record of seven world championship victories. But for real talent behind the wheel, the award has to go to Dominic Cummings. Most people who were recovering from coronavirus and were suffering from poor eyesight might have asked someone else to drive them to the nearest opticians. But not our Dom. He did it the hard way by going on an hour’s round trip to Barnard Castle with himself in the driving seat, straining his eyeballs not to take out any pedestrians or side-swipe any cyclists and to avoid steering into oncoming traffic. And as far as we know, he completed his eyesight test perfectly without picking up so much as a scratch to the paintwork. That’s what I call real talent. Travel agent of the year Let’s face it, it hasn’t been a great year for taking holidays. By the beginning of summer we had already cancelled a trip to the US to see our daughter and one to Spain to stay with friends, but no one did more to screw up his own hols than the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who was so out of the loop that no one had told him before his plane there would be a 10-day isolation period on his return from Spain. He only found out when he landed. To make matters worse, he completely screwed up the holiday by abandoning his family and flying home alone after three days so he could get his cold turkey over and done with. The Chris Grayling trophy for failing Fittingly, this award again goes to the man himself for failing to win an election that had been rigged in his favour. Grayling had been lined up to be chair of the joint intelligence and security committee under the proviso that he sit on the report on Russian interference in UK elections indefinitely. But poor old Chris was blindsided by fellow Tory Julian Lewis, who secured the support of the four opposition MPs on the nine-person committee by promising to publish the report asap. By the end of the year Grayling had resigned from the committee in a sulk. Superforecaster of the year This is a category for which Dominic Cummings would normally have regarded himself as a shoo-in. Only this year Dom completely failed to forecast he would be out of a job at No 10 by Christmas. So instead the award goes to Boris Johnson for getting everything right by being consistently wrong. If you want to know what government policy is going to be, you can now guarantee that it will be the exact opposite of what Boris said it would be two weeks previously. Sports personality of the year An easy one. Marcus Rashford for twice getting the government to reverse its decisions on free school meals. The goals arbitration service is still not entirely sure whether to mark these down as goals for Rashford or own goals for Johnson. Either way, there’s every likelihood one of them will complete their hat-trick next year. Book of the year Since the first coronavirus lockdown my concentration has been shot to pieces and I have been unable to complete any book. So instead I am nominating Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light as the book I would most like to have finished. Live gig of the year Not a lot of choice as I’ve only been to two, one of which was the divine Ermonela Jaho’s recital at the Wigmore Hall. But the winner is Opera Holland Park for its socially distanced concert of opera arias with some fabulous singers back in July. It took place outdoors, so naturally it rained, but no one cared. It was a beautiful evening at the end of which my soul felt temporarily restored."
2020-12-25T22:48:00Z,politics,Politics,Brexit trade deal to be approved by EU27 'within days',"The 27 members of the EU are expected to approve the post-Brexit trade deal with the UK within days after a Christmas Day briefing of ambassadors by Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator. Experts across Europe, from Berlin to Paris and Rome, will now pore over the 1,246-page text, although much of it is well known in the capitals and there is little doubt that the agreement will be signed off.
Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission leader, were able to announce completion of the nine months of trade and security negotiations on Christmas Eve after the two teams led by Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, had agreed terms at 1.44pm UK time. Ambassadors representing the 27 member states in Brussels nibbled on chocolates and at least one wore a Father Christmas bobble hat as they met to start the process that will lead to the deal being put into force on 1 January. The European parliament has declined to hold a vote of consent this year due to the lack of time for scrutiny. The UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union in six days. The deal will instead be “provisionally applied” at the end of the year by the EU in order to avoid a no-deal outcome, with MEPs voting later in January. The House of Commons will be recalled and hold a vote on the new treaty on 30 December. An EU diplomat said: “EU ambassadors praised Michel Barnier and the EU negotiation team for their resilience and steadfastness under intense pressure during the Brexit negotiations with the UK. “Ambassadors also thanked Michel Barnier and his team for the extraordinary cooperation and transparency during the negotiations which has greatly helped to ensure EU unity.” The diplomat said the member states “will now start a preliminary review of the draft texts of the different Brexit agreements”. “This exercise will take a few days as the core agreement on EU trade and cooperation already comprises 1,246 pages of legal text,” the diplomat said. “EU ambassadors unanimously endorsed a letter to the European parliament on the intention of EU member states to take a decision on the provisional application of the EU-UK agreement in the coming days. “The letter lays out the necessity of this exceptional step in order to prevent a significant disruption in EU-UK relations with severe consequences for citizens and businesses at the end of the transition period on the 1st of January. “The provisional application would also allow for proper and full democratic scrutiny of the draft agreement by the European parliament and the council of member states before its final ratification. This decision on the provisional application will be put to a vote in the council in the following days.” In the UK, Eurosceptic backbenchers are awaiting the verdict of a “star chamber” of experts convened by the European Research Group to go through the agreement line by line. It is expected to publish its conclusions on Monday. There is, however, no expectation that the deal will be rejected. Michael Gove meanwhile presented the trade agreement as a new start that would allow the UK and the EU develop a “special relationship … between sovereign equals”. Writing in the Times, the cabinet secretary hoped it would end the “rancorous and, at times, ugly politics” of the period since the Brexit referendum. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has told his MPs that they should vote for the deal. A rebellion on Wednesday’s vote is certain, with a number of shadow ministers likely to quit rather than vote in favour. At a press conference on Christmas Eve, Starmer said: “At a moment of such national significance, it is just not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines.”"
2020-12-25T22:00:04Z,politics,Politics,"PM's Brexit deal makes UK safer, Priti Patel insists","Priti Patel has insisted that the government’s Brexit deal will help make the UK safer, following concerns from senior police officers and Labour MPs about the lack of access to a key EU information database. The home secretary was under pressure to defend the deal after it emerged that the UK will automatically forfeit its membership of Europol, Eurojust and the European Arrest Warrant and will no longer benefit from the same real-time sensitive data-sharing agreements when the UK exits the transition period on 1 January. The deal allows cooperation on security and policing issues, but Brussels said the UK will no longer have “direct, real-time access” to sensitive information. Crucially, the UK will lose access to the EU’s Schengen Information System II (SIS II) database of alerts about wanted or missing people and items such as stolen firearms and vehicles. Government officials said on Friday that the deal would ensure law enforcement officers had the tools they needed, while new border controls and the end of free movement would help protect the public. The Home Office said the agreement includes streamlined extradition arrangements, fast and effective exchange of national DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data, and continued transfers of Passenger Name Record data. In a statement, Patel said: “The safety and security of UK citizens is the government’s top priority and the UK will continue to be one of the safest countries in the world. I’m immensely proud of the comprehensive package of capabilities we’ve agreed with the EU. “It means both sides have effective tools to tackle serious crime and terrorism, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice. But we will also seize this historic opportunity to make the UK safer and more secure through firmer and fairer border controls.” From July 2021, the UK will start receiving advance data on all goods coming from the EU into Great Britain, something that has not previously been possible under EU rules. The UK is also phasing out the use of alternative identity documents used to enter the UK. From 1 October 2021, the UK will refuse to recognise EEA and Swiss national identity cards. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) lead for Brexit, deputy assistant commissioner Richard Martin, told peers last month: “We have over 4m alerts on the Schengen Information System about people, property and things that my officers need to look at … We checked it 603m times last year because it is integrated into our system.” While contingency plans had been made to “still have access to the alerts that we consider to be the most important” using an Interpol system, the loss of access to SIS “is still a capability gap and it will have a massive impact on us”, he added. In the run-up to the UK’s separation from the EU, police chiefs raised concerns about access to information and the loss of the European Arrest Warrant. Under the warrant, the UK extradited more than 11,000 wanted criminals between 2000 and 2019 and received hundreds in return. The agreement includes a fast-track extradition system to replace the warrant, which will be “unprecedented for a non-Schengen third country”, according to Brussels, and DNA and fingerprint data will continue to be exchanged through the Prüm system. The UK cooperates with European partners on hundreds of cross-border criminal and terrorism investigations through Europol, the EU’s policing agency. The National Crime Agency has said it will have to reorganise hundreds of these operations with new agreements with each country it currently works with inside Europol. Following the announcement of the deal, the NPCC said: “We welcome the agreement between the UK government and European partners. We are working with the government to fully understand the detail of the security agreement and how it will be implemented, and ensure we are prepared for any changes to the way we currently operate.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said Labour would be questioning the government over future security plans. “For our nation’s security, no deal would have been disastrous, so securing a deal was always preferable. “We will be holding the government to account on their commitments on our future security partnership. We must do all we can to address serious and organised crime and terrorism, which know no borders,” he said."
2020-12-25T18:51:33Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer faces Labour frontbench revolt over Brexit deal,"Keir Starmer is facing a revolt from Labour frontbenchers over his decision to back the government’s Brexit trade deal.
The party leader has been warned that shadow ministers are poised to resign and defy a three-line whip when the House of Commons votes on the deal on Wednesday. Starmer on Thursday called for Labour MPs to vote for Boris Johnson’s deal, saying it was a “binary choice” between the deal on offer or no deal. “When this deal comes before parliament, Labour will accept it, and vote for it,” he said. Starmer described Johnson’s deal as “thin”, saying it would not underpin workers’ rights or adequately protect sectors such as manufacturing and the creative industries. Labour MPs had urged Starmer to abstain in the vote, saying he would be unable to hold the government to account for its economic consequences if Labour had supported it. Others, including some of those who refused to vote to trigger the article 50 process of leaving the EU, would like Labour to vote against. Sources confirmed that several frontbenchers are preparing to step down over the vote, while many others will support Starmer’s position while wishing he would abstain.
“We seem to be making a stand over a Conservative project. It is deeply uncomfortable for some MPs,” said one source. Shadow cabinet members – including the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, and the shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry – are known to have expressed concerns about the idea of supporting the deal, though they are expected to abide by collective responsibility. Those who may stand down are believed to be shadow junior ministers, not from the shadow cabinet. Dodds tweeted on Thursday that the agreement would have a “major negative impact” on GDP and pointed out that it would not have the “exact same benefits” as EU membership – a promise that Starmer included as one of his “six tests” of Theresa May’s deal when he was the shadow Brexit secretary. But Starmer insisted that “leadership is about taking the tough decisions in the national interest”, adding: “It is about being a serious, responsible opposition. At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines.” Several Labour MPs have warned the party that they plan to vote against the deal in keeping with their constituents’ opposition to Brexit, with some saying that dozens could revolt. One source said: “We are being asked to support a Boris Johnson deal that is full of holes, on issues of security, fishing rights or level playing fields. Plus, it is going to go through anyway on Tory votes alone. I do not understand Keir’s position.” Both Houses of Parliament will be recalled on 30 December, with the Commons sitting from 9.30am and the Lords from noon, to push through a bill implementing the deal – potentially in a single day. The Speaker of the Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, has urged MPs and their staff to avoid travelling if possible, given the Covid restrictions in place in many parts of the country and the prevalence of the disease in London. With Labour’s support, even a significant rebellion by Eurosceptic MPs on the Tory benches – which appears unlikely – will not prevent the deal from passing."
2020-12-25T13:36:31Z,politics,Politics,Brexit deal greeted with relief by European media,"Across Europe’s media there was relief that a deal had finally been reached, and hope that it would mark a high tide of anti-European Union sentiment. Italy’s Corriere della Sera described it as “a Christmas present for everyone”. At a difficult moment, in a complicated world, there is no room for hatred between friends, wrote Beppe Severgnini. But like many others, he questioned the need for Brexit to have happened at all, pointing out how even the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, as he announced the deal, underlined enduring cultural, emotional and other attachments between the continent and Britain. “If that’s the case, dear Bojo, wouldn’t it have been better to avoid Brexit and stay part of the family?” he asked. France’s Le Monde saw the deal as a political victory for Johnson, who it described as an “unsinkable political machine”, if not the unqualified triumph for Britain that he claimed to have pulled off. “His hair is more chaotic than ever, he looks wild at every appearance and seems permanently overwhelmed by events,” the paper said. “But by pulling off a trade deal with the European Union on December 24th, the British prime minister has once again shown the usefulness of pretending to be a madman.” Johnson’s triumphalist presentation of the agreement was noted by El País, which noted that he was already bracing for criticism from those who thought the deal went too far, and others worried it did not go far enough. “Johnson’s propagandistic efforts to extol his results can be explained not only by his character and by what is personally at stake for him – which is approximately everything – but also because he needs to break the resistance of the ultra groups (ultra-Brexiteers) and to plug territorial criticisms such as those already unleashed from Scotland.” Spain’s El Mundo warned that criticism was certain to follow closer scrutiny of the terms of the deal, and described Brexit as hugely damaging, but welcomed an amicable separation as far better than the alternative. “The small print remains to be seen – surely it will not satisfy anyone entirely – but the divorce will be consummated amicably after countless disagreements. And that is great news,” El Mundo said. Germany’s business daily Handelsblatt argued that the Christmas Eve agreement would “mark the end of the Brexit movement” in the UK. With Britain’s departure from the EU complete, the ideological impetus for anti-European sentiment would dissipate and practical realities of life on the bloc’s doorstep would lead to an organic deepening of ties. “From now on the pendulum will swing back the other way,” wrote its London correspondent, Carsten Volkery. “In the coming years relations between Great Britain and the EU will probably become closer and closer again. Because after all the British Isles remains stuck only 30km from France, and negotiations between neighbours never really end. Just ask Switzerland,” he added. Der Spiegel’s Markus Becker also suggested the realities of Brexit would deal a heavy blow to the British exceptionalism that helped drive the departure from the EU. “Many politicians and citizens in Great Britain do not perceive themselves to be Europeans among many other Europeans”, he wrote. “And Great Britain does not think of itself as one European country among many, but a very special or even chosen one.” “Of course not all Brits think like that. But sadly they are not the ones currently in charge. That is why their country’s departure from the EU is not an unreasonable development. “The EU will be freer to take the steps it needs to take in order to assert itself against the USA and China – because it is running out of time to do so. Great Britain, on the other hand, might need Brexit to realise how small the bit part it will play on the world stage will really be.”"
2020-12-25T08:00:42Z,politics,Politics,A step forward or a failure: Britons react to the Brexit deal,"A Brexit deal has been agreed between the UK and the EU with Boris Johnson hailing it as a “jumbo, Canada-style” arrangement. The Guardian asked four people for their thoughts, with some pleased and others not. ‘It’s a complete failure’ Charles Turner from Leamington Spa, a sociology lecturer at the University of Warwick, is fairly certain of his views. “This deal is a complete failure, it’s very simple. We won’t grow as fast as the rest of Europe, and I think by the first half of 2022, we’ll realise we’ll need a much closer relationship with the EU. The Scottish argument for independence will kick in and bring the economic argument right to the fore.
“Having reached the cliff edge, the UK has decided not to jump off after all. “Instead it will find a rocky and steep path down to the stony beach below, with a few handrails along the way, and when it reaches the bottom it will walk along for a bit and then realise the best thing to do is to find another path to get it up to the top again, where it will try to resume its journey and possibly catch up with the others who are striding ahead.” ‘I voted to leave and I’m pleased’ Ken Thompson, 75, from the east Midlands, who used to work for the military, civil service and a national environmental charity, is happy about the deal but remains sceptical about the implications of Brexit, despite having voted for it. “I’m pleased a deal has been struck and that the foundation of a long-term relationship with the EU has been agreed. At least it’s a step forward, everybody can breathe a sigh of relief and we can stop running around like headless chickens. “As with all deals, there has been compromise, and I envisage multiple interest groups will condemn the prime minister. In this respect I think they are incorrect and premature. “I wish to make it clear now that I do not support Boris Johnson. I regard him as a mix between a Captain WE Johns [creator of Biggles] character and Billy Bunter, who does nothing for the image of a modern United Kingdom. “I’m a little concerned about how it is going to affect our agricultural sector. We use so much foreign labour, so that could have an impact on us, and the workers of course. “We might end up like a vassal state, and will be told what to do. I’m quite happy to adopt some of the good EU legislation that has been developed, but it needs to be tailored to us. “I know Europe is very much split on sovereignty. While the politicians want to present a united front, I think that’s a veneer. It’s a possibility that, as we evolve, we might go back in! Only time will tell.” ‘It’s no better than Theresa May’s deal’ Charles Lea, 73, from Lancashire, is exasperated. “This deal is a complete and an utter sellout. Right now, we’re still in the EU, so to speak, and the labour we’re trading at the moment is beneficial for both sides. “The deal Boris has signed us up for is no better than Theresa May’s. I downloaded it this afternoon, and it reads a bit like War and Peace. Boris has given fishing away. He’s not just talking fish quotas. He’s mentioning specific types of fish and has completely destroyed the Scottish fishing industry. “Nobody signed up for any of this. I just don’t understand why he’s taken this route. We weren’t given the full facts and should have had all the facts prior to the 2016 referendum. “This is a bad deal not just for the UK as a whole but for the EU and its member states. This is not the time for gloating or self-praise, this whole sorry saga will go on and on for years, and there won’t be winners.” ‘I’m glad a no-deal was avoided, but I weep silently’ Teresa Curtis, 64, from Stockport, a retired midwife, health visitor and university lecturer, is glad a deal has been reached, but has strong reservations. “Whilst I certainly did not relish a no-deal scenario, I cannot see any benefit to the UK within this agreement. “We had a sound and mutually satisfactory relationship as a member of the EU where we were stakeholders and had a voice. Now we are merely an appendage, increasingly isolated and irrelevant.
“I am completely outraged at the loss of the Erasmus programme, which I saw at first hand during my university tenure as so beneficial to participating students. The words of Joni Mitchell – ‘You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone’ – have never rung so true. “I am concerned about the restrictions on freedom of movement. Insurance premiums will be higher, especially for the over-60s. Food prices here will rise and of course there will be job losses, which no doubt this unscrupulous government will seek to blame on Covid. “I fear that the seeds of racism have already been sown and will grow as we become ever more inward-looking, and that the cultural norms we have incorporated into our lives since joining the EU will be eroded. “I weep silently for all the young people whose lives will be inevitably restricted.”"
2020-12-25T08:00:42Z,politics,Politics,Coming and going: the race to move before transition period ends,"With a week to go before the Brexit transition period finishes on 31 December, people wanting to relocate to either the UK or the EU before freedom of movement ends are coming to terms with the possibility their plans will be scuppered by travel bans, coronavirus restrictions, and job insecurity. ‘If moving doesn’t work out, I don’t know what we’ll do’ Rose Barber, 33, a teacher and mother of two, is hopeful that she will be able to relocate from Lyndhurst, Hampshire to France with her family on 27 December. “It looked like everything was in jeopardy, but we are hoping to cross at Dover on the 27th and sign on our new house on the 28th. My husband drove to Leicester to hand-deliver our tests to the lab so we would get the results in time. “Moving abroad has been a lifelong dream of mine. We started buying our house in July, but it all took ages because of the pandemic. We’re stuck in this admin loop where you need proof of address to show you are in the country and apply for residency, and a French phone number, which we don’t have. “It’s literally down to the wire. We’ve been living in Airbnbs so if this doesn’t work out, I don’t know what we’ll do.” As excited as Barber is, she is nervous about potential hurdles arising from Covid restrictions and travel bans.
“Thanks to Covid restrictions, there are family members and friends we haven’t seen in nearly a year and even a baby nephew we haven’t been able to meet in person, which, in addition to not knowing when or even if we will get to France, makes leaving even harder.” ‘I’m very worried for my future’ Daniele Ravizza, 26, from Bergamo, Italy, had to temporarily return to Italy during the pandemic because of financial difficulties, and risked losing his pre-settled status as a consequence when travel bans hit and he fell ill with Covid. European citizens like him will be eligible to apply for the right to remain if they arrive in the UK before 11pm on 31 December 2020. Ravizza was granted pre-settled status earlier this year before leaving for Italy, but had to return to the UK within six months in order to retain it. “Covid pushed me to leave the UK in March. I have interviewed for many jobs in the UK, but was not able to come back because I wasn’t successful and couldn’t afford to stay. “I tested positive for Covid while abroad, and ended up being away for nine months. I was afraid I might lose my right to remain but when the travel ban between the UK and various countries was announced on 20 December, I booked a flight immediately. “I’ve made it back and have started my settled status clock again, but I now need to find a job in order to be able to stay. I hope being in London will help me find work, but I’m very worried for my future. The mix of Brexit and Covid has been lethal for me.” ‘If it wasn’t for Brexit, I’d stay put’ Pieter de Jong, 25, is self-employed in the festival industry and graduated from the University of Aberdeen in 2019 before moving back to the Netherlands. After having been separated from his girlfriend in the UK for most of the year, he is now scrambling to move to Glasgow before the Brexit deadline, where he is due to start a masters degree in January. “I’m looking to move now because the industry I work in has been completely decimated. It looks like I’ll still be able to travel to the UK as my flight is confirmed for 27 December, and because I’m moving house it would be classed as an essential journey. But if they move my flight or cancel it, I’ll have to figure out what to do.”
De Jong is worried that he might have to pay international student fees, as well as a surcharge in order to be eligible for Scottish NHS services. “If it wasn’t for Brexit, I’d hold off and travel some time in January, but I want to make it into the country before the deadline to avoid potential problems at the border. “Covid is another sore point: my home town of Groningen is one of the safest places in the Netherlands, whereas Glasgow is not doing very well at the moment. Travelling so close to Christmas, New Year and the Brexit deadline is unnerving as I’m scared that it might be quite busy and make it hard to keep a safe distance.” ‘I could become separated from my partner’ Norman Jope, 60, from Plymouth, working in academic administration, is struggling to make peace with not being able to relocate to Hungary, where his partner lives, in time before the Brexit deadline. “My partner is British but has lived there for over 20 years and has recently acquired dual nationality. For various reasons I will not be able to join her in the next seven days, so effectively, from 1 January I will lose my European citizenship rights. My blood is boiling about this.” The pandemic, Jope believes, will have frustrated many people’s efforts to move between the EU and the UK in time. “It’s been very challenging to relocate this year – moving would have been a wrench as I have ailing elderly parents. The pandemic effectively took the decision out of my hands. “My only option is now to either formalise my relationship with my partner so I can join her in the future, which we are thinking about, or get a job and a work permit. “Healthcare will also be an issue: I’m healthy now, but I will no longer have the automatic right to care in Hungary, and getting private health insurance is difficult for old people. All this is likely to affect the life chances, relationships and mental health of many British citizens.”"
2020-12-25T07:00:40Z,politics,Politics,'Make what you want seem normal': David Frost and the Brexit deal,"For good or ill, David Frost knew how to get under Michel Barnier’s skin. The British chief negotiator’s habit in the negotiating room of dismissing the EU as “your organisation”, as if it was a bowling club, grated with his French counterpart. “You ask for respect for your sovereignty, David, but please respect ours,” Barnier privately chided Frost. Throughout many months of talks, theirs was never the warmest of relationships. “I don’t know if they will stay in touch,” admitted one EU source. But there was strategy at play: change conventional wisdom, the UK reasoned, and instil a genuine belief in Brussels that this administration could walk away. Frost, 55, had recognised the importance of changing the terms of the conversation in Brussels while working in the UK’s permanent representation in the Belgian capital in the 1990s, and as deputy head of the Foreign Office’s EU external department in London. On leaving the diplomatic service in 2013 to head the Scotch Whisky Association, he wrote a pamphlet on how to negotiate with the EU in the context of David Cameron’s renegotiation of Britain’s membership. “Make what you want seem normal,” he said then. And in 2020 Frost would tell his team: “People get used to ideas.” Frost – “Frosty” to his team or “the Great Frost” to the prime minister – did want a deal, albeit a thin one. He had extolled the economic value of access to the single market in the past. He had put his negotiating positions through “star chambers” of officials from Whitehall departments for interrogation, warning that ambitions should be kept within reason given Downing Street’s unwillingness to sign up to EU rules. As he saw it, this negotiation was not about limiting damage to trade by scaling down from EU membership. It was about building up access to the single market from the basis that Britain would make its own laws, unencumbered. The heart of the deal was known, given the UK’s red lines and the lack of time for elaborate negotiations: zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods. British officials believed a new narrative was key to making the EU engage with Downing Street’s scepticism about “level playing field” provisions limiting the government’s right to set its own regulatory standards. “They stressed sovereignty and taking back control constantly,” EU diplomats were privately briefed following the first round of talks in March. Or as a British official put it: “They found it very difficult to deal with our obstinacy. It was wearying. After another session of telling them we were a sovereign equal and an independent coastal state we would all say to ourselves ‘never again’. But David [Frost] would then get us to go in and do it again.” The British negotiators deployed the “Diet Coke manoeuvre”. “Diet Coke doesn’t make so many different flavours because of the taste,” said an official. “They do it so you are choosing between five different types of Diet Coke and a Pepsi. I would give them five different options that were more or less acceptable and get them to choose.” Uncertainty about Britain’s commitment to staying at the negotiating table was also drilled in from the start – and amplified by the definition of a no-deal outcome as equivalent to leaving on Australian terms. “It was a Trumpian use of alternative facts,” said one EU source. “The closer you got to the talks, the more you thought: this could end in no deal,” said another. “The closer you are to the action, the more you doubt.” Frost himself was an enigma to the EU side. A former Foreign Office man, steeped in EU affairs through postings in Brussels and Whitehall, but now a political figure sitting as a Conservative in the House of Lords, with Johnson promising him another massive role as national security adviser. A scholar of medieval French who had his team wear union jack branded lanyards: Frost may have been personally understated, but his negotiation had swagger. Following the UK’s dramatic mid-October walkout, Frost had been in no rush to resume the talks even when his demands had been fully met. Through gritted teeth, Barnier had reiterated his respect for UK sovereignty and the need for mutual compromise in a speech to the European parliament. But Frost let Brussels hang for a while. “The speech was in the morning but David was very calm and he said to hold off,” a UK source said. He wanted to see all the Is dotted and Ts crossed on new terms of reference for the intensified talks. It would take several hours before he picked up a phone in an office in No 9 Downing Street to restart the negotiations. “David’s super power is that he is so, so calm,” said a British official. As a consequence of this bullish approach, the negotiation was marked by public and private spats. By far the most explosive move came in September with publication of the internal market bill, rewriting the withdrawal agreement and breaking international law. “It focused minds on some of the problems in the negotiation,” said one UK source. For others, the breach of trust was cataclysmic. Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, for whom Frost worked as private secretary when he was head of the diplomatic service, said the losses were tangible, notably the block on a swath of UK-headquartered financial services from serving the European market – a unilateral EU decision. “That doesn’t feel like it’s played out well,” Kerr said. Time will tell. Frost has said the short-term costs of Brexit will be more than matched by long-term benefits, as the UK can plot its own way. Thanks in no small part to him, the country has the opportunity to find out."
2020-12-25T07:00:40Z,politics,Politics,"Now Brexit is sealed, Scotland plunges into battle for the narrative","For those stalwart Scottish independence activists still online on Christmas Eve afternoon, the message could not have been simpler: the only way to escape the disaster of Brexit is to leave the UK at the earliest opportunity. Brexit has significantly changed the nature of support for independence since 62% of Scotland voted to remain in the EU in 2016, against the UK grain, but the question remains whether the conclusion of a post-Brexit trade and security deal will shift voter sentiment further. While the expected “Brexit bounce” did not materialise immediately, with voters dubious about inviting further constitutional uncertainty, polls have shown a steady increase in support for independence over the past four years. After the Brexit vote, there was some counterbalance between Scots who voted remain and then moved from no to yes on independence, and those disenchanted leave voters who abandoned their nationalist sympathies. Since then the increase in support for independence has occurred among remain and leave voters, as a surge this year saw independence support reaching as high as 58% in the polls, attributed in part to the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon’s impressive management of the pandemic. It may be some way off the convincing proportions that some in the pro-independence camp believe they must secure to avoid Brexit-style division, but it has nonetheless put the Westminster cabinet on a war footing. Whether the deal itself would increase support for independence would turn on whether Scots’ dissatisfaction with Brexit was already “baked in” to polling numbers, said Sir John Curtice, the veteran analyst and professor of politics at Strathclyde University. “It depends what happens over the next few months and whether the change becomes a friction that grates, for example if Dover is still bunged up, people’s post-Covid [pandemic] flights are cancelled and they get enormous mobile phone bills.” The battle now is for the narrative: while the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, was quick to trumpet an end to “the hated” common fisheries policy, Sturgeon was already arguing that fishers had been shortchanged. The SNP will seize on examples of specifically Scottish detriment in the detail of the deal, such as the exclusion of seed potatoes, a premium Scottish export. The first significant test of who is winning that battle will be May’s Scottish parliament elections, where the SNP is already forecast to win a Holyrood majority that many believe will make the case for a second independence referendum unanswerable.
For Curtice, UK Labour’s support for the Brexit deal when it is put before parliament next week could make campaigning difficult for the Scottish party, which was hampered in the last general election by the UK leadership’s stance on Brexit. “If Labour want to appeal to the Scottish electorate after voting for a deal, that’s going to be very difficult. Remain voters unhappy with Brexit are unlikely to go to Scottish Labour, and the SNP has already gobbled up a large proportion of them.” At the last Holyrood elections, held just before the Brexit vote, the former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson’s opposition to Brexit allowed her to effectively put distance between the Scottish Tories, their UK counterparts and Boris Johnson himself, the man who remains – for many Scottish voters – the embodiment of Brexit. Her successor is well aware of the Brexit effect on independence support, but Scottish Tory strategists believe they can effectively neutralise continued criticism of Brexit by pointing to the division and chaos that another independence referendum could bring – as well as the practical uncertainties of independence as a route back to the EU."
2020-12-25T06:13:28Z,politics,Politics,'Christmas gift' or 'bad timing'? Brexit deal greeted with joy and foreboding around world,"Britain should be congratulated for coming to a Brexit deal with the EU, but be wary of the very different world they are walking into, international analysts have said. Outside Europe, politicians, experts, and media took a short break from Christmas and the pandemic to welcome the end of Britain’s long and torturous Brexit process, but there was little in the way of celebration. In the New York Times, Mark Landler reflected on how much Britain, and the world, had changed since the 2016 vote, when a narrow majority of people were “tempted by an argument that the country would prosper by throwing off the bureaucratic shackles of Brussels”, develop new industries and cut its own trade deals. But now the world is more protectionist and nationalistic, and vulnerable post-pandemic.
“The world is now dominated by three gargantuan economic blocs – the United States, China and the European Union,” wrote Landler. “Britain has finalised its divorce from one of them, leaving it isolated at a time when the path forward seems more perilous than it once did.” In that same piece, Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution cut to the chase: “Becoming a global free trader in 2016 is a bit like turning into a communist in 1989. It’s bad timing.” In a comprehensive step through of the politics behind history, Linton Besser, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s Europe correspondent, predicted Boris Johnson, ever the populist, would swing with the wind on whether the deal was working out. “The prime minister will continue to trumpet the breakthrough for as long as it’s advantageous to do so,” wrote Besser. “Then, in the not-too-distant future, when electoral profit beckons, he and his allies will find a way, whatever rhetorical contortions are required, to condemn the EU all the same. The deal will be reprosecuted – perhaps by Johnson himself – in pursuit of another chance to wave a kipper at those pesky Europeans from up on a stage. “And that’s because Europe has for decades been a very handy straw man for many in the establishment, not least Johnson himself, who paved a path to politics with wildly exaggerated newspaper columns pouring scorn on European cooperation.” Chinese state media reports on Brexit were viewed more than 140m times on microblogging platform, Weibo, but they did not appear to publish any Chinese-language commentary. The state-backed tabloid, Global Times, said the deal was “a Christmas gift not only for the British economy but also for the Covid-19-battered global financial market”. The editorial said the world’s markets were still struggling with the pandemic, and looking for “less chaos”. It commended the British government’s “last ditch efforts” to secure a deal under so much pressure. “There is no denying that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a dramatic change in the life and employment prospects of the Britons,” it said. In English, Xinhua said that while the deal will “certainly help avoid a Brexit cliff edge”, it was not “a Christmas gift for all”. Other English-language state media, including CGTN and China Daily, went with an op-ed by former MEP Jonathan Arnott. Arnott wrote that the last-minute nature of the deal – on Christmas eve and a week before deadline – was “breathtaking, though hardly surprising”. “The world is changing,” he said, and how the UK deals with the growing markets of China, India, and South America will be “pivotal”. “One way or another, it must demonstrate a clear strategy: unless such trading relationships are signed, sealed and delivered, the UK cannot claim to have gained economically from Brexit.” Japan’s finance minister, Taro Aso, told reporters he welcomed the deal, and “it should be highly valued that a broad agreement was clinched between the two”. New Zealand’s minister for foreign affairs, Nanaia Mahuta, also congratulated both sides. “We welcome continued stability and continuity,” she tweeted. A US state department official said the US was committed to negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK. “We support the UK in its sovereign decision to depart the EU, and we look forward to continued strong relationships with both the UK and EU,” they said. The Times of India reported the agreement left “critical parts of the relationship to be worked out later”, and WIO News reported the two parties had “finally agreed” on a deal, and led on reassuring comments by the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, that the two sides would “stand shoulder to shoulder to deliver on our common global goals”. However it also reported on economists’ warnings that “leaving the EU’s orbit will still hurt” the world’s current sixth largest economy."
2020-12-25T05:17:08Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson vows to pit UK against EU in race for success,"Britain is heading into a new chapter in its relationship with the rest of Europe with Boris Johnson vowing to pit the country against the EU in a race for economic success. After nine months of tortuous talks, a Brexit deal was secured at 1.44pm GMT on Christmas Eve, avoiding a no-deal exit from the transition period with just a week to go. EU ambassadors will meet on Christmas day for a briefing from their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and are expected to take two or three days to analyse the agreement and decide on its provisional implementation. In the UK, Eurosceptic backbenchers are awaiting the verdict of a “star chamber” of experts convened by the European Research Group to go through the agreement line by line. It is expected to publish its conclusions on Monday. The deal was met with “relief tinged with some sadness” in Brussels. But it was said by Johnson to be the settlement of the vexed question of Britain’s relationship with Europe, 48 years since the country joined the then European economic community. Flanked by large union flags, the prime minister said: “This European question’s been going on for decades. I think this gives us the platform, the foundation for a really prosperous new relationship.” The deal delivered on the promise of a “giant free-trade zone” characterised by “regulatory competition”, Johnson said. “We have taken back control of laws and our destiny …We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation in a way that is complete and unfettered.” The prime minister said the UK had won the right “set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want” in key sectors such as biosciences and artificial intelligence. “British laws will be made solely by the British parliament; interpreted by British judges, sitting in the UK courts,” he said. He later tweeted a video where he hailed the deal as “great tidings of great joy”. Picking up a copy of the 500-page document, he added: “The oven-ready deal was just the starter. This is the feast – full of fish, by the way. I believe it will be the basis of a happy and successful and stable partnership with our friends in the EU for years to come.”
His optimism contrasted with the expectations of the government’s own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects Brexit to shave 4% off GDP in the medium term.
From 1 January, most UK nationals will lose the right of free movement and British businesses will face significant extra costs in doing business with its biggest export market. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, gently questioned Johnson’s understanding of sovereignty, the watchword of the British negotiation led by David Frost, as she welcomed the agreement. She said: “Of course, this whole debate has always been about sovereignty. But we should cut through the sound bites and ask ourselves what sovereignty actually means in the 21st century. “For me, it is about being able to seamlessly do work, travel, study and do business in 27 countries. It is about pooling our strength and speaking together in a world full of great powers. And in a time of crisis, it is about pulling each other up. Instead of trying to get back to your feet, alone. “And the European Union shows how this works in practice. No deal in the world can change the reality of [the] gravity in today’s economy. And in today’s world, we are one of the giants.” Von der Leyen referenced Shakespeare, the Beatles and TS Eliot as she ushered in the new era. “It was a long and winding road, but we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair. It is a balanced deal. And it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides,” she said. “At the end of a successful negotiation I normally feel joy. But today I only feel quiet satisfaction and, frankly speaking, relief. “I know this is a difficult day for some, and to our friends in the United Kingdom, I want to say parting is such sweet sorrow but, to use the line from TS Eliot, what we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is often a beginning. So, to all Europeans, I think it is time to leave Brexit behind.” Most of Johnson’s themes in his speech, including sovereignty, regulatory independence and fishing, were those close to the hearts of the Brexit-backing MPs who helped him to win the Tory leadership last year. With MPs set to vote on the agreement on Wednesday 30 December, Downing Street has kept Eurosceptic backbenchers closely informed as negotiations developed. After the deal was struck, many said they would await the verdict of the “star chamber” convened by the backbench European Research Group, consisting of lawyers and politicians including the former Europe minister David Jones. In a sign of battles to come, representatives of the fishing industry said it was “bitterly disappointed” with what Johnson described as a “prodigious” increase in the amount of fish the UK could land. Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said Johnson had had his “Ted Heath moment” – a reference to his predecessor giving away fishing rights in British waters in 1973. A transition period of five-and-a-half years to phase in changes, with the UK accepting a 25% repatriation of quotas, amounted to “justice deferred, justice denied”, he said. The prime minister urged Brexiters and remainers to move on from the divisions that have plagued UK politics since the referendum. “My message to everybody on both sides of that argument in 2016 is I really think now it’s a long time behind us,” he said. He claimed the UK would remain “culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the 4 million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives”. Barnier, said it was “a day of relief but tinged with some sadness”. He lamented the government’s decision not to be a partner in the Erasmus student exchange programme and the lack of cooperation on foreign policy and defence. The deal will be scrutinised by EU leaders but both the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said they believed the accord would be in place for the end of the year."
2020-12-24T21:58:49Z,politics,Politics,Kipper tie: Boris Johnson sports fish symbol in Brexit message,"Boris Johnson delivered his press conference on Christmas Eve, outlining the Brexit trade deal that will separate the EU and UK, while wearing a tie with a subtle fish motif in a nod to one of the dominant issues of the tortuous negotiations. Despite Britain’s fishing industry being responsible for only 0.1% of the country’s GDP, it became symbolic of a desire by leave voters to “take back control”. Many had complained that successive years of overfishing by EU countries and the quota system had hurt the industry.
In Johnson’s announcement, he stressed the “prodigious” increase in fishing catches he said the UK would now be allowed to keep. Downing Street agreed to terms that would see 25% of the catch by value of European fleets in UK waters “repatriated”. Yet Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said the prime minister had considered fish expendable, adding his industry would be “bitterly disappointed” that European fisherman were still allowed within 12 miles of the British coast.
It is not the first time during the Brexit debate that public figures’ clothing has seemed to be a comment on the issues. When Lady Hale sat down to deliver the supreme court’s ruling on whether Johnson proroguing parliament in 2019 was legal, many people’s eyes were drawn to the silver spider that seemed to be crawling up her shoulder. The brooch was thought to be a coded signal that the prime minister was trapped by the court’s ruling his move was illegal. T-shirts with the design on raised more than £5,000 for Shelter in the hours after her announcement. During the state opening of parliament after the 2017 general election, the Queen wore a lilac hat with several flowers on, with blue petals and yellow centres. Some immediately drew a parallel to the EU flag with Brexit going on to dominate Theresa May’s premiership. Away from Brexit, in the US the first lady, Melania Trump, was seen sporting a coat bearing the slogan “I really don’t care. Do U?” on the back, as her husband increasingly faced criticism. Despite initial denials – and claims that it was “just a jacket” – Melania later said in an interview that it “was a kind of message, yes”."
2020-12-24T20:30:49Z,politics,Politics,Brexit deal: Boris Johnson says EU trade agreement resolves 'question that has bedevilled politics for decades' â€“ as it happened,"Weâ€™re closing the liveblog now after an eventful Christmas Eve, as Boris Johnson announced that the UK had struck a trade deal with the EU. Thank you for following, and have a Merry Christmas, however youâ€™re spending it."
2020-12-24T18:39:17Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to whip his MPs to support 'thin' Brexit deal,"Keir Starmer will whip Labour MPs to support Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal when it comes to parliament next week, he has announced, in a move likely to provoke a rebellion by pro-EU backbenchers. The Labour leader gave a press conference after the prime minister announced that negotiations had concluded, and said he had made the “tough decision” to back the agreement. “When this deal comes before parliament, Labour will accept it, and vote for it,” he said. Starmer described Johnson’s deal as “thin”, saying it would not underpin workers’ rights or adequately protect sectors such as manufacturing and the creative industries.
But he insisted that a no-deal exit from the transition period on 1 January next week was now the only other realistic possibility. “A better deal could have been negotiated. But I accept that option has now gone,” he said. Some Labour MPs had urged Starmer to abstain in the vote on the deal, saying he would be unable to hold the government to account for its economic consequences if Labour had supported it. Others, including some of those who refused to vote to trigger the article 50 process of leaving the EU, would like Labour to vote against. Several shadow cabinet members – including the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, and the shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry – are known to have expressed concerns about the idea of supporting the deal, though they are expected to abide by collective responsibility. Dodds tweeted on Thursday that the agreement would have a “major negative impact” on GDP and pointed out that it would not have the “exact same benefits” as EU membership – a promise that Starmer included as one of his “six tests” of Theresa May’s deal when he was the shadow Brexit secretary. But Starmer insisted that “leadership is about taking the tough decisions in the national interest”, adding: “It is about being a serious, responsible opposition. At a moment of such national significance, it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines.”
Johnson attacked Starmer at prime minister’s questions this month when he abstained in a key vote on coronavirus restrictions. He said his message to the government was: “Up against no deal, we accept this deal, but the consequences of it are yours. And yours alone. We will hold you to account for it every second you are in power.” The decision was confirmed in a shadow cabinet meeting on Thursday. Both Houses of Parliament will be recalled on 30 December, with the Commons sitting from 9.30am and the Lords from noon, to push through a bill implementing the deal – potentially in a single day. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, has urged MPs and their staff to avoid travelling if possible, given the Covid restrictions in place in many parts of the country and the prevalence of the disease in London. With Labour’s support, even a significant rebellion by Eurosceptic MPs on the Tory benches – which appears unlikely – will not prevent the deal from passing. But Starmer may face a significant rebellion on his own side, with some Labour MPs suggesting scores of colleagues could defy the whips, who will be unable to use the traditional approach of face-to-face persuasion to win them over. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said his party had not yet decided how to vote on the deal, but he told BBC News: “Even on an early analysis, it’s looking a pretty poor deal for our economy.”"
2020-12-24T17:59:47Z,politics,Politics,In their own words: how Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson signed off,"The announcement of the Brexit deal finally came mid-afternoon on Christmas Eve – with contrasting words, delivered in their own inimitable styles, from Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson. In her remarks, the president of the European commission referenced a song by the Beatles, a line from Shakespeare, and a poem by TS Eliot. Johnson, meanwhile, dusted down familiar phrases from the Brexit campaign, aimed the occasional jibe – and ended with a joke … On Brexit … VDL: “To our friends in the UK, I want to say: parting is such sweet sorrow.” BJ: “We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter, and indeed, never let it be forgotten, your number one market.” On the deal … VDL: “It was a long and winding road. But we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair, it is a balanced deal, and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides.” BJ: “This is a great new free-trade deal, a trading relationship and partnership that, I think, will bring prosperity to both sides of the Channel.” On the future ... VDL: “The EU and the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder to deliver on our common global goals.”
BJ: “Although we have left the EU, this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically, geologically attached to Europe.” On sovereignty … VDL: “Of course, this whole debate has always been about sovereignty. But we should cut through the soundbites and ask ourselves what sovereignty actually means in the 21st century …No deal in the world can change reality or gravity in today’s economy and today’s world. We are one of the giants.” BJ: “For the first time since 1973 we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters. We have taken back control of our laws and our destiny. We have taken back every jot and tittle of our regulation in a way that is complete and unfettered.” On fishing … VDL: “We have secured five-and-a-half years of predictability for our fishing communities.” BJ: “I think that was a reasonable transition period and I can assure great fish fanatics in this country that we will as a result of this deal be able to catch and eat quite prodigious quantities of extra fish.” And finally … VDL: “To use a line from TS Eliot: what we call the beginning is often the end, and to make an end is to make a beginning. “So to all the Europeans, I say: it is time to leave Brexit behind, our future is made in Europe.” BJ : “I think my message to everybody on both sides of the [Brexit] divide, of that argument in 2016, is, I really think it’s now a long time behind us.” “That’s the good news from Brussels, now for the sprouts.”"
2020-12-24T17:53:27Z,politics,Politics,European leaders welcome Brexit deal as least-worst outcome,"European capitals have welcomed agreement on what most hailed as a good post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU – but described it as the least-worst outcome and warned they had yet to study the fine print. Emmanuel Macron said European “unity and firmness have paid off” but Paris would now be checking to make sure the deal protected the French fishing industry. The 2,000-page treaty was “essential to protect our citizens, our fishermen, our producers … We will make sure this is the case,” the French president tweeted, adding that Europe could now look to the future “united, sovereign and strong”. Germany’s Angela Merkel was pleased with an agreement “of historic significance”. Berlin would now study the text “intensely”, the chancellor said, and expected “soon to be in a position where we can judge whether Germany can support today’s result … I am optimistic that we have a good result in front of us here.” Merkel said the German cabinet would meet by telephone on 28 December to decide its stance, but added that the agreement “cannot finally enter into force until the European parliament has also given its approval”. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, said Dublin would also now “consider the detail of the text very carefully”. The Brexit journey had been “long and difficult”, he said, and implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol would be critical. Ireland’s fishing communities “will be disappointed with the outcome”, Martin admitted, but “compared with no deal, which would have seen them completely excluded from British waters, negotiators have worked hard to minimise the damage”. Irish businesses would, however, now be facing “new customs and regulatory formalities, procedures and checks”. There was “no such thing as a ‘good Brexit’ for Ireland”, Martin said. The agreement was “the least bad version of Brexit possible”. Ireland’s European affairs minister, Thomas Byrne, said it was “a bittersweet day for us. We hated to see Britain leaving, but we couldn’t wait to conclude the deal to do so.” Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said Vienna would study the text. MEPs said the UK’s compliance with the agreement would be closely watched. The chair of the parliament’s environment, public health and food safety committee, Pascal Canfin, tweeted that he would be “extremely careful”. Canfin said his committee would “ensure full implementation of the provisions protecting EU citizens and companies manufacturing in the EU from climate dumping and non-compliance with our food safety standards” by UK companies. Philippe Lamberts, the head of the Greens in the European parliament, said the bloc’s primary goal had “always been to protect the integrity of our single market, one of the key foundations of the union, and it seems this deal achieves that”. Lamberts said, nonetheless, that “the devil is always in the detail” and the parliament would insist on being given “the proper time to scrutinise and potentially ratify such a wide-ranging deal. We are not just here to rubber-stamp agreements.” Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said in a tweet that he welcomed the deal but warned that talks between Spain and the UK over how Brexit would affect the British overseas territory of Gibraltar had not yet been concluded. Sánchez said member states would examine the deal and the EU council would make clear its position in the coming days. “Dialogue continues between Spain and the UK to reach an agreement on Gibraltar,” he added. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister, said the deal did not cover Gibraltar and that “for us, and the people of the Campo de Gibraltar around us, the clock is still ticking”. His administration would “continue to work, hand in glove with the UK, to finalise negotiation with Spain of an agreement for a proposed treaty between the EU and the UK in relation to Gibraltar”, Picardo said. Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, one of the toughest of the EU27 in several aspects of the negotiations, hailed the deal as “excellent news”, but the Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, said The Hague would be examining the text with great care. “We will pay particular attention to the agreements on a level playing field, the access of Dutch fishing boats to British waters, and the governance of the agreement,” Blok said, adding: “There is very little time to do this.” The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said only one thing mattered to him: “Ensuring the best possible protection for Belgium’s economic interests. We must protect our Belgian companies from unfair British competition.” The agreement offers the prospect of “maintaining our strong relationship with the UK after Brexit, but provides crucial guarantees for fair competition for our companies”, he said. Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, said his country “warmly welcomed” the agreement, adding that UK would remain “in addition to our neighbour and our ally, an important partner” after 1 January. Franziska Brantner, Europe spokesperson for the German Greens’ parliamentary group, said the EU27 had “not allowed themselves to be divided by Johnson’s brinkmanship” and would now “check whether conditions for fair competition and the option of sanctions against dumping are solidly anchored in the text”. European commentators were not charitable. “The trade deal doesn’t match the promises made after the EU membership referendum in 2016,” said the weekly Die Zeit. “Back then, the promise by Johnson was that the UK would keep the advantages of EU membership. “That is no longer the case. In spite of an agreement, cross-country trade will have to bear the weight of more bureaucracy and more border controls. The deal does not apply to services, especially not financial services. Free movement of workers is no longer provided.” The Spanish daily El País said London had “seen in recent hours, as a result of border closures, the monumental damage that a no-deal Brexit would have caused. The British side would be the hardest hit by a chaotic exit from the single market – a risk that has been on the table in recent weeks and now is avoided.”"
2020-12-24T17:40:11Z,politics,Politics,Business groups urge EU leaders to agree Brexit ‘adjustment period’,"Industry figures are calling on EU leaders to urgently agree a Brexit “adjustment period” after negotiators left them with just three working days to prepare for the end of the Brexit transition period. While big business including manufacturers and supermarkets have made Brexit preparations costing hundreds of millions of pounds, they say there is not enough time over Christmas to implement the newly agreed trading regime. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, welcomed the deal but said that “even without the pandemic it would be stretching credibility to believe the companies that export hundreds of billions of pounds worth of goods each year could adapt to a fundamentally different trading model in just one working week”. He added: “It is in everyone’s interest for the UK and EU to jointly agree that with the legal start of this deal significant easements and an adjustment period, with review clauses if necessary, are vital.” Business groups say it is impossible, even with a retinue of experts, to wade through the 2,000-page deal document and get systems ready for new customs, VAT and rules of origin that have not been seen since the single market eradicated trade barriers in 1993. Mike Hawes, the head of the Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders , one of the most vocal critics of a hard Brexit, said: “A phase-in period is critical to help businesses on both sides adapt, and efforts should now be sustained to ensure seamless implementation.” The UK has said it will phase in customs and other controls on imports and industry and is now looking to the EU to mirror this on trade to the continent and Ireland. British businesses trading with Northern Ireland have got a grace period to implement the special arrangements for the region that involve it following EU trading rules. Jonathan Geldart, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said that while the clock had stopped ticking for on the negotiations, it had now started for businesses. “Guidance on implementing the mammoth text is urgently needed across government. Digesting what the changes mean in practice and adapting, in the middle of a pandemic and the festive season while border disruptions continue, is a huge ask,” he said. “However, there is now precious little time for businesses to adapt to the changes they will need to make and at a time when many are reeling from tier 4 restrictions. The UK government must provide as much support as possible to firms in the months ahead.”"
2020-12-24T17:19:31Z,politics,Politics,From tariffs to visas: here's what's in the Brexit deal,"The Brexit trade and security deal, finalised on Christmas Eve, runs to 2,000 pages, including annexes. It will enter into force once approved by both sides. The devil of what has been agreed will be in the detail – and will be pored over in the days to come. Here are the main agreements, at a glance. Tariffs Tariff-free and quota-free access to one of the world’s biggest markets is the backbone of the Brexit deal and goes beyond the EU’s deals with Canada or Japan. Trade There will be mutual recognition of trusted trader programmes. This means UK producers will have to comply with both UK and EU standards. Professional qualifications There will be no more automatic recognition for doctors, nurses, architects, dentists, pharmacists, vets, engineers. They will now have to seek recognition in the member state they wish to practise in. Mobility – freedom of movement UK nationals no longer have the freedom to work, study, start a business or live in the EU. Visas will be required for stays over 90 days. Coordination of some social security benefits such as old-age pensions and healthcare will make it easier to work abroad and not lose any pre-existing build up of contributions to national insurance. Fisheries The UK will leave the common fisheries policy. The annual turnover of EU fishing vessels from British waters is around €650m – compared with €850m for the UK-flagged fleet. New quotas reducing the EU’s share by 25% are due to be phased in over five and a half years. A quarter of the EU’s catch by value – €162.5m a year – will be “repatriated” to UK-flagged vessels by the end of that period. After that, the two sides will hold annual negotiations. The EU vessels that fish six to 12 nautical miles from the British coastline will be able to continue during the transition, but access will be negotiated on an annual basis after that. There is a three-month notice for closing access. Should access be denied to either side, the other may seek compensation or apply tariffs in a proportionate way. State aid The EU had insisted the UK align with its state aid rules. Brussels was concerned that the UK government would seek to find a competitive advantage through subsidies. The UK successfully killed off this idea. The UK will set up its own subsidy regime. The new domestic enforcement body can make decisions over whether state aid has distorted trade after the subsidy has been granted. This is a major concession by the EU. However, the UK will have to ensure that its subsidy regime respects key principles set out in the treaty. The deal also allows both parties to adopt remedial measures if there is evidence that the domestic enforcement body has failed to uphold the shared principles. Standards or level playing field Both sides have agreed on a minimum level of environmental, social and labour standards below which neither must go. Ursula von der Leyen said there would be a review after four years to ensure the level playing field was working. One of the biggest sticking points in the talks was the EU’s insistence on an “evolution clause”, or “equivalence mechanism”, as Downing Street termed it. This would have allowed the EU to unilaterally apply tariffs on UK goods in the event of standards diverging over time. If one side upgraded their rulebook, the other would have to follow, or face consequences. In the end, compromise was reached. It bears a closer resemblance to the UK objective than that of Brussels. The British government had merely wanted a reflection point in the future where the two sides could discuss upgrading the basic minimum below which neither could go. The deal provides for a review and “rebalancing” clause, which allows either side to initiate a formal review of the economic parts of the deal, including the minimum level of standards. If either side drags their feet on agreeing a new floor for standards, the other may apply tariffs subject to the approval of an independent arbitration panel. Rules of origin This determines what goods count as “made in Britain”. The UK persuaded Brussels that EU materials and processing should to be counted as British input when the completed products are exported into the European market. A product would therefore only attract tariffs under the agreement if more than 40% of its pre-finished value was either not of British origin or from a non-EU country such as Japan. The UK failed to secure diagonal accumulation, which would include parts from countries such as Japan and Turkey, with whom the UK and the EU have a trade agreement, to be counted as British input. Dispute resolution This was one of the most difficult areas of negotiation as it will set remedies for trade disputes for decades to come. Angela Merkel has said disagreement over an arbitration mechanism was the biggest obstacle to a deal. The EU was concerned that the UK could, over time and depending on which government was in power, deviate so far from EU standards that it could carve out a significant competitive advantage and become a “Singapore on Thames”. If either party feels trade is being distorted, it can take measures after consultation. An arbitration panel would meet within 30 days and adjudicate. If the measures were later seen to have been deemed erroneous or excessive, the aggrieved party would be able to take compensatory measures. It also appears there will be some kind of overarching UK-EU governance committee which will have subcommittees to implement and enforce the treaty. Science The UK will continue to participate in the EU’s flagship €80bn Horizon Europe programme as a paying associate member for seven years. It will also continue in Copernicus and Euratom. Erasmus The UK is out of the university exchange programme, baulking at the EU’s insistence that to be an associate member it would have to commit to a seven-year payment plan. The Irish government on Thursday confirmed students in Northern Ireland can continue to access Eramus as part of its promise to make sure Irish citizens in the region “will never be left behind” their fellow citizens south of the border. Citizens in Northern Ireland can also avail of a scheme to replace the European health insurance card (EHIC) funded by the Irish government. Security and law enforcement Cross-border police investigations and law enforcement can continue, with agreements that the UK can remain in key exchange programmes but not all. The UK will no longer be part of the European Arrest Warrant system. Nor will the UK be a full member of Europol or Eurojust. There will be “continued cooperation between the UK, Europol and Eurojust” with “strong cooperation between national police and judicial authorities”. The UK will maintain a “mechanism for access” to the Schengen Information System (SIS II), an automated database that shares police alerts on stolen goods and missing persons. There has also been an agreement for continued joint use of the Passenger Name Records, which provides live data on the movement of air and ferry passengers, a key tool in the fight against terrorism and the Prüm database of fingerprints, DNA and car number plates of suspects. TV Services France successfully kept the audio visual sector out of the deal in a major blow to the UK, which is home to around 1,400 broadcasters, about 30% of all channels in the EU. Britain’s thriving TV and video-on-demand service providers will no longer be able to offer pan European services to European viewers unless they relocate part of their business to an EU member state. Travel into the EU for paid work Staff seconded to the EU on business can stay for up to three years if they are managers and specialists and up to one year for trainee employees. Those on short-term business will need a work permit and may stay for a period of up to 90 days in any 12-month period. Experts have warned that British business travellers and posted workers – those that stay in the EU to work for a limited period of time – face fines unless they get advance authorisation once the UK leaves the single market. Under the deal, reciprocal arrangements have been made “to facilitate short-term business trips and temporary secondments of highly-skilled employees”. Transport Aviation and haulage will continue as before with passenger and cargo planes still able to fly and land in the EU including stopover flights from Heathrow and elsewhere in the UK that originated from outside the UK. Hauliers will also be allowed to continue to drive without special permits allocated in limited numbers to countries outside the EU. This comes as a relief to the logistics industry which feared drivers being locked out in significant numbers. The deal hinged on the UK remaining a member of the European Common Aviation Area. However planes will continue to fly in a temporary deal, which will have to be renegotiated urgently."
2020-12-24T17:18:52Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says Brexit deal has settled UK's Europe question,"Boris Johnson claimed finally to have settled the vexed question of Britain’s relationship with the European Union as he hailed on Christmas Eve what he called the “jumbo, Canada-style” Brexit deal. At a press conference in Downing Street where he was flanked by two large union flags, the UK’s prime minister said: “This European question’s been going on for decades. I think this gives us the platform, the foundation for a really prosperous new relationship.”
He claimed the deal, which will see Great Britain leave the customs union and single market but retain tariff-free access to EU markets, would create a “giant free-trade zone” characterised by “regulatory competition”. The two sides have agreed an independent arbitration process to judge what penalties should be applied if either deviates from current regulatory standards in a way that undercuts the other. Johnson insisted: “We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation in a way that is complete and unfettered.” He highlighted what he claimed would be the UK’s newfound ability to “set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want” in key sectors such as biosciences and artificial intelligence. “British laws will be made solely by the British parliament; interpreted by British judges, sitting in the UK courts,” he said. Johnson also stressed the “prodigious” increase in fishing catches he said the UK would now be allowed to keep. Despite the fact exporters will now face increased friction at the border, he claimed he had struck “a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends”. His optimism contrasts with the expectations of the government’s own independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects Brexit to shave 4% off GDP in the medium term. The fishing industry was also disappointed that Johnson had not secured control of the 12 miles of fishing waters off the coast of Britain. Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “I think what I would say is that there’s a gap between the rhetoric and the delivery … I think the industry will be bitterly disappointed. I think there will be fury about the failure to secure an exclusive 12-mile zone.”
Most of Johnson’s themes in his speech, including sovereignty, regulatory independence and fishing, were those close to the hearts of the Brexit-backing MPs who helped him to win the Tory leadership last year. With MPs set to vote on the agreement on Wednesday 30 December, Downing Street has kept Eurosceptic backbenchers closely informed as negotiations developed. After the deal was struck, many said they would await the verdict of a “star chamber” of experts convened by the backbench European Research Group to go through the agreement line by line. The group, consisting of lawyers and politicians including the former Europe minister David Jones, is not expected to publish its conclusions until Monday. The prime minister urged Brexiters and remainers to move on from the divisions that have plagued UK politics since the referendum. “My message to everybody on both sides of that argument in 2016 is I really think now it’s a long time behind us,” he said.
He claimed the UK would remain “culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the 4 million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives”."
2020-12-24T16:20:23Z,politics,Politics,Bust-ups and brinkmanship: inside story of how the Brexit deal was done,"Even in its final hours, the settling of Britain’s future trading and security relationship with the European Union was a painful affair, dragging deep into the night and on into Christmas Eve morning and afternoon, with Downing Street insisting right to the end that nothing was certain. The deal was finally struck at 1.44pm UK time. It could not have come soon enough for two exhausted teams that had been squabbling over, crafting, drafting and redrafting legal text in a final two-week run-in under the headache-inducing strip lights of the Albert Borschette conference centre, a drab building in the EU quarter of Brussels. It was like “negotiating in a 1970s car park”, a British official said. German government officials in their nearby embassy had enjoyed a running gag as they counted off the Brexit deadlines that had slipped past over the last year. But the joke had worn thin for British officials at the coalface. “I want to go home,” said one. “We were supposed to get a deal two weeks ago and I’m having to wash my underwear in the hotel room sink.” As Christmas Day drew closer, morale was sapping, frustration showing. The lack of trust between the sides heightened a sense that it all could go wrong even in the excruciating final hours. “My experience with the UK is that you have to be careful right to the last minute,” the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, privately warned. As told by diplomats, ministers and officials in Brussels, Westminster and across Europe’s capitals, this is the inside story of an extraordinary negotiation that slalomed precariously through a global pandemic, the infection of its two chiefs, a prime ministerial brush with death and Britain’s attempt to break international law. “But the ending was in the beginnings,” said one EU official.
For all the celebrations upon leaving the EU on 31 January, greeted in No 10 with a bong on an ornamental gong, Boris Johnson was allergic to much of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationship negotiated over the previous gruelling three years, government insiders recall. To the prime minister’s mind, it kept Britain chained to Brussels, not only through the agreements on citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland but in the outline for the trade and security deal. “The point of Brexit is to diverge,” Johnson told officials. Largely negotiated by Theresa May, the deal had been finalised in haste by the new prime minister as he sought to “get Brexit done”. But he would not leave the transition period on the terms as set out, Johnson would tell his team. Johnson’s chief negotiator, David Frost, was equally scathing of the settlement agreed by his predecessor under May, Olly Robbins. He intended to do things differently. “At the outset he said they would want us to end up in their orbit,” said a British official. “He was completely clear that a non-negotiated outcome was not a failure.” Speaking to an audience at the Université libre de Bruxelles on 17 February, Lord Frost made clear he wanted the UK to end the negotiations with “a huge advantage over the EU – the ability to set regulations for new sectors, the new ideas, and new conditions”. He instructed his team, given union jack lanyards for their access passes, to be “polite” but “robust”. “He gave us a four-box grid with different modes of negotiating: teenager, tank, mouse and leader,” said a British negotiator. “He said the EU tends toward the first two, and the UK is too often a mouse. We needed to be the leader in the room.” There was a “reckoning to come”, said a UK official – with one explosive confrontation to follow down the line.
The first act of repudiation of the previous years of Brexit prevarication was Johnson’s insistence that the UK would not extend the UK’s transitional membership of the single market and customs union beyond 2020. It set a deadline for diplomats on the other side of the Channel, who were working throughout February in Brussels’ Europa building. There would be no time for the EU to debate where tariffs might be selectively applied on British goods, as in Brussels’ deal with Canada, which allows for lighter-touch demands on maintaining environmental, social and labour standards. It would be “off the shelf”: zero tariffs. While the British government wanted to “unshackle”, the EU goal was to protect European businesses from being undercut and to ensure its fishing industry would not be suffocated through loss of access to British waters. Emmanuel Macron’s representative was in no rush – frustratingly so, to his peers. “He started off in style with what was to be a year-long habit of very long lectures on principles to everyone,” said an EU source. But Paris was not alone in wanting to keep the status quo on fish and tie the UK to future EU standards. “These were the two elements cranked up in [Barnier’s negotiating] mandate,” said an EU official. “And the evolution clause was one of the points they reintroduced.” The addition of the evolution clause, or ratchet clause as it was known in Downing Street, would compel the UK to not only maintain current EU standards but potentially develop equivalent regulations as Brussels upgraded its rulebook – a scenario No 10 wanted to avoid at all costs. It would dog the talks to the end.
Round one: no handshakes, no masks After the smiles for the cameras at the start of round one of the negotiations at the commission’s Berlaymont HQ in the Belgian capital – no handshakes between Barnier and Frost, but also no masks – it was clear that the British were not even content to uphold current EU rules. “It was a constructive and friendly atmosphere,” Paulina Dejmek-Hack, a senior member of Barnier’s team, reported to diplomats. “But the notion of common high standards in paragraph 77 in the political declaration has been drawn into question … They stressed sovereignty and taking back control constantly.” It was ominous – but a far darker cloud was gathering on the horizon. On Friday 13 March, as coronavirus spread across Europe, about 70 diplomats gathered in a room in the Europa for a “feverish” three-hour meeting to finalise the EU’s proposed legal text. “Everyone was looking at each other, people were coughing, everyone was freaking out,” said a source. “Why are we playing Russian roulette with our lives?” asked one diplomat. Within days, both Barnier and Frost had tested positive. A fortnight later, Johnson was in St Thomas’ hospital’s intensive care unit fighting for his life. “Brexit was suddenly irrelevant – an embarrassing manufactured problem,” recalled an EU official. Weeks of negotiating time were lost. The phone line to Brussels from the EU capitals went cold. Downing Street was in chaos. The talks were moved online, with all the familiar frustrations, not least for Barnier, 69, who struggled with turning on the camera or microphone. “‘Can you hear us?’ ‘Can you mute your mic?’ The documents wouldn’t share,” recalled one EU participant with a shudder. “You miss out on the body language. You get insight into officials’ bedrooms and their children who sometimes pop up. But you lose the ability to confer on your own side.” The backgrounds to the virtual negotiations on Webex, a conferencing platform, offered some comic relief. “One woman on our side sat in her kitchen with a bouquet of lilies on one side, a fuck-off set of knives on the other,” said an UK official. “It was perfect for her. The best room on their side was one guy’s blood red room with strange hats and a birdcage with what looked like a dead bird in it.” EU group chats initially full of serious negotiating steers were taken over by “very, very dark side remarks”. It seemed obvious to EU officials that the transition had to be extended. “We can’t be doing this in a year, this is mad,” one EU source said. “At that point we were stonewalling, which was easier done remotely,” said a British negotiator. “I turned the camera off.” Then a message was delivered by the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove: “I just want to inform you that we will not be extending the transition period.” By June, on a videoconference call between Johnson and the EU’s institutional leaders including the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the major problems were evident. Johnson displayed puckish enthusiasm. “Where’s my good friend Michel? Michel, are you there?” boomed the prime minister down the phone. “He got on with Barnier,” chuckled a source. But Barnier was insisting on “parallelism”. Without movement on fisheries and level playing field provisions such as the evolution clause, nothing else would budge.
A summer frost Relations between Frost and Barnier grew difficult. The British peer’s habit in the negotiating room of dismissing the EU as “your organisation”, as if it was a bowling club, grated with his French counterpart. “You ask for respect for your sovereignty, David, but please respect ours,” Barnier privately chided Frost. The claim from Downing Street was that Barnier had “lost control” of the fishing negotiations. In truth, he was playing a waiting game. In his gilded office in the Élsyée Palace, Macron told aides he could not contemplate French fishermen losing out to Brexit Britain before his 2022 presidential election battle with the far-right Marine Le Pen. “Can you imagine it?” asked a French official. “Incroyable.” But they would have to move. “We just hoped that they would know when,” said an official in Brussels. Other member states were not always sympathetic to Paris’s stubborn stance. “We don’t care about your fish – get on with it,” one eastern European ambassador told his French counterpart. During the conference call with the commission president, Johnson said it was time to put a “tiger in the tank”. Barnier took him at his word, making what he thought was a significant offer by keeping the European court of justice out of the trade and security deal.
On 7 July, the EU negotiating team arrived in London for renewed face-to-face talks in the basement of the business department, soon to be known as “the cave”. “They hated it,” said a British official. “We’re the UK and we are ready to trade with you,” screamed a large sign above the heads of the EU officials entering the subterranean rooms. Every wall was covered in union jack-plastered posters from the “GREAT Britain” promotional campaign. “Is this just for us?” asked one amused EU official. Barnier believed there was business to be done, but the British refused to move. Their response was “yeah, no, sovereignty, blah, blah,” said an EU source. “It was disappointing. A wasted summer.” The talks were in the doldrums. On 6 September, Johnson warned that the UK would walk away if a deal was not done by an EU leaders’ summit on 15 October.
A new low Worse was to come. That evening, a Financial Times story flashed up on the phones of the EU negotiating team. It was a leak of draft legislation that would undermine the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement by giving ministers power to overwrite clauses – and break international law in what a minister later described as a “specific and limited way”. “Barnier was amazed,” admitted one EU official. “What the fuck?” said one source when asked for the reaction of the wider EU team. Shock turned to red-hot anger. Barnier was due to go to London to start the next round of talks. Back in the cave in room C2, where the two chief negotiators would spend hours together over the weeks to come, he asked Frost whether he was serious. “Is this what you are doing? How can we continue? I have to go back to the member states who are all going to ask why we are continuing to negotiate?” An emergency meeting in Lancaster House of the joint committee – tasked with implementing the withdrawal agreement – was called for the following day by the EU’s senior representative, the commission’s Slovakian vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič. “It was the first time we had all 27 member states tuning in, and big Maroš just laid into Gove,” said one attender. The indignant fury of the Irish government’s representative in the room was crystal clear: it was absolutely unacceptable that London had gone ahead without informing Dublin, she told Gove. “It ruined the relationship – unforgivable,” said one official close to the talks. Within Frost’s own team there were serious reservations about the move, the details of which had been kept to a tight group at the top. But Brussels would carry on. “The civil servants on both sides smiled in an embarrassed way at each other and tried to ignore the arguing adults,” said an EU source. “We would continue with eyes wide open as to who we were dealing with.” On 19 September, the EU formally offered to ditch dynamic alignment on state aid rules forcing Britain to follow Brussels, but Downing Street felt the alternative offer of shared “high principles” with domestic enforcement was a backdoor to the same result. After Johnson and Von der Leyen spoke on 3 October, the commission president agreed to intensify talks. But the British soon felt they were empty words. Just three days a week were set aside for negotiations, and before a meeting of EU leaders on 15 October a draft summit communique was changed at the prompting of the Dutch and French to ditch a pledge to further intensification. Charles Michel, the European council president, was told it would put Barnier under needless pressure. Von der Leyen had to leave the summit after a member of her team contracted coronavirus. Barnier took her place in briefing the leaders. They applauded him. “He came out feeling good about it,” said a source. “What was noticeable was what wasn’t said: he was not given instructions. He had the flexibility to make a deal,” an EU official said. But as Barnier started to talk at an end-of-summit press conference, Frost tweeted that he was “surprised” at the EU’s ditching of the intensification pledge and the insistence that it was the UK that needed to budge. A strange way to negotiate, he said.
Downing Street drops a bomb: ‘Prepare for no deal’ The next day, Johnson said the UK should prepare for no deal. A No 10 spokesman went further: the talks were over. In a call with Barnier, Frost advised the Frenchman not to come to London on the following Monday as planned. “It was completely manufactured – they would have found any reason to do it,” said an EU official. “It was entirely for domestic consumption. They were always looking for an excuse if things went wrong.” On a shorter call on the Monday, Frost told Barnier he needed a credible figure to publicly recognise that the UK was a sovereign nation and that both sides needed to compromise. “I have been saying for two years now in two languages that I respect your sovereignty,” Barnier responded. Behind the scenes, new terms for intensive talks were drafted. Barnier would say the magic words in a speech to the European parliament. The talks were back on. “We did take it seriously. We didn’t know on Monday the speech would work,” an EU official said. “But when they came back and agreed, it was: right, OK, they want a deal.” A new round of negotiations was delayed by Barnier’s seven-day isolation after a member of his team contacted coronavirus. When he returned to Brussels on 28 November there followed a fruitful period. The two men would sit for hours in room C2, with their deputies at their side and note-takers behind. They spoke English, but Frost – a scholar of medieval French – would use his counterpart’s language from time to time. There was the constant hum of papers being photocopied and printed. In an attempt to break the deadlock, Frost proposed a review clause in the trade agreement. It would allow for a reflection point on the whole treaty years down the line, including whether a divergence in standards was distorting trade. Barnier, now working hand in glove with Von der Leyen’s deputy head of cabinet, Stephanie Riso, 44, did not reject it. But he knew it was unlikely to fly with the member states.
Oceans 11 Von der Leyen was applying pressure for a deal, but in a meeting with ambassadors on Friday 28 November, Barnier said there was a danger of allowing the British to “cherrypick”. It set off alarm bells – as Barnier knew it would. Stick to the mandate, Denmark’s ambassador to the EU, Jonas Bering Liisberg, told Barnier during a difficult early-morning meeting with the capitals’ representatives in Brussels four days later. There were “jitters” in Paris and elsewhere. Only ambassadors were allowed to attend, to prevent leaks. But news swiftly emerged of the discontent of 11 countries with the biggest trade ties to the UK, nicknamed the “Oceans 11”. Italy was upset over details of a new geographical indications regime that might not sufficiently protect its olive oil, parmesan cheese and Parma ham in the British marketplace. France feared that the EU would be held back from leading on climate change as it looked over the shoulder to British policymaking. The Dutch had concerns over the terms on aviation. Even Romania wanted to see the legal text on the UK’s approach to hauliers. Barnier returned to the cave “put on the straight and narrow”, said a diplomatic source. Late on Thursday evening, he took out a document which, to British eyes, jettisoned all the fruitful discussions about a review clause. The EU would have the right to apply lightning tariffs on British goods in the event of a divergence in standards. “It was basically dynamic alignment – completely against the momentum of the talks,” said an UK official. Frost went to Downing Street and a decision was made to suspend the talks – with a call later lined up between Von der Leyen and Johnson to clear the air. “They thought it was all going their way – perhaps felt they had missed their moment,” an EU source said.
‘Allons-y’: Von der Leyen takes control It was at this point, EU sources said, that Von der Leyen took command, with the encouragement of Angela Merkel. “Von der Leyen was driving this from the 13th floor of the Berlaymont from then on.” The calls between the respective sides’ leaders over the week – addressing each other as Boris and Ursula, rather than prime minister and president – were crucial to finding negotiating space for Frost and Barnier. “Johnson talked through his political problems with some of the EU demands, it was two seasoned politicians going through it and trying to find a fix,” said an EU source on the calls. “This was the Boris Johnson that Angela Merkel met when he first became prime minister – on the detail rather than talking in abstraction,” said a second. Johnson had constantly through the final weeks sought to get Paris and Berlin involved but they had insisted the talks had to go through the commission. Von der Leyen offered the prime minister a consolation dinner in the Berlaymont on a cold Brussels night on 9 December. Johnson and his team were met by Von der Leyen and Barnier as their convoy of cars swept up to the commission headquarters. As the prime minister emerged from his Mercedes, Von der Leyen ushered him in. “Allons-y,” she said – let’s go. Preparing for the official photographers, Johnson asked if they were taking off their masks for the cameras. “Yes,” Von der Leyen replied in English, but she added: “Keep distance. Then … you have to put it back on immediately.” “You run a tight ship here, Ursula,” Johnson told her, “and quite right too.”
The subsequent dinner – scallops followed by turbot and pavlova – went no better than the awkward start. Across the dinner table, Johnson and his team threw ideas at Von der Leyen and Riso accompanied by Jens Flosdorff, a former journalist and longtime aide to the commission president. The response was muted. Nothing came back, said a source. There was a brief moment in the corner of the room at the end of the three-hour dinner, where Johnson and Von der Leyen slipped away from their advisers. “A tête-à-tête – pretty intense,” said a source. Before returning to London on RAF Voyager, the prime minister joined his team for a drink in the library room at the British ambassador’s residence on Rue Ducale, a grand early 19th-century terraced house overlooking Brussels’ Parc Royal. “I kept throwing pennies in the well and no sounds came back,” Johnson said, cradling a glass of red wine. “It felt over – it is fucked,” said a source. “There was serious thinking going on then: is this it?” Johnson wanted another go. While he told broadcasters that a no-deal exit was now “very, very likely” during a visit to Blyth in Northumberland, Frost was preparing to table a fresh proposal on the evolution clause in Brussels on Saturday 12 December. It was not a new idea, but it was a fleshing out of a solution. Johnson had another call with Von der Leyen on Sunday. There was a crack of light. Von der Leyen said in a subsequent statement that a narrow pathway to a deal was visible.
“For the first time,” Barnier said in a behind-doors meeting of ambassadors on the following Monday, the UK government had “accepted a mechanism of unilateral measures”, such as tariffs, where there were “systemic divergences which distort trade and investment”. But Downing Street expected something back. “The UK says that because it has made a concession on the level playing field, that we should move on fisheries – but that is not how it works,” Barnier told the ambassadors. The UK side were incandescent. Frost started to wonder whether Barnier wanted a deal. “He was not being helpful – really there were doubts,” said a UK source. Barnier, in turn, would repeatedly accuse British officials of being “aggressive” around the table. For the UK side it was a matter of being “direct with no fluff”. “Things could get really punchy,” admitted one British negotiator. “But then times that were the most punchy were probably the least productive. Like in our table when we were arguing over whose fault it was that fish wasn’t moving. So if I did want to move things on or be the leader, I would step in: ‘Look, we can all fun insulting each other but let’s move on.’”
The final stretch Progress was being made, however. “When we finished our table we were in this huge room where we’d had some really horrible moments, accusing each other of breaches of trust and that sort of thing,” recalled a British negotiator. “Then at the end we couldn’t celebrate, we couldn’t shake hands, but no one wanted to leave the room. So we just sat there.” Von der Leyen took to the phones for the final push and instructed her senior aides to also liaise directly with the capitals of the big fishing member states, pushing Barnier aside.
There were constant calls with Johnson. It became a numbers game, splicing and dicing quotas of cod, herring, mackerel and tuna, and fixing a mechanism to reassure French, Belgian, Danish and Dutch fishermen over the future. On 22 December, Barnier said there was progress. When Denmark said the EU should not go beyond a “final offer” already rejected by Downing Street, he did not offer any words of support. France was tellingly shy of making the same demand. Germany’s ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, concluded the meeting: “I would like to wish you a merry Christmas but we might be back here tomorrow.” It took another day of intense talks on fishing arrangements, this time in the Berlaymont between Frost and Riso, against a backdrop of calls between Brussels, London, Paris and Berlin. But on Christmas Eve afternoon, Brexit was finally done."
2020-12-24T16:03:47Z,politics,Politics,UK and EU agree Brexit trade deal,"A historic deal on the UK’s future trading and security relationship with the European Union has been struck on Christmas Eve, a week before the end of the Brexit transition period, triggering a victory cry from Downing Street and sombre reflection in Brussels. As the country leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December, new arrangements allowing for tariff-free trade in goods and close police and judicial cooperation will come into force. The announcement followed a final call between Boris Johnson in Downing Street and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in her Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels – at least the fifth such call over the last 24 hours. The trade agreement – running to 2,000 pages – is unprecedented in scope, containing provisions on subjects ranging from civil nuclear cooperation and energy interconnections to fishing and aviation. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The deal is done. Everything that the British public was promised during the 2016 referendum and in the general election last year is delivered by this deal. “We have taken back control of our money, borders, laws, trade and our fishing waters. The deal is fantastic news for families and businesses in every part of the UK. We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved.” Johnson tweeted a picture of himself with both thumbs up.
Von der Leyen was more reflective in her comments at a press conference during which she referenced Shakespeare, the Beatles and TS Eliot. “It was a long and winding road, but we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair. It is a balanced deal. And it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides,” she said. “At the end of a successful negotiation I normally feel joy. But today I only feel quiet satisfaction and, frankly speaking, relief. “I know this is a difficult day for some and to our friends in the United Kingdom, I want to say parting is such sweet sorrow but, to use the line from TS Eliot, what we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is often a beginning. So, to all Europeans, I think it is time to leave Brexit behind.” The deal guarantees “zero tariff and zero quota” trade on goods that were worth £668bn in 2019. But it will also mean significant costs to businesses as exporters face a host of border checks from 1 January and freedom of movement in the EU will end for most UK nationals.
The Downing Street spokesperson said, however, that the agreement would guarantee that the UK was “no longer in the lunar pull of the EU, we are not bound by EU rules, there is no role for the European court of justice and all of our key red lines about returning sovereignty have been achieved.” They added: “It means that we will have full political and economic independence on 1 January 2021. A points-based immigration system will put us in full control of who enters the UK and free movement will end. “We have delivered this great deal for the entire United Kingdom in record time, and under extremely challenging conditions, which protects the integrity of our internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it. “We have got Brexit done and we can now take full advantage of the fantastic opportunities available to us as an independent trading nation, striking trade deals with other partners around the world.” The prime minister told his cabinet late on Wednesday night that the deal respected the sovereignty of both sides, as he urged senior figures to help him sell it. On Wednesday the Brexiter European Research Group of Conservative MPs said it would ask a self-styled “star chamber” of lawyers to scrutinise the terms before giving its support. The agreement avoids a no-deal exit that the Office for Budget Responsibility had warned would reduce Britain’s economic output by £40bn in 2021 and cost more than 300,000 jobs. The UK left the EU on 31 January but has benefited from continued membership of the single market and customs union over the last year, with British citizens retaining the right to freedom of movement around the bloc. The end of the transition period will bring widespread changes for British businesses and citizens, as a new chapter in the country’s relationship with its neighbours begins. Businesses will face extra paperwork and costs when trading with the UK’s biggest export market. Freedom of movement for most UK nationals will end, with restrictions imposed on stays in EU member states. As the UK will be a “third country” to the EU, coronavirus travel restrictions could be imposed on British nationals as of 1 January.
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was “a day of relief but tinged with some sadness”. He lamented the government’s decision not to be a partner in the Erasmus student exchange programme and the lack of cooperation on foreign policy and defence. In the final days it had been future EU access and quotas in British fishing waters – an issue of small economic impact but high political salience for both sides – that was the difference between a deal and a breakdown in talks. The compromise found involves a transition period of five and a half years to phase in the changes, with the UK accepting a 25% repatriation of quotas. But Downing Street has knocked back attempts by the EU to establish a mechanism under which changes to the quotas in the future could lead to tariffs on British exports. The issue had been key to No 10’s claims to have taken back control of British waters. The EU vessels that fish in the zone six to 12 nautical miles from the British coastline will be able to continue during the transition, but access will be negotiated on an annual basis after that. There is a three-month notice for closing access. Following the announcement of a deal, the European commission sent the draft treaty to the member states. Should the 27 capitals be content with the deal, ministers on the council of the EU will agree on provisional application of the agreement on 1 January. The European parliament declined to stage a vote of consent this year, given the lack of time for scrutiny. MEPs will have their say next month."

2020-12-24T14:54:49Z,politics,Politics,Fishing data mix-up delayed Brexit deal announcement,"Boris Johnson’s announcement of a post-Brexit trade and security deal was held up after a data mix-up in the final hours left the EU member states unsure how their fishing fleets would be affected. Sources on both sides of the negotiations said the hitch was the result of the European commission and UK government having different understandings of the actual catches in British seas. Downing Street agreed to terms that would see 25% of the catch by value of European fleets in UK waters “repatriated”. But translating the quota changes into tonnages proved difficult. The two sides were working with different datasets relating to annual catches of fish species, it is understood. Sources suggested that the commission’s numbers were inaccurate, and that EU officials had to scramble to keep the key states on side as the impact on their fishing industries became apparent. A planned Christmas Eve meeting of EU ambassadors to start the process of ratification of the trade and security deal, allowing it to come into force on 1 January, was cancelled on Thursday afternoon. A spokesman for the German government, the country currently holding the rolling presidency of the EU and responsible for organising its agenda, said: “We have just informed EU colleagues that due to the ongoing Brexit deal negotiations the EU council presidency will not convene an [ambassadors’] meeting today. At the same time we have asked EU ambassadors to be available during the Christmas period.” The commission and Downing Street declined to comment.
Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had been expected to hold early-morning press conferences on Thursday to unveil the 2,000-page legal text. The deal covers a huge range of issues from security to aviation, civil nuclear cooperation and energy. Most significantly it provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on goods. The prime minister told his cabinet on Wednesday night that the agreement respected the sovereignty of both sides, and called on senior members to go out and sell the deal. But, despite negotiators being locked in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters all night, there was significant work left for the technical experts to cover."
2020-12-24T14:18:34Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade deal 'disastrous' for Scottish seed potato farmers, says Sturgeon","Nicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of selling out farmers in Scotland after it emerged that seed potatoes are set not to be included in a post-Brexit trade deal. A letter from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the EU would allow almost all food and plant exports from Great Britain to continue from 1 January. However, seed potatoes will be banned. The Defra letter says: “Unfortunately the EU have confirmed they will not accept our case for a permanent change to the prohibition on seed potatoes … on the grounds that there is no agreement for GB to be dynamically aligned with EU rules.” Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters for the production of chips and crisps in the world, with the sector accounting for three-quarters of UK production and worth about £112m a year. Northern English farmers will also be particularly affected. Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, tweeted: “This is a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers … and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against our will.” James Withers, the chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: “There’s no dressing this up. This is bad news for Scottish seed potato exporters. One-fifth of our exports go to the EU, more than 20,000 tonnes a year. “It may be a smaller industry in a big trade deal, but tell that to the companies and farmers affected. This will feel to them about as far from a definition of free trade as is possible. There are still markets elsewhere and a roll-on deal for Egypt is good news.” Sales to Northern Ireland, which will operate under EU arrangements under the terms of last year’s withdrawal agreement, are also likely to cease. Iain Barbour, who manages JBA Seed Potatoes in Dumfries, described the outcome as “a massive disaster for everyone”. Pointing out that Scottish seed potatoes are a premium global product on a par with salmon or whisky, he added: “We’ve got so many people – potato trade bodies, Defra, MPs – supposed to be lokoing out for our interests but nobody has done.” Barbour, who has been selling seed potatoes to Northern Ireland and the EU for decades, said: “Nothing has changed in our potato rules so it doesn’t make sense to me how they can say we don’t align anymore.” Barbour said Scotland specialised in producing varieties such as Kerr’s Pink and British Queen, which suit Irish tastes. “We’ve seen demand for those double in the past month, because buyers knew there was a danger that they wouldn’t be able to get them after December 31st.” The Scottish National party’s shadow environment, food and rural affairs spokesperson, Deidre Brock, said: “If these reports are true, it would be a terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government – and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s booming farming industry. “It is clear that the Tories are selling Scotland’s farming and fishing industry out and planning a total betrayal of our rural communities – with a hard Brexit that will cause serious and lasting damage to exports, jobs, living standards, businesses and the economy.”"
2020-12-24T13:12:10Z,politics,Politics,"Alas, poor Boris: PM's go-to word for delivering bad news","It is the word the prime minister turns to when he is about to deliver bad news. And it’s become the signal for the rest of us to brace ourselves. Alas, it seems, is the word poor Boris knows all too well. And according to the team behind the BBC TV show QI, it has become a staple during parliamentary debate too – it was said more than 80 times in the House of Commons in November 2020, more than any other month since 1800. A now-unfashionable word, with its origins from Old French in the mid-13th century, “alas” was used by Shakespeare in one of his most famous and misquoted lines. In a graveyard, clutching the skull of the court jester, Hamlet declares: “Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio …” Then, as now, it is word commonly used to express sorrow, grief and concern, and there’s certainly been a lot of that this year. At his last Downing Street press briefing on 21 December, Boris Johnson used it for the umpteenth time. “As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, this virus, alas, can move all too swiftly from one nation to another …” Five days earlier, with coronavirus spreading rapidly across the nation and new tougher restrictions in the offing, the prime minister admitted “the overall situation is, alas, worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules”. In late November, Johnson told the nation that the tiering system wasn’t really working. “I should warn you now that many more places will be in higher tiers than, alas, was previously the case,” he said. Two weeks before that, on 9 November, “alas”, he said, the death figures were rising fast. And in his statement to the Commons at the beginning of the month, it was double portions. “When I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered, alas, to work on Covid wards … I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people.” Getting the R number down was essential to avoid “more hospital admissions and, alas, more fatalities”. These aren’t the only occasions the prime minister has used the word in recent weeks. And given the bleak news about the spread of the virus, they are unlikely to be the last. Alas."
2020-12-24T10:37:03Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson to claim victory in Brexit talks, leaked paper reveals","Boris Johnson will boast of a victory in the post-Brexit trade and security talks, claiming to have won 28 key battles compared with Brussels’ 11 triumphs while admitting to a fisheries compromise, according to a leaked government document. The paper, drafted as part of the UK government’s attempt to sell the deal to Brexiter MPs, suggests David Frost’s negotiators got their way on 43% of the major issues, compared with 17% for the EU’s Michel Barnier, with 40% of the treaty being a balanced compromise. Questions remain over the paper, in particular over its claims to have protected British-based car manufacturers. The UK claims a victory on so-called cumulation, which sets out whether manufactured goods containing parts made outside Britain can be exported to the EU without tariffs. The paper says that the UK won on this issue as they persuaded Brussels that EU materials and processing should to be counted as British input when the completed products are exported into the European market. A product would therefore only attract tariffs, under the agreement, if more than 40% of its pre-finished value was either not of British origin or from a non-EU country such as Japan. The reality, however, as Frost admitted in a letter to the car manufacturing industry in September, is that the UK was seeking a far more ambitious agreement. The UK wanted manufacturers to be able to in effect count products from countries with which both sides have a trade deal, such as Japan and Turkey, as being British input. Frost admitted in a letter on 6 September that “the [European] commission has made clear that it will not agree third-country cumulation in any circumstances, which we regret, but obviously cannot insist upon”. Despite the doubts over some of the “wins”, the document illustrates the scope and value of the trade deal to the British government and areas where Frost’s team did achieve their negotiating goals. One of the biggest sticking points in the talks was the EU insistence that Brussels should be able to apply tariffs if the two sides diverge in terms of environmental, social and labour standards in the future. While the landing zone was a mutual compromise, it bears a closer resemblance to the UK objective than that of Brussels. The British government had merely wanted a reflection point in the future where the two sides could discuss upgrading the basic minimum below which neither could go. The UK government document states: “The UK rejected the EU’s asks for an ‘equivalence’ mechanism, and instead secured a review and rebalancing clause which allows either side to initiate a formal review of the economic parts of the deal, including the level playing field provisions, and update the balance of the agreement over time. “Any short-term rebalancing measures are strictly limited and proportionate and subject to the approval of an independent arbitration panel.” On fisheries, the issue that dogged the talks right to the end, the UK document says there was a “mutual compromise”. Frost had said that the UK should retain the right to close off access to European fleets if an annual negotiation over quotas did not result in a mutually satisfactory conclusion. Brussels was demanding greater assurances for its fishing communities. The final deal provides for a transition period of five and a half years to allow new quotas to be phased during which European fleets will retain full access to waters, including the zone six to 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, an area the UK had wanted to retain exclusively for UK flagged vessels."
2020-12-24T07:00:07Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's Tory-linked peerages raise fresh claims of cronyism,"Almost a quarter of peerages awarded this year have been to Conservative party donors, close associates or former colleagues of Boris Johnson, according to analysis by the Guardian, which raises fresh concerns about cronyism. On Tuesday, in a highly unusual move, the prime minister announced he had given a peerage to the Tory donor Peter Cruddas, in defiance of advice from the House of Lords. Cruddas is one of 13 out of 54 people ennobled this year to have either funded the Conservatives or who have an employment or personal connection to Johnson, the Guardian has established. The list includes three donors, four people who worked at the Telegraph with Johnson and four who worked with him at City Hall when he was mayor of London. The prime minister’s brother Jo Johnson, who stood down from the cabinet and as an MP last year, was also made a peer this year, as was Boris Johnson’s friend Evgeny Lebedev. Johnson is reported to have attended at least four weekend parties at the Russian-born newspaper owner’s restored Perugia mansion. The Electoral Reform Society (ERS), which wants an elected second chamber, said the appointments gave the impression prime ministers were “able to appoint donors and allies on a whim – and in unlimited numbers”. This year’s peerages have taken the total size of the Lords to more than 830, despite a cross-party agreement three years ago that numbers should over time be reduced to 600. Willie Sullivan, a senior director at the ERS, said: “The Lords was already packed to the brim with donors and party loyalists, but this past year has seen a bad situation get even worse. “It would be tempting to call cronyism in the Lords an abuse of the system, but the system itself is fundamentally broken. This situation cannot go on. Public trust is at rock bottom.”
Cruddas resigned as Conservative co-treasurer in 2012 after the Sunday Times claimed he was offering access to the prime minister for up to £250,000. Cruddas was eventually awarded £50,000 in damages after a libel action although aspects of the allegations were upheld. As well as Cruddas, two more party donors and former party treasurers, Aamer Sarfraz and Michael Spencer, have been ennobled this year. Spencer’s personal investment company IPGL also donated £20,000 directly to Johnson’s leadership campaign. Charles Moore, who was reported to be the government’s choice to be the next chair of the BBC until he ruled himself out, and Dean Godson, the director of the Policy Exchange thinktank, both worked at the Spectator and the Telegraph with Johnson and received peerages this year. They were joined by two other ex-Telegraph colleagues, the former Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan and Veronica Wadley. Wadley was also a senior adviser to Johnson when he was mayor of London, having previously championed his candidacy and rubbished his incumbent opponent, Ken Livingstone, while she was editor of the Evening Standard. Lebedev replaced Wadley as editor when he bought the Standard in 2009 but the paper continued its full-throated support for Johnson in his 2012 re-election campaign, running an unusual front page editorial urging voters to back the “right choice for London”. Two of Johnson’s former deputy mayors from his City Hall days were made peers this year – Sir Edward Lister, recently appointed as Johnson’s interim chief of staff after Dominic Cummings’s departure, and Stephen Greenhalgh, who was directly appointed to the upper house to serve as a minister. The list of ennobled ex-City Hall colleagues is completed by Daniel Moylan, who was Johnson’s chief adviser on aviation and championed the failed “Boris island” Thames estuary airport plan. James Wharton, the former MP for Stockton South who was Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign manager, was made a peer in August. He was the subject of a political row last week over his qualifications to be the government’s preferred candidate for chair of the Office for Students, the independent watchdog charged with regulating universities. No 10 has been approached for comment."
2020-12-24T00:26:28Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade and security deal with EU within 'touching distance', says No 10","Boris Johnson is expected to sign off on an historic post-Brexit trade and security deal with the European Union in a telephone call with Ursula von der Leyen on Christmas eve, four and a half years after Britain chose to leave the bloc. A call is expected between the prime minister and the European commission’s president, ahead of press conferences on either side of the English channel. Negotiations were continuing over the fishing arrangements, one of the final sticking points in the talks. The agreement once announced will include unprecedented provisions for zero tariffs or quotas on all goods, as well as settle the future arrangements on a vast range of issues from aviation and transport to civil nuclear cooperation and energy. Just after 11pm on Wednesday night, the prime minister had briefed the cabinet telling them that he would need their help in selling the deal. The prime minister claimed the hard-fought agreement respected the sovereignty of both sides. The UK left the EU on 31 January, following the June 2016 referendum, but has remained in the bloc’s single market and customs union for a year-long transition period, temporarily allowing freedom of movement to continue and trade flows to remain frictionless. An EU commission spokesperson had tweeted just after at midnight GMT:
The path towards agreement had not been helped by claims from anonymous French officials that the UK had made “major concessions” on key issues around access for European fleets in British fishing waters in the final 48 hours – one of the major sticking points in the final two weeks of talks in Brussels. UK sources dismissed the claims from Paris but Downing Street faced immediate threats from the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiter backbenchers. One of the hold-ups was understood to be the prime minister’s desire to prepare the ground with key backbenchers before the announcement. Downing Street was making a series of calls to senior figures throughout the evening. In a joint statement, the chairman and vice-chairman of the group, Mark Francois and David Jones, said they would task a self-styled “star chamber” of lawyers to analyse the provisions of the treaty before deciding on whether to give their support. The statement said: “The ERG will tomorrow [Thursday] reconvene the panel of legal experts, chaired by Sir Bill Cash, to examine the details and legal text. The team of highly experienced lawyers previously known as the ‘star chamber’ was first assembled in 2019 to examine the legal aspects of Theresa May’s original withdrawal agreement.
“Given that the new agreement is also highly complex, the star chamber will scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the UK, after we exit the transition period at the end of this year. “The star chamber, which will include some new members to replace those now in government, will undertake its examination as expeditiously as possible, before providing its conclusions on the merits of the deal – which we will aim to make public before parliament reconvenes.” Johnson had been in contact with Von der Leyen at least four times on Wednesday, at the end of eight months of tortuous negotiations. The commission president was also engaged in furious telephone diplomacy with the EU capitals, as she sought to push the talks over the line. “David Frost is in Brussels working through the detailed legal text, line by line, and we hope we will be in a position to announce an agreement, but we’re not there yet,” said an UK source. “We need to make sure the devil is not in the detail.” With discussions continuing in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters, a pizza delivery arrived shortly after 10pm local time. The UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union in a week, with or without a deal on the new arrangements. EU ambassadors plan to meet to start the ratification process on Thursday morning. Sources in Brussels and London had confirmed earlier on Wednesday that they believed the talks were coming to a successful conclusion. A senior EU source told the Guardian: “The stars have aligned.” Diplomats representing the 27 EU member states have already started combing through the legal text. The Commons is likely to be recalled by Sunday should the deal be announced after troubled negotiations that had repeatedly looked set to fail. Only two weeks ago, the prime minister said a no deal outcome was “very, very likely”. A vote by the European parliament to give consent to a trade and security agreement with the UK is no longer possible, given the lack of time left before the end of the transition period. Should a deal emerge, the EU capitals will instead have to agree to “provisional application” of the deal on 1 January, with MEPs voting later in the month. The process can take up to a week, given the need for the treaty to be translated and scrutinised by the 27 governments. A meeting of ambassadors on Christmas Eve would be the first step towards the provisional application. Barnier has told MEPs that Christmas Day is the deadline in order for a deal to be in place by 1 January. Should agreement be found after that date, contingency measures would have to be agreed with Downing Street to bridge a short “no-deal” period.
The two sides have been at loggerheads over future EU access and quotas in British fishing waters, an issue of small economic impact but high political salience for both sides. Barnier said the EU had offered a six-year transition period for phasing in a 25% reduction in the catch by value taken by European fleet in British waters, with access guaranteed to a six to 12 nautical mile zone from the British coastline. Downing Street had tabled a counter-proposal of a three-year transition period with a 60% reduction – and no access to the nautical zone. Barnier said this issue would have to be settled by Von der Leyen and Johnson with the input of the concerned EU capitals. The compromise is likely to involve a transition period of five and a half years to phase in the changes, sources said, with the UK accepting a 25% repatriation of quotas. But Downing Street has knocked back attempts by the EU to establish a mechanism under which changes to the quotas in the future could lead to tariffs on British exports. The issue had been key to Downing Street’s claims to have taken back control of British waters. On the issue of the so-called evolution clause designed to avoid either side gaining a competitive advantage by failing to upgrade environmental, social and labour standards over time, Barnier had said on Tuesday that there was agreement. He explained that if either party felt trade was being distorted, they could take measures after consultation. An arbitrage panel would meet within 30 days and adjudicate. If the measures were later seen to have been deemed erroneous or excessive, the aggrieved party would be able to take compensatory measures."
2020-12-23T17:39:27Z,politics,Politics,"More data needed before giving just one vaccine dose, says Covid adviser","A senior scientific adviser has said more data is needed before the government can adopt a proposal to give as many people as possible a single dose of a Covid vaccine rather than preserving stocks so there is enough for a second jab. The former prime minister Tony Blair and Prof David Salisbury, a former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, backed the idea on Wednesday, saying second shots should be given only when more stock is available. While the suggestion would mean each vulnerable person who has received the vaccine would be afforded less protection, the number of people given at least some protection would double. But Prof Wendy Barclay, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told the Commons science and technology committee: “I think that the issue with that is that the vaccine is on the basis of being given two doses, and the efficacy is on that basis. To change at that point, one would have to see a lot more analysis coming out from perhaps the clinical trial data.” Barclay agreed with the suggestion of the Labour committee member Graham Stringer that any such change to the established vaccine policy was “too risky”. Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme earlier that the proposal to spread the doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already in the government’s possession more widely and thinly should be considered because “the reality is we are now in severe lockdown until vaccination”.
He said the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is expected to be approved this month and is easier to store and transport, could then be used in the same way once it becomes available. “Does the first dose give you substantial immunity – and by that I mean over 50% effectiveness? If it does, there is a very strong case for not, as it were, holding back doses of the vaccine,” Blair said. “If in January AstraZeneca is delivering you 10m or 20m doses of the vaccine, you vaccinate 10 or 20 million people, because then you should get more vaccine coming on stream by the time you are ready for the second dose and that first dose can give you substantial immunity.” The former prime minister also criticised the “somewhat inflexible ‘by age’ structure” used to determine who receives the jab. Experts at the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation have drawn up a priority list based on clinical need, but Blair, who does not have a medical background, said: “There is a strong case for saying you have got to focus also on the people spreading the disease, not simply the most vulnerable.” Salisbury told the Guardian: “In the circumstances we currently face, I think the best use of the vaccine stocks is to give the first dose to as many high-risk people as possible. And after that, you then give second doses.” He said the New England Journal of Medicine study had reported the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to have 91% efficacy, compared with 95% for two doses. That level of protection, he said, was justification for administering only one dose to a larger group at first, followed by the second when possible. While the study showed 52% efficacy in the period between the first and second doses, Salisbury explained that each dose only begins to take effect after several days. Therefore, he interpreted data from the period immediately after the second dose as indicative of the possible efficacy of the first.
The study’s authors noted, however, that it was not “designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen”. Prof Stephen Evans, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said a briefing document produced by the US Food and Drug Administration was a “more reliable source”. He said: “What is clear is that there is evidence of efficacy in the short term and it seems likely that the efficacy will not decline notably. This efficacy is clearly nearer 80% than 90% and could be quite a bit lower, but is still good.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our brilliant NHS has vaccinated more than half a million people against Covid-19 using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Over the coming weeks and months, the rate of vaccinations will increase as more doses become available and the programme continues to expand.”"
2020-12-23T16:16:36Z,politics,Politics,Scrutiny slippage? Johnson's own MPs blench at lack of vote on tier 4 Covid rules,"In the latest of a series of sanguine predictions in recent months, Boris Johnson told the nation this week it could look forward to a “very, very, different world” by Easter thanks to the arrival of a Covid-19 vaccine. But, for the millions of people plunged into tier 4 restrictions last Sunday, and with other areas to be included at that level from Boxing Day, that will seem a long way off. To appease Tory backbencher anger about the lack of parliamentary scrutiny on restrictions, the government, in September, committed to giving MPs a vote to approve coronavirus rules before they came into force. But, crucially, there was a caveat giving Downing Street some wriggle room. “I can confirm to the house that for significant national measures with effect in the whole of England, or UK-wide, we will consult parliament,” Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told MPs at the time, adding: “Wherever possible we will hold votes before such regulations come into force. But, of course, responding to the virus means that the government must act with speed when required and we cannot hold up urgent regulations which are needed to control the virus and save lives.”
With parliament rising for recess last Thursday and MPs not due to return until the first week of January – unless recalled to ratify a Brexit deal – there has been no such vote yet to approve tier 4 measures. Some Tory MPs – many of whom have voted against restrictions in recent months, including more than 50 who rebelled on 1 December to inflict Johnson’s worst Commons revolt – are not happy. William Wragg, a member of the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs, wrote for Conservative Home on Monday, saying: “The plain fact is this. Parliament debated and voted on the original rules that were to be in place to govern Christmas, along with the revamped tier system. “Parliament should do the same for these new rules and additional tier. This should be welcomed by all, regardless of how they might vote, because it will carry greater legitimacy among the public who sent us to Westminster to be their representatives.” Two days earlier, Mark Harper, the chair of the CRG, tweeted: “Given [that] the 3 tier system and the initial Christmas household rules were expressly authorised by the House of Commons, these changes must also be put to a vote in the Commons at the earliest opportunity, even if that means a recall of the House.”
Though some Tories have aired grievances over the latest changes, there is arguably a sense, perhaps reflecting concern over the new Covid variant, that the response so far has been relatively muted. That could soon change. The tier 4 restrictions were made law on Sunday via a statutory instrument (SI), a piece of secondary legislation used to amend an existing act. The legislation was laid before parliament on Monday. The SI must be approved by parliament within 28 sitting days. Labour would be unlikely to oppose the measures, but the move sets up another showdown between Johnson and his own MPs. Separately, ahead of the tiered measures being introduced on 2 December, Johnson committed to giving MPs a “sunset” clause for 3 February so they would have a vote on whether the measures would remain in place beyond that date and until the end of March. While some observers may question Johnson’s buoyant predictions about when the UK might overcome the pandemic, one thing is for sure – there is yet more trouble on the horizon for the prime minister in parliament."
2020-12-23T15:33:12Z,politics,Politics,Liz Truss and Foreign Office split over policy on China and Uighurs,"A behind-the-scenes struggle over UK policy towards China has begun, with Liz Truss, the trade secretary, backing plans, opposed by the Foreign Office, to give the British courts a role in determining whether genocide is happening in Xinjiang province. MPs are due to vote in the new year on the Lords’ all-party amendment to the trade bill, which would give the courts a preliminary role in determining whether a genocide is being committed by a country with whom the UK might sign a trade deal. The Foreign Office (FCDO) is opposed to giving UK courts preliminary power to determine whether genocide is occurring in Xinjiang, or elsewhere, saying this decision rests with competent international courts rather than national governments. But it is claimed Truss is content to back the measure. The Foreign Office is due to present a new cross-government approach to China in the new year. It is focusing on setting stricter obligations on firms trading in Xinjiang to ensure their supply chains do not involve slavery. China has denied repeated claims that Uighur Muslims have been held in detention or re-education camps. Nigel Adams, a Foreign Office minister, told MPs he feared an “asset flight” if ministers rushed to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for their role in the detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Adams warned of a risk to the British economy from moving towards individual human rights sanctions against Chinese officials. He said sanctions had to be developed in a responsible way, adding: ‘“It is not right to speculate or rush into the measures. There is a pretty good chance you are going to see asset flight if that is the case.” The minister warned MPs there would be consequences if British firms used forced labour, and promised a cross-government response in the new year. Ministers are looking at civilian fines for companies that do not show due diligence and a corporate duty to prevent human rights abuses. There was “credible, troubling and growing evidence” of forced labour taking place on a significant scale in Xinjiang, said Adams. The province provides more than 20% of the world’s cotton. With two Commons select committees, the foreign affairs select committee and the business select committee, looking into allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law in Xinjiang, British fashion chains are moving to clear up their supply chains. Adams said: “All businesses involved in investing in Xinjiang or with parts of their supply chains in Xinjiang should conduct appropriate due diligence to satisfy themselves that their activities do not support, or risk being seen to support, any human rights violations or abuses.” The Lords’ cross-party amendment, tabled by the Labour peer Lady Kennedy, the former Tory cabinet minister Lord Forsyth and the crossbencher Lord Alton, proposed that the high court should have the power to determine whether the evidential hurdle of genocide is met. It would be for the government to decide if such a ruling required it to withdraw from a prospective trade agreement. The measure is being supported by the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith. Minsters said in September they would update the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in the new year to possibly include the introduction of civil penalties for companies’ non-compliance, including lack of due diligence. Work on the duties required of businesses, especially the fashion industry, to clean up their supply chains, has not been completed, but ministers insisted they had recognised that the law was too weak and seen as a box-ticking exercise by many firms. As it prepares a broader policy on China, the government is also waiting to see whether the Biden administration in the US will drop the aggressive anti-China rhetoric and economic measures of the Trump government. Jake Sullivan, expected to be the new US president’s national security adviser, has already asked the EU not to go ahead with a planned EU-China investment agreement without first consulting the US. In a tweet, he urged “early consultation with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices”. The EU external affairs commissioner, Josep Borrell, had said an agreement was likely to be made by the end of 2020, but many critical of China regard any such deal as a setback for those wanting labour rights to be part of the EU trading relationship. A Department for International Trade (DIT) spokesperson said: “These reports are untrue. DIT and the FCDO are completely aligned on our policy towards China.”"
2020-12-23T14:20:13Z,politics,Politics,'No excuses': Nicola Sturgeon apologises for breaching Covid rules,"Nicola Sturgeon has said there are “no excuses” for her breach of Covid rules after she removed her face mask at a wake. Scotland’s first minister was photographed standing up without her face covering as she spoke to three members of the public while attending the event at a bar and restaurant in Edinburgh last Friday. Regulations state that customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated, including when they are entering, exiting or moving around, and any breach is punishable by a fixed penalty notice of £60. Making the apology ahead of the final session of first minister’s questions for 2020, Sturgeon said: “I took my face mask off while briefly attending a funeral purvey last week. I’m sure everyone will have seen in the media this morning a picture of me without it. I want to be clear today that regardless of the circumstances, I was in the wrong. There are no excuses. These rules do apply to me, just as they do to everyone else and the rules really matter.” Sturgeon told MSPs: “I am kicking myself very hard, possibly harder than my worst critic ever could. But more importantly, I’ll be making sure I do not drop my guard again.” The response to Sturgeon’s infraction has been muted and in some cases sympathetic, while the matter was not raised again by opposition leaders during the Holyrood session. Ged Killen, the former Labour MP for Margaret Ferrier’s Rutherglen constituency, tweeted: “I doubt many people have followed the rules more closely than Nicola Sturgeon. I’m much less upset about this than I am about the fact Margaret Ferrier remains a member of the SNP. Every day she is an MP is an insult to the people she is supposed to represent.” Last month, the Guardian reported that Ferrier’s constituents felt frustrated by their MP’s continued refusal to step down after she travelled by train from London to Scotland following a positive Covid test result. Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, who has advised the Scottish and UK governments on compliance with coronavirus guidelines, said he did not believe that Sturgeon’s error would have an impact on public behaviour. “The literature on ‘scandals’ suggests that very often it is not the original act that is the problem but the subsequent reaction: [Dominic] Cummings justifying his actions, Kay Burley making up stories. On this, Sturgeon has immediately come clean and admitted the error. She hasn’t tried to diminish it.” Earlier on Wednesday, Scotland’s national clinical director, Jason Leitch, told BBC Radio Scotland Sturgeon’s mask was off because she was leaving the venue, and that she was then called back but did not put it back on. He described her as “absolutely mad at this little lapse in concentration”. Leitch said: “She was leaving a funeral of a colleague of ours – a wonderful, wonderful individual who did a huge amount of work during the pandemic. It was an awfully sad day for many of us in the government who knew him and his family well. It just reinforces again to all of us the nature of these instructions and this virus.”"
2020-12-22T23:06:53Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon apologises for Covid rule breach at funeral,"Nicola Sturgeon has apologised for breaching Covid rules after she was photographed without a face covering at a wake. The Scottish Sun published a picture of Scotland’s first minister standing talking to three people at a social distance, but with her face uncovered, while she was attending a wake after the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Sturgeon had been wearing a tartan mask and is believed to have taken it off briefly as she was leaving the venue. Sturgeon told the Sun: “Last Friday, while attending a funeral wake, I had my mask off briefly. This was a stupid mistake and I’m really sorry. “I talk every day about the importance of masks, so I’m not going to offer any excuses. I was in the wrong, I’m kicking myself and I’m sorry.” The mandatory use of face masks for customers in hospitality settings has been law since 14 September. Customers in hospitality venues must wear a face covering except when seated – including when they are entering, exiting and moving around a venue. Anyone breaching the rule may be liable for a fine of £60 in Scotland. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: “The first minister should know better. By forgetting the rules and failing to set a proper example, she’s undermining essential public health messaging. “It’s a blunder that an ordinary member of the public wouldn’t get away with. There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else.”"
2020-12-22T19:45:20Z,politics,Politics,Von der Leyen takes control of Brexit talks in attempt to strike deal,"Ursula von der Leyen took personal control of Brexit negotiations in an attempt to strike a deal before Christmas as talks went to the wire over tens of millions of pounds worth of fish. The European commission president is understood to be in constant contact through a series of unscheduled phone calls with Boris Johnson and the EU capitals as she battles to find a compromise. Speaking to EU ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was progress but that he had rejected the latest offer from the prime minister’s chief negotiator, David Frost.
The EU has said it is willing to lose 25% by value of the fish its fleets catch in UK waters. The UK has proposed the repatriation of 35% – a potential difference of €63.8m (£58.1m). However, Barnier said the British offer did not include pelagic fish such as anchovies, tuna and mackerel, meaning the loss of annual income would be closer to €230m a year. The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility warned last month that failing to secure a trade and security deal after nine months of talks would cost 300,000 jobs next year and cut 2% off GDP, equivalent to £40bn a year. Barnier said there was “political willing on both sides to get this over the line”, adding that “some things now have to go higher up”, according to one source in the room. Von der Leyen has encouraged the big fishing nations to move closer to the British offer. France and Denmark are understood to be the most cautious about making a counter-proposal. The Danish ambassador told Barnier that the EU should stick with its final offer. The EU negotiator did not respond. France’s representative highlighted the political sensitivity of the issue for its coastal communities. Von der Leyen spoke by telephone to Johnson on Monday night to discuss a way forward and further calls are expected in the next 24 hours, but the commission refused to offer details. Barnier said as he went into a meeting with EU ambassadors: “We are really in the crucial moment. We are giving it the final push. In 10 days the UK will leave the single market and we continue to work in total transparency with the member states right now and with the parliament.” A senior EU diplomat said a deal was within reach. “Progress has been made,” they said. “Most issues are preliminarily closed or close to being agreed. However, differences on fisheries remain difficult to bridge. Unfortunately the UK is not moving enough yet to clinch a fair deal on fisheries. “EU negotiators are in a last push now to make progress and to clinch a deal acceptable for both sides. The EU will not close its door to the UK and remains ready to negotiate even beyond 1 January.”
Johnson has suggested a five-year phase-in period for the new arrangements – up from his initial offer of three years – with a compromise also likely on the application of tariffs or export bans on goods where fishing access changes after the phase-in period. The EU wants at least six years of transition. Under the UK proposals, where the quota share is reduced in the future, an independent arbitration panel will deduce the cost and allow either side to levy tariffs on goods or seek compensation. According to sources briefed on the terms, there will also be a termination clause should the reduction in access be judged to be egregious, opening up a fresh negotiation on all aspects of the trade deal. UK sources declined to comment. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said Brexiters were comfortable with a lengthy transition period to allow the UK fishing industry to build up capacity. But he said there should be no right for the EU to apply tariffs if the UK cut access to the European fleet in future. He said: “The crucial issue is that the UK takes back control fully. After a transition the UK needs to be an independent coastal state in control of 100% of its fishing waters. “Any idea that there would be a post-transition review would be utterly unacceptable. That would make a mockery of the slogan ‘take back control’. It would be instead another renegotiation.” With the European parliament saying it is now too late for it to hold a vote of consent on any deal, the EU member states would probably seek to “provisionally apply” the deal on 1 January, with MEPs voting later in the month. But this process also takes a number of days given the need for legal scrubbing, translation and scrutiny by the governments. Should the talks go beyond 23 December, there may be an unavoidable period after 1 January where there is a no-deal outcome. Contingency measures could be negotiated to avoid the worst impacts but it would leave exporting businesses, ports and security services in a legal limbo."
2020-12-22T17:30:33Z,politics,Politics,Is Liz Truss really the best person to target inequality?,"In view of Liz Truss’s ill-informed speech (Liz Truss’s record of picking white, male trade advisers criticised, 17 December), I look forward to the government (1) finally enacting section 1 of Labour’s Equality Act 2010 – “the socio-economic equality duty” – which is aimed at the very inequality she purports to care about; and (2) introducing an anti-poverty strategy to combat the poverty that Tory policies since 2010 (and previously) have caused and exacerbated, highlighted by Owen Jones (The Tories created the very class inequality they pretend to rail against, 18 December). To be effective, such a strategy must address the intersecting inequalities of gender, race and disability that shape poverty’s impact and incidence. Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords • It seems to me that Liz Truss may have made more than one mistake in her speech about equality. The first is that by appointing a majority of white men, she will miss opportunities to gain from a greater diversity of experience and views. Rather than ignoring “unrepresentative voices”, she is now only able to hear the voices of the overrepresented. Her second error is, therefore, that she perpetuates the exclusion of certain groups from positions of power (for example, women and members of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities), voices that for too long have not been represented, heard and listened to. I suggest that her mistakes signal errors of judgment and a lack of regard for social justice. Prof Simon Gibbs Newcastle University • “Equalities minister” Liz Truss has misgivings about her state education in Leeds, claiming: “While we were taught about racism and sexism, there was too little time spent making sure everyone could read and write.” My understanding is that Ms Truss’s comprehensive school enabled her to gain a place at Oxford, so the evidence suggests her literacy did not suffer unduly. I’m not convinced the racism and sexism lessons worked, though. Chris Barnham London"
2020-12-22T17:05:02Z,politics,Politics,PM rejects official advice in awarding peerage to Peter Cruddas,"Boris Johnson has been accused of cronyism after he gave a peerage to a former Conservative party co-treasurer in defiance of advice from the Lords Appointments Commission. Peter Cruddas, a businessman, philanthropist and Tory donor, was one of 16 people on a list of newly created political peerages – seven Conservative, five Labour, and four crossbench. In a highly unusual move, Downing Street published the list alongside an open letter from Johnson to Paul Bew, the chair of the commission, explaining why he was putting Cruddas in the upper house without its approval. Cruddas resigned as Conservative co-treasurer in 2012 after the Sunday Times claimed he was offering access to the prime minister for up to £250,000. A year later Cruddas won £180,000 in damages in a libel action, although that was subsequently reduced to £50,000 after aspects of the original allegations were upheld when the paper appealed. Announcing the full list of new political peers, Downing Street said: “The Lord Appointments Commission has completed its vetting in respect of all nominees. The commission advised the prime minister that it could not support one nominee: Peter Cruddas. “The prime minister has considered the commission’s advice and wider factors and concluded that, exceptionally, the nomination should proceed.” In his letter to Lord Bew defending his decision, Johnson said the allegations against Cruddas were from eight years ago and that there had been no other “matters of concern” before or since. The prime minister said “the most serious accusations levelled at the time were found to be untrue and libellous” and that an internal Conservative party investigation “found there had been no intentional wrongdoing”. Johnson added: “Mr Cruddas has made outstanding contributions in the charitable sector and in business and has continued his long track record of committed political service. His charitable foundation, which supports disadvantaged young people, has pledged over £16m to good causes through over 200 charities and he is a longstanding supporter of both the Prince’s Trust and the Duke of Edinburgh award.” The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, said: “After months of revelations about the cronyism at the heart of this government, it’s somehow appropriate the prime minister has chosen to end the year with a peerage to Peter Cruddas. It’s never been more clear: there is one rule for the Conservatives and their chums, another for the rest of the country.” The appointment came only a month after Johnson essentially ignored the findings of another Whitehall standards regulator when he decided to keep Priti Patel as home secretary despite Alex Allan, his adviser on ministerial standards, concluding she had engaged in behaviour that could be seen as bullying. Allan resigned instead. Earlier in the year, Johnson was also accused of cronyism when he defended his then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, after Cummings took his family out of London in what was widely seen as a breach of lockdown rules. In a critical response to the announcement, Norman Fowler, the Lord Speaker, said Johnson had created 52 new peers this year – taking the total size of the Lords to more than 830 – despite a cross-party agreement three years ago that numbers should over time be reduced to 600. Fowler suggested this “massive U-turn” would anger the public.
The other six new Tory peers are: the former MP and minister Sir Richard Benyon; the former MEPs Daniel Hannan, Syed Kamall and Dame Jacqueline Foster; Stephanie Fraser, the chief executive of Cerebral Palsy Scotland, and Dean Godson, the director of the Policy Exchange thinktank. Hannan and Godson are former colleagues of Johnson’s from the Daily Telegraph. When they arrive in the Lords they will join Charles Moore, the paper’s former editor, and Veronica Wadley, a former Telegraph executive, who were also made peers earlier this year. The five new Labour peers are: the former MPs Jennifer Chapman (now Keir Starmer’s political secretary), Gillian Merron (now the chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews) and Vernon Coaker; the former MEP Wajid Khan, and Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council. And the four new crossbench peers are: the Rt Rev John Sentamu, the former archbishop of York; Sir Simon McDonald, the former head of the Foreign Office; Sir Terence Etherton, master of the rolls, and Sir Andrew Parker, the former head of MI5."
2020-12-22T12:40:13Z,politics,Politics,Local politicians row over renaming of  Severn Bridge,"What’s in a name? Those disputing whether the Severn Bridge connecting England and Wales should be named after Aneurin Bevan or the Queen would argue – a great deal. A row has broken out between Welsh residents and politicians and councillors in South Gloucestershire after the latter voted to rename the mile-long steel bridge across the Severn to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee in 2022, after she opened the bridge in 1966. The Conservative councillor for Severn Vale, Matthew Riddle, claimed that the issue was “purely a matter for the English” because the bridge, which links England and Wales via the M48, landed in England on both sides of the estuary. However, those on the other side of the Welsh border disagree and say that if there is a change then the bridge should be named after Aneurin Bevan, who led the establishment of the NHS, or rugby hero Sir Gareth Edwards. One Welsh councillor said it would be “a huge injustice” to not consult the Welsh people on its renaming. Riddle proposed the motion and councillors voted to write to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, about the issue. While Riddle’s motion did not contain a specific name for the bridge his preference was the Queen Elizabeth Severn Bridge. He told BBC Radio Bristol: “I believe that she’s carried out her duties in an exemplary way. [The bridge] was designed and built at the beginning of her reign.” Noting that the bridge hits land in England on either side of the Severn estuary, before moving across the Wye river into Wales, he added: “I believe the naming of the Severn Bridge is purely a matter for the English, and not the Welsh Assembly or any Welsh county council. It is a fact that the Severn Bridge only connects England to England.” The crossing is made up of several constituent parts, including the Wye Bridge, but the crossing is managed and maintained as one unit, and Highways England refers to it as the Severn Bridge. Armand Watts, a Labour councillor in Monmouthshire who represents a Chepstow ward on the Severn Bridge’s western side, said it would be “a huge injustice” to not consult the Welsh people on its renaming. He said that if it is renamed, it should be done so after NHS founder Aneurin Bevan. “It’s unclear if South Gloucestershire council realise there is already a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth II at Dartford,” Watts said. “What’s clear is South Gloucestershire county council haven’t carried out any cost-benefit analysis. A lot of public money was spent on renaming the Second Severn Crossing and people still call it the second Severn crossing.” Andy Trotter, chairman of Oxleas NHS Trust and a former chief constable of British Transport Police, suggested that the bridge should be renamed after rugby player Sir Gareth Edwards. The Welsh rugby union football player led the Welsh national team that dominated European play from the mid-1960s through the 70s. Riddle said that he hoped that Highways England would begin looking into the cost of the project."
2020-12-21T20:12:12Z,politics,Politics,No 10 fishing offer to EU raises hopes of Brexit deal before Christmas,"Downing Street has made a major counter-offer on fishing access for EU fleets in British waters to break the Brexit trade talks deadlock, raising hopes of a deal before Christmas. After a difficult period of negotiations, with both sides seemingly entrenched, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is understood to have tabled a proposal that could unlock the troubled talks. According to EU sources, the British demand for a 60% reduction in the catch by value in British waters had been reduced to 35%, far closer to the 25% reduction that Frost’s EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, had said he would be prepared to accept. Boris Johnson has also accepted a five-year phase-in period for the new arrangements, with a compromise also likely on the application of tariffs or export bans on goods where fishing access changes after the phase-in period, it is understood. Where the quota share is reduced, an independent arbitration panel will deduce the cost and allow either side to levy tariffs on goods. According to sources briefed on the terms, there will also be a termination clause should the reduction in access be judged to be egregious, opening up a fresh negotiation on all aspects of the trade deal. UK sources declined to comment. Diplomats from the major fishing member states were sceptical on Monday evening that the offer would be acceptable in full. “Paris is key,” said one senior diplomat. “It is not enough – but it may be enough to unlock things.” On Monday, France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said France would be vigilant about the UK’s proposals, with concerns in Paris that the UK has not done enough on the other key sticking point of committing to a “level playing field” in a trade in goods. “There have been successive proposals from the UK, sometimes on fishing, that don’t respond to European priorities and demands,” Beaune said. “Difficulties remain, in the fishing sector, but not only, so it would be an error of judgment and unacceptable stigmatisation to say that a few countries or a few sectors are blocking.” The development came as Downing Street rejected calls from some Conservative MPs and the mayor of London to consider extending Brexit talks beyond the new year, saying any trade deal had to be in place and approved before 31 December. Johnson’s spokesman also dismissed the idea of allowing MPs to ratify a trade deal retrospectively as time was too short, saying the Commons would have a vote on any agreement before it came into force. Some Conservative MPs argued on Monday that with the UK still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and freight already disrupted by a halt imposed by France due to the spread of a fast-transmitting variant of Covid, leaving without a trade deal on 1 January should be avoided. Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister, tweeted: “Let Brexit trade talks continue. These are far from ideal conditions to rationally determine our future prosperity and security terms. If there’s no deal by new year let’s do what’s best for the UK and pause the clock.” Simon Hoare, the North Dorset MP, tweeted that it was “time for maturity”, saying: “There’s no parly time to scrutinise and agree a deal, and daily clarity of the dangers to our already pressured economy of no deal is alarming.” In a statement, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the idea of leaving the EU without a trade deal “was reckless even before the latest surge in Covid cases” and should not be allowed to happen. However, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, declined on Monday to back a possible extension, saying only that he wanted Johnson to deliver a deal this week. Asked following a speech on devolution if he agreed with the calls, Starmer said: “I don’t want an extension. I want the deal. The prime minister said he had an oven ready deal … I say to the prime minister, ‘Get on and deliver the deal you promised.’” Speaking after his first major policy speech on the union, in which he pledged to “make devolution a reality” under a Labour government, Starmer added: “It would be far better for the government to get the deal over the line today, tomorrow or some time this week.” Johnson will face fury from Brexit-minded backbenchers if he does agree to any delay. His spokesman said this would not happen. “Our position on the transition period is clear. It will end on 31 December. That remains our position,” he said. “We obviously need to ratify any agreement ahead of 1 January, which means that time is in short supply.” The spokesman ruled out the idea of retrospective parliamentary approval: “We’ve said before that we will need to ratify any agreement ahead of 1 January. The leader of the house made it clear that we would recall parliament in order to give MPs a vote on the necessary legislation.”"
2020-12-21T19:23:54Z,politics,Politics,Calls for national lockdown in England to curb spread of new Covid strain,"Boris Johnson is facing intense pressure to impose another national lockdown within days, as more than 40 countries banned arrivals from the UK in an effort to keep out a new fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. Government scientific advisers warned that inaction could cost tens of thousands of lives and risk an “economic, human and social disaster”, with the new strain spreading across the UK and overseas. Ministers urged people to avoid panic-buying food as France failed to lift its ban on freight and passengers from the UK on Monday despite a personal appeal from the prime minister, who asked Emmanuel Macron to put aside his “anxiety” over the new strain of Covid-19. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Johnson strove to reassure other world leaders that Britain had responded swiftly. “I hope that everybody can see that as soon as we were briefed as a government of the fast transmissibility of this new strain … we lodged all the necessary information with the World Health Organization. And we took prompt and decisive action the very next day to curb the spread of the variant within the UK,” he said. Johnson said delays to cross-Channel freight affected a small proportion of food entering the UK. “As British supermarkets have said, their supply chains are strong and robust, so everyone can continue to shop normally,” he said. Even so, some shoppers reported queues and empty shelves in supermarkets. Downing Street insisted the measures imposed at the weekend, which placed London and areas in the south and east of England in a lockdown-like tier 4 but left people elsewhere still able to mix on Christmas Day, could control the spread of the variant. But the message from health officials and scientists was very different. In a joint statement, Greater Manchester’s directors of public health said anyone arriving in the region from a tier 4 area or from Wales, which is also in effect in lockdown, should self-isolate for at least 10 days. Cases of the Covid mutation, which is thought to spread between people with up to 70% greater efficiency, have been detected across the UK, and Johnson’s chief scientific adviser said stronger curbs were likely. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference alongside the prime minister, Sir Patrick Vallance said the new strain was “everywhere” and cases would rise after “inevitable mixing” at Christmas.
“The lesson I think you have to learn about this virus … is that it’s important to get ahead of it in terms of actions,” Vallance said. “I think it is likely that this will grow in numbers of the variant across the country, and I think it’s likely therefore that measures will need to be increased in some places in due course, not reduced.” Since news emerged at the weekend about the rapid spread of the new variant across parts of England, at least 42 countries have banned all flights from the UK or said that only their nationals may be allowed in following a negative coronavirus test. They include: Belgium, Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, South Africa, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Croatia, France, Malta, Sweden, Turkey, Hong Kong, Canada, India, Russia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, El Salvador, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Colombia, Morocco, Chile, Finland and Argentina. In a briefing on Monday, scientists said they had examined additional data and now had “high confidence” that the new strain had a transmission advantage over other virus variants circulating in the UK. “We still don’t understand the exact biological mechanisms,” said Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Oxford University who chairs the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). “So there’s still a lot of uncertainty about exactly how it’s occurring, and exactly the extent of the extra transmissibility.” Other scientists said the variant was unlikely to be largely contained to south and east of England, and noted that the UK was heading towards the first-wave peak of hospital admissions and deaths, to accompany the added toll of winter on the NHS. A further 33,364 people were reported to have tested positive UK-wide on Monday and 215 people died. As Johnson confirmed that more than 500,000 people had received the first dose of the only approved Covid vaccine, scientists said harsher measures now could save the lives of those yet to be immunised. Andrew Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the new variant had the potential to spread around the UK and overseas. “I recognise that we have restricted travel from the tier 4 areas … but this transmission is not only in those tier 4 areas, it’s there at some level across the country,” he said. “We’re just entering a really critical phase of this pandemic, and it makes absolute sense … to act decisively I would say across the country, as many other countries have done, despite them not as far as we know being affected by this strain.” Asked if it would advisable to have a national lockdown, Hayward said: “Personally, I think it’s clearer to give a consistent national message because although the levels of risk are different in different parts of the country, they’re still there and they’re still substantial. “Essentially what we’re really doing is very much trying to reduce transmission until we can protect as many of the vulnerable as possible and that would buy us many more weeks, in which we could get people vaccinated. I couldn’t give you a precise estimate … but my view is it will be in the scale of tens of thousands of lives. “An increase in transmissibility, even given exactly the same mortality rate per person, will lead to many, many more deaths unless one increases the effectiveness of our control measures.” Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health, who sits on the advisory group on behavioural science for Sage, said his personal opinion was that the current system was “unlikely” to contain the spread of the virus. He said: “We need to reset our strategy and move rapidly to a zero Covid strategy of the kind that many have been proposing. This will involve stricter but more rational social distancing rules across the country, and finally doing what we should have done from the start – to build the kind of test, travel, isolate and support programmes they have in countries in the far east. “It sounds expensive but the alternative could well be a catastrophic collapse in confidence in the country’s ability to control the virus and the economic, human and social disaster that would follow.” Asked why tier 4 measures were not being pushed out across England, Johnson’s spokesman said: “I would point to the fact that we’ve been clear that people shouldn’t be travelling out of tier 4 areas, and I would point to the changes that we have made in terms of tier 4,” he said. “We’re being clear that people should remain at home and limit human interaction.” Asked whether parliament could be recalled to allow angry MPs to debate the new measures, the spokesman said this would only be done to ratify any Brexit deal. “If we need to recall parliament for the purposes of Brexit, we will.”"
2020-12-21T11:09:58Z,politics,Politics,'Captain of a rudderless ship': Tory media turn on Boris Johnson,"Normally Conservative-leaning media turned on Boris Johnson on Monday amid rising anger about the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, and the late decision to in effect cancel Christmas. Here are some of the comments they made … Daily Mail: ‘Does the prime minister have any idea what he’s doing?’ Mr Johnson’s previous message, ‘Have yourself a merry little Christmas’, has morphed into another popular song with a very different tone – ‘Lonely this Christmas’. Carefully and lovingly laid plans for families to get together for the first time in months were dashed at a stroke. Overnight, the season of goodwill evaporated. And, after yet another screeching U-turn, the question on many lips is: does the prime minister have any idea what he’s doing or where he’s going? Is there a coherent Covid strategy? Or is he all at sea – the captain of a rudderless ship being controlled by the currents rather than steering a steady course? Instead of meekly buying into every scientific scare story, Mr Johnson must interrogate each one and come to measured conclusions based on a balance of risk. That is what political leadership is all about. Seize control of events or, sure as shooting, they will seize control of you. Daily Telegraph leader: ‘This dismal pattern of promising one thing and delivering another …’ Tory MPs critical of the lockdown measures question whether this decision was deliberately delayed until the Commons rose for the recess on Friday, thereby avoiding a possible backbench revolt. This is denied by ministers who say they were not fully alerted to the spread of the new variant of the virus until Friday night and action could no longer be put off. We concede that these are difficult times for the government but this dismal pattern of promising one thing and delivering another is hardly designed to reinforce public faith and trust in the way this crisis is being handled. The Times: ‘The mother of all U-turns …’ I worked with Johnson for years. I don’t believe he sets out to be duplicitous or to mislead. He is just desperate to be liked, a trait which is desperately incompatible with leading a country through such a time. The weekend’s mother of all U-turns must prompt him and those around him to reject their approach to date. In the days and weeks ahead, sober caution must win out over reckless optimism. Instead of cheery promises and cheerleading about Britain’s greatness we need the government to think pessimistically, act early and act decisively. For once, it must get ahead of events – on three fronts. Clare Foges, columnist The Sun: ‘No doubt Boris Johnson has made a pig’s ear of things recently …’ There’s no doubt that Boris Johnson has made a pig’s ear of things recently. Hard-up families waking up in tier 4 this morning will long remember the way in which their festive reunions were cancelled at the 11th hour – after the cash had been spent. But we applaud the PM for standing up to cabinet colleagues who pushed for even more ruinous restrictions. And it’s clear to all but the most fervent Tory-haters that he is at least acting in good faith: his agonised flip-flopping on Christmas is proof that the heartbreaking decision was not made lightly."
2020-12-20T19:30:32Z,politics,Politics,UK faces Brexit limbo after talks deadline missed,"Negotiators of a Brexit trade deal inched towards a compromise on fishing rights on Sunday but missed a major deadline, raising the prospect of weeks without arrangements from 1 January even in the event of agreement. The teams led by the chief UK negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, were expected to continue talks on Monday despite the European parliament’s notice that it would not vote on a deal if not secured by midnight on Sunday. A UK government source said: “Teams have been negotiating throughout the day and expect to continue tomorrow. Talks remain difficult and significant differences remain. We continue to explore every route to a deal that is in line with the fundamental principles we brought into the negotiations.” Frost met Barnier on Sunday afternoon to discuss the latest EU proposals on fisheries, with the UK side posing a series of questions to be answered on Monday, raising some hope of progress. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the talks had been derailed in recent days after the EU “put in some unreasonable demands” on fisheries, but that he was still hopeful of an agreement before Christmas. “I’m sure that a deal can be done, but obviously it needs movement on the EU side,” he said. The failure to meet the European parliament’s deadline means that ministers on the EU council representing the bloc’s capitals may need to “provisionally apply” a deal on 1 January to avoid a no-deal exit until parliament votes later in the month. If the talks go much deeper into December, however, there may not be time for the EU capitals to translate and scrutinise the agreed text, leaving the UK to exit the transition period without new trade and security arrangements with Brussels. Contingency measures would have to be agreed to bridge the gap before a deal could come into force, but such a scenario raises the danger of ports and security services being left in legal limbo. Bernd Lange, the German chair of the parliament’s trade committee, the key body in the chamber’s ratification process, tweeted: “The consequence of no deal tonight is obvious: the [European parliament] does not know the consolidated text, is not in a position to scrutinise before the end of the transition period. So make preparations now for a no-deal period and agree emergency measures with UK.” A major sticking point in the talks remains the EU’s demand to be able to apply tariffs or entirely block the entry of British goods in the event of the government closing off access to UK seas after a transition period to phase in new fishing arrangements for European vessels. Under the British proposal, Boris Johnson insists that UK-flagged vessels have exclusive access to the six-to-12 nautical mile zone off the British coast, fished for centuries by French and Belgian vessels. Such a move would lead to some British exports being kept out of its biggest market under the proposal Brussels has tabled. Barnier tweeted: “In this crucial moment for the negotiations, we continue to work hard with David Frost and his team. “The EU remains committed to a fair, reciprocal & balanced agreement. We respect the sovereignty of the UK. And we expect the same. “Both EU and the UK must have the right to set their own laws & control their own waters. And we should both be able to act when our interests are at stake.” His comments indicate that there has been some movement on the issue, with both sides able to take measures should their interests be threatened, but UK sources downplayed any suggestion of a breakthrough. The exhausted British team in the UK mission to the EU, many of whom have been away from home for the last two weeks, were served mince pies and mulled wine, delivered from the British ambassador’s residence as they worked through Sunday. Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, said he believed a deal with the UK remained doable. “We have given ourselves a few more days because we think that an agreement is still possible,” he said. “It’s hard, not sure, but worth a try. More than an agreement, we want a good agreement, in particular preserving fishing and fair conditions of competition. The negotiations should be concluded in the next few days. We know where our red lines are and what interests we don’t want to sacrifice.” All the political groups in the European parliament apart from the Greens had agreed on the Sunday night deadline for a deal. Philippe Lamberts, the co-leader of the Greens, said: “The position that we defend is that negotiators should be allowed to work until the last minute, and simply give us time in January and February to scrutinise and ratify any deal. I’m watching quite gleefully, I must say, because I was quite angry at my colleagues and now they will look stupid.”"
2020-12-20T13:20:56Z,politics,Politics,When is the deadline for a Brexit trade and security deal?,"After nine months of talks and with just 11 days to go before the end of the transition period when the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union, there is still no sign of a post-Brexit trade and security deal. Is there a deadline for an agreement? There is a deadline to the extent that the transition period ends at 11pm GMT on 31 December, but there have been many others along the way – all of which have come and gone. The latest is the European parliament’s. All the leaders of the political parties, except the Greens who decided it was already too late, said they would need agreement on a deal by midnight central European time on Sunday for them to be able to hold a consent vote before the end of the year. An extraordinary session of the parliament would be staged on 28 December. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, had wanted to meet the MEPs’ target, but with the EU and UK negotiators at loggerheads over fishing rights, his efforts were in vain. Does this mean it is no deal? No. There is no legal requirement in the treaties for the European parliament to hold a consent vote. The necessary steps in Brussels are for the commission to propose “provisional application” of a deal; the proposal and the draft treaty to be translated into the EU languages, although maybe not all 24; the commission proposal to be adopted by the 27 European commissioners in Ursula von der Leyen’s team; and the Council of the European Union, which represents the member states, to sign the deal. In the meantime, the EU capitals will want to take a hard look at the legal text. The process could take up to a week. The deal would then be provisionally applied on 1 January. The European parliament could give its consent in a vote later in January. By when does there need to be agreement? Downing Street has briefed that the deadline is now Christmas. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Sunday that this was the European commission’s deadline. That would make sense given the week that is likely required for provisional application, but there is also a UK ratification process to bear in mind. In practice, it would probably need 48 hours’ notice for the House of Commons to be recalled and MPs will want to have their own look at what has been agreed. Christmas is the deadline then, no wriggle room? Not quite. A deal could feasibly be struck on 31 December. There would not be enough time for the agreement to be ratified by 1 January, but there could be a short no-deal period with contingency measures in place to avoid the worst before both sides do the formal work necessary for the new trade and security arrangements to come into force."
2020-12-20T09:38:49Z,politics,Politics,"Latest Brexit offer 'selling EU fishing communities down the river', Barnier told","Michel Barnier has been told by the European fishing industry that his latest offer to the UK amounts to selling coastal communities “down the river” as negotiators continue to haggle in Brussels over a post-Brexit trade and security deal. The EU and UK negotiating teams remain at loggerheads on the future rights of EU fishing fleets in British seas, with Downing Street warning there will not be a deal without a significant shift from Barnier in the coming hours. The annual turnover from fish for UK vessels in British waters is about €850m (£770m) compared with €650m by EU member states. The prime minister has rejected the latest EU offer of handing over 25% of its catch by value – €162.5m a year – to UK vessels. The UK insists that the EU needs to get closer to its demand for 60% of the current catch being repatriated, worth about €390m a year. Downing Street also wants to restrict a phase-in period for the new arrangements to three years rather than the six or seven recently proposed by Brussels. But in a warning shot across Barnier’s bows, Gerard van Balsfoort, the chairman of the European Fisheries Alliance, representing the industry in coastal states such as France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, said the terms already offered would involve “unprecedented” and unacceptable cuts. He said: “The shape of a deal, as currently stands, would give a huge blow to the European seafood sector which is made up more than 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels with an annual turnover of €20.7bn. “Our industry is literally and metaphorically on the brink and in spite of repeated promises made, we are in the throes of being sold down the river with the offer made to the United Kingdom by the European commission. The more so when the fisheries negotiations with the UK are intended to start all over again after only six or seven years.” Should the nine months of talks fail to produce an agreement on a trade and security deal, the UK’s waters would be entirely shut to EU vessels, unless some contingency arrangements could be negotiated. But Van Balsfoort said his members would prefer a no-deal outcome than the terms so far proposed by Barnier. There are 11 days to go before the UK leaves the transition period, with or without a deal. Van Balsfoort said: “The one thing we wanted to avoid was a ‘no-deal’ situation in the interests of all our fishermen but the deal which is now being proposed is every bit as bad. We are looking at vicious and unprecedented cuts on a wide range of stocks including our pelagic, shellfish and whitefish sectors. “This is galling and if the European commission doesn’t stand up for its fishermen and honour its written agreement made during the arduous Brexit negotiations, it could spell the death knell for large parts of an industry which has contributed so much to coastal communities across nine EU states. Our fishermen must be protected as they risk life and limb to provide fresh food in the most unforgiving environment on Earth.” The European parliament has set midnight on Sunday, central European time, as the deadline for an agreement. MEPs have said they will not hold a vote of consent this year if a deal is not in place. A deal could still be “provisionally applied” by the 27 EU member states, with parliament holding a vote in January, although the commission is loth to take that route. The provisional application process could also take up to a week, due to the need for translation and scrutiny of the text in the EU capitals, leaving just a few days more of talking time before a no-deal outcome, for at least a short period in the event of a very late agreement, becomes unavoidable. Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, said a deal remained doable in the coming few days. “We have given ourselves a few more days because we think that an agreement is still possible,” he said. “It’s hard, not sure, but worth a try. More than an agreement, we want a good agreement, in particular preserving fishing and fair conditions of competition. The negotiations should be concluded in the next few days. We know where our red lines are and what interests we don’t want to sacrifice.” A UK government source said: “We need to get any deal right and based on terms which respect what the British people voted for. Unfortunately, the EU are still struggling to get the flexibility needed from member states and are continuing to make demands that are incompatible with our independence. “We cannot accept a deal that doesn’t leave us in control of our own laws or waters. We’re continuing to try every possible path to an agreement, but without a substantial shift from the commission we will be leaving on WTO terms on 31 December.”"
2020-12-20T09:00:14Z,politics,Politics,"As the UKâ€™s MPs prepare to cast their crucial vote on Brexit, where do the parties stand?","When MPs adjourned for Christmas on Thursday, after what the deputy speaker Nigel Evans described as an “awful year”, they were all aware that their festive break might be interrupted at any moment. If Boris Johnson can strike a free trade deal with Brussels in the next few days, legislation to pass it into UK law will be put to a Commons vote, if at all possible before 31 January and MPs will be summoned back. Four and a half years on from the referendum, the final vote will effectively mark the end of the Brexit process. While any deal short of a complete national humiliation will almost certainly pass, deciding how to vote will not be easy for many elected members, or for opposition party leaders. So where do the main parties and their MPs now stand, as they prepare to conclude the most divisive debate in recent UK political history? Conservatives Boris Johnson sees delivering Brexit as the defining act of his political career. But some of his hardline pro-Brexit MPs will only accept pure Brexit, meaning no concessions to the EU. To get a deal with Brussels, however, Johnson will have to make some compromises on issues such as EU access to UK fishing waters, and UK compliance with rules governing the single market to which we want to continue to have access. It is these compromises that the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group, which has around 70 Tory MPs as members, will be looking out for. If they believe significant ground has been given, some or all of this group will refuse to back the deal. MPs like the former cabinet minister John Redwood, who has often made the case that a no-deal outcome would be quite acceptable, could even vote against. For veteran sceptics like Bill Cash and Bernard Jenkin, getting Brexit done will be the culmination of decades of toil. But they will not be happy if it is a fudge of the sort that allows Nigel Farage to declare it is not a real Brexit at all. A big Tory revolt on his defining policy is something Johnson is desperate to avoid.
Labour Labour’s leader Keir Starmer was a prominent Remainer and was at the forefront of those pushing for a second referendum. But having won the leadership, and after Johnson comfortably won last December’s general election, Starmer has been determined to move on, to the point of hardly mentioning Brexit at all in recent months. Conscious that millions of traditional Labour supporters voted to leave the EU, Starmer now wants his MPs to support any reasonable deal. Most will fall into line. But some ardent Remainers on both the right (Ben Bradshaw, perhaps) and the left (Diane Abbott) will find it difficult to back any form of Brexit, let alone Johnson’s Brexit. Some leftwingers may simply recoil from supporting a deal because it was the work of the Tories. But any Labour rebellion is likely to be limited because the only alternative to a last-minute deal is far worse: a last-minute no-deal. The SNP The SNP is strongly against Brexit and a clear majority of Scots voted to remain in the EU in the referendum. So Nicola Sturgeon and her 47 Westminster MPs believe they have a mandate to reject it. The official line from the SNP is that they would look carefully at any deal brought back by Johnson before deciding what to do. But as Sturgeon pushes towards another independence referendum and with the May 2021 Holyrood elections approaching, which will she hopes will be a big step on the road, it is hard to see how the SNP could ever back a Tory Brexit deal. The Lib Dems Like the SNP, the Liberal Democrats – who now have only 11 MPs at Westminster – say they will take a look at the deal before deciding. The party’s leader Ed Davey has said he will not be campaigning to rejoin the EU in the near future – after the party’s “revoke” message backfired badly at the last election, seen even by many party members as undemocratic. That said, it is very hard to see how a party whose members and MPs are overwhelmingly pro-EU and whose internationalism is at the heart of its policy agenda, could ever back a Johnson deal.
The DUP The eight Westminster MPs in this Northern Irish party, which held the balance of power when Theresa May was prime minister, are not in the best of moods about Brexit. The party does not like the Northern Ireland protocol agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement. In order to ensure trade keeps flowing, the protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods and means it will apply EU customs rules at its ports. As such, the DUP object as it treats Northern Ireland as separate from the rest of the UK. That is not popular among its supporters. So there is no guarantee at all that the DUP will back Johnson on any deal he puts to the Commons."
2020-12-20T09:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Conservative MPs threaten rebellion on Brexit deal,"More than 30 pro-Brexit Tory MPs are privately threatening to withhold support for a UK-EU free trade deal if Boris Johnson is forced into any significant last-minute compromises to avoid a no-deal Brexit. According to several senior MPs on the 70-strong European Research Group (ERG), its membership is evenly divided between those who say they will “suck it up”and vote for a deal even if the prime minister has to give some ground, and those who would be prepared to rebel and withhold support in protest if he moves from his current hardline positions. “There has been of lot of activity on our WhatsApp groups on this,” said one senior member of the ERG. “We are divided between those who say let’s just suck it up and get this done, and others who say they have fought for their entire careers for this and will not vote for a deal that is not really Brexit.” While Johnson is almost certain to win a vote on any deal, given that Labour is expected to back one, a significant Tory rebellion would be a blow to the prime minister, and suggest that the Tory civil war over Europe will continue even after the end of the transition period. Senior figures in the EU, including in the European parliament, have named Sunday as the final realistic deadline for agreement. But on Saturday both Downing Street and Brussels appeared to be more pessimistic about the chances of a deal than a few days ago, although talks between officials have been continuing over the weekend. Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister and a longstanding ally of Emmanuel Macron, said, however, that France was prepared to drag the negotiations even beyond the European parliament’s Sunday deadline. His intervention came as the Observer learned that key member states have slapped down an attempt by the European commission to offer an improved deal on fish to Downing Street to break the deadlock. The annual turnover from fish for UK vessels in British waters is about €850m (£770m), compared with €650m by those of EU member states. The prime minister has rejected the latest EU offer of handing over 25% of its catch by value – €162.5m a year – to UK vessels. Downing Street insists that the EU needs to get closer to its demand for 60% of the current catch being repatriated, worth about €390m a year. The government also wants to restrict a phase-in period for the new arrangements to three years – but the EU has suggested a six- or seven-year period. It is understood that Michel Barnier’s negotiating team was looking to table an improved offer in the face of Downing Street’s rejection but has been told by the member states with the biggest interest in fishing that they will not go any further.
MEPs had said on Thursday that they would stage a vote of consent on 28 December if terms were agreed by the two sides by midnight central European time on Sunday, raising the stakes for a weekend deal. But as negotiations continued in Brussels on Saturday, Beaune said the French government would not be rushed into a deal over the next 24 hours. He said: “There is nothing wrong in not saying: well it’s Sunday evening so let’s wrap it and sacrifice everything. It may be hard and sometimes tough to understand, but it’s necessary to take the time and, at any rate, not to sacrifice our interests under the pressure of a calendar.” If Johnson emerges with a deal with the EU, it will only be achieved if both sides shift ground on issues including access by EU fishermen to UK waters, and so-called “level playing field” rules that Brussels says UK businesses must comply with in return for continued access to the single market. Tory Brexiters are particularly concerned to ensure no role for the European court of justice in any future disputes involving the UK. Sir Bernard Jenkin, a veteran Eurosceptic and member of the ERG, said he had “complete faith” in Johnson to deliver a deal that protected UK fisheries and UK sovereignty.
But stressing the importance of sticking to that position, he added: “That means we recover our full sovereign right of democratic self-government and we don’t sell out on issues, including fish.” Eurosceptics say the biggest beneficiary of a fudged Brexit deal would be Nigel Farage. Another veteran Brexiter, Peter Bone, the MP for Wellingborough, said: “I don’t think for one moment that the prime minister is not going to honour the results of the referendum and the mandate achieved at the general election. “But if you are asking me if a bad deal was done, which I don’t think would happen, then I couldn’t vote for a bad deal and I think there is a significant number of colleagues who could not vote for a bad deal.”
A deal could still be provisionally applied on 1 January if agreement is found in the next few days, with the European parliament holding a vote later in the month. Such a process would also take up to a week, given the need for the treaty to be translated and scrutinised by officials in the EU capitals. Barnier told MEPs on Thursday that as a result there might need to be a short period without any trade and security arrangements in place if the talks dragged on to Christmas. Gerard van Balsfoort, chairman of the European Fisheries Alliance, representing the EU fishing industry, said the EU offer already went too far and would sound the death knell for the sector. He said: “The shape of a deal, as currently stands would give a huge blow to the European seafood sector which is made up more than 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels with an annual turnover of €20.7bn. “Our industry is literally and metaphorically on the brink and in spite of repeated promises made, we are in the throes of being sold down the river with the offer made to the United Kingdom by the European commission. The more so when the fisheries negotiations with the UK are intended to start all over again after only six or seven years.”"
2020-12-19T15:34:13Z,politics,Politics,Labour and unions criticise Matt Hancock over delays to NHS pay rise,"Unions and the Labour leadership have criticised the health secretary over a delayed pay rise for NHS staff, as it was revealed that he had emphasised “affordability” must determine the size of healthcare workers’ wage increases. In a letter to the NHS pay review body chair formally beginning the process on Friday, Matt Hancock repeatedly underlined that wage increases must be influenced by the country’s economic situation. Responding to his recurring calls for the review body to consider the financial climate, the Royal College of Nursing said the funding of health and social care was “a political choice”. It said: “A fair pay rise is vital not just for nursing and other NHS staff, but for patients and the health service as a whole.” The government expected “recommendations to take account of the extremely challenging fiscal and economic context, and consider the affordability of pay awards,” Hancock wrote to the chair, Philippa Hird. The letter makes constant reference to the need for affordability in the light of the country’s economic position.
The letter goes on to acknowledge the importance of pay increases in continuing to recruit, retain and motivate NHS staff, while requesting that Hird describe “what steps she has taken to take account of affordability, the need for workforce growth and making best use of the funds available to deliver the best care for patients” in her final report. Hancock said the timing of the spending review announcement had delayed the start of the review process, and that the government aimed to “expedite the process as much as possible … and would welcome [the pay review body’s] report in early May 2021”. The delay has been met with anger from unions, several of whom have been urging the government to start discussions for a “fair and early” pay rise for all NHS staff since the summer. GMB’s national officer, Rachel Harrison, lambasted the health secretary for slipping out the letter late on a Friday in the hopes that attention was elsewhere. She said: “The health secretary’s ‘Scrooge’ letter in the week before Christmas will leave NHS workers worried that they will not receive the fair pay rise next year that they were promised.” She accused the government of “interfering with the pay process before any evidence is submitted”, adding that NHS staff will “rightly be angry”. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, also hit out. She tweeted: “What a disgrace. There are never any delays in the cash being dished out hand over fist to Serco’s shareholders for failed test and trace or Matt Hancock’s ex pub landlord for testing kits but there’s no money left for our nurses.” Commenting on the news that the government has set the report deadline to May, Unison’s head of health, Sara Gorton, said: “It’s cruel to make staff wait until next summer to learn what their pay rise will be. The chancellor and prime minister must do the right thing and fund a decent wage increase now. This would give exhausted staff a morale boost and get services fit for the year ahead.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “We continue to listen to our valued staff and trade unions so everyone is rewarded fairly … Over one million NHS staff are currently benefiting from multi-year pay deals”."
2020-12-19T14:45:55Z,politics,Politics,Five-mile lorry queues in Kent as businesses prepare for Christmas and Brexit,"Brexit uncertainty on top of the usual volume of Christmas traffic have caused huge queues in Kent, with a line of lorries stretching five miles up the M20 as they head for the Channel tunnel. Many businesses are stockpiling goods in an effort to avoid disruption to cross-Channel deliveries, which is expected to occur when Britain leaves the EU at the end of December. With the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looming, uncertainty has been growing among businesses about the impact the departure might have. Combined with the normal increase in activity around Christmas, this has frequently caused travel delays for freight drivers in recent weeks. On Saturday morning, the queues on the motorway leading to the Channel tunnel entrance began in the Ashford area and stretched several miles to the tunnel’s entrance at Folkestone. There were also long queues of HGVs along the M20 between Capel-le-Ferne and the port of Dover. A government report published on Saturday said businesses were being “held back” by the lack of a trade deal with the EU, with negotiators warning that a no deal was looking likely. The report, from the House of Commons committee on the future relationship with the European Union, said the government’s attempts to communicate with businesses over the impact Brexit might have on them “appear patchy at best”. “Little time now remains and, in making their preparations, businesses continue to be held back by restrictions imposed to control the spread of Covid-19, a lack of detailed guidance and continued uncertainty over the final terms of the UK-EU future relationship,” it said. However, the port of Dover chief executive, Doug Bannister, said on Friday he was confident the port would be able to handle any uncertainty. “Dover has a proven track record to handle disruption in a good, successful way, and we are able to manage the disruption and importantly recover the position very swiftly indeed,” he said. He also said the rush in freight in the run-up to Christmas could mean the following weeks were quieter. Last month, queues of a similar length built up in Kent when French authorities began their trial of post-Brexit travel checks. The queues gave a glimpse of the impact Brexit could have on travel across the Channel when it comes into force in January."
2020-12-19T13:13:36Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade talks may continue after MEPs' deadline, says France","The European parliament’s Sunday deadline may pass without agreement on a post-Brexit trade and security deal, France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, has said, as British and EU negotiators continued to haggle over fishing rights. MEPs have said they will stage a vote of consent on 28 December if terms are agreed by the two sides by midnight central European time on Sunday, raising the stakes for a weekend deal. But Beaune, a long-time ally of Emmanuel Macron who speaks for the French president on Brexit, said the French government would not be rushed into a deal over the next 48 hours.
“It would be normal not to say: well it’s Sunday evening so let’s wrap it and sacrifice everything,” he said. “It may be hard and sometimes tough to understand, but it’s necessary to take the time and, at any rate, not to sacrifice our interests under the pressure of a calendar.” A deal could still be provisionally applied on 1 January if agreement is found, with parliament holding a vote later in the month, but the European commission is understood to be loth to take such a step. Such a process would also take up to a week, given the need for the treaty to be translated and scrutinised in the EU’s capitals. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs on Thursday that as a result there may need to be a short period without any trade and security arrangements in place if the talks drag on to Christmas. With none of the alternatives looking palatable, the EU side is keen to try to wrap up the deal this weekend but the two sides continue to struggle to find a compromise on access to British seas for the European fishing fleet. The annual turnover from fish for UK vessels in British waters is around €850m compared to €650m by EU member states. The prime minister was presented with the latest EU offer of handing over 25% of its catch by value – €162.5m a year - to UK vessels. The UK insists that the EU needs to get closer to its demand for 60% of the current catch being repatriated, worth around €390m a year. The UK also wants to restrict a phase-in period for the new arrangements to three years rather than the seven most recently proposed by Brussels.
Downing Street is further resisting an EU demand to be able to apply tariffs or entirely block entry of British goods in the event of the government closing off access to UK seas at some point after the phase-in period. About 75% of UK fish exports, including the most valuable species such as herring, cod, shellfish, mackerel and salmon, goes to the EU market. Johnson wants to keep the six to 12 nautical mile zone off the British coast, fished for centuries by French and Belgian vessels, exclusively for UK-flagged boats. The prime minister called on the EU on Friday to table a deal-making proposal. “Our door is open, we’ll keep talking but I have to say things are looking difficult,” he said. “We hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves, because that’s really where we are.” Barnier has complained that the UK believes it is owed a concession on fishing access having accepted the need for an “evolution clause” on EU and UK standards in the treaty. “That is not how it works,” he has said. The evolution clause opens up the possibility of the unilateral application of tariffs in the event of a divergence on environmental, labour or social standards putting one side at a competitive disadvantage. A UK government source said a no-deal outcome remained the most likely. “Negotiations continue, but we remain far apart. We will leave no stone unturned, but given where things stand it feels more likely that we will leave the transition period on Australian terms,” the source said."
2020-12-19T11:14:07Z,politics,Politics,Post-Brexit trade deal 'hangs in balance' as talks run into weekend,"Talks on a post-Brexit trade deal are due to continue into the weekend, with both sides saying the chances of an agreement remain in the balance. Downing Street and the European commission said the negotiations were ongoing, but that significant differences remained over fisheries and level playing field rules. The European parliament has been pressing for an agreement by Sunday so it can ratify any deal before the current Brexit transition period ends on 31 December.
It is thought, however, that EU leaders could sign off on a deal on a deal agreed beyond that point provisionally, with formal ratification taking place in the new year. MPs are on standby to return to Westminster from their Christmas break if an agreement can be struck in the final days of the year. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, sought to break the deadlock in what he described on Friday as the final few hours of the talks with a new proposal on EU fishing access in British waters, after Boris Johnson called on Brussels to move to seal a deal. After meetings with aides to the EU’s heads of state and government and fisheries ministers, Barnier was locked in late-night discussions with the UK negotiators led by David Frost in what he described as a “moment of truth”. Johnson had conceded earlier on Friday that it would be “difficult at first” if the UK were to be forced to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms from 1 January, but insisted it was time for the EU to move on what is now the biggest stumbling block. If there is no deal by 31 December, the UK will leave the single market and customs union and begin trading with the EU on WTO terms. The imposition of tariffs could potentially lead to higher prices in the shops. Even with an agreement, there will be major changes at the border from 1 January with new customs checks. There are fears of long delays if businesses are not properly prepared for the new rules. The Commons Brexit committee raised significant concerns on Saturday about the UK’s preparedness for leaving the EU less than two weeks before Brexit day. It said in a report that decisions had been made too late and communications with businesses had been patchy at best. The committee chair, Hilary Benn, said the government was still unable to provide businesses, traders and citizens with certainty about what would happen. “With just seven working days until the end of the transition period, significant concerns remain,” he said. “At this late stage, the government must be ready to implement contingency plans where necessary to mitigate the effects of any disruption. “Failure to do so would mean the worst possible start to the new year for many people and businesses who are already experiencing the toughest of times.”"
2020-12-19T10:36:26Z,politics,Politics,Lorry drivers heading to EU face ham sandwich ban,"Lorry drivers will be banned from taking a ham and cheese sandwich or other meat and dairy products from the UK into the EU from 1 January, even if it is just to eat while driving, UK government officials have said. Personal imports of certain products of animal origin will be prohibited from 11pm on 31 December, a ban which will also apply to tourists travelling to the EU. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs advised transport representatives of the ban this week and gave the specific example in its updated guidance of an ordinary sandwich. The official guidance states: “Drivers travelling to the EU should be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports taking effect from 1 January 2021. If you are carrying prohibited items in your luggage, vehicle or person you will need to use, consume, or dispose of them at or before the border. “From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (eg a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU.” One operator whose fleet of trucks collects vegetables from Belgium said he had not been aware of the new rules and that it could cause friction at the border. “God help the poor customs bloke who is going to turf out the driver’s packing up box [food box]. I wouldn’t be surprised if there are fisticuffs if they try,” Simon Wilkinson said. “The thing is, when drivers are going to Europe they pack up their box for days and weeks. The tractor [the cab of the trailer] is basically their home from home. You have microwaves, the works, in your tractor so that if you do get stuck, or if you are away for a week if you are going somewhere like Spain, you are self-sufficient.” There continue to be Brexit stockpiling queues on the roads in Kent and Calais. The government said this week that a lorry park due to open in Ashford to relieve congestion would be ready for 1 January, but admitted the customs area would not be ready, forcing drivers into a lorry park further inland called Waterbrook.
Aerial shots of the Ashford site showed that construction was not complete with less than two weeks to the end of the Brexit transition period. Other photos this week showed queues on the M20 on the approach to the Eurotunnel, with Kent Online reporting delays of two and a half hours on ferries because of the congestion.
The ban on sandwiches and other food is one more issue for drivers, who face a range of new rules from 1 January including having to produce a Kent access permit for international journeys through the county. The food ban applies to produce arriving in the EU from non-EU countries and will come into force for UK drivers from 1 January, deal or no deal.
The European commission says the restrictions are part of maintaining a biosecure border. “Personal goods containing meat, milk or their products brought into the EU continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the union. It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,” it said. The rules will permit the transit of sweets and chocolate, preserving the long association between truckers and Yorkie bars. UK officials told transport representatives this week that the ban included “products that are store-bought or homemade”."
2020-12-19T07:00:42Z,politics,Politics,"Britain not ready for no deal, says Brexit select committee","Significant concerns have been expressed over the UK’s preparedness for leaving the EU by an influential group of MPs less than two weeks before Brexit day on 31 December. The Commons’ Brexit select committee has called on the government to ensure there is a robust contingency plan in place in the next fortnight to cope with the fallout as it criticises the lack of an “overall state of readiness” for business and citizens. The call comes as it emerged that Whitehall had tested some worst-case possible scenarios in a no-deal outcome this week. Operation Capstone events included French fishing boats blockading ferries in the English channel, the hijacking of vaccine trucks, a surge in hate crime, an explosion in Gibraltar and the closure of a care home because of sudden shortages of EU-national workers after 1 January, according to the Times (paywall). Many of the details of the new trade and travel barriers are only beginning to sink in. Some will not emerge until it is known if the UK and the EU have been able to hammer out a deal before the Sunday deadline. The committee has warned that borders must not be compromised if there is no agreement on policing that ensures continued access to law enforcement tools including the European arrest warrant. “With just seven working days until the end of the transition period, significant concerns remain,” said Hilary Benn, chair of the committee. The warning comes in a report published on Saturday as Downing Street and Brussels continue to try to hammer out a deal, deadlocked over fishing, by the European parliament’s deadline.
“At this late stage the government must be ready to implement contingency plans where necessary to mitigate the effects of any disruption. Failure to do so would mean the worst possible start to the new year for many people and businesses who are already experiencing the toughest of times,” the report says. Benn said the government “still cannot provide business, traders and citizens with certainty about what will happen in all the areas affected by the negotiations”. The report adds that decisions have been made “too late”, communication with businesses has been “patchy at best” and police may be forced to use “slower and more cumbersome” systems. The cross-party committee, which backed the report unanimously, warned that the combination of Brexit uncertainty and Covid-19 could hamper UK businesses. Provisions to ensure the UK border is “secure and safe” must be put in place while ministers must carefully monitor the effectiveness of alternative means of intelligence sharing for law enforcement, the report says. If the UK crashes out without a deal it loses access not just to the joint arrest system but also to four other systems including: live passenger number records vital in counter-terror operations; the Schengen Information System II database of missing persons and stolen goods; fingerprinting and DNA records in a system known as Prüm; and the European Criminal Records Information System (Ecris), which holds records of criminals across the bloc. Before connecting to the Prüm DNA framework, which contains millions of records on criminal suspects, data exchange was done manually by the UK’s National Crime Agency. The government has said it would still be able to cooperate with EU security and police counterparts using Interpol and other forums. However, police representatives have said the alternatives will leave the UK in a weaker position. While the precise nature of future cooperation with the EU on law enforcement remains unclear, the UK’s safety and security must not be compromised, the MPs say. They recognise that UK law enforcement agencies have been working hard to develop alternatives to EU databases but warn “the fallback systems for exchanging data are slower and more cumbersome”. They say a EU-UK surrender agreement to replace the European arrest warrant is “unlikely” to be ready in time and urge the government to open talks with the Irish government over bilateral policing arrangements for the island of Ireland. The MPs praise the government for its early decision to phase in customs and regulatory controls in three stages between January and July, and the recent agreement on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. But they call on Westminster to work with the devolved governments to “minimise traffic disruption” near British ports, citing the lack of veterinary officers to provide health certificates for food and animal products mandatory for exports to the EU from 1 January. Decisions on the border model are complicated but have been made “too late” and the “late delivery” of IT systems for customs makes training and testing difficult. The MPs warn that trade with the EU may be hindered if sufficient numbers of customs and veterinary staff to perform checks and give advice are not in place. On security issues the government said Brexit would allow “tangible changes that will make the British people safer, including banning foreign criminals from entering the UK”. It said border software would be ready, that the Welsh government was close to securing a lorry site for Holyhead and that it was pleased the committee had welcomed “our pragmatic and flexible approach to staged border controls, as well as our detailed border operating model” as well as the agreement on Northern Ireland."
2020-12-18T18:13:59Z,politics,Politics,Row as Boris Johnson ally lined up for top job at Office for Students,"Boris Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign manager has been named as the government’s preferred candidate to take up a leading role in an independent watchdog charged with regulating universities. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said James Wharton, a former Tory MP who ran Johnson’s 2019 campaign to succeed Theresa May as party leader, would bring “strategic direction” to the post of chair of the Office for Students (OfS). But Labour questioned Lord Wharton’s qualifications for the role, which he can take up after his nomination is confirmed by the education select committee and he is appointed by the OfS board. The solicitor and former MP for Stockton South, who was given a peerage by Johnson in August, served as minister for the northern powerhouse and in a junior ministerial role in the Department for International Development before losing his seat in the 2017 election. He was chairman of the lobbying firm Hume Brophy UK Communications up until last month. However, there appears to be little in his CV that lends itself specifically to the post at the independent regulator of higher education in England. The organisation also describes its role as championing equality and diversity. Wharton is a graduate of Durham University where he read politics and law. He was the race awareness officer in the student union and and was president of the university’s Conservative association. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “Nothing in James Wharton’s background appears to suggest he has the suitability or experience for this role.” The Department for Education said Wharton had been selected following a rigorous assessment process conducted in accordance with the governance code for public appointments. Williamson said : “He will play a vital part in ensuring students from all backgrounds are at the heart of the higher education system, receiving a high-quality education and value for money from our universities.” Sir Michael Barber, whose term as chair of the OfS will come to an end on 31 March, said he was looking forward to helping his successor prepare for the role. Following a pre-appointment hearing, the education select committee will publish its recommendations, which the education secretary will consider before deciding whether to finalise the appointment. Previously, the government spent two years and £40,000 of taxpayers’ money trying to hide how little Wharton had visited the north of England in his role as northern powerhouse minister, in what one prominent northern figure called “a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability”."
2020-12-18T18:05:17Z,politics,Politics,Michel Barnier seeks to end Brexit deadlock with fresh fishing proposal,"Michel Barnier has sought to break the deadlock in what he described as the final “few hours” of the post-Brexit trade talks with a new proposal on EU fishing access in British waters, after Boris Johnson called on Brussels to move to seal a deal. After meetings with aides to the EU’s heads of state and government and fisheries ministers, Barnier was locked in late-night discussions with the UK negotiators led by David Frost, at what Barnier described as a “moment of truth”. Talks are expected to continue into Saturday, with UK sources downplaying the chances of a breakthrough following Barnier’s move. The two sides are at loggerheads over whether the EU will be able to impose tariffs on British goods should the UK close its seas to European vessels after a new transition period of unspecified length, with less than two weeks to go before the end of the current transition period. There are also major differences over how much the UK should be able to catch in its own waters in the future, with Barnier only edging up his offer from 15% to 18%. The UK is demanding that 60% of the €650m in EU turnover from fish caught in British waters is taken back. Boris Johnson had conceded earlier on Friday that it would be “difficult at first” if the UK were to be forced to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms from 1 January, but insisted it was time for the EU to move on what is now the biggest stumbling block. He said: “Our door is open. We’ll keep talking. But I have to say that things are looking difficult. And there’s a gap that needs to be bridged. We’ve done a lot to try and help, and we hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves. “If that doesn’t happen then come 1 January we will be trading on WTO terms. An event that obviously has been four and a half years in the making … Yes it may be difficult at first, but this country will prosper mightily, as I’ve said many, many times, on any terms and under any arrangement.” Johnson said “no sensible government” could sign up to a deal that did not allow the UK to retain control of its laws and its fishing rights. As businesses raced to get stockpiles delivered ahead of the establishment of customs barriers on 1 January, long queues formed on the French and British side of the Channel, with drivers reporting full ferries and six-hour waits in Calais. Earlier, Barnier said the main obstacle to a deal was over whether Brussels would be able to hit British goods with tariffs if the government closed its fishing waters to EU fishing fleets in the future.
With the European parliament having said it needed agreement by midnight on Sunday for it to be able to give its consent in a vote this year, the EU’s chief negotiator said the nine months of trade talks had reached the “moment of truth”. Barnier said it would only be fair for Brussels to be able to put tariffs on UK goods, and fisheries products “in particular”, in a possible sign of EU flexibility on the issue. The UK is concerned that Brussels will strike at non-fishing products in such a scenario. The government has said that after a transition period of three years it wants exclusive access to the zone six to 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, where French and Belgian fleets have fished for centuries. In a speech to the European parliament, Barnier told MEPs: “It’s a question of whether the UK will leave in a few days – 10 days or so – if they’re going to leave the single market and the customs union with an agreement or without an agreement. It’s the moment of truth. “We have very little time remaining, just a few hours to work through these negotiations in a useful fashion if you want this agreement to enter into force on 1 January.”
Barnier warned Downing Street that the time had come “when decisions need to be taken”. “When it comes to access to markets without tariffs and quotas and the UK would like to regain its sovereignty over fisheries, to be able to control access to its waters and, as I’ve said on many occasions, I’ll reiterate that here: we can accept that and we respect that,” he said. “But if following a critical period of adjustment that is deemed necessary, if the UK then wants to cut access to these waters for European fishermen, at any given time, then the European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or to compensate by adjusting the conditions for products, and especially fisheries products to the single market. And that is where we come up against one of the main hurdles of the negotiations at the moment, fisheries being part and parcel of the economic partnership.” Barnier, a former French fisheries minister, said there was a fundamental issue of fairness that the EU would not back down on. About 75% of UK fish exports, including the most valuable species such as herring, cod, shellfish, mackerel and salmon, goes to the EU market."

2020-12-18T16:14:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson wanted a leak-free regime. That isn't how it turned out,"When Boris Johnson’s cabinet met by video link on Halloween weekend, as he rushed forward plans to announce an England-wide lockdown after they emerged in the press, Gavin Williamson gave colleagues a ticking off about leaks. The irony of Williamson’s lecture was not lost on others present. It was the education secretary who less than 18 months earlier had been sacked by Theresa May over the leak of sensitive discussions about the Chinese tech giant Huawei. Williamson protested his innocence; but in any case, when Johnson won the leadership he wiped the slate clean. Leaking from May’s deeply divided cabinet became so endemic that one minister said they learned to spot when a colleague made a particularly wordy intervention that appeared designed to find its way into the press. Ministers on either side of the Brexit divide were keen to ensure that whatever the outcome of cabinet discussions, their contribution to the argument was recorded for posterity. The then chief whip, Julian Smith – responsible for party discipline – later gave a BBC interview saying May’s cabinet had been the “the worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history”. The Johnson regime was meant to be different: when he wrote the foreword to a reworked ministerial code last August, he promised there would be “no leaking; no breach of collective responsibility”. And his aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain went about enforcing that diktat with zeal. They banned special advisers from accepting hospitality from journalists – with some reports even suggesting Cummings had a network of “spies” in popular Westminster bars and restaurants to spot who was lunching whom. Those accused of leaking were sometimes treated brutally – Sajid Javid’s aide Sonia Khan was summarily sacked by Cummings and marched out of Downing Street by police. Last month, the government paid between £50,000 and £100,000 to Khan to settle her claim of unfair dismissal, shortly before a five-day hearing for the case was due to begin. A former special adviser to Grant Shapps, Neil Tweedie, recently claimed in the Mail on Sunday that Cain had warned him, after a spate of well-informed stories about changes to travel restrictions appeared, that “if leaks carry on, we’ll start shooting people”. Tweedie, who denied he was the source of the leaks, was later fired. He was then rehired, after Cummings and Cain were forced out in what insiders say was a power-struggle with Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, and the new Downing Street press secretary, Allegra Stratton. It remains to be seen whether this new No 10 regime will be more successful in stopping Tory tongues wagging. But they may find that like backbench rebellion, which has proved impossible to quell despite Johnson’s safe majority, leaking is a tough habit to break. Meanwhile, the House of Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has repeatedly asked for updates on No 10’s investigation into the lockdown leak – but nothing has so far emerged."
2020-12-18T15:34:56Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Greens MSP resigns claiming 'intolerance' over women and trans rights,"One of the Scottish Greens’ most prominent MSPs has resigned abruptly from the party, citing its “intolerance” to open discussion of potential conflicts between women’s and transgender rights. Andy Wightman, the Scottish Greens’ list member for Lothian region and a highly respected campaigner for tenants’ rights and land reform, stated in his resignation letter published on Friday afternoon: “Some of the language, approaches and postures of the party and its spokespeople have been provocative, alienating and confrontational for many women and men”. With fewer than six months to go before crucial Holyrood elections in which the Greens could play a key role in a pro-independence majority, Wightman continued: “It has become evident to me that the sort of open-minded public engagement I would like to see take place on this topic is incompatible with a party that has become very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line”. It appears that a clash over policy and decision-making in the party was brought to a head by Wightman’s attempts to vote for an amendment to the forensic medical services (victims of sexual offences) (Scotland) bill last week, which legislated for the option to request an examiner of a particular sex. The amendment substituted the word “sex” for “gender”, which supporters argued resolved ambiguity but other MSPs argued was hostile towards trans women, and was passed overwhelmingly. There are not thought to be any trans women working at medical examiners in Scotland at this time. In his letter, Wightman – who joined the Scottish Greens in 2009 and entered the Holyrood parliament in 2016 – says it was “made clear” to him that if he voted for the amendment and against the group mandate, he would face “complaints and disciplinary action leading to possible suspension, deselection or expulsion”. Wightman added that he was previously admonished by colleagues following his attendance of a public meeting at Edinburgh University in June 2019, which included speakers critical of proposed reforms to transgender rights. “It has become evident to me that the sort of open-minded public engagement I would like to see take place on this topic is incompatible with a party that has become very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line.” Wightman felt there was no clear and agreed process for allowing individual MSPs to deviate from the group position, with no rules for allowing a free vote as are established in other parties. The Scottish Greens say that MSPs discuss the group position on a vote-by-vote basis and can vote differently, but may encounter complaints if they stray from party positions. Describing Wightman’s decision as “a matter of deep disappointment”, a spokesperson for the Scottish Greens said: “Land reform, empowering local democracy and community empowerment are core Green issues, and Andy’s contribution has been very important, but the Greens remain committed to carrying on this agenda without him. The Scottish Greens wish Andy well in whatever he decides to do next.”"
2020-12-18T14:06:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to rule out third Covid lockdown for England,"Boris Johnson has refused to rule out imposing a third nationwide lockdown in England, as official data showed Covid infection rates increasing across much of the UK even before the Christmas relaxation of the rules. As Northern Ireland prepares for a strict six-week shutdown from Boxing Day, and with people in Wales threatened with stringent “tier 4” restrictions, the prime minister was asked whether similar measures could be needed in England.
“Obviously we’re hoping very much that we’ll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks,” he told Sky News. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), based on swab samples of randomly selected households, chime with other data – including government figures – that have shown an increase in infections. The UK’s R rate is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2 According to the ONS, about one in 95 people in England had the virus in the week of 6-12 December, compared with about one in 90 in Wales, one in 100 in Scotland and one in 215 in Northern Ireland. The week before, about one in 115 people in England had the virus. As with previous weeks, the data for England shows that the positivity rate is highest among school-aged children. But the latest figures reveal that cases are now climbing more widely, as experts have previously warned, including among elderly people who are more vulnerable to severe Covid. “In the most recent week, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in most age groups, other than those in school year 12 to 24 years old and those aged 50 to 69,” the ONS said.
The figures also highlight geographical differences in the spread of Covid. London and the east Midlands now have the highest positivity rates, and cases are rising in many parts of the UK. “Over the most recent week, the percentage of people testing positive has increased sharply in London, with other increases in the east of England, the east Midlands, and the south-east,” the ONS team report, noting that the figures have fallen in the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber.
Prof Steven Riley, of Imperial College London, who is a member of the government advisory committee SPI-M and works on the React-1 infection surveillance study, said: “The latest data from ONS show increasing infection in multiple areas of the country. Trends for London, south-east and east of England are particularly worrying. These are consistent with the latest React-1 data and data from pillar 2 [swab testing of the public] suggesting that infections in the east of London, Essex and Kent are continuing to increase rapidly.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has expressed concern about a new strain of the virus circulating in Kent and London, though it is unclear as yet whether it is behaving any differently to previous strains. The ONS said the percentages of people in Wales and Scotland testing positive were rising, and rates were no longer falling in Northern Ireland. Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, when asked about the possibility of lockdown-type measures, said: “Nothing at this point can sensibly be ruled out.” She said: “Undoubtedly the situation in Wales and Northern Ireland is significantly more challenging … but that doesn’t mean we should be complacent.”
Freeman said the levels of restrictions imposed on local authorities were under continual discussion, with the results of the next weekly review due to be announced next Tuesday. Scotland’s national clinical director, Jason Leitch, said: “Hospitals in Scotland are coping. They are not ringing alarm bells to tell us to do something dramatic quickly.” He said that having spoken to colleagues in Wales and Northern Ireland, “they are worried. You can hear from some of the language both from politicians and clinical advisers how worried they are”. A growing number of NHS hospitals report that they are struggling with the number of coronavirus patients coupled with staff off sick or isolating. The number of Covid patients in hospital in the UK is now higher than at any other point in the second wave, at more than 18,000 patients. The prime minister urged the public to heed warnings about the risks of Christmas gatherings, despite the relaxation in the rules that allows three families to form a bubble for up to five days. “What we’re saying to people now, over this Christmas period, is think of those rules about the three households that you can bubble up with, the five days – that is very much a maximum, that is not a target that people should aim for,” Johnson told Sky News. “This is the time to think about our elderly relatives, avoid spreading the disease. Keep it short, keep it small. Have yourselves a very little Christmas.” The UK government is due to review the three-tiered restrictions on 30 December, but government insiders acknowledge it will be difficult at that point to disentangle the impact of Christmas socialising from other factors. “There will be a lot of noise,” said one official. Realistically, even if a lockdown can be avoided, officials expect the tiered restrictions to remain in place until the most vulnerable groups in the population can be vaccinated. They will also be watching closely to see whether the vaccine helps to stop people spreading the virus, as well as preventing them from becoming ill. Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Guardian that the latest infection figures should prompt the government to reconsider its guidance for the coming weeks. “It is clear that rather than easing restrictions of the Christmas period, we probably need to be strengthening restrictions to keep a handle on the situation,” she said."
2020-12-17T20:27:09Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Boris Johnson says talks in 'serious situation' after call with EU chief,"Boris Johnson claimed the Brexit talks were in a “serious situation” after a call with Ursula von der Leyen, even as the EU’s chief negotiator raised hopes of a weekend Brexit agreement by persuading the European parliament to delay its deal deadline to Sunday. In a statement released after a short stock-take telephone call on Thursday evening with the European commission president, the prime minister repeated his suggestion that it was “very likely” that an agreement would not be reached, with fisheries the standout issue. Downing Street said Johnson had told Von der Leyen that the UK “could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry”.
The statement claimed Johnson had insisted that the EU’s negotiating stance on access to British waters was “simply not reasonable, and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly”. “The prime minister repeated that little time was left,” the statement added. “He said that if no agreement could be reached, the UK and the EU would part as friends, with the UK trading with the EU on Australian-style terms.” The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeted on Thursday night: “The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out.” While EU access to British waters remains a difficult issue, during a briefing with leaders of the European parliament’s political groups earlier on Thursday, Michel Barnier, who has led the EU negotiation for four years, said he believed a deal could still be rapidly wrapped up. Barnier cautioned against setting an early cutoff that could not be met after a suggestion from Manfred Weber, the German leader of the centre-right European People’s party, who said a consent vote could only be staged at the end of the month if a trade and security deal was secured on Friday. Barnier described it as “difficult but possible” for a deal to be struck within the 24-hour deadline if remaining difficulties over EU access to British fishing waters could be overcome, but suggested it could take a “few days”. “There is still a lot of work to do on fisheries,” Barnier told the leaders. In a subsequent statement, the parliament’s leaders – apart from the Greens, who withheld their backing due to lack of time for scrutiny – said they would hold a vote on 28 December if there was agreement by midnight Brussels time on Sunday. In her own statement after the call, Von der Leyen also offered a more positive assessment of the state of the negotiations. She said: “We welcomed substantial progress on many issues. However, big differences remain to be bridged, in particular on fisheries. Bridging them will be very challenging. Negotiations will continue tomorrow.” During his briefing of senior MEPs, Barnier had said he believed there was still a pathway to a deal within days and promised that parliament would swiftly receive the legal text of a deal once Johnson and Von der Leyen had signed it off. Dacian Cioloş, the former prime minister of Romania, had argued that the gravity of a no-deal outcome demanded flexibility from the parliament, asking: “Can we block an agreement for the sake of a few days?” Deadlines have come and gone throughout the Brexit talks. In an appearance in front of the Commons Brexit select committee, the cabinet minister, Michael Gove, said he believed failure to find an agreement remained the most likely outcome. “I think regrettably the chances are more likely that we won’t secure an agreement, so at the moment less than 50%,” he said.
The EU capitals could still provisionally apply a deal successfully negotiated before 31 December if the European parliament does not vote on the deal. MEPs would then vote in January after holding debates, but the European commission is opposed to going ahead without parliament having its say in the remaining two weeks of this year. Barnier told MEPs that given all sides were against the so-called “provisional” application of a deal, the failure of the parliament to hold a consent vote in the event of a deal being brokered would leave a few weeks after 31 December without any arrangements in place, raising the stakes for a deal within the next 72 hours. He said fisheries was the most difficult issue, with Frost insisting that – because the UK had moved on the issue of future standards – the onus was on the EU to compromise on fishing demands.
Barnier argued in response that in accepting that the UK would have the unilateral ability to close its waters after a transition period, the EU had already moved. He added that the UK would repatriate a significant amount of the catch currently taken by European fishing vessels in British seas, although not the 60% being sought. There is also a continuing debate over EU access to the zone six to 12 nautical miles from the UK’s coastline, with No 10 insisting it should be for exclusive use by British vessels. Barnier tweeted: “Good progress, but last stumbling blocks remain. We will only sign a deal protecting EU interests & principles.” Agreement has been struck on a range of other issues, including the right, where there is a breach of the treaty, for one side to trigger cross-suspension – meaning if a problem arises in one sector, action can be taken in another. Barnier said the UK was seeking to leave financial services out of the mechanism but Brussels was pushing for its inclusion. He told MEPs that the UK had shifted on the previous big sticking point of the “evolution clause”, under which there would be a route to apply unilateral tariffs should there be evidence that regulatory divergence was leading to one side losing out. Discussions on state aid were continuing, he said, with many of the issues resolved, but the EU wanted European businesses to go to the UK courts should there be evidence that shared principles on subsidy control had not been followed by a new domestic enforcement body."
2020-12-17T19:10:51Z,politics,Politics,Jacob Rees-Mogg under fire for dismissing Unicef's UK grants as stunt,"The Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has come under fire for accusing Unicef of a “political stunt” after the UN agency stepped in to help feed deprived children in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Commons leader hit out at Unicef, which is responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children worldwide, after it launched its first domestic emergency response in the UK in its more than 70-year history. As part of its programme of support that is set to distribute more than £700,000 to help fund projects for children and their families, the agency has pledged £25,000 to supply nearly 25,000 breakfasts in a south London borough over the Christmas holidays and February half-term. Rees-Mogg characterised Unicef’s support as “playing politics” and claimed it should be “ashamed of itself”. After Unicef’s support in the UK was raised in the Commons on Thursday by the Labour MP Zarah Sultana, who also took aim at Rees-Mogg’s personal wealth, the minister replied: “I think it’s a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived countries in the world, where people are starving, where there are famines and there are civil wars. “And they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, I think, £25,000 to one council. It is a political stunt of the lowest order.” He defended the government’s response to child poverty, including expanding free school meals, adding: “Unicef should be ashamed of itself.” However, the minister’s comments prompted a backlash, with Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, saying: “The only people who should be ashamed of themselves are Boris Johnson and the rest of his government for letting our children go hungry.” She said: “In one of the richest countries in the world, our children should not be forced to rely on a charity that usually works in war zones and in response to humanitarian disasters. The only scandal here is this rotten Tory government leaving 4.2 million children living in poverty, a number that will only rise due to the coronavirus crisis.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “Rees-Mogg’s sneering comments are abhorrent – a modern-day version of ‘let them eat cake’.” Anna Kettley, Unicef UK’s director of programmes and advocacy, said: “Unicef UK is responding to this unprecedented crisis and building on our 25 years’ experience of working on children’s rights in the UK with a one-off domestic response, launched in August, to provide support to vulnerable children and families around the country during this crisis period. “In partnership with Sustain, the food and farming alliance, over £700k of Unicef UK funds is being granted to community groups around the country to support their vital work helping children and families at risk of food insecurity during the coronavirus pandemic. Unicef will continue to spend our international funding helping the world’s poorest children. We believe that every child is important and deserves to survive and thrive no matter where they are born.” Kettley said Unicef UK was providing grants of between £5,000 and £25,000, with more than £700,000 being made available in total to 30 community organisations to fund projects for children and families in their area. “For some of the projects in question, the funding is distributed via a council, but the majority of the grants are being made directly to community organisations,” she said. “In Southwark, the funding has gone directly to School Food Matters, a community organisation.” Unicef UK said the first round of grants were confirmed in mid-August and all funded programme activity was due to conclude in February next year. It has given a £25,000 grant to the community project School Food Matters. The charity says it is working with Premier Foods, Southwark council and Southwark Food Action Alliance – a collective of charitable organisations, residents and community partners – to deliver 18,000 breakfasts to 25 schools for distribution around the borough over the two-week Christmas holidays, as well as an additional 6,750 breakfasts over the February half-term. The prime minister’s spokesman declined to comment directly on Rees-Mogg’s remarks, saying: “What we would point towards is the work and the action that we’ve already taken to support the most vulnerable and the poorest families across the country.”"
2020-12-17T17:56:45Z,politics,Politics,Door Matt Hancock sold his soul to Boris a long time ago | John Crace,"If looks could kill ... You know that the government’s guidance to visit your relatives over Christmas without actually visiting them is asking for trouble. I know that the government’s guidance to visit my relatives over Christmas without actually visiting them is a hopelessly confusing piece of messaging. But most of all, Matt Hancock also knows it. Yet the health secretary sold his soul to Boris Johnson long ago. There was a time early in the pandemic when Matt appeared to be one of the few members of the cabinet to act with integrity. Someone who was prepared to call out the prime minister’s rubbish about the coronavirus being all over in three months: or, when that deadline had come and gone, be all over by Christmas. A minister prepared to level with the country about the severity of the crisis, the failure of the government’s response and committed to doing whatever it took to improve the situation. But sometime around the summer, Hancock’s nerve failed him. Though never sinking to the level of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had earlier today criticised Unicef for feeding hungry British children, maintaining his job became more important than telling the truth. Matt became Door Matt. Another piece of Westminster flotsam. He didn’t stand up for the Sage advice recommending a circuit breaker in September. And he allowed himself to stand by an initial tiering system that he knew would be inadequate. And now it seems as if he’s managed to convince himself of the virtues of the new improved tiering system. Somewhere in his department there must be a picture of him with his soul corroding from the inside, because externally he looks much the same. If a little more short-tempered and drained of his natural enthusiasm. In what he must hope was his last Covid statement of the year, Door Matt was back in the Commons on Thursday to announce the fortnightly changes to the tiering levels around the country. And he looked less than thrilled about it, as even he can spot a Christmas turkey. After his customary space filler preface about the virus being a terrible disease, he now announced that a whole load more regions would be moving up to tier 3. As of Saturday, 68% of the country would be under the highest levels of restrictions and just three areas would be moving down. Bristol and north Somerset would be eased to tier 2 while Herefordshire would be afforded the luxury of tier 1. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, was relatively sanguine about the changes as they were more or less in line with what he had expected. But he did question the government’s five-day Christmas Killing Zone. Hancock had promised the government had the virus under control and that it wouldn’t take the risk of it spreading over Christmas but that was exactly what was likely to happen. So would he please rethink the government regulations over Christmas? Ashworth said that out of duty rather than expectation as he too has long since given up on Hancock having a mind of his own. It’s reached the point where he no longer needs advance sighting of any statement as he knows precisely what the health secretary is going to say even before Door Matt does. As indeed do we all. I long for a week when I can avoid sketching the health secretary compromising his beliefs on coronavirus. At which point Hancock rather jumped the shark. The Christmas regulations were perfectly clear to everyone and it was up to each person to take personal responsibility for their own actions. If you wanted to kill your elderly relatives then go ahead and be his guest. But if you wanted to spare them for another year then think twice before visiting them. Door Matt had given up on trying to do what was right for the country. It was now up to everyone to make their own decisions about what level of risk they were happy to take over Christmas. And if you died, you died. Just don’t come moaning to him. Here the logic began to fall apart, as Hancock began to apply the same sense of personal responsibility to the tiering levels. The three regions that had come down a tier had done so because they had come together as a community to act collectively. Which rather suggested that he imagined the rest of the country had gone feral and was just doing as it pleased – with no regard to government guidelines – which was why they had either remained in the same tier or been bumped up to the highest one. It didn’t seem to have occurred to him for a second that actually the vast majority of the population were complying with the guidance and that it might have been the regulations themselves that were inadequate in stopping the rate of infection from increasing. The remainder of the session passed off peacefully enough. Liam Fox congratulated Hancock for seeing sense and reducing his north Somerset constituency to tier 2, while several MPs from Manchester and elsewhere in the north, who were stuck in tier 3, observed that the rates of infection in their areas were now lower than areas in the south that had been in tier 2 just a couple of weeks back. But there was little anger in the debate. Almost every MP just appeared resigned to the inevitable and couldn’t really bring themselves to start a fight they knew they were certain to lose just before Christmas. For now they would take their punishment and give Door Matt an even break. And God knows Hancock needed it. Because if there were delays in the vaccine and people’s personal responsibility couldn’t fill the vacuum in the government’s own regulatory system, then there was sure to be hell to pay in January and February."
2020-12-17T17:44:25Z,politics,Politics,"Covid: tough UK restrictions to last until February at least, say experts","Tough coronavirus restrictions are expected to be in place across much of the UK until at least February, experts have said, as they warned of a “harsh” two to three months ahead. More than 35,300 positive cases were recorded on Thursday – including a backlog of 11,000 from Wales - with infection rates increasing in many parts of the country, while rising Covid hospital numbers stand at more than 18,000. In the first wave the peak for UK hospitalisations was 21,683. So far 138,000 people out of 25 million people in nine priority groups have received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The temporary relaxation of restrictions at Christmas is expected to fuel the spread of the virus, and scientists say it is likely that tough measures will then be in place until at least February. “The Covid-19 landscape in the UK will only get worse before it gets better and the next two to three months will be harsh,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. He noted there were believed to be around 60,000 new coronavirus cases, 1,700 hospital admissions and 600 deaths daily, and Christmas was set to heap further pressures on the health service. “Therefore, we can expect heavy restrictions to be in place across all, or much of, the UK until February at the very least. More areas are being put into tier 3, which will help to turn the tide, but as we saw with the national lockdown across the spring, these restrictions can take some time to have an effect.” Hospital bosses believe limits on social contact will have to stay in force for months. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, said: “No one wants the tiered restrictions to stay in place one day longer than is absolutely necessary. Trust leaders completely understand their impact on peoples’ livelihoods and wellbeing, and the wider economic impact. But until the vaccination programme has brought the virus right back under control, reducing social contact is the best defence we have, and is likely to remain so until well into the spring.” Prof Rowland Kao, an expert in infectious disease dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, said that for restrictions to be eased, an area’s R number needed to fall below 1, meaning the epidemic is shrinking. Even during lockdown restrictions, R was probably no lower than 0.7, he noted. Dr Michael Tildesley, of the University of Warwick, who is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said the scale of any expected Christmas effect was unknown, with some venues where people mix – such as schools and universities – closed. But he agreed that tough restrictions were likely to be needed for some time. “Cases are now rising again in most regions, so I would expect that further restrictions will be introduced in the new year and that such measures will be in place until at least February, when hopefully vaccines can start to be rolled out in much larger quantities.” While Tildesley said most of his team’s analysis was focused on the situation in England, he added: “I would expect that the situation will be similar across the UK.” Head said while the next few months might look bleak, the situation could brighten after Easter. “The improving weather will, for example, mean more people meet outdoors, the vaccine programme will continue to be rolled out with probably more vaccine candidates licensed and available by then,” he said."
2020-12-17T17:34:06Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: cases rise 42% in a week as tier 3 rules widened and furlough extended â€“ as it happened,"Large swathes of the south and east of England are to be put under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions, as the government rejected calls to allow hospitality businesses to reopen in other parts of the country. Here is the full list of what which areas are moving up or down a tier, and what the tiers will be for all parts of England from Saturday. Rishi Sunak is to extend the furlough scheme for an additional month and has said the government will hold a budget on 3 March to outline the next stage of its response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Welsh government has been strongly criticised for a delay in adding 11,000 positive Covid tests to official figures because a computer system was down for maintenance. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has accused a senior Tory MP of breaching Covid-19 rules after he attended a Christmas dinner for 27 people at a private membersâ€™ club. Michel Barnier has raised hopes of a weekend Brexit deal after persuading the European parliament to stretch its deadline to last thing on Sunday â€“ even as UK ministers put the chance of an agreement at less than 50%. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-12-17T16:06:19Z,politics,Politics,'There are no good options': Britons torn over Christmas gatherings,"“A smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas,” Boris Johnson said on Wednesday, leaving millions of people across the country to decide whether to go ahead with planned gatherings of up to three households over Christmas. Penelope Adamson, 66, retired and living in Glasgow, has decided to cancel plans for a family get-together over Christmas. “My son and his wife were going to fly up from London and my daughter was going to drive up from Hampshire,” she said. “But then Nicola Sturgeon strongly advised against overnight stays between households, and then yesterday Boris Johnson made similar recommendations. That was it for me. I got really scared and thought this isn’t worth it.” Although her son will lose the money for the flights to Scotland, Adamson is certain her family have made the correct choice. “I’m dreading seeing the number of cases and deaths rocketing in January due to the relaxation of the rules,” she said. “Until we are all vaccinated, no one is safe, and I’m just not ready to die yet! We’ll do Christmas at Easter. I think a lot of people will be reviewing their plans given the government’s latest advice.”
Edwin Bailey, 46, from Norwich, said his family’s plan to merge three households for the festivities would probably remain unchanged despite the prime minister’s latest advice. “At this point, we haven’t changed our plans and I don’t think we will,” he said. “Our family made arrangements based on the rules for the Christmas period. Now the government’s advice has got muddled again. It’s difficult: expectations were raised, now it’s going to be very hard for individual families to backtrack.” He added: “I have elderly family members who say: ‘I’m in my 80s! I don’t care, I want one more Christmas!’ I think they’ll be fairly adamant that they’ll want to see their children and grandchildren, regardless.”
Amy, 37, a charity director from south-east London, remains determined to visit her elderly parents in Sussex over Christmas with her husband, two young children and her sister, with whom she is in a bubble. She said: “By the time we’ll get there we will have been self-isolating for nearly two weeks, and we will only go if we’ve had a negative test before. As far as we’re concerned, we’ve minimised the risk sufficiently. “We did a lot of research to make sure that we isolate for long enough before the Covid test to be sure we get a reliable result. So we are trusting the science. Our families and a lot of friends think we are being completely over the top.”
Jess Youngs, 34, a mother of two from Chichester, is still unsure what her family will do after the new guidance. “It’s really tough,” she said. “My husband and I had a discussion for about an hour and a half this morning. He’s one of four siblings, and we were all meant to gather in an Airbnb rental in Southampton for Christmas. You’d have 16 people together, and I said: ‘On no other day of this entire year would I have this many people gathered indoors. So why should we do it on this one?’ I’m a Christian and am sentimental about celebrating Christmas, but I am worried someone will pass it on without realising they have it asymptomatically. “My husband sees it differently. He thinks this is what his family needs, and I think it comes all down to that: there is the national picture and infection numbers and so on, and then there are the needs of individual families. There are no good options.”"
2020-12-17T15:39:09Z,politics,Politics,UK tourists who need routine treatment to be covered in EU for 12 months,"The government is to cover the cost of EU holiday healthcare for people who require routine hospital treatment such as dialysis and chemotherapy in the event that there is no Brexit deal to replace the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) scheme. The health minister Edward Argar revealed the plan in a written statement to parliament on Thursday. The arrangements will last for 12 months from 1 January 2021. The scheme has been welcomed by Kidney Care UK, which has been campaigning for health insurance cover for kidney patients who need daily treatment and faced prohibitively expensive travel insurance next year. Argar said: “This government will introduce the scheme with the intention that it is used by individuals who are certain to require treatment while abroad, such as regular dialysis, oxygen therapy or certain types of chemotherapy. The government recognises that these ongoing, routine treatment costs can be expensive and makes travelling abroad extremely challenging for many people.” It means British citizens who need life-sustaining treatment, equipment and medication can now make travel plans for next year at no extra cost. It is not clear whether it will apply to people undergoing all forms of treatment. Argar said people applying for the scheme “must be ordinarily resident in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland and entitled to the treatment on the NHS”. He added: “Individuals will need to work with their NHS clinician to agree their treatment requirements and confirm they meet the criteria in the scheme.” The government is expected to seek bilateral deals with EU countries popular with British tourists in the event of no overall deal on EHIC when Brexit trade talks end. Argar said: “The government will assess its options for reciprocal healthcare if we do not achieve an EU-wide arrangement. This includes the possibility of negotiating bilateral arrangements on social security coordination, including reciprocal healthcare, with individual EU member states.” Fiona Loud, the policy director for Kidney Care UK, said it could help up to 30,000 people on dialysis in the UK. She said travel was “greatly valued” to kidney patients and their families. “Having a break means the world to them; now the vaccination programme has started, this is something to look forward to,” Loud said. “We welcome this move for patients and the reassurance it gives, but need arrangements to be made so people don’t have to pay in advance.”"
2020-12-17T13:26:25Z,politics,Politics,Large parts of south and east England move to Covid tier 3 as Bristol rules eased,"More than two-thirds of England faces winter under the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions after large sections of the south and east were put into tier 3, prompting anguish from local leaders. Mayors and MPs from the north expressed disappointment after none of their regions were moved down, with some complaining they were being unfairly treated. However, some public health chiefs took a different view, with one expressing dismay that Herefordshire had been shifted to the least stringent measures. Asked if she was pleased about the move to tier 1, Rebecca Howell-Jones, acting director of public health in Herefordshire, said: “From a public health perspective, I would have to say no, we are disappointed by this news.” Much of a recent decrease in infection rates was seemingly due to England’s four-week lockdown rather than the subsequent restrictions, she said, telling the BBC: “I would rather we weren’t yo-yoing out of different tiers and the likely impact of increased infections occurring over the Christmas period is a concern.” With weekly Public Health England data showing coronavirus case rates rising in all but one region of England, Matt Hancock told MPs that only a handful of areas were being moved down a tier. Instead, the health secretary said, another 3.7m people in parts of southern and eastern England were moved up to tier 3, covering Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Peterborough, the whole of Hertfordshire, Surrey with the exception of Waverley, Hastings and Rother on the Kent border of East Sussex, and Portsmouth, Gosport and Havant in Hampshire. The changes comes into force on Saturday. Tier 3 already covers most of the north of England and the Midlands, London and some of the south-east, meaning almost 38m people or 68% of England’s population are under its restrictions. “We’ve come so far, we mustn’t blow it now,” Hancock told the Commons. In tier 3, hospitality businesses must close except for takeaway services and almost all mixing between households is barred. The next review is due in two weeks.
Only Bristol and north Somerset, with a population of 900,000 people, were moved down from tier 3 to 2 after infections fell, while Herefordshire was moved from tier 2 into tier 1, the lowest level of restrictions.
Conservative MPs and local leaders expressed anger at the wholesale move into the top level. “Ridiculous that we are being dragged into tier 3,” tweeted Stephen McPartland, MP for Stevenage in Hertfordshire, who voted against the current tier system. Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-wary Conservatives, whose Wycombe constituency in Buckinghamshire has been put in tier 3, said ministers must “urgently clarify what the criteria are for moving areas between, and especially down, the tiers”. Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth council, said it was “bizarre” to move the city into tier 3 but not nearby areas also served by the city’s hospital. Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said it was “bitterly disappointing so close to Christmas” that the city had not exited the top level. Responding to Hancock in the Commons, the Conservative backbencher Sir Graham Brady, who represents Altrincham and Sale West, said infection rates were below the national average in nine out of 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester, and lower than in Bristol or Cheshire, both now in tier 2. “What exactly do we have to do to move out of tier 3?” Brady said.
The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said his region had lower rates than London when it was first put into tier 2. He said: “One can only conclude that it’s the changed context in London and the south-east which has changed the national context which has led to everybody in the north of England staying in restrictions.” But the changes were welcomed by some local health experts. In Trafford the director of public health, Eleanor Roaf, said the decision was “unfortunately the right one”. “Do I think Greater Manchester is being punished?” she said. “No. I think really unfortunately in Greater Manchester we happen to have a lot of things that put our population at higher risk – more people in lower paid work, more people doing face-to-face work and more people in factories, perhaps in a noisy or cold environment such as food processing.”"
2020-12-17T13:25:02Z,politics,Politics,Labour to appoint Jewish board to help draw up antisemitism complaint process,"Labour will appoint a Jewish advisory board to help oversee the creation of an independent disciplinary process to respond to incidents of antisemitism. The party announced the change, which is part of an overhaul ordered by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, after the body found it was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act when dealing with complaints of antisemitism among members. It has now published an “action plan for driving out antisemitism”, which the EHRC agreed could be placed into the public domain. In it, the party commits to drafting a new process for dealing with complaints by April next year, and implementing it as soon as possible after the 2021 party conference, which would need to approve the changes. An advisory board of Jewish stakeholders will be appointed to consult about the new system, and Labour will report back to the EHRC regularly about progress. In a foreword to the document, Angela Rayner said: “We failed the Jewish community, our members, our supporters and the country. That is why we must act to drive antisemitism out of our party and change the processes, structures and the culture of the party to ensure Jewish people feel safe to return to their political home. That requires more than just words. It requires action.” Other changes planned by Labour include ensuring the offices of the leader and deputy leader have no involvement in overseeing individual cases, and creating a culture that encourages members and staff to feel able to challenge inappropriate behaviour and, where necessary, to complain. Labour has promised to tackle the backlog of antisemitism complaints. The party also plans to strengthen its social media guidelines – a move that could potentially lead to more members being disciplined – and to improve due diligence on the social media accounts of candidates. The EHRC welcomed Labour’s report. Alastair Pringle, its executive director, said: “The Labour party has produced a comprehensive action plan that meets the recommendations made in our investigation report. It will take time to rebuild the trust of the membership and the public. This is an important step in the right direction. We are satisfied these changes are realistic and achievable and we will continue to monitor and work with the Labour party so this plan is adhered to.” While the measures were drawn up in response to the antisemitism report, they will also cover other complaints. Rayner said: “We will be establishing an independent process to investigate complaints of antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, sexual harassment and any discrimination based on protected characteristics.” The publication of the EHRC report in October sparked an internal Labour split after Jeremy Corbyn responded by saying the scale of the problem in the party had been “dramatically overstated” for political reasons. Corbyn was subsequently suspended from the Labour party. Three weeks later he was readmitted by the ruling national executive committee but Keir Starmer declined to restore the whip, so Corbyn is now sitting as an independent MP. That decision has infuriated Corbyn’s supporters in the party, including his former frontbench colleagues Diane Abbott and John McDonnell. Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, has banned MPs and members from expressing solidarity with Corbyn, or criticising the EHRC’s findings at constituency Labour party meetings. The leftwing campaign group Momentum responded by accusing Evans of “yet another disturbing attack on the rights of members to democratically discuss matters vital to the party”. Momentum is calling for the Labour general secretary to become an elected post. Evans was Starmer’s preferred candidate for the job. Corbyn was also able to secure the post for his pick, Jennie Formby."
2020-12-17T12:40:14Z,politics,Politics,"Liz Truss's record of picking white, male trade advisers criticised","Labour has accused Liz Truss of setting an “appalling standard” on equality in government after it emerged that of more than 250 trade advisers she has appointed, fewer than a quarter are women and 95% are white. The analysis comes before Truss, who is the minister for women and equalities as well as the international trade secretary, announced a shift in government equality priorities away from gender and race. In the speech on Thursday afternoon, Truss said the debate on equality had been “dominated by a small number of unrepresentative voices, and by those who believe people are defined by their protected characteristic.” The data collated by the office of Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, shows that since mid-July Truss has appointed 253 people from outside government to new advisory roles connected to trade. Of these, 63 (24.9%) are women, 240 are white, 12 are Asian and one is black. Simon Woolley, the founder and director of Operation Black Vote, said Truss’s speech was part of “a clear trajectory that seeks to downplay the reality of persistent race inequality”. “The whitewashing of tackling institutional racism is in turbocharge mode right now.” Woolley said. “There are elements of this government that are not neutral about this. They are pushing back hard, creating faux culture wars, pitting the north against the south, white against black, all this at a historic moment when we could make the most fundamental positive change in regards to race equality ever seen.” The Labour tally of external appointees includes nine members of the new Board of Trade – among them the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott – and four non-executive directors for her department. It also cover 24 members of a strategic trade advisory group; 205 members of trade advisory groups (TAGs), across 11 sectors of the economy; 15 members of a trade and agriculture commission; and four members of a trade union advisory group. While this totals 261, eight people are in more than one role, so it covers 253 different people. The sole black appointee is Dambisa Moyo, a Zambian economist and writer, who is among the four new non-executive directors for the Department for International Trade. These were the only roles of the 253 made via competitive recruitment. The figures show that of the 11 sector-wide TAGs, five only have white members. None of the appointments fall under the category of what are known as regulated appointments under Cabinet Office rules, and so would not count towards government targets on equality. These state that by 2022 half of appointees should be women, and 14% from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Thornberry said: “It’s no wonder Liz Truss wants to ditch the government’s targets relating to gender and race when she has set such an appalling standard herself in recent months over the representation of women and minority ethnic groups. “We all know that the boardrooms from which many of these appointments have been made are not representative of the country as a whole, but as the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss has a duty to challenge that under-representation and the discrimination that underlies it, not just to mirror it in her own appointments.” Truss’s speech, to the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, promised a greater focus on issues such as geographical and class divides, saying the existing discourse had been dominated by the left, “captured as they are by identity politics, loud lobby groups and the idea of lived experience.” Such a worldview, she argued, says that “if you are not from an ‘oppressed group’ then you are not entitled to an opinion, and that this debate is not for you”. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, said Truss was seeking to create a separation where none existed. He tweeted: “Liz Truss’ attempt to separate class from race is divisive garbage.” A source at the Department for International Trade said Truss had recently appointed women to two leading roles – chief of US trade, and director general of trade policy implementation work – and that the advisory appointments were unpaid. More widely, they said, the advisers tended to reflect the relevant industries whose advice was needed. “It’s no surprise that there is a skew towards white men, because that reflects senior boards and business at the moment,” they said. Five of the nine Board of Trade appointments made by Truss were women, they added."
2020-12-17T09:08:39Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid Christmas: what the law says and what the four nations say,"Boris Johnson implied during prime minister’s questions that the four nations had agreed on a joint position over Covid rules for Christmas. However, there has been some divergence. The legal framework allowing people a five-day limited exemption from the normal rules remains the same in all countries, except for Wales. But the guidance in each country differs, creating a hotchpotch of advice across the UK. By the letter of the law … What you can legally do was set out by the government this month. The law states that between 23 and 27 December: You can form an exclusive Christmas bubble composed of people from three households. You can only be in one bubble and it cannot be changed. You can travel between tiers and UK nations for the purposes of meeting this group. You can only meet them in private homes or gardens, places of worship or public outdoor spaces. You can continue to meet people who are not in your Christmas bubble outside your home according to the rules in the tier in which you are meeting. If you form a festive bubble, you should not meet socially with friends and family that you do not live with in your home or garden unless they are part of your Christmas bubble. Guidance in England Johnson said the law had not changed but he admitted “the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules”. He added: “A smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas.”
He said three households could still meet on five days, but that was the maximum and not a target. People should avoid travelling from high-prevalence areas to low ones. He also urged people to avoid staying away from home overnight and suggested not seeing elderly relatives until they had been vaccinated. Scotland The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, recommended people spend Christmas in their own home with their own household, and if they did mix with others then they should only do so for one day, with a limit of two households and “as far within the maximum of eight people over the age of 12 as you can”. She also told Scots to avoid all travel between high prevalence areas and low prevalence areas – in particular, avoiding travel to or from Scotland and tier 3 areas in England. Northern Ireland The first minister, Arlene Foster, has suggested further Covid restrictions could be introduced after Christmas. She said she was not expecting to recommend tightening the rules before Christmas but she could not rule out further restrictions afterwards. Wales In changes to the law, only two households should come together to form an exclusive Christmas bubble during the five-day period. All non-essential shops, plus leisure and fitness centres and close-contact services, will shut at the end of trading on Thursday 24 December. Hospitality premises, including pubs and restaurants, will close from 6pm on Christmas Day."
2020-12-16T23:45:20Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: pets will need papers for travel to EU and Northern Ireland,"Dog, cat and ferret owners will have to follow new rules if they wish to travel to the EU or to Northern Ireland with their pet following Brexit, it emerged on Wednesday. From 1 January, people travelling from Britain with pets and assistance dogs will need to ensure they have an animal health certificate (AHC) instead of a pet passport no earlier than 10 days before travel, the UK government said on its website. British pets required only a passport while their country was part of the EU. Only vets officially allowed to inspect animals for export can issue the certificates. The same rule will apply for taking animals from England, Scotland and Wales to Northern Ireland. The change is because the UK will have part 2 listed status under the EU Pet Travel Scheme. Owners will also have to ensure their animal is microchipped, and protected against certain diseases. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said dogs, cats and ferrets will need to be vaccinated against rabies 21 days before travelling, and dogs must be treated against tapeworm if they are travelling to some countries. Pets and assistance dogs will also need to enter the EU through a travellers’ point of entry, which includes all the major French ports such as Calais, Caen and Dunkirk. There will be no change to the current health preparations or documents for pets entering Great Britain from the EU or Northern Ireland. Owners have been advised to check the government website for guidelines. UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: “Your vet will be able to advise what you need to do in order to obtain the correct documentation to travel and you can find the latest pet travel advice on gov.uk or by searching ‘pet travel’.” Meanwhile, the government is continuing to press the European commission to secure Part 1 listed status, stating that the UK meets all the requirements for it."
2020-12-16T19:40:01Z,politics,Politics,No 10's Covid press briefings led exclusively by men for past six months,"Downing Street has not used a female minister to lead its coronavirus press conference for more than six months, a tally by the Guardian has found, prompting accusations that Boris Johnson does not value the women in his team. It has also emerged that the government has sent out no female minister as its main representative on the regular morning round of TV and radio interviews for five weeks – and has done so only once in the past two months. Johnson has previously been accused of overseeing an “incredibly blokey” government, with the ministers and aides he most relies on being almost exclusively male – which critics say can affect perspectives on policy decisions. Of 20 cabinet ministers under Johnson, 15 are male. An examination of Downing Street’s list of coronavirus press conferences found that Priti Patel, the home secretary, was the last female minister to front one, on 22 May. The briefings were almost daily on weekdays until the summer, after which they became more intermittent. While Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have led a substantial proportion of recent briefings, since Patel appeared seven other male ministers have also been used, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. Downing Street also designates a minister to handle morning appearances on radio and TV news programmes nearly every day of the week apart from Saturday. Analysis of recent appearances shows that the last female minister to be used by No 10 for this was Michelle Donelan, the junior education minister, on 11 November. Before that, the previous woman was Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, on 14 October. Caroline Nokes, the Conservative former minister who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, said Downing Street “has a blind spot when it comes to using female ministers to get its messages across”. Nokes told the Guardian: “Whatever the issue, the first port of call is always a male minister. I don’t know why that is – there are many really competent female ministers but the media team either forget they exist or just prefer to use men.” Marsha De Cordova, Labour’s shadow women and equalities secretary, said: “What’s really worrying about the absence of a female minister fronting the government’s responses to Covid is that it exposes a lack of diversity at the decision-making table in government. It’s no wonder that the government has paid such little attention to the impact of Covid on women.” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP whose party brief includes women and equalities, said the lack of female voices “is starting to look ridiculous”. She said: “Given the incompetence of this male-dominated government and the confusion they’ve caused through muddled messages throughout this pandemic, perhaps they would benefit from more women making decisions and communicating with the public. “We need diverse voices in parliament and in government to make sure all sections of our communities are represented and listened to. Diversity leads to better decisions and a better democracy.” Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s press secretary, rejected the idea that the lack of female ministers for press conferences and media interviews meant Johnson did not trust them. She said: “He does trust the women in his team. I was not aware of that tally, and I will take it away and have a word with the prime minister about it.” It is understood that Patel was being lined up for morning media interviews on Thursday."
2020-12-16T19:23:07Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: parliamentary recess from Thursday hits hopes for deal approval,"MPs and peers will begin their Christmas break on Thursday evening, the government has announced, amid waning hopes that a Brexit deal will be struck in time to be approved in parliament next week. With talks on trade and security continuing in Brussels amid signs of progress and compromise, ministers had considered stipulating that parliament should sit on Monday and Tuesday to allow legislation implementing a deal to be passed rapidly. However, the government has signalled that the Christmas recess will start on Thursday, with Downing Street sources suggesting a deal is not expected to be finalised imminently. The move does not preclude parliament being recalled before January if a deal were to be struck, however – a process that usually requires 48 hours’ notice. A No 10 spokesman said: “That recall could be as early as next week.”
Alternatively, a bill could be rushed through between Christmas and New Year’s Day, with likely support from Labour. With Boris Johnson appearing more upbeat about the prospects of a deal, some in Westminster interpreted the decision to press ahead with parliamentary recess as a piece of political theatre on the way to an agreement. Earlier on Wednesday, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned the European parliament that the fraught issue of fish could still sink the talks, saying agreement was “so close but yet … so far away”. A No 10 spokesperson said three bills necessary to pave the way for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December would have passed through all their parliamentary stages by Thursday evening. “In the absence of further substantive business, we will – subject to usual approval by the House - go into recess tomorrow [Thursday], but with the knowledge that we will recall MPs and peers to legislate for a deal if one is secured,” the spokesperson said. A Labour spokesperson said: “Boris Johnson should get on with delivering the deal he said was ‘oven-ready’ rather than dragging the country to the wire.”"
2020-12-16T18:44:54Z,politics,Politics,"Theatre of the absurd as Boris tells country: obey the rules, don't obey the rules | John Crace","It all comes down to a matter of personal preference. In the opening question, the Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, had described Keir Starmer as the sort of “smarmy lawyer” that the country didn’t want. Shame then, he didn’t think to mention the alternative on offer. A narcissistic opportunist chancer, who is only on nodding terms with reality and has been sacked at least twice for lying. On balance, given the year we’ve all just had, most would choose a former director of public prosecutions. But there’s no accounting for taste. For what was generally assumed to be the last prime minister’s questions before Christmas, Starmer chose to use the session as a greatest hits roundup. A scorecard of Boris Johnson’s end of year performance. It rapidly turned into a theatre of the absurd as Boris, who appeared to have made an effort to look even more shambolic than usual, yet again failed to answer any of the questions put to him. At one point he even accused Starmer of trivialising the occasion; the height of cheek given that trivialisation has been Johnson’s prime defence at PMQs once he realised it was the only way of dealing with a Labour leader who had his measure. If you turn everything into a joke there’s an even chance that some of the more serious stuff might get missed. And when you’re consistently losing, anything that slips under the radar counts as a win. Starmer began by asking if the country had been too slow to lock down, given the UK is the world’s sixth largest economy and has suffered one of the highest death rates and deepest economic recessions. Boris tugged his hair – a sure tell that he’s about to lie – and said that everything had worked out just fine. With help from Typhoid Dido we had still managed to fit in the Cheltenham festival and it was just petty to quibble about a possible 20,000 extra deaths. Then Johnson went completely rogue. “We have always followed the science,” he insisted. Apart from the times when he hasn’t. Most scientists wanted to go into lockdown sooner in March. They also wanted a further short lockdown in September. And they sure as hell don’t want the five-day Christmas killing zone that the government has set its heart upon. Even more bizarrely, Boris acted as if both the lockdowns the country has been put in were nothing to do with him, and were all the fault of the namby pamby Labour leader. I guess Johnson is often as surprised as the rest of us that he is actually in charge of the country. Time and again, Keir tried to drag Johnson back to reality, but with limited success. He got no answer as to why Dominic Cummings – the man whose 50-mile round trip to Barnard Castle that single-handedly undermined the credibility of the government’s public health messaging – was worth a £40K pay rise when public sector workers were getting a pay freeze. Nor could Boris answer why, if the government’s new tiering system was working, the rate of infection was going up in three-quarters of the country. Instead, he accused the Labour leader of having no plan. Apart from the one that he and the editors of the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal had endorsed. “There is a unanimous agreement that we should proceed with the regulations,” Johnson said, almost exactly at the same time as the first ministers of Scotland and Wales were suggesting their citizens didn’t pay too much attention to the regulations and followed the considerably stricter guidelines and lockdown restrictions that they were issuing instead. It could have been a fudged compromise, but you can never be too sure with Boris as for him language is a moving target. He did, though, say that people should exercise personal responsibility in their choices. Something that is not his strong point: his family have been trying for years to get him to behave responsibly with no great success. Come the close, it wasn’t entirely clear what his message was. Something like ‘Go and visit your relatives but don’t go and visit them’. Schrodinger’s Xmas. Starmer ended by quoting from a Wellingborough Conservative newsletter that suggested it was best to use fake news and say the first thing that came into your head. Boris’s answers throughout the session rather suggested he had taken the message to heart.
There was a rather more serious Johnson on offer at the afternoon press conference with Chris Whitty, but the message remained much the same contradictory nonsense. Obey the rules but don’t obey the rules. The rules are really only there for show – remember it was Boris who promised us that the pandemic would all be over by Christmas – so try not to see anyone, if at all possible. Again, the prime minister appealed to his own terra incognita of personal responsibility yet somehow managed to leave the viewer with a sense that the government had just abdicated its own. Even as Johnson was speaking, Wales was upgrading its Christmas guidance into law. Yet the prime minister has so little sense of personal responsibility either to himself or the nation that he is incapable of reviewing a promise he made last month in the light of new scientific evidence. He knows what the right thing to do is, but is incapable of doing it. We now have Pontius Boris. A leader who has washed his hands of the difficult decisions. He had told people to have a shorter, safer “merry little Christmas” and he believed his job was done. If more people died, then it was their own stupid fault. Come January and February, there may well be a reckoning. Where’s the smarmy lawyer when you need him?"
2020-12-16T18:03:17Z,politics,Politics,Post-Brexit 'right to stay' in UK rule could catch out EU citizens,"EU citizens who have been granted temporary permission to stay in the UK after Brexit could inadvertently lose the right to make that permanent if they have been out of the country for more than six months and do not return by the end of the year, campaigners have warned. Grassroots activists at the3million group have begun a campaign, called “check your absence” to alert those with “pre-settled status” as they believe many may not be aware of the rule. The group is telling EU citizens caught by the rule that if they return to the UK before the end of the transition period, falling on 31 December, they will still qualify for the permanent option as they will have “started the clock” again on their status. One Belgian graduate, Hanne, who left the country more than six months ago to complete her studies, said she was nearly caught out. She was intending to return to the UK in January for what she described as “a fantastic job” with the hope of remaining long term and converting her pre-settled status to settled status under the special Home Office Brexit arrangements for EU citizens. “I realised I was about to lose any claim for settled status unless I managed to get to the UK before the 31 December. Within three days I managed to rent a flat in London and get on a Eurostar [train]. I’m currently quarantining and hopefully will get back to my family in Belgium for Christmas,” she said. Pre-settled status is granted to those in the UK for fewer than five years. Settled status, which allows EU citizens to remain permanently, is only granted to those in the country for five years or more. Under Home Office rules citizens who have pre-settled status can convert to settled status but they must demonstrate they have not been absent for a period of more than six months in any 12-month period up to 31 December. The Home Office will consider exceptions, including serious illness and study. It published guidance this week confirming it considered Covid-19 as a serious illness and would allow absences of up to 12 months. “Your continuous qualifying period will not necessarily be affected if you were impacted by coronavirus public health restrictions. For example, if you had coronavirus overseas and could not return to the UK, or imposed travel restrictions meant you were absent from the UK for longer than planned (providing the period does not exceed 12 months),” it says on the government website. While the guidance has been welcomed, Luke Piper, policy director of the3million, warned that the wording did not make explicitly clear as to who would qualify because of the coronavirus. “There is a risk that people will fall through the cracks by this ambiguity. We look forward to working with the government to understand more who the policy should protect and how it can be clearer,” he said. Hanne, who said many of her friends were in a similar situation, thought it was important to warn others not to make a mistake “that could cost them their future”. She added: “I came very close to losing all my rights to live in the UK because I would not have qualified for settled status and would have lost my pre-settled status irrevocably in four years’ time.” Coline Schupfer, a lawyer from Germany who also had pre-settled status, was hoping to take an overseas posting next year but realised this was out of the question for now. “I’m really annoyed. I think I’m a person who is fairly clued into things, but I had no idea,” she said. Maike Bohn, spokesperson for the3million, said: “It’s important to say that people with pre-settled status who have been away for more than six months do not lose their pre-settled rights if they return next year, but they do lose their right to settled status in these circumstances.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We appreciate that Covid-19 has had an impact on many people’s ability to travel and we have been clear that those with pre-settled status will not be affected if illness or quarantine restrictions have caused them to be absent from the UK for up to 12 months. “However, people with pre-settled status do need to be aware that excess absences will affect their status in the UK and should check the rules before they spend a prolonged period outside the UK.”"
2020-12-16T18:02:24Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: PM says Christmas rules will not change but urges caution and minimal contact with others – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has urged families to limit the length and scale of Christmas gatherings, saying existing rules for a festive respite from Covid regulations across the UK would not be changed â€“ but that people should be extremely cautious.
Fresh lockdown measures are to be imposed in Wales beginning on Christmas Eve, while the law will be changed to limit Christmas mixing to two households, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced. A fifth of people still have coronavirus symptoms five weeks after being infected, with half of them continuing to experience problems for at least 12 weeks, official data suggests, as concerns grow about the scale and impact of â€œlong Covidâ€�. Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has said that he expects the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to be approved for use in the UK by early in the new year. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, when asked when it would be available, he said it was up to the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). He went on: I think thereâ€™s a fair chance that by early in the new year, possibly before, but that entirely depends on the data, they will be able to say whether they are confident that this vaccine is both efficacious and safe. Unicef has launched a domestic emergency response in the UK for the first time in its more than 70-year history to help feed children hit by the Covid-19 crisis. More than 300 passengers were stranded on a ferry overnight in Birkenhead after six crew members tested positive for Covid-19. A clash over EU access to British fishing waters could still sink hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal, Ursula von der Leyen has said, with agreement said to be â€œso close but yet â€¦ so far awayâ€�. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-12-16T13:34:17Z,politics,Politics,UK firms struggling to import as end of Brexit transition period looms,"Manufacturers are stockpiling goods as disruption at Britain’s ports before the end of the Brexit transition period piles pressure on UK companies, raising the likelihood of supply shortages. With little more than two weeks before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union, the latest monthly survey from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) said British companies were struggling to import goods owing to congestion at the county’s main ports. Analysts said the disruption was down to a combination of pre-Brexit stockpiling, frantic efforts to meet Christmas demand and severe backlogs in global shipping during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, concerns are mounting that failure to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU could lead to additional disruption next month. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said: “The concern will be that these problems will become magnified next month when the UK and EU move to new trade terms. Even under a free trade agreement, which we still think is the mostly likely scenario, there will be major changes for businesses.” IHS Markit/Cips said the lengthening of shipment lead times was the third steepest since it began surveying business activity in 1992, exceeded only by two months of heavier delays during the first coronavirus lockdown in April and May. The survey of 1,500 manufacturing and service-sector companies, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England and the government for early warning signs from the economy, found 45% of firms were struggling to cope with longer delivery times from their suppliers. Only 2% reported an improvement from November. Global shipping has been heavily disrupted by coronavirus lockdowns in countries around the world, leaving empty shipping containers scattered across Europe, and leading to delays in Asia and bottlenecks at ports. Honda shut down production at its Swindon plant, its biggest in Europe, last week owing to “transport-related parts delays”. Builders are reporting shortages of power tools, timber and roof tiles, while retailers are struggling to get stock into stores in time for Christmas. Manufacturers and retailers typically rely on “just in time” shipments and “just in sequence” production, meaning delays can quickly cause shortages. According to IHS Markit and Cips, shortages are driving up the cost of goods, which could have a knock-on effect on prices in UK shops. It said a rush to stockpile goods and raw materials before the Brexit deadline had led to the biggest increase in buying by manufacturers since August 2013. But a combination of stretched supply chain capacity, the need to source alternative vendors and the rising price of raw materials led to the steepest rate of cost inflation since June 2018. Duncan Brock, the group director at Cips, said: “Though manufacturing was buoyed up by Brexit panic-buying, and saw the fastest rise in purchasing since August 2013, delivery times increased at the third highest rate since 1992 which meant many essential materials were not getting through.”
The latest snapshot showed the UK economy returned to growth in December, fuelled by the increase in manufacturing activity to beat pre-Brexit deadlines. The IHS Markit/Cips flash composite purchasing managers’ index for the services and manufacturing sectors rose to 50.7 in December, up from 49.0 a month earlier. This is higher than the 50.0 level that separates growth from contraction, but was below the 51.3 forecast of some City economists. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at IHS Markit, said. “The recovery lacked vigour.” Faced with rising coronavirus infections and public health controls, the service sector – which makes up 80% of the UK economy – continued to struggle for growth. “Consumer-facing services, notably hotels, restaurants and tourism, reported further marked declines in output, largely offsetting renewed growth in business services, transportation and manufacturing,” Williamson added."
2020-12-16T09:39:09Z,politics,Politics,"Fish could still sink Brexit deal, says EU's Ursula von der Leyen","A clash over EU access to British fishing waters could still sink hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal, Ursula von der Leyen has said, with agreement said to be “so close but yet … so far away”. In an address to the European parliament, the European commission president said the issue of domestic subsidies, so long a thorn in the side of the negotiators, had been resolved. She reported that legal assurances that environmental, social and labour standards would not be undercut had also been secured, with fruitful continuing discussions on “future-proofing” against unfair competition offering a clear path to an agreement. But Von der Leyen told MEPs that remaining disagreements on the future arrangements for European fishing fleets in UK waters could yet scupper the nine months of negotiations at the 11th hour. “The discussion is still very difficult,” Von der Leyen said. “We do not question the UK sovereignty on its own waters. But we ask for predictability and stability for our fishermen and our fisherwomen. “And in all honesty, it sometimes feels that we will not be able to resolve this question. But we must continue to try finding a solution. And it is the only responsible and right course of action.” The UK wants the power to shut down European boats’ access to its waters but the EU is seeking three months’ notice for its fleet, with the possibility of compensation or the ability to take retaliatory measures. The two sides have not yet found a middle way between the EU offer to repatriate 15% to 18% of the current EU catch by value in British seas to UK flagged vessels and Downing Street’s demand for around 60%. The UK is also refusing access to the zone six to 12 miles from the British coastline where French and Belgian fishing boats have worked for centuries. “We’ve made some progress but we are still very far apart in key areas,” a UK official said. The German chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that a deal could be secured by the end of the week to allow the European parliament to give their consent on 28 December. She said: “With the consent from all of us, the commission continues to negotiate in these hours, in these days, again until the weekend to see - or rather until the end of this week, let’s put it this way - to see whether there still can be an agreement. There has been progress but no breakthrough, but I think we will stick to our opinion, a deal would be better than no deal, but we are also prepared for the latter.” There is growing unrest among MEPs at any suggestion that the deal could be provisionally applied for 1 January and that the European parliament would rubber stamp it at a later date. The left group in the chamber, in which Sinn Féin sit, are among those demanding the right to scrutinise the deal before the end of the year given the potential impact of the agreement on millions of people across Europe. Meanwhile, the Guardian understands that at a two-hour meeting on Monday of EU and UK chief veterinary officers and chief officers of plant health, European commission officials raised concerns about British border preparations for 1 January. EU officials claimed that government health certificates that will be required for livestock, plants and animal products coming into the UK had been shoddily drafted.
The concern for Brussels is in cases where the UK is used as a “land bridge” for goods, such as meat, or livestock that might come from Ireland to the continent. EU sources said the health certificates contained several substantial errors, raising safety issues and potentially limiting the quantity and type of goods that the commission would allow to flow through the UK. An EU diplomat said: “Given the high-profile role of food supplies in the UK Brexit debate this autumn, we were surprised about the degree of preparation.” A follow-up meeting of officials is planned for Friday. A UK government spokesperson said: “We continue to engage with the EU in order to prepare for the end of the transition period, including to ensure we secure the relevant listings where required for trade.”"
2020-12-16T07:10:52Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus: tensions over handling of UK Covid vaccine rollout,"Vaccinating the population against Covid-19 will cost up to £12bn, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has disclosed, amid details of tensions between health bodies over the rollout. The National Audit Office said the government would spend up to £11.7bn on purchasing and manufacturing Covid-19 jabs for the UK before deploying them in England. A report released on Wednesday reveals officials from Public Health England complained that they had been cut out of key decisions despite having previous experience of vaccine delivery programmes.
Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said the report showed that the government was right to have backed a number of vaccines but the accountability arrangements were “highly unusual”. “The organisations who know how to carry out mass vaccination campaigns didn’t always have a seat at the table when decisions were taken. “The logistical challenges of vaccinating tens of millions of people – on top of the other pressures on the NHS – can’t be underestimated,” she said. The report examined how the government has approached developing and planning for a mass vaccination programme. Kate Bingham, the venture capitalist and chair of the vaccine taskforce, was appointed in May and reports directly to Boris Johnson. She has been in charge of selecting which vaccines to purchase and securing UK access to sufficient quantities. NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE&I) and Public Health England are leading on the operational delivery of the vaccination programme in England. The report disclosed that Public Health England raised concerns in June that “operational experience of vaccine deployment was not represented within the senior boards and groups of the Taskforce”. It was not until September 2020 that both Public Health England and NHS England and Improvement had regular senior representation, the report said. Current government plans are to vaccinate up to 25 million people with two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine throughout 2021, but these are subject to change depending on vaccine developments, the report said.
The public purse may incur additional costs because the vaccine contracts each contain a form of indemnity protection for the pharmaceutical companies in case of any legal action arising from adverse effects from the vaccines. No cap has been applied to the amount the government could have to pay if there is a successful claim against the companies in four of the five contracts agreed so far, auditors warned. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as 40 million of the Pfizer/BioNTech, seven million of the Moderna, 60 million of Valneva SE, and 60 million of the Novavax jabs. The Pfizer vaccine is already being rolled out by the NHS after it was approved by the regulator. Bingham, who is married to the treasury minister Jesse Norman, is expected to leave her post at the end of this year. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Thanks to the work of our Vaccine Taskforce, the UK is now in an exceptionally strong position with a diverse portfolio of 357m doses of some of the world’s most promising vaccine candidates. “To ensure our country is in the best position to make any Covid-19 vaccine available as quickly as possible and respond to future pandemics, we have worked to build an entire domestic vaccine manufacturing base from scratch by investing in state-of-the-art facilities across the country.”"
2020-12-15T19:51:34Z,politics,Politics,UK drops push for renationalising of fishing vessels in Brexit talks,"Downing Street has watered down a key demand over post-Brexit fishing rights as part of a broader compromise, EU sources said as Germany’s ambassador in Brussels said there was a chance of a deal by the weekend. The UK dropped a push for fishing vessels operating under the UK flag to be majority British-owned in the future, it was claimed. It came as Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons who is responsible for its timetable, suggested it was “theoretically possible” that MPs could be asked to approve a trade deal retrospectively. “I haven’t heard anyone talk about ratification post-31 December,” he told a ConservativeHome podcast. But Boris Johnson’s spokesman said later this would not happen: “We’re confident that all of the necessary domestic UK legislation required for 1 January will be in force by the end of the transition period.” As talks over a trade and security deal continued, the UK government’s attempt to “renationalise” vessels that are now UK-flagged and are set to enjoy a boost to their catch from new fishing arrangements next year is understood to have been resolved. European-owned vessels under British colours would need to operate under UK standards rather than EU regulations. They would also need to significantly increase the percentage of the catch they land in British ports. One source said the UK now wanted 100% of the catch to be landed in the UK, rather than 70% as previously suggested, but government sources were unable to confirm the details. It is understood the ownership rules are likely to be different for vessels now under the UK flag and those that operate under British colours in the future. The fishing vessels issue had caused problems with Spain and the Netherlands whose citizens have invested in UK-flagged vessels since the 1990s, and its resolution is an important step towards agreement on a deal – although sources on both sides said serious issues remained. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs on Monday that he in turn had compromised on the “architecture” of the agreement on fisheries and that he had accepted that there would be a transition period to phase in changes. But there is no agreement on the proportion of the EU catch in UK waters that will be repatriated nor on whether European fleet will be able to fish in waters six to 12 miles from the UK coast.
Beyond fishing, the two sides are also unable to agree on the terms of the UK’s involvement in the EU’s Erasmus student exchange scheme. The UK only wants to fund student exchanges and opt out of “cooperation actions” through which senior university academics across Europe get together to share ideas. Barnier has told representatives in Brussels that the UK was “cherrypicking”. Despite the outstanding problems, Germany’s ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, told a thinktank on Tuesday that a deal by the end of this week remained doable. He said: “It’s not over yet. We still have a couple of days to go, so we’ll see. End of year hasn’t come yet and I think there’s still clearly the possibility of having a deal, maybe by end of this week. There’s at least a chance.” Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney said there were indications in Brussels that the talks were in the decisive stage. He said: “I think what we’re seeing this week, having had a number of stalls in this process, is slow, but at the same time some, progress. “My understanding is we’re making some progress in that area [the level playing field]. I think you can take it that because negotiating teams have gone really quiet here, that’s an indication to me that there is a serious if difficult negotiation continuing. I’m still hopeful that can result in a successful outcome agreement.” On Monday, Barnier said a “narrow path” to a post-Brexit trade and security deal was possible. If a deal is not secured by this weekend, the European parliament will not have time to scrutinise and vote on a deal. But speaking to the Europe committee of MSPs in the Scottish parliament, the cabinet minister Michael Gove said this should not lead to an accidental no-deal exit. He said: “There is something that the EU has called provisional application, which means if a treaty is agreed, they can choose to apply it from the get go and the European Parliament can approve it subsequently … The UK parliament can still make sure we ratify a deal before 31 December, and the EU has its own processes to ensure a deal is in place.”"
2020-12-15T18:50:53Z,politics,Politics,While we wait to find out about Christmas – two not-so-wise men | John Crace,"It’s just 10 days until Christmas and we are still none the wiser about almost anything to do with the coronavirus restrictions or Brexit. But then in the Commons we had two cabinet ministers whose sole purpose is to know nothing. And, what’s more, they are proud of it. You might have thought their sense of futility would have kicked in by now, but I guess they both still get a thrill out of playing with the electric windows in their shiny ministerial limos. First up was Alok Sharma, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, at departmental questions. Which is in itself an oxymoron as Sharma, one of the nicer ministers you could hope to meet, has never knowingly given a direct answer to anything. And today was no exception, as he had clearly decided, after waffling on for a few minutes about green energy that might happen in 2030 at the earliest, to give himself a break and let his junior ministers do most of the heavy lifting on Covid payouts and companies, such as British Airways, firing and rehiring employees. Sharma’s only vaguely tricky moment came when Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business minister, observed that the hospitality industry had been left totally unsupported now that 60% of the country was in tier 3. This seemed to take Sharma completely by surprise and all he could say was that the government had gone the extra mile to help them. The problem was that many pubs and restaurants had been too conscientious about making their premises Covid secure, which obviously counted against them as currently the government seems to be running a complicated algorithm where the worse you are at your job, the more money you get. Hence Dominic Cummings’s 40% pay rise. For his second question, Miliband moved on to Brexit. There were over 150,000 firms who still didn’t know what forms they would have to fill out in the new year because no one had a clue what the rules were. Other than that all lorries would have to be kept waiting for hours in an unfinished lorry park. This, too, came as a surprise to Sharma who now sounded like he was auditioning for an episode of Pointless Celebrities. “Businesses just want us to do our best,” he said hopefully, before sidestepping any details of what the government’s various options might entail. Because deep down in his subconscious, he has this gnawing feeling that in a few months time the shit will really hit the fan whatever deal or no deal is reached. Just as well no one has got round to telling him that the French are planning to blockade Calais. Still, Sharma comes across as an intellectual heavyweight compared to culture secretary, Oliver Dowden – a man with the hunted look of Foxton’s worst-performing estate agent, who was finally giving a statement, two years after it was promised, of what might appear in the government’s online harms bill. If and when it actually emerges as a white paper sometime next year. The statement was a mirror image of Dowden’s own psyche. Long on “ground-breaking” waffle but short of any real clarity. That something needs to be done about illegal content, disinformation and cyberbullying is not in doubt; it’s Oliver’s ability to deliver it that is the issue. Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, made little effort to conceal her sense of she’ll believe it when she sees it. Dowden looked devastated by the lack of enthusiasm – he really was giving it 110% – and was close to tears, before some colleagues reassured him they were certain it would be a very, very good bill if it ever happened. There was rather more action away from Westminster, with the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, stepping in to fill the indecision at the heart of government with a joint editorial begging Boris Johnson to rethink his plans to turn Christmas into a five-day free for all. Something which Keir Starmer was quick to follow up with his own letter to the prime minister, in which he pointed out the second round of tiering was going no better than the first and that it could be a good time to rethink the idea of hoping everyone would automatically behave sensibly over Xmas. And yes, he knew Boris had made a promise but people had long since stopped expecting him to keep promises. Up in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was making her own coronavirus statement to the Scottish parliament. While the main body of her speech was on the new variant of the virus – thanks for nothing 2020 – and on the moving of three regions up to tier 3, most MSPs were waiting to see if the first minister would go rogue and unilaterally declare the Christmas amnesty null and void. In the past, Sturgeon has not been afraid to go it alone by bringing in restrictions before the other countries of the UK, but this time she was content to hold fire. For the time being, at any rate. Sturgeon was the iron fist in the velvet glove, saying she was happy to work with all four nations but careful not to rule out the possibility of a change of course. It sounded very much like she would be leaning heavily on Michael Gove to have a rethink during their phone call later in the day. So we ended the day as we had started, with no one much the wiser. The government appears paralysed over Christmas. And in the absence of Boris yet to announce the Plan B we all know is probably coming, it looks like a wise move for the rest of us to make our own alternative arrangements."
2020-12-15T18:27:45Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: four-nations Christmas talks to continue tomorrow amid concern over easing of rules - as it happened,"Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been chairing a meeting with leaders from the devolved administrations to discuss whether to change the special Covid rules agreed for Christmas. According to ITV Cymruâ€™s Adrian Masters, another meeting is planned for tomorrow.
And ITVâ€™s Paul Brand says no decision has yet been taken.
PA Media also report talks are expected to resume on Wednesday. A Welsh government spokesman said: â€œThe leaders of the devolved administrations and Michael Gove met this evening to discuss the arrangements over the Christmas period. They will reconvene tomorrow to confirm the position.â€� The meeting was scheduled as the UK government came under increasing pressure to tighten the rules for the holiday period. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Boris Johnson should order a rethink because taking the wrong decision now could have â€œsevereâ€� consequences. (See 1pm.) Two leading medical journals, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, said allowing up to three household to mix over Christmas, as planned, would be a â€œmajor error that will cost many livesâ€�. (See 10.45am.) Before this afternoonâ€™s meeting chaired by Gove, Downing Street said the rules were being kept under constant review. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told MSPs that her government was considering whether the proposed rules should be tightened in the light of the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus, nine cases of which have been discovered in Scotland.

2020-12-15T16:30:38Z,politics,Politics,Johnson 'wasted public money' over adviser sacked by Dominic Cummings,"Boris Johnson wasted thousands of pounds of public money by ignoring formal advice to pay off a special adviser who was escorted out of Downing Street following a clash with Dominic Cummings. Documents released on Tuesday show that the prime minister overruled the advice of the civil service’s chief executive, John Manzoni, in March that the government should seek a settlement with Sonia Khan, a former adviser to the then chancellor, Sajid Javid. Johnson refused to listen to the advice, which meant that the case continued until November, driving up legal costs. Khan was eventually paid between £50,000 and £100,000 in November, days after Cummings announced he would be standing down from Downing Street at the end of this year. Legal sources estimate that the total costs including Khan’s payoff could be nearly £200,000. It has also emerged that Cummings received a pay rise of about £40,000 for his role as Johnson’s top adviser, official figures show. The prime minister’s top aide, who is preparing to officially leave his job on 18 December, is paid between £140,000 and £144,999. It is an increase on his £95,000 to £99,999 salary, which was published in last December’s figures.
Khan was Javid’s media adviser when in August 2019 she was escorted by police from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event. In a letter sent on 3 March, Manzoni wrote: “Given the ongoing expenditure of defending the case and the potential costs that a court may award, it is my advice taking account of legal and financial analysis, that a further negotiation should be carried out to seek to avoid litigation.” Johnson replied by letter the following day. “The legal position is clear that the prime minister can withdraw consent for the appointment of any special adviser. That is the reason for the termination of employment and I am content for a reasons letter to be issued to the individual setting that out. “I do not believe that individuals should receive more compensation than they are entitled to under their contract and therefore I believe this claim should be tested in litigation.” Counsel for Khan argued that what Cummings had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He was expected to be summoned as a witness. Khan, 29, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond’s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. The government finally paid off Khan in November after a five-day hearing for the unfair dismissal case had been set for this month. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which backed Khan’s claim, said: “This is an extraordinary exchange of letters, demonstrating the depth to which the prime minister would go to pursue a vindictive agenda against a special adviser they knew was unfairly dismissed. “The prime minister was happy to waste taxpayers’ money rather than admit he was wrong, even though he knew that by issuing a ministerial direction, his callousness and profligacy with public finances would ultimately be revealed. It was only when faced with the cold reality of having to give sworn evidence in court that they chose to settle.”"
2020-12-15T16:27:14Z,politics,Politics,‘Kamikaze’: the experts urging UK to rethink Christmas Covid rules,"A growing number of experts and politicians are urging the government to rethink plans to relax Covid restrictions over Christmas. They include: Scientists Many are warning that allowing three households to gather for five days will inevitably lead to a rise in infections, a surge in hospital cases, and unnecessary deaths. Prof Andrew Hayward, the director of the UCL institute of epidemiology and healthcare, who has contributed to meetings of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has said that to continue with the easing of restrictions would be “throwing fuel on the Covid fire”. Prof Gabriel Scally, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, has voiced similar concerns. ‘There is no point having a very merry Christmas and then burying friends and relations in January and February,” he has said. Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel prize-winning biologist and previously head of the Royal Society, has also warned of the repercussions of the relaxation, although he said the rules were for the government to make. “I think if restrictions are relaxed as planned, and people take advantage of relaxed rules, it will lead to another surge at a particularly bad time,” he said.
Some scientists, including the epidemiologists Prof John Edmunds of Sage and Prof Chris Whitty, have said the rules are an attempt to find a balance between the desire to meet family and friends and the need to control the virus. But they and others have urged individuals to remember that “can” doesn’t mean “should”. “From a purely epidemiological standpoint we should not relax our guard at Christmas, particularly as the prevalence of Covid in the community remains dangerously high,” Edmunds said. Health experts The Royal College of Physicians said coronavirus restrictions had taken a heavy toll on people and it was understandable families wanted to meet. But it urged people to be very careful. “Our advice has to be: keep your distance at Christmas and don’t spend any longer together than you need to – less is more this year.” However, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal called on Tuesday for Christmas Covid rules to be reversed, warning that should the relaxation go ahead, many lives could be lost. A joint editorial called on the government to “reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing and instead extend the tiers over the five-day Christmas period in order to bring numbers down in the advance of a likely third wave. “It should also review and strengthen the tier structure, which has failed to suppress rates of infection and hospitalisation.” The call has been echoed by the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, whose president, Dr Claudia Paoloni, described the government as setting the NHS up for an avoidable emergency.
“Inaction will mean patients dying needlessly and thousands of critical cases going untreated. The government must move now, urgently, to reverse these kamikaze plans,” she said. Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, has said the relaxation of rules could wrongly give the impression that increasing social contact does not raise risk, while he also flagged worries about the capacity of NHS hospitals to handle a surge in patients in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman, Dr Richard Pugh, has urged the Welsh government to change tack, noting that critical care is already over capacity. The relaxation of rules “makes no sense viewed from a perspective of frontline staff and public health”, he has said. Politicians A growing number of politicians are calling for a rethink of the Christmas rules. Among them, the Tory MP Tobias Ellwood has asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to review the Christmas plan to avert a third wave. “My concern is letting down our guard for five days during Christmas could be very dangerous indeed,” he said. Labour has also called on the government to rethink its rules. In a letter to the prime minister, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, wrote: “Put simply, if you take the wrong decision now, the ramifications for our NHS and our economy in the new year could be severe.” Such sentiments have also been voiced by Labour’s Andy Burham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. The government “is allowing too much. They have given the green light for Christmas but what price will people have to pay. The government has not got the balance right. This is too much,” he has said. Meanwhile … Other countries are already tightening restrictions over the festive period. Among them, Germany will have a lockdown over Christmas, with no more than four guests over the age of 14 allowed at family gatherings between 24 and 26 December. Netherlands and the Czech Republic have also introduced a lockdown over the festive period, with Italy also looking at tightening – rather than relaxing – rules. “This year’s Christmas will be totally different, but that is the result of the situation we are in,” the Czech health minister, Jan Blatný, told a news conference. In the Netherlands, households can have up to two guests a day, expanded to three for 24-26 December, excluding children under 13, while in the Czech Republic public gatherings will be limited to six people indoors and out. • This article was amended on 20 December 2020 to remove a chart that showed out of date (from 2 December 2020) tier levels for local authorities in England."
2020-12-15T16:06:19Z,politics,Politics,Post-Brexit key worker shortage 'may hamper UK economic recovery',"The economic recovery from the Covid-driven recession will be hampered by a post-Brexit shortage of key workers including nursing assistants, senior care workers and dental nurses, the UK government’s migration advisers have warned. In its annual report, the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac) said many of the roles with the highest vacancies in the UK, such as veterinary nurses and welders, require a significant level of training, which could cause a delay in filling jobs and “hinder future economic recovery”.
The migration experts warned the gap was unlikely to be filled by the government’s flagship post-Brexit skilled worker route due to the ongoing economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a renewed focus on domestic workers. The Mac chair, Prof Brian Bell, said: “This is a time of great change for the UK immigration system, with the contribution that migrants can make becoming the focus rather than where they were born. Such major changes are never easy, but there is no denying the significant impact of the ongoing pandemic. “There will be continued economic disruption, with significantly higher unemployment predicted in the coming months. It is considerably more costly to recruit a worker from overseas and it seems less likely that foreign workers will want to move at this time. “It is more important than ever that we monitor migration and keep the system under constant review.” The Mac’s report said there would be limited use of the new skilled worker route, at least in the first half of 2021. Job vacancies have fallen substantially, and most forecasts predict significantly higher unemployment in the coming months, the advisers said. Firms that are still recruiting are likely to receive more applications from the domestic workforce than has been the case in recent years when the labour market has been tight, the committee said. In addition, the report said the immigration system was deliberately designed to make it considerably more costly to recruit a worker from overseas than to recruit from the domestic workforce, while at the same time it seems less likely that foreign workers will want to move countries until the pandemic is under clear control. The end of free movement, at 11pm on 31 December, will mean that all non-Irish EU citizens arriving in the UK after the end of 2020 will be subject to the same immigration rules as those from outside the EU. A Home Office spokesperson said: “People from around the world are already applying through our new points-based immigration, which welcomes people to the UK based on the skills they can provide, not where their passport comes from. “This new fairer, firmer, skills-led system ensures employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, whilst also encouraging employers to train and invest in the UK’s workforce.”"
2020-12-15T15:54:10Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings received £40,000 pay rise while at No 10","Dominic Cummings was handed a pay rise of at least £40,000 for his role as the prime minister’s top adviser, new figures suggest. Cummings, whose trip to Durham during the height of the first national Covid-19 lockdown prompted an outcry, was paid between £95,000-£99,999 in 2019 but a new report reveals his pay packet was bumped up to £140,000-£144,999 this year. The disclosure is included in the publication of a Cabinet Office report (pdf) which details the £9.6m total pay cost – including salary, national insurance and pension contributions – for 102 government special advisers, referred to in Westminster as Spads, from April 2019 to March 2020. Last month, it emerged that Cummings was leaving his Number 10 post, as was his ally, communications chief, Lee Cain. The Cabinet Office report states: “Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings are in the process of leaving their government posts and are not included in the above list. They are, however, included in the December FTE numbers. Both individuals were in PB4 and pay band £140,000-£144,999.” Meanwhile, newly appointed press secretary Allegra Stratton, who will be fronting televised Downing Street briefings next year, earns between £125,000 and £129,999, according to the report. Responding to Cummings’ pay rise, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner, said: “Boris Johnson defended Dominic Cummings when he broke lockdown rules - then awarded him a £50,000 pay rise. Yet he’s freezing pay for key workers and refusing to give our care workers a pay rise to the living wage. “Cummings’ bumper bonus is an insult to key workers denied the pay rise they deserve. It’s another example of how under this government it is one rule for the Tory Party and their friends and another for the rest of us.”"
2020-12-15T15:46:46Z,politics,Politics,"Most child sexual abuse gangs made up of white men, Home Office report says","The majority of child sexual abuse gangs are made up of white men under the age of 30, an official paper has said. The report, which covers England, Scotland and Wales and summarises a range of studies on the issue of group-based child sexual exploitation (CSE), also known as grooming gangs, said there was not enough evidence to conclude that child sexual abuse gangs were disproportionately made up of Asian offenders. High-profile cases including in Rotherham, Rochdale and Telford have involved groups of men of mainly Pakistani ethnicity, fuelling a perception that it is an “Asian problem”. As a result “Asian grooming gangs” have become a cause celebre for the far right, with a number of high-profile figures mounting campaigns across the country. The Home Office paper into the “characteristics” of such gangs, first promised by the former home secretary Sajid Javid in 2018, says while some studies show a possible overrepresentation of black and Asian offenders, it is not possible to conclude this is representative of all grooming gangs. The review was published after criticism that victims of child abuse had been failed because of fear of accusations of racism. It said: “Research has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white. Some studies suggest an overrepresentation of black and Asian offenders relative to the demographics of national populations. However, it is not possible to conclude that this is representative of all group-based CSE offending. “This is due to issues such as data-quality problems, the way the samples were selected in studies, and the potential for bias and inaccuracies in the way that ethnicity data is collected.” It found that while offenders come from diverse backgrounds, groups tended to be of men of the same ethnicities. Money and sex were motivations as well as a sexual interest in children and misogyny, the review said. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “This paper demonstrates how difficult it has been to draw conclusions about the characteristics of offenders.” Sarah Champion, the MP for Rotherham, who has long campaigned on the issue, said: “Going forwards, I want to see a nationally recognised and approved set of triggers that, once met, require local authorities to provide support for children showing signs of harm, rather than the current postcode lottery when it comes to help. “Finally, the government must accept that all children are vulnerable because they are children. However, children’s vulnerabilities would never be exposed without perpetrators looking to exploit them. All children deserve the protection of the state and appropriate resources must be found to allow that.” Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in the north-west, who brought prosecutions over the Rochdale grooming gangs, welcomed the report. “It confirms that white men remain the most common offenders, which is something rarely mentioned by rightwing commentators,” he said. “However, it is not shy in reflecting that south Asian and British Pakistani men are disproportionately found in high-profile cases. “The danger is that by focusing entirely on the ethnicity of the offender, we miss the bigger picture, which is how the unheard, the left-behind women and girls, are invariably the victims. That’s where the government’s attention and action should be primarily focused.”"
2020-12-15T15:11:41Z,politics,Politics,UK ministers criticised for failing to find alternative to unconscious bias training,"An academic whose research has been used by the government to justify scrapping unconscious bias training for civil servants has questioned why ministers have failed to devise alternative plans to combat prejudice in Whitehall. The training, intended to make employees aware of patterns of discrimination and prejudice, is used across the civil service to address prejudice on the grounds of race, sex, sexuality and disability. A written ministerial statement on Tuesday said there was no evidence the training changed attitudes and so it would be scrapped. Julia Lopez, a junior Cabinet Office minister, said the government had produced a summary of available evidence on unconscious bias and diversity training that concluded the training did not change behaviour or improve workplace equality. First among the evidence cited, Lopez wrote that “a systematic review of unconscious bias training examining 492 studies (involving more than 87,000 participants), found changes to unconscious bias measures were not associated with changes in behaviour”. The psychologist who conducted the review of 492 studies, Patrick Forscher, told the Guardian that the funds spent on unconscious bias training should have been spent on other measures to help combat prejudice in the workplace. “I support the idea of scrapping unconscious bias trainings and redirecting the funds toward defining clearly the problems that they want to solve in the civil service related to race/ethnicity, defining how they plan to measure progress toward solving those problems, setting up monitoring systems to measure that progress, devising policy solutions that are more targeted toward those specific problems than unconscious bias trainings. “I would be more in favour of replacing the training with something else,” he said. Public sector unions have also criticised the government’s lack of an alternative strategy. Garry Graham, Prospect’s deputy general secretary, said the government must come up with other measures to replace the training if ministers scrap it. “Hard data, from staff appraisal markings and success in career progression to evidence from staff attitude surveys, show that our workplaces are not as diverse and inclusive as they should be. “While there is a debate as to the effectiveness of unconscious bias training, simply scrapping it without setting out alternative ways to combat discrimination in the work place is not acceptable,” he said. Lucille Thirlby, the assistant general secretary of the FDA civil servants’ union, said: “How will they ensure people are not discriminated against? It’s easier to attack something than do something positive about it.” Learning about unconscious biases was first made a requirement for all Whitehall staff in 2014, with online sessions provided for junior staff and face-to-face lectures for senior mandarins. Nearly 170,000 staff across the civil service have taken part in sessions in the past five years. The curriculum has since been scaled up to include four modules in diversity and inclusion training. The new government review of the academic literature on the training echoes that of a 2018 assessment conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which found a “mixed picture” of its effectiveness. Acknowledging the increasing popularity of the training in organisations across the UK, the commission stated: “This training has been implemented even though some academic research and reports have highlighted the ineffectiveness, and even the negative effects, of UBT [unconscious bias training].” It added that “there remains much academic debate about the accuracy” of the implicit association test, one of the most common measures of unconscious bias, which measures reaction time of how quickly a participant can link positive and negative stimuli to labels such as “male” and “female”. Parliament ran a pilot of unconscious bias training sessions in the wake of Black Lives Matter. It was offered to Liberal Democrat and SNP parliamentarians. Dozens of Conservative MPs have said they would refuse to attend if asked. Government sources said ministers were examining plans to find a replacement for unconscious bias training."
2020-12-15T07:00:03Z,politics,Politics,"Ministers often kept in dark over Britons held abroad, inquiry finds","UK diplomats have failed to give enough priority to cases of British nationals detained abroad, even when there was a high risk they were being tortured, according to a report quietly released by the Foreign Office. The report, commissioned by Jeremy Hunt during his time as foreign secretary, said ministers were often kept in the dark about such cases, and large-scale reform was needed in the way they were handled. It recommended establishing a specialist taskforce, committing extra resources and fostering a new culture of engaging relatives of those detained. The report said relatives often found the government to be secretive, inflexible and more intent on containing an issue politically than agreeing a strategy to resolve it. But it said there was no evidence that the Foreign Office systematically put bilateral political relations ahead of individual cases. Hunt ordered the inquiry when the Foreign Office faced heavy criticism for failing to do more over the arrest and alleged psychological torture by the United Arab Emirates of a British academic, Matthew Hedges, in 2018. He spent six months in jail accused of spying before being sentenced to life imprisonment and then pardoned in November 2018. His family complained that information about his detention was withheld for weeks by diplomats on the basis that it might breach data protection laws. The internal report was completed in June 2019 by Dame Judith MacGregor, a former diplomat, and was not published. Last month the foreign affairs select committee was informed that the report’s recommendations had been accepted and a copy had been deposited in the Commons library. The campaign group Redress requested a copy under freedom of information law. A report by the foreign affairs committee on Iran is expected to make reference to MacGregor’s report this week. It is expected to air criticism of the way cases of Iranian-British dual nationals detained in Iran, such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, have been supported. In interviews with families of those detained, MacGregor was told they wished to be brought more closely into any Foreign Office strategy to resolve their situation, and to receive more proactive communication, and they wanted the Foreign Office to challenge the human rights laws of the countries in which people are detained, and to move from a “manage and contain” strategy to one of resolution. The families told the inquiry that they also “wanted the Foreign Office to be more flexible and more creative in handling their cases: not automatically rejecting wider actions lest they should set a precedent but looking at cases individually and pragmatically – and defending new actions as such.” The inquiry found that the Foreign Office sometimes said it could not share information with families due to data laws. MaGregor said: “It was clear that this can contribute to frustration and a lack of trust if not explained carefully and sensitively and, where possible, as decisions are made.” The report proposed that “ministers are kept informed of all pending complex cases, with the expectation that cases where there is a significant risk of torture/mistreatment or a failure of due process when assessed against international human rights norms will be raised urgently and at the most senior levels.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “While the vast majority of people who request our consular services are satisfied with the support they receive, we are committed to continually improving the assistance we provide. “Dame Judith’s review found the FCDO places the interests and welfare of the individual at the heart of our policy and practice. “We have accepted the review’s recommendations and work is underway to implement them.” • This article was amended on 18 December 2020 to add a response from the Foreign Office that was received shortly after publication."
2020-12-14T21:37:39Z,politics,Politics,Tony Blair rock opera to be staged in London in 2021,"The life of Tony Blair is to be staged as a rock opera next year, featuring a cast of characters including Princess Diana and Saddam Hussein. Tony! (A Tony Blair Rock Opera) will be performed at the Turbine theatre, at Battersea power station in London, next February with lyrics by the comedian Harry Hill. Key political aides during Blair’s time as prime minister from 1997 to 2007 are also to be depicted, including his director of communications Alastair Campbell, adviser Peter Mandelson and deputy prime minister John Prescott. Osama bin Laden, President George W Bush and Blair’s chancellor and successor, Gordon Brown, will also appear as characters in the production, which is one of a number of shows in the festival MTFestUK 2021, which runs from 1 to 13 February. The opera, being performed from 4 to 6 February, will tell the former prime minister’s life story and will play “fast and loose with the facts”, according to the theatre.
Blair was in his first year in Downing Street when Princess Diana died in Paris in 1997. His tenure is remembered for the contentious invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, which led to the execution of Saddam, the country’s former president. Paul Taylor-Mills, artistic director of the Turbine theatre, said: “It’s impossible to ignore the challenges and sheer nerve required to make any kind of announcement during these times. “With all that in mind, I couldn’t be prouder to be associated with the Turbine theatre and everything that it stands for, particularly with regard to investing in and generating new work. “It’s fair to say that MTFestUK 2021 is going to be our most diverse to date and I’m thrilled to be presenting musicals from first-time writers, alongside Tony and Olivier award-winning artists.” It is not the first production based on the 67-year-old former prime minister, who has gone on to set up a global institute and interfaith charitable foundation. Tony! The Blair Musical, a satire written by Chris Bush, and its sequel Tony of Arabia had short try-outs around the start of his third term in charge of the country. In 2016, Corbyn the Musical: The Motorcycle Diaries premiered at the Waterloo East theatre, written by Rupert Myers and Bobby Friedman. It featured an appearance from a character playing the role of Blair and was set in a future where Jeremy Corbyn, then Labour leader, was prime minister and Russia had declared nuclear war on the west."
2020-12-14T20:18:24Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock doesn't seem thrilled with the Christmas gift from Boris | John Crace,"Every cloud has a silver lining. While the increasingly prolonged Brexit trade negotiations – Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen appear on a mission to prove Zeno’s paradox – made most of the headlines in the past week, the coronavirus has been relegated to the second item on most news bulletins. Which proved an unexpected bonus for Matt Hancock as he found his workload dramatically reduced. Only one Downing Street press conference, in which he had precisely nothing to say, and a single Commons appearance in which he did a victory lap of honour after the first vaccine was administered. Otherwise not much really. It was almost a week off. But with coronavirus not showing any signs of going away, Hancock was back in the chamber to give a statement on the crisis. Having begun with his usual remarks about “sacrifice”, “straining every sinew” and “the national effort” that he now cuts and pastes from all his previous statements, Matt got down to the business in hand. It did not make for easy listening. First, there was a new Covid variant that might have been responsible for the increased rates of transmission in the south-east – he hoped, but couldn’t promise, it was no worse than Covid’s first iteration and would respond to the vaccine. Then we got down to the nitty-gritty that everyone already knew because it had been broadcast on social media hours previously. Although the official tiering review date was in two days’ time, owing to the increasing rate of transmission, the government had had to act more swiftly by putting London and parts of Essex and south Hertfordshire into tier 3 as from midnight on Wednesday morning. You could almost sense the panic in Door Matt’s voice as yet another government measure to control the virus had proved only partially effective. Though weirdly some Tories seemed to think the new data meant that their own constituencies should have been placed in tier 1 from the off. Labour’s Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, responded more with sorrow than with anger. As if he was just thankful he wasn’t the minister stuck in the middle of hawkish cabinet colleagues hellbent on keeping as much of the economy open regardless of what the scientists were advising. Ashworth began by saying that it had been only a matter of time before London and parts of the south-east were moved up to tier 3 as that’s where they should have been from the very start of the government’s new system. He also observed that tier 3 didn’t seem to be doing much to control the spread of the virus in Kent, which was already in tier 3. He left the question hanging about whether the government had a plan if tier 3 proved ineffective on a larger scale. So Hancock did not feel obliged to say whether there would be a new level of tier 4, whether he would rethink the tiering system for a third time or impose another national lockdown. For which he gave thanks for small mercies, as all three options must be on his mind. Though stopping short of calling for the five-day Christmas free-for-all to be scrapped, Ashworth did gently wonder if it was a good idea to effectively suspend all three tiers over Christmas. How was allowing any number of people, who may or may not have the virus, travel around the country to spend time with elderly relatives in lower tiers, be, in any sense of the word, safe? The Lib Dem Munira Wilson and the Conservative Tobias Ellwood were rather more forthright. It was clearly insane to risk the health of so many people, so soon after the government had imposed restrictions to mitigate both the load on the NHS and the number of deaths. Here Door Matt sounded genuinely conflicted: his voice became more brittle and he thumped the dispatch box in frustration. You got the feeling that if it was up to him he’d cancel Christmas right here and now. But because Boris had promised the country the treat of allowing everyone the possibility of killing members of their family, the prime minister was determined not to let anyone down. Typical. You wait years for Johnson to keep a promise and he ends up keeping the one you wish he wouldn’t. So all Matt could do was just offer a few platitudes. Just because people were able to see their families, he said, it didn’t mean they were actually obliged to do so. Most people’s Christmases ended up with some kind of row, so why not cut your losses ahead of the game and just stay at home after all? Or just travel 200 miles to see your grandparents and then merely speak to them through the window for a few minutes. Somehow, I’m not sure that one’s going to catch on.
At the Downing Street press conference an hour later, some of the negativity appeared to have rubbed off on Hancock. The last few months have left him scarred and there are few signs of the old enthusiastic Tigger. Predictably, most of the questions were about the wisdom of the five-day Christmas amnesty and, with Chris Whitty sounding less than thrilled about the prospect – the most he was prepared to say was that it was a time of year when people like to see their relatives but they should do so responsibly, aka not at all – Matt became noticeably more evasive on when or whether there should be further restrictions. “People should be cautious,” Matt said cautiously, before insisting he wouldn’t be afraid to take further action if required. Though he hedged his bets on whether that action would come before or after Christmas if infection levels continued to rise. Not least because that was a decision well above his pay grade."

2020-12-14T18:37:01Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer under fire for failing to challenge radio caller's racism,"Keir Starmer has been criticised for failing to challenge a caller to a radio phone-in who advanced a racist conspiracy theory and hailed Israel as an ethnonationalist utopia. The caller to his LBC phone-in said she opposed footballers taking a knee in solidarity with antiracism “because if anything the racial inequality is now against the indigenous people of Britain, because we are set to become a minority by 2066”. The claim is a feature of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory that claims elites are using migration to make white people an ethnic minority in Europe. “We just have to look across to the Middle East,” the caller continued. “Israel has a state law that they are the only people in that country to have self-determination. Well why can’t I as a white British female have that same right?” A controversial law was passed by Israel’s government in 2018 declaring that only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country. It has been criticised by the EU and Israeli civil rights groups, and denounced by Arab Israeli politicians as “the death of our democracy”. In response, Starmer told the caller: “We all have those rights.” He defended the taking the knee gesture and added that he thought “the vast majority of people do want a more equal society”. The Labour leader’s response drew criticism from his own MPs. “When white supremacist conspiracy theories and racist undemocratic laws are promoted on national radio, they must be called out and vigorously challenged,” said Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South. Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said: “For neither the presenter nor Keir to, at the very least, explore further, unpack and robustly challenge such an extreme statement is frankly appalling.” Nadia Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, said: “This is a ‘great replacement’ conspiracy theory as old as time. We must be able to recognise and robustly challenge white supremacy – especially when it is promoted on national radio.” The incident comes as Labour struggles with its relationship with minorities. Starmer was this month urged to return money from a party donor whose tweets have been condemned by Muslim groups as Islamophobic, weeks after a survey of Muslim supporters found a lack of trust in the leadership. There have also been reports this year of a disalignment of black voters from the party. Faiza Shaheen, the director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies thinktank, who ran as a Labour candidate in 2019, said: “There’s part of me just shutting down completely from the UK political scene. It just feels like no one has our back here now, and it is just too painful.” On Monday night, Labour issued a statement saying Starmer “completely rejects the racist conspiracy theory that this caller espoused”, and that under his leadership “the Labour party stands for a patriotism that is built on the total inclusion of Brits from all ethnic backgrounds”. “Keir gave a robust defence of sportspeople taking the knee to shine a light on the deep racial inequalities and injustices against black, Asian and minority ethnic people that exist in our society,” the statement said."
2020-12-14T17:04:28Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade deal possible within days after Johnson concession, says EU","A post-Brexit trade and security deal could be sealed as early as this week after Boris Johnson made a key concession at the weekend but the pathway to agreement remained “very narrow”, Michel Barnier told ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels. The EU’s chief negotiator said the prime minister’s acceptance of the need to ensure that there was fair competition for British and European businesses as regulatory standards diverged over time had unlocked the talks despite difficult issues remaining. “For the first time,” Barnier said, the UK government had “accepted a mechanism of unilateral measures”, such as tariffs, where there were “systemic divergences which distort trade and investment”. “But this mechanism needs to be credible, effective and quick,” he added. “We are working on this.” Sitting on a panel next to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said there was “movement”. “That is good,” she said. “We are talking about a new beginning with old friends. We are on the very last mile to go. But it is an essential one. We want a level playing field, not only at the start, but also over time and this is the architecture we are building.” “We are fine about the architecture itself but the details in it, do they really fit?” she said. “These are crucial points. If the UK wants a seamless access to the single market of the EU – and it’s the largest one in the whole world – they are welcome, but they have to play by our rules.” A Downing Street spokesman said the government was “committed to try and bridge the gaps that still exist”. “We’ve been clear that we will continue to work, and hope to reach a free trade agreement,” he added. “Obviously, no deal is a possible outcome. Time is in very short supply and it has been for some time.” A UK source said they would be vigilant to ensure that Brussels did not introduce “dynamic alignment” of EU and UK regulatory standards. Despite positive signs on the so-called level playing field provisions, Barnier claimed talks over a deal on fishing had gone backwards, raising the risk they could run deep into December. “The next few days are important, if a [UK-EU deal] is to be in place on 1 January, 2021,” Barnier tweeted. “Fair competition, and a sustainable solution for our fishermen and women, are key to reaching a deal.”
He complained that the UK believed that as it had made efforts on the level playing field, then the EU should reciprocate with concessions on fishing quotas and the frequency of negotiations. “But it does not work like this,” he said, according to sources. Barnier told MEPs the government had tabled a paper on fisheries on Monday, only to take it off the negotiating table on Thursday and that Downing Street was seeking to “renationalise” fishing boats by insisting vessels under the UK flag should be majority British-owned. UK sources said the flow of papers in the talks was a normal part of the negotiation process. “We have always been absolutely clear that the UK will have control over access to our waters and better deal for UK fishing communities – there is simply no truth in idea that we have backtracked,” the source added. The UK’s move on the so-called “evolution clause”, ensuring there is recourse to unilateral tariffs should standards significantly diverge, also left work to be done on how it would work in practice, Barnier said. According to EU sources, he explained that there were three scenarios: a deal struck by the end of this week allowing for ratification by the European parliament on 28 December; a breakdown in the talks; or agreement being found at the end of the year and the deal being “provisionally applied” to avoid a no-deal exit, with MEPs giving their consent in 2021. Alternatively contingency measures could be arranged to bridge the gap between a no-deal and ratification. The suggestion that the UK had made a key concession riled officials in London, who hit out at what they described as “inaccurate briefings” by the Brussels negotiators. “Talks remain difficult and we have not made significant progress in recent days, despite efforts by the UK side to bring energy and ideas to the process,” a UK government source said. “The inaccurate briefings from the EU side in recent days have made a difficult discussion even more challenging in the short period of time we have left.” France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said on Monday the talks would have to progress rapidly. “It will be very difficult to go beyond the end of the week,” he said. “Not just because of ratification, but because we need two weeks to organise. Companies are getting anxious. We cannot get to 5pm on 31 December without companies knowing what will happen the next day.” Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said, however, that there was no rush. “As long as an agreement is possible, we will keep negotiating,” he said. An EU diplomat said: “There might now be a narrow path to an agreement visible – if negotiators can clear the remaining hurdles in the next few days. There has been some progress in the negotiations over the last few days, but – sometimes substantial – gaps still need to be bridged in important areas like fisheries, governance and level playing field. “Success depends on whether London also wants a fair deal and is ready to accept the inherent trade-offs.” The sticking points on fishing remain the UK demand on annual negotiations and the amount of catch that will be repatriated to British vessels. The UK is also pushing back against the inclusion of fisheries within the scope of sectors that could have tariffs applied to them if there is divergence in environmental, social and labour standards over time."
2020-12-14T16:59:48Z,politics,Politics,MPs could sit between Christmas and new year to pass Brexit deal,"MPs may need to sit in parliament between Christmas and new year to pass any Brexit deal in order to meet the deadline for the end of the transition period on 31 December. The EU is hoping talks will be concluded to allow ratification by the European parliament on 28 December. If talks go on longer, it is possible for any deal to be “provisionally applied” to avoid a chasm of no deal until the agreement is ratified, to allow time for MEPs to scrutinise and pass the deal early in 2021. Otherwise contingency measures could be arranged to bridge the gap. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels that a post-Brexit trade and security deal could be sealed as early as this week after Boris Johnson made a key concession over the weekend on regulatory standards. However, MEPs are likely to be far from happy at the lack of time for scrutiny and for translation of the deal. It will need to be accepted by all EU member states and the commission has accepted there will need to be a “very flexible, fast process”.
If a deal is clinched this week, Downing Street hopes to hold a vote early next week before the Christmas break, the date of which has not been set. However, there are still difficult negotiations take place around fishing rights, which EU sources have said could drag on longer. Though time is extremely short, parliament can work quickly to pass legislation if a deal is done. Downing Street has confirmed MPs will have a vote if a deal is reached. “If a deal is agreed, it will require legislation to come into force,” a No 10 spokesman said. “MPs will therefore of course get a vote on any deal before this legislation receives royal assent and becomes law.” Some Conservative MPs – even hardline Brexiters – would be likely to view a very short extension pragmatically to allow time to ratify a deal. The former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who has been critical of any concessions to the EU on level playing field negotiations, said: “If push comes to shove, they can give themselves a bye post-31 December of a month while the sides sort out their legislation, as long as these issues are sorted satisfactorily.” Labour has all but confirmed that its MPs will be whipped in favour of backing a deal. Speaking to LBC on Monday, Keir Starmer said the party was clear that a deal was in the national interest if the alternative was no deal. “We’ll look at a deal if they get it,” the Labour leader said. The decision by Labour to back a deal – even if a substantial number of MPs abstain – will give the prime minister some room for manoeuvre in negotiations knowing he will have no issues in parliament passing the deal. If there is no deal then MPs will not get any automatic right to vote on the decision to leave without trading terms on 31 December. A number of Conservative MPs have had conversations in recent days about whether any parliamentary steps could be taken to prevent no deal – after MPs mounted audacious bids in parliament last year to pass legislation to force extensions, enabled by some flexibility from the Speaker at the time, John Bercow. However, with Johnson’s substantially increased majority and a new Commons Speaker in place, it is unlikely there are any parliamentary moves that could stop a no-deal Brexit."
2020-12-14T16:09:41Z,politics,Politics,Brexit will hit UK economy like a 'slow puncture',"Brexit will hit the British economy like a “slow puncture”, a leading industrialist has warned, with disruption to business to last at least six months even if a trade deal is reached. Juergen Maier, the former chief executive of German electronics giant Siemens, warned that businesses were starting to shift parts of their operations to other countries in the EU while at the same time decrying the “nationalist” headlines over the weekend claiming Angela Merkel wanted the UK to “walk on broken glass” to secure a Brexit deal. He said many people were under the illusion that a deal would be a panacea not realising that the mountain of red tape cross-border suppliers face will kick in whether there is a deal or not. Hopes that cross-border supply chains will quickly recover from the pre-Christmas stockpiling that has resulted in gridlock in Dover and Calais are wide of the mark. “It’s going to be a pretty tough for the first six months,” he said. “That is what I am hearing from the groups that I am on,” he said. A member of government’s industrial strategy council and the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Maier is a leading business commentator with the ear of the government, Whitehall and business. He says Brexit will be felt deal or no deal but warns that “those who think a deal is going to miraculously resolve the situation” are wrong. “It’s a slow puncture of the economy is how I describe it, because people will have made their contingency plans to lose bits of their production; to move parts of their research and development over to other places where it’s easier to do it from. “They will just start acting on it slowly,” he said in relation to the flight of business caused by Brexit.
“You don’t suddenly just take all of your operations and shift them to the Netherlands or France, you move bits of it or you might also plan that the next generation of products you’ve developed might be for a European factory as opposed to a UK factory. So this will be a slow burn,” he said. Born in Germany, but an Austrian-British national, Maier has spent years at the helm of pan-European companies and knows how sensitive they are to the Brexit rhetoric of the past four and a half years. He said there were real consequences to the “irresponsible” and “xenophobic” headlines over the weekend quoting “government sources” claiming Merkel wanted “the UK to walk across broken glass” to get a Brexit deal. “It is just rhetoric that is nationalist, and comes at exactly the wrong moment. The timing of it was particularly dreadful, with two blocs the UK and the European Union, trying their damnedest to solve something we all know is hugely difficult. “The term ‘oven ready’ is just another piece of rhetoric and to irresponsibly add fuel to the fire with nationalist statements like that are just horrible,” he said. “For German business, the UK was always seen as the most reliable partner in Europe. German businesspeople are feeling incredibly sad that their trusted reliable partner, at least for now, can no longer be trusted, because of things like the internal market bill and the language we saw at the weekend. Looking ahead to the next few days and weeks, he has urged the government to provide what he calls an “adjustment period” to avoid the cliff-edge Brexit and allow businesses get accustomed the new customs and standards red tape that comes in on 1 January deal or no deal. He also called for urgent publication of the rules of origin formula the EU is going to apply to imports. Industry figures expect they will be able to continue to export if 55% of their products are made in the UK or the EU but this has not been confirmed. Car companies using Japanese parts have already said their businesses could be unsustainable if the quota of British-made products is too high."

2020-12-14T11:40:24Z,politics,Politics,Tracy Brabin running to become the 'Andy Burnham of West Yorkshireâ€™,"The Labour MP and former Coronation Street star hoping to become the “Andy Burnham of West Yorkshire” is running to be the region’s mayor because she’s “sick of all the metro mayors being men”. Tracy Brabin, who became the MP for Batley and Spen after the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, was selected as Labour’s candidate on Friday. She won just over 50% of the votes, beating Bradford’s council leader, Susan Hinchcliffe, into second place and the lawyer Hugh Goulbourne into third. In an interview with the Guardian, Brabin warned that the Conservatives would “throw everything” at the inaugural elections in May 2021. The mayor will represent around 2.3m people in Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Kirklees and the Calder valley. Brabin, who grew up on a council estate in Batley and went on to play Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street in the 1990s, said she decided to run because Labour needed a mayor who the public would recognise. “If that comes from Corrie, I don’t care, because at least then they will be listening, potentially, to what I’ve got to say,” she said. But she admitted her primary motivation was to stop the mayoralties being all run by men. “All you have at the moment is men in suits – or men in parkas, in Andy Burnham’s case,” she said. If she wins, she plans to give up her Westminster seat, believing being mayor is a “24/7 job”. Her former Westminster colleagues Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, did the same in 2017 – though Dan Jarvis, the mayor of the Sheffield city region since 2018, an unpaid post, kept on his job as Labour MP for Barnsley Central after devolution proposals were watered down in his region.
Brabin warned that Labour was not a shoo-in to win the election: “The campaign is going be incredibly different this time around. It’s going to be online. People have got so much else going on in their lives. The Tories are going to throw everything at it, and they outspend us on Facebook [adverts].” She added: “We can’t rely on the failures of the government to give us a Labour mayor here. As we’ve seen in the red wall seats, nothing can be taken for granted. And certainly a low turnout, because people’s lives are so busy, could deliver a Tory mayor … anybody who thinks this will be a pushover is in for a shock.” The Conservatives won a string of Labour seats in West Yorkshire in last year’s general election, including Wakefield, which had been Labour since 1932, and the swing seats of Keighley and Dewsbury. Nine out of 22 constituencies in the region are now represented by Tories, who have yet to select their candidate for the mayoral race. Metro mayors were the invention of the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who always believed they had the power to transcend traditional party politics. He was proved right in 2017 when the Tees valley, previously a Labour stronghold, elected a Conservative, Ben Houchen, to be its first mayor. Andy Street, former managing director of John Lewis, also became the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands that year. Brabin warned that the Conservatives were likely to resort to “pork barrel politics” which could sway voters, such as the £3.6bn towns fund, which favoured Tory marginal seats over more deprived areas, and the £4.8bn “levelling up” fund, which will be administered from Whitehall. Brabin pledged to make the case as a Yorkshire woman for God’s Own County: “I think we do have enormous potential here to be the best place in the country to live and work and to grow up and have a family and to get old and to start a business,” she said. The government had to transfer “real powers” to the mayors, said Brabin, noting that while Covid had thrust the mayors into the spotlight, they still lacked key hard powers. If elected, she said her first task would be to assess “how decimated” West Yorkshire’s economy had been by Covid. Then she wants to push for a “mass transit system” to connect the region’s towns and cities, noting that her constituents in Cleckheaton cannot get to Leeds by train. She also wants to introduce a “fair work charter” which she said would encourage employers to provide “decent paying jobs”. She would then push for the West Yorkshire combined authority to only procure goods and services from companies that signed up. An independent remuneration committee has yet to decide on the West Yorkshire mayor’s pay, but Brabin said she expected the same salary as Burnham, who earns £110,000 a year but gives 15% of it away each month to his homelessness charity. “I believe in equal pay, absolutely,” she said."
2020-12-14T07:00:28Z,politics,Politics,'It feels gruelling': new Tories reflect on difficult year,"When Boris Johnson swept to victory in 2019, the whirlwind brought with it nearly 100 new Conservative MPs, the biggest new intake since 2010. Many from the northern “red wall” did not expect to be elected – and none could have predicted the first year they would experience. “Is there anything good about being an MP? I’ll let you know when Covid finishes,” joked Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South, who has one of the slimmest majorities of the new intake. “My daughter is two and she’s old enough to know that I am not there and it’s hard when I get back from London at the end of the week and am completely knackered.” Conservative whips have found the new intake difficult to contain. Commentators have been struck by their strong feelings about public spending in left-behind towns as well as an appetite to wade into the so-called “culture wars”. And Boris Johnson is known to be particularly keen to please them, spending time giving them personal briefings at key votes and calling them directly if there is a sign they will rebel – a source of consternation for some of the longer-serving Tories. James Grundy, the MP for Leigh and the first Conservative MP to represent the constituency, is among those who was surprised to find himself in Westminster. “I thought we’d have a good go of it and I’d happily return to being a local councillor the week after the general election,” he said. “And before we could draw breath, we launched into this massive crisis, which has taken up the rest of the year. It feels simultaneously gruelling and never-ending and also feels like five minutes ago I was elected.” A third of the new MPs are from the so-called red wall seats gained from Labour, but there are some who are ex-remainers, or self-described “one nation” Tories. One of the new names in that tradition is Laura Farris, the MP for Newbury, who previously worked for Hillary Clinton. “I actually hated the place that that Brexit debate took us, I hated what had become of politics and society more generally. I do actually feel that this year has, I suppose, in a way brought us together,” she said. The 2019 election saw the retirement of a number of very high-profile Conservative MPs, many of whom had been key opponents of Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy. Among those leaving parliament was the father of the house, Ken Clarke. His successor, Ruth Edwards, has had to battle with getting to know a new constituency of Rushcliffe, which her predecessorhad held for five decades, while being unable to meet many people in person. “I knew I passed muster when he described me in the Times as ‘not a rightwing fire-breathing loon’,” Edwards said. She said her predecessor had to assure her that not all years were like the first 12 months. “We’ve had floods, we had a three-day fire, we had a pandemic, you know, I mean, we haven’t quite seen the four horsemen of the apocalypse, but sometimes it’s felt like it hasn’t been far off,” she said. New MPs had only been in parliament for less than four months when the pandemic struck. “I think our caseload went up by about three fold,” Edwards said. “And in this case, everything was urgent, and everything was important. We’re talking about livelihoods, access to essential supplies.” Apart from coping with an unprecedented pandemic and restrictions on normal life, the MPs have had to address extremely controversial issues which many found bruising, including the row over free school meals, the A-levels debacle and the misdemeanours of the PM’s former aide Dominic Cummings. Wakeford abstained on the Labour motion to provide free school meals over half-term though there was a protest outside his office. “The protesters were all from Momentum and the People’s Assembly. Trying to explain to a year 9 class in my constituency why I had abstained was a much trickier one,” he said. Grundy, who voted with the government, said he was prepared to defend that position. “I actually got fewer emails and letters about it than I did about Dominic Cummings,” he said. “To some degree the abuse and the obnoxiousness is kind of like a low-level background radiation when you’re in public office. It shouldn’t be, but it is.” Fewer new MPs have rebelled on the coronavirus restrictions, but many new members, particularly in northern towns, are starting to feel the strain of the restrictions on local businesses, with their areas having been under tougher curbs for longer periods than other places in the south. Wakeford is among those who has rebelled on Covid restrictions, the first time on the 10pm curfew. “That prompted a bollocking from the whips along the lines of: ‘We worry you are going to become a serial rebel. Tell us, what are your concerns?’” he said. “My concern was that we weren’t following the science, but sarcasm doesn’t go down well.” Simon Fell, a former cyber-crime expert who won a 5,789 majority on a huge swing from Labour in the Cumbrian town of Barrow, said he had not yet rebelled “but had to be talked down off a window ledge” to vote for the post-lockdown restrictions last week. “I just wasn’t happy with the data on it.” Fell said that on the whole, people in Barrow seemed willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt on its handling of Covid, but less so on Cummings and free school meals: “It’s a delicate job we’ve got now as – and I hate the phrase – red wall MPs. We’ve got to sound different, talk different and do different than people would expect the Tories to do. The Cummings situation was the perfect example of ‘one rule for us’.” Many MPs, particularly those in traditional Labour seats, said the opposition was not making much of an impression. “I don’t know if I would win if there was a general election tomorrow,” Wakeford said. “Obviously Keir Starmer is doing better in the polls. but that’s mainly because he’s not Corbyn.” Farris said she believed even MPs in safe seats were determined to secure the constituencies won in 2019 because of the historic resonance they had. “It is obviously quite an amazing thing to sit next to MPs from, you know, Wakefield and Darlington and Grimsby.”"
2020-12-14T06:01:27Z,politics,Politics,Peers call for universal credit boost to be made permanent,"A Lords committee has urged the government to make permanent an increase in the value of universal credit benefits to address poverty and job losses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. In a report calling for a “new deal” for jobs to prevent a surge in unemployment next year, the Lords economic affairs committee said there was an urgent need to reform the benefits system and make additional plans for job creation. Calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to shift spending away from emergency wage subsidies, the committee said the government should focus on creating job opportunities for people who are most at risk of unemployment. It said the temporary £20 a week increase in universal credit made by the chancellor at the outset of the pandemic in March, which is due to end in April, should be made permanent. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, the committee chair, said it was “obvious” the government would have to address the universal credit issue. “Otherwise they are going to have several other famous footballers running campaigns,” Forsyth said, in a reference to the lobbying from Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford for free school meals. The committee’s intervention is likely to pile pressure on the government after warnings from experts that failure to change course would drive up poverty levels. Ending the increase would leave as many as 6 million poor households £1,000 a year worse off at a time of intense economic disruption. Official figures are expected to confirm on Tuesday that unemployment in the UK rose above 5% for the first time since 2016 during the three months to October, before the government committed to extending the furlough scheme until March. The jobless rate is expected to peak at about 7.5% next summer, equating to as many as 2.6 million people unemployed, as the furlough scheme is scaled back. The Lords committee, which is responsible for holding the Treasury to account, said additional government support was needed to create jobs next year as the system of wage subsidies comes to an end. “This means creating jobs to repair the UK’s ‘social infrastructure’, the urgency of which has been exposed during the Covid-19 pandemic, by increasing the number of social care workers and investing in the childcare sector. It means prioritising sustainable infrastructure projects that can be delivered at scale, quickly, and across the whole of the UK,” the committee said. Ministers should launch a new “jobs, skills and training guarantee” for every young person not in full-time education or work for one year, according to the report, which also called for the government to step up plans for protecting jobs and helping people to improve their skills. Forsyth said the government had given the impression that the economic crisis would be short-lived and “everything will be fine by spring” as Covid vaccines become available. However, he said the government was “sleepwalking into an unemployment crisis” as restrictions remained in place and job losses continued to rise. “Rishi Sunak has done his winter economic plan. He needs another for the spring or he will have a big unemployment problem. He needs to get ahead of the curve,” he said. “What this report is trying to do is get the government to wake up and have a plan.” Forsyth said the committee thought skills and training should have been part of the furlough scheme, and he was “disappointed “ the chancellor had not made the temporary increase in universal credit permanent. “There are 5 million people on universal credit and more job losses coming in the new year. This is something that needs to be addressed.”"
2020-12-13T23:05:46Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn to start global social justice project ‘for the many’,"Jeremy Corbyn has announced plans for a new organisation to support social justice, peace and human rights in the UK and around the world. The former Labour leader said his Peace and Justice Project would “bring people together” to create “a future that works for the many, not the few”. Corbyn, now sitting as an independent MP after a damaging report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into antisemitism in the Labour party under his leadership, will launch the initiative next month. The project will aim to bring people together to support social and environmental justice, peace and internationalism, and will focus on combating poverty, inequality and unaccountable corporate power, the Islington North MP said. “The aim of the Peace and Justice Project will be to bring people together for social justice, peace and human rights in Britain and across the world. It’s there to create space, hope and opportunity for those campaigning for social justice and a future that works for the many, not the few,” Corbyn added. Corbyn, who was replaced as Labour leader by Sir Keir Starmer in April, added that his project would promote global cooperation, climate justice, self-determination, democracy and human rights by working with social movements and trade unions to build networks for progressive change. The project will launch on 17 January after an online event featuring the Labour peer Christine Blower, the Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, and the Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Outlining his plans, Corbyn said: “We will combine research and analysis with campaigning and organising. And we can build on the popular socialist policies developed in the Labour party over the past five years. “This year, many of us have felt powerless in the face of forces beyond our control. It doesn’t have to be like that. Things can, and they will, change.” Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, welcomed the initiative saying: “Coronavirus has shown again how neoliberalism is incapable of dealing with the huge crisis our societies face. Now, more than ever, we need to be united in our struggles across the world against neoliberalism and inequality.” Corbyn was suspended from the Labour party after saying the scale of the problem investigated by the EHRC had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. He has since made a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to “tolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it”, and has been readmitted to the party with a warning. However, Starmer has suspended the Labour whip until early next year, requiring Corbyn to make a formal apology."
2020-12-13T21:59:34Z,politics,Politics,Johnson and EU vow to go 'extra mile' to thrash out Brexit deal,"Britain and the EU enter the final stretch of the Brexit negotiations with renewed hope of a deal being struck within days after Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen agreed to “go the extra mile” and ordered the resumption of talks in Brussels. As the prime minister played down expectations following a telephone conversation with the European commission president, EU embassies in Brussels were briefed that “progress has been made” and that “the next days will be important”. UK negotiators are expected to stay in Brussels until at least Tuesday. There were reports over the weekend that government sources had put the chances of no deal at 80%. The leaders’ phone call at noon Brussels time on Sunday had been presented as a point by which a “firm decision” would be made on the prospects of a trade and security deal, with Johnson saying on Friday that it was “very, very likely” the talks would end in failure. In the event, shortly after the phone call, Von der Leyen and Johnson released a joint statement saying: “Despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations, despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over, we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile.” It said the two sides had a responsibility to keep on working. “We had a useful phone call this morning. We discussed the major unresolved topics. Our negotiating teams have been working day and night over recent days.. “We have accordingly mandated our negotiators to continue the talks and to see whether an agreement can even at this late stage be reached.”
However, in a separate statement, Johnson said he had briefed the cabinet to be ready for a no-deal exit. The prime minister said his request to open talks directly with Berlin and Paris had been rejected. “The commission is very determined to keep the negotiations the way that they have been done between us, and that’s fine,” he said. “The most likely thing now is of course that we have to get ready for WTO [World Trade Organization] terms, Australia terms, and don’t forget everybody, we’ve made huge preparations for four and a half years … perhaps more intensively in the last couple of years.” He added: “I think that the UK should continue to try. And I think that’s what the people of this country would want me to do. We’re going to continue to try and we’re going to try with all our hearts and we’ll be as creative as we possibly can. But what we can’t do is compromise on that fundamental nature of what Brexit is all about.” The former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said MPs now expected that the talks would go to the wire, though others said the negotiations must be done in time for parliament to scrutinise the deal. “It is dawning on European leaders that we are serious about leaving without a deal,” Duncan Smith said. “We are now at the end of the beginning. Between now and the 31st is where we will get serious compression.” He said Johnson would have a “problem back home” if there was any give from the UK side on the level playing field terms. However, he said a short extension to allow for ratification might even be acceptable as long as a deal was done by the 31st. “If push comes to shove, they can give themselves a bye post-31 December of a month while the sides sort out their legislation, as long as these issues are sorted satisfactorily,” he said.
David Jones, the vice-chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said MPs would be prepared to read a deal on Christmas Day and vote in between Christmas and the new year, but he said it would be highly preferable for MPs to scrutinise the deal, including taking legal advice, before the final deadline. Von der Leyen travelled to Paris on Sunday to see Emmanuel Macron for a pre-scheduled dinner. In Berlin, Angela Merkel said the EU “should try everything” to get an agreement. Johnson said he had wanted to involve Merkel and Macron in the talks but had been rebuffed again by the commission. “The negotiating position hasn’t changed in any way, and the fact that the talks are not easy is clear,” Merkel said. “Britain is leaving the internal market, and we of course need to make sure that there are fair conditions for competition in place if the legal situation between the UK and the EU moves further apart.” Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: “I think both sides do want a deal and they want a deal now. My view is that a deal can be done, but it really needs to be done within the next few days.” EU sources said the two sides were finding common ground over clauses in a potential deal designed to ensure neither side could undercut the other as they set their own regulatory standards.
The negotiations between the teams led by the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, ran until midnight on Saturday, with the British team ending the evening with bacon sandwiches in the UK ambassador’s residence. Johnson said the UK and the EU “remain very far apart on these key issues”, adding: “Let’s see what we can achieve … if Ursula is optimistic, then that’s great … as far as I can see there, there are some serious and very difficult issues that currently separate the UK from the EU.” The biggest stumbling block to a deal has been the EU’s demand for an “evolution” or “ratchet” clause in the treaty that would create a mechanism to ensure that a minimum baseline of environmental, social and labour standards evolves over time, to ensure there is no significant distortion of trade.
Downing Street has said the EU’s proposals would tie the UK to follow regulatory changes in Brussels on pain of automatic tariffs. Arbitration over those tariffs would only then follow. It is understood that the EU has agreed that tariffs should be applied only once there is clear evidence that regulatory changes by one side have significantly distorted trade. Frost tabled a fresh proposal on Saturday. In a sign of a meeting of minds, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, agreed that comments from the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, on Friday about the need for a “structured” way to address distortions to trade had been welcome. Raab said: “Mark Rutte is one voice, he is normally pretty pragmatic, we are normally quite close to the Dutch on these matters … There are plenty of other voices. The bottom line is this: are we required to follow EU rules past, present, future and do we have a situation where when we are exercising normal control over our own law as any democracy does that we suddenly find there is a torpedo of tariffs.” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said last week’s agreement on implementing the Northern Ireland protocol showed that the two sides could reach accommodation on difficult issues. “I think it would be an appalling failure of statecraft if we were not in a position to get a deal over the line,” he said."
2020-12-13T18:51:57Z,politics,Politics,UK business and farming leaders implore Johnson to avoid no-deal Brexit,"Business, food and farming leaders have implored Boris Johnson to rule out a no-deal departure from the EU, saying it would be “catastrophic” for employment, supermarket supply chains and farming. The food industry said it was “just bonkers” that UK businesses did not know what the trading conditions would be in 12 working days’ time. Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the threat of tariffs “was not a trivial thing” and that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal on 1 January, consumers could expect to see price rises of between 5% and 15% in the supermarkets from mid-January. “I know some of our members are planning to send out new portfolio price lists to their customers this week to take account of tariffs,” he said. “Obviously they are conditional and assume there is no deal and that the tariff regime comes in in January. Price rises driven by tariffs would start to appear in middle to late January as obviously anything already in the country by 1 January will not attract a tariff.” The UK imports about 30% of its food from the EU, and 85% of the food imported from the EU would face tariffs, although the government could elect to delay their imposition through legislation.
In a no-deal scenario, 13,000 goods would attract import duties, but tariffs are known to be highest on agri-food – for example, 50% tax on cheddar cheese, 35% on boneless pork and 45% on wheat flour. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said recently that tariffs were not the main driver of food prices. He said the average shopping basket could cost more, but the increase would be lower than that predicted by Tesco, which put the rises at 3% to 5% last week. The British Retail Consortium has asked consumers not to “panic buy” after reports that the government had told supermarkets to stockpile for Brexit. One insider said that if that were true it was “an insult” to an industry that had kept the country in food supplies through the pandemic. “Supermarkets know what they are doing,” they said. “They have had no-deal contingencies in place for two years and do not rely on out-of-touch politicians for out-of-date tips.” The motor industry has said no deal would be catastrophic and implored the government to take it off the table. Production plans face a double shock of new checks and controls at the ports delaying deliveries of parts, and a 10% tariffs making exports uncompetitive. Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “We welcome the commitment from both sides to continue talking and find a way through the political impasse. We now need negotiators to finish the job and agree the deal we all so desperately need, without further delay. No deal would be nothing less than catastrophic for the automotive sector, its workers and their families and represent a stunning failure of statecraft. Quite simply, it has to be ruled out.” The former Labour party leader Ed Miliband accused Johnson of playing “Russian roulette” with people’s jobs, saying it was a “disgrace” that he was contemplating the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. One industry leader expressed despair at what they felt was the disconnect between Johnson and business reality. “Either he doesn’t know or he doesn’t care. I suspect both,” they said. British and French port and Eurotunnel representatives have said they expect the congestion seen on roads in Kent and the northern Haut-de-France region to continue over the next three weeks and then fall off in January, with many importers planning to cut deliveries because of the threat of delays in the immediate aftermath of 1 January. At the weekend it emerged that there were 10-mile tailbacks in Calais, causing five-hour delays. Local leaders were expected to respond to public concerns at a press conference on Monday. Rod McKenzie, the policy director of the Road Haulage Association, said the organisation had anecdotal evidence that some EU nationality drivers, who dominate the business, would “not bother” with driving in the UK in the new year in the event of no-deal chaos. Honda and Jaguar have paused production because of disruption to their “just in time” and “just in sequence” production lines caused by congestion at the ports. Welsh sheep farmers have said they face being wiped out because tariffs are so high they would prohibit competitive exports. Plaid Cymru’s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, whose supporters including many in the agriculture community in Snowdonia and its environs, said Johnson was “playing fast and loose with people’s jobs” and called on him to agree a deal with the EU."
2020-12-13T18:16:05Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: Eurosceptic Tories say PM must 'hold firm' to no-deal pledge,"Eurosceptic Tories have said Boris Johnson must “hold firm” to his commitment to no deal, suggesting Brussels was finally taking the UK’s intention to walk away from talks seriously. After reports over the weekend that the chances of a no-deal Brexit had risen to 80%, EU leaders announced that talks would resume past the given deadline of Sunday as both sides agreed to “go the extra mile” to secure a deal. Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said he expected talks would go to the wire and that Brexiteers may even be able to accept a short extension to allow the EU to ratify any deal forged before 31 December – but added that Johnson should still be prepared to walk away if talks came to a standstill. “He has made his bed and he has to lie in it. Now he has said this deal is unacceptable and we have to be prepared to go for WTO terms, then he has nowhere to go. Now the European Union are the ones who have the flexibility and they must move if they want a deal,” Duncan Smith said. Former minister David Jones, the vice-chair of the influential European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, said there was little purpose protracting talks if the two sides were still poles apart. “There will be a time when the UK should say – is there any purpose in continuing this?” he said. “It is not a question of flouncing off, but at some point one party has to make the call.
“With the approach of the end of transition period, it cannot go beyond the end of next week. We are coming to the end of the road, including the EU’s capacity to ratify a deal.” Multiple cabinet sources underlined that Johnson would have no issue with his cabinet were he to walk away from the talks. Shortly after his call with von der Leyen, Johnson spoke directly to the cabinet in what was described as a “very brief update call” where he confirmed negotiations would be continuing into next week. There was no debate to be had, one cabinet source said, and very few cabinet ministers took the opportunity to offer any comment. “Everyone is agreed about the position to keep negotiating as long as it is worthwhile – and everyone is behind the PM in pursuing Australia-style terms if not,” one cabinet source said, a reference to leaving without a deal.
Though cabinet ministers have given a public display of support, departments are lobbying behind the scenes for a no-deal bailout fund after reports over the weekend that the government was planning resilience deals for sheep farmers, fishermen, car manufacturers and chemical suppliers. Environment secretary George Eustice, the cabinet office minister Michael Gove and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland secretaries Alister Jack, Simon Hart and Brandon Lewis were reported to be working on the plans which are yet to get the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s buy-in. A Treasury source said HM Treasury was definitively not working on a bailout plan though another government source said cabinet ministers were lobbying the chancellor.
Though the UK parliament will not have a legally binding vote, Jones said he believed it was the government’s intention to have a vote on the deal. The ERG has said it would like to consult with its legal panel of experts before making a decision whether to endorse the deal. “In parliament we would like to have time to scrutinise it and it will take several days. If there is a vote it will probably have to be between Christmas and New Year,” Jones said. Former cabinet minister John Redwood suggested hardline Brexiteers may not be happy with any form of deal presented by Johnson. “A long complex legal agreement that locks the UK back into many features of the EU that hinder us is not the Christmas present the UK needs,” he said. However, a number of senior Conservative MPs who had expressed fears in recent days at the prospect of no deal welcomed the commitment to more talks. Former health minister Stephen Hammond said: “All efforts must be made to reach an agreement. Ending the year without a FTA would be bad for the UK and EU. I really urge the negotiating teams to keep working to find a pragmatic solution – for the benefit of all our citizens.” Damian Green, a former cabinet minister, said: “No deal would be terrible. So continuing the talks is good news.” The UK shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, urged the prime minister to keep talking – giving the strongest confirmation yet that his party would back a deal in parliament, despite protestations from his party. Asked if Labour would vote for a deal if it were achieved, Miliband said his party had said: “We’re minded to support it.”"
2020-12-13T16:42:56Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: what will change on 1 January 2021 for people in UK?,"Hasn’t Brexit already happened? Yes and no. The UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, but we have been cushioned from the real impact by the transition agreement, which has kept the UK in the customs union and the single market. But this runs out on 31 December, whether or not a trade deal with the EU is reached in the next few days. What happens if there is no trade deal? Companies will have to start paying tariffs on goods bought and sold across EU borders, as do other countries who do not have a trade agreement with the bloc and must operate under World Trade Organization rules. As well as increasing costs, there are likely to be even longer delays at ports. A trade deal would provide some “customs facilitation” to make the process smoother. Why are the talks so fraught? The British government sees the 2016 EU referendum as a mandate to release the UK from EU laws, notably on trade, borders and fishing. The EU says that if the UK wants to sell its goods to European consumers without taxes or tariffs being applied, there should be a level playing field so that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by downgrading its regulations and lowering the cost bases of its businesses. On fishing, the UK is demanding huge gains in catches from British waters once outside the EU’s common fisheries policy. The impact could be devastating for coastal communities in France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, among others. Has there been any progress? Boris Johnson said on Sunday the two sides were “still very far apart” on these three issues. But there are signs of a constructive shift away from rows about principle to nitty-gritty discussions about how a new relationship would work. The focus is now on managing divergence in environmental, labour and social standards rather than keeping the UK in lockstep with EU rules. What happens to free movement? Deal or no deal, free movement of people will end on 1 January 2021. The UK will apply a points-based immigration system to EU citizens. Currently, anyone on a temporary stay in the EU should get a European health insurance card (Ehic) from the UK government to access treatment while in the EU. But, from January, Ehics issued in the UK will not be valid, except in a few specific circumstances. The UK is seeking a like-for-like replacement scheme with the EU as a whole but nothing has been signed off yet. The Ehic will still work for some groups including those studying and those living in the EU before the end of 2020.
What happens to UK state pensions? If you already live in the EU and draw a state pension from the UK, your payments will go up each year in line with the triple lock – the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. For anyone who moves to the EU after January, you will still be able to claim your UK state pension, but how much you get will depend on the outcome of the talks. What about healthcare? UK citizens living in the EU before the end of 2020, and EU citizens living in the UK, will still be entitled to access healthcare as they do now. But for anyone relocating after 1 January 2021 the situation is still unclear, unless and until a deal is agreed. Will UK citizens still be able drive in Europe? Yes, but drivers will need a so-called green card to prove that they are insured. The cards will be available from car insurers and drivers will need to ask for it a month before they plan to travel. What about travelling with pets? The UK has applied to become a “listed country”, which will allow pets to be moved between it and the EU almost as freely as now. But if this is not approved, travelling with your pet will become harder. The current pet passport scheme will end, and you will need to get an animal health certificate when you want to travel overseas. This will involve waiting for three months after a blood sample has been taken from your pet, so journeys will involve more planning. Will mobile phone companies impose roaming charges again? Possibly. Under EU law mobile phone providers are not allowed to charge customers extra for making calls from a different country in the bloc. But, as of January, customers from the UK will not be covered by this rule. The big providers have all said they have no plans to introduce roaming charges, but if they wanted to charge, they could. • This article was amended on 15 December 2020. An earlier version said that, from January, Ehics issued in the UK will not be valid for EU nationals living in the UK. In fact EU nationals living in the UK before 31 December 2020 will be able to apply for a new UK Ehic."
2020-12-13T16:32:07Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen agree to continue UK-EU trade talks - as it happened,"Hereâ€™s a summary of the dayâ€™s developments so far: The UK and the EU have agreed to keep talks on a post-Brexit trade deal going. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed there was sufficient hope off a deal being reached to make a continuation worthwhile, making Sunday the latest deadline to be missed. The parties remain far apart in the negotiations, Johnson said. Talks have reached deadlock over disagreements on fishing and measures to protect the level playing field within the single market. Business leaders welcomed the continuation of talks. The heads of the British Chambers of Commerce, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the CBI all backed the decision. Several key figures had expressed hope a deal could be reached and had called for discussions to continue. The Irish taoiseach and the UKâ€™s foreign secretary were among those to insist that a deal of some sort could be reached, though the latter in particular sought to lay much of the blame for the failure to find one so far on the EU. Weâ€™re pausing this live blog now and will resume our coverage later if there are any developments."
2020-12-13T16:29:18Z,politics,Politics,EU leaders stress unity as they welcome Brexit trade talks extension,"EU leaders have welcomed news that fraught Brexit trade talks will continue next week, but insisted the bloc was united in its determination to protect its single market as commentators lamented a “warlike, xenophobic” British press. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said UK and EU negotiators would “go the extra mile” to find an agreement that would guarantee Britain zero-tariff, zero-quota access to the EU’s internal market after what she described as a useful phone call with Boris Johnson. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said everything should be done to reach an agreement that would avert a chaotic and economically damaging no deal. “Every opportunity to reach a deal is highly welcome,” she said in Berlin.
Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he believed a deal was “clearly very difficult” but was within reach providing both sides held their nerve. With 19 days left until Britain leaves the EU single market at the end of the post-Brexit transition period, Coveney said that despite some comments to the contrary last week he did think both sides wanted a deal. “It really needs to be done within the next few days,” he said.
Analysts were not convinced the decision to continue talking signified any real progress. “Probably best not to read too much into the ‘useful’ nature of the phone call,” said Fabian Zuleeg of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre. “The problem areas remain, and no landing zone for a deal has been identified. Negotiations need to have a purpose, adding more days doesn’t really help. It looks likely looks likely that neither side wants to be blamed for no deal.” The French newspaper Libération said the prospects of a deal had not been improved by by the fact that “habitual xenophobia” and “hysteria” of the British tabloids – which this weekend included personal attacks on Merkel and a threat to “send in gunboats” – had “reached new heights of outrageousness”. Failure to reach a deal would mean cross-Channel trade reverting to World Trade Organization rules from January. Tariffs would drive up prices, and customs and other border checks would snarl up borders and disrupt supply chains across the continent. Relations between London and Brussels would be poisoned possibly for years to come.
The EU 27 have insisted since the day after Britain’s Brexit referendum in June 2016 that they would not allow the UK to “cherry-pick” rights and obligations, and that if British companies were to have preferential access to the single marketthey would have to continue to observe its rules. Insisting on its right to full post-Brexit sovereignty, the UK is reluctant to accept EU demands for a “level playing field” and, in particular, to agree a mechanism that would allow the bloc to retaliate if UK and EU law were to diverge in a way that would give British companies an unfair competitive advantage. Spain’s EU and foreign affairs minister, Arancha González Laya, said the UK’s insistence on asserting its sovereignty was an unnecessary obstacle in the talks.
“Trade deals are not meant to assert sovereignty,” she told Sky News. “It’s pretty clear when you do a trade deal that you are a sovereign nation. The UK and the EU are interdependent, so let’s do a trade deal that manages that interdependence.” Charles Michel, the president of the European council of EU heads of state and government, told France Inter radio on Sunday that the bloc would “keep its cool” and do all it could to make a deal possible. “We must support a good deal,” he said. He stressed, however, that it would be “impossible to put a cigarette paper” between the member states on the key issue. “We are reasonable,” Michel said. “We want to maintain close relations with Britain. But we want to preserve and protect the single market.” Commentators also expressed surprise at Johnson’s attempts – rebuffed by Paris and Berlin – to talk to Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, rather than the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Catherine de Vries, a political scientist at Bocconi university in Italy, said the UK’s strategy appeared to be to “try to use a cliff edge to pit member states against each other”, using “asymmetric Brexit fallout as a means to get concessions”. The problem, she said, is that it “hasn’t worked. And there is no plan B.”"
2020-12-13T15:01:31Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: what are the 'major unresolved topics' UK and EU must agree on?,"After nine months of tortuous negotiations, and with just over three weeks left until the UK leaves EU’s single market and customs union at the end of the transition period, there are two issues that continue to dog the talks, described by EU leaders on Sunday as “major unresolved topics.” These are the future level of access to British waters given to the EU fishing fleet and, more significantly, the “evolution” or “ratchet clause” to ensure that regulatory standards do not diverge to such an extent that British or European businesses are left at a significant competitive disadvantage in the marketplace over time. Fish In Brussels, the issue of fishing access is not seen as a deal-breaker. “The negotiation is transactional, not about principle, and so is eminently doable,” said one official. In London, the sentiment is not shared. Johnson has repeatedly emphasised its importance to the EU side. But either way the political sensitivity of the issue, with loud fishing industries on both sides to satisfy, makes it a difficult one to land. And there do remain some genuine points of difference to nail down even at this late stage. The UK is leaving the common fisheries policy and taking back control of its exclusive economic zone: 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline or to the halfway line in smaller stretches of water. Downing Street wants annual negotiations with the EU on what European fishing fleets will be allowed to catch in its sovereign waters based on “zonal attachment”.
This means shares would be set according to the percentage of fish inside each side’s exclusive economic zone. It is argued that this system would be fairer and more scientific. It is already used by the EU in its annual quota-setting talks with Norway. The UK also has priority stocks – around 80% of all the stocks in its waters – where it expects to enjoy an increase in catch. And it wants the six- to 12-mile area around its coast to be exclusively used by British fishing vessels. The EU is resisting both “zonal attachment” and annual negotiations as it does not offer security to its coastal communities. It also wants to keep the British gains to around 15-18% of the fish caught by EU boats in UK waters. The UK is seeking a far higher windfall – 60% of the EU’s current catch in British waters. Meanwhile, France and Belgium, in particular, say they have fished for centuries in the six- to 12-mile area off the UK coast and they will not allow their vessels to be forced out. The UK has offered a three-year transition period to phase in the changes. The EU has proposed a standstill transition period of 10 years. The two sides are likely to settle on a time period between those two stances of five to seven years. Standards There is agreement on “non-regression” clauses, which would ensure that neither side can undercut a common baseline of standards after the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, but Brussels wants to go further. The row is over divergence on environmental, labour and social standards, ranging from emission reduction targets to health and safety regulations and food standards, that could leave companies on one side with a lower cost base when they try to sell goods into the European market. As the EU develops its rulebook on working conditions or the environment, for example, it is seeking a mechanism to ensure that European businesses are not left at an economic disadvantage if Britain fails to step up as well. As time goes by, it is argued, the minimum standards protected by non-regression will become obsolete. Initially the EU was proposing that where one side failed to upgrade its standards, the other should be able to apply tariffs automatically to correct the terms of trade. The thinking moved on sometime ago, however. It is instead argued by Brussels that it should be possible for either side to propose a revision of the common minimum standards when the time comes. There should be a forum for discussion, it is argued, and a system for dispute resolution, possibly through independent arbitration, should one side be foot-dragging. In extremis, there could then be tariffs applied. The UK has a few problems with this approach. It wants to know what the test will be for judging whether one side has been put at a competitive disadvantage. Is it simply a risk of trade being distorted or tangible evidence of it having occurred? It wants to know how the new minimum standards will be set. Downing Street says it surely cannot be whatever EU law might be. And the application of tariffs needs to be controlled. The UK wants it to be clear that tariffs should only be applied in areas of trade where distortions can be shown to have emerged due to regulatory divergence rather than cross-cutting across all sectors of the economy. The UK says that without assurances over the mechanism, it poses a threat to its sovereign right to make its own way from 1 January. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, claims that fear of countermeasures could lead to Britain being dragged into the EU orbit. Officials in Brussels suspect there is another motivation behind the UK’s scepticism: a future Labour government could agree to upgrades in standards that a future Conservative administration would be powerless to peel back. Once the clause has ratcheted up a policy, there is no way to ratchet down."
2020-12-13T14:09:09Z,politics,Politics,Police drop investigation into Tory MP accused of rape,"Police have dropped an investigation into allegations of rape against a Conservative MP and former minister. The MP, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of rape on 1 August and later released on bail. He was accused of sexual offences and assault relating to four alleged incidents in London. On Sunday, however, the Metropolitan police said the allegations had not met “the evidential test”. A spokeswoman said no further action would be taken, following a thorough investigation. “The complainant has been made aware of the decision,” she said. The alleged victim told the Sunday Times she intended to appeal against the decision under the victims’ right to review scheme. The MP agreed in August not to attend the House of Commons while the allegations were investigated. The Conservative party resisted calls at the time to suspend the whip from the MP while the investigation continued. The chief whip, Mark Spencer, said it was a matter for the police to investigate. A spokesman for Spencer said: “The chief whip takes all allegations of harassment and abuse extremely seriously and has strongly encouraged anybody who has approached him to contact the appropriate authorities, including parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme, which can formally carry out independent and confidential investigations.” A Conservative party spokesman said at the time: “We take all allegations of this nature extremely seriously. As this matter is now in the hands of the police it would be inappropriate to comment further.” The investigation came days after the former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke was convicted at Southwark crown court in a separate case of sexually assaulting two women, one of whom was a parliamentary worker."
2020-12-13T12:00:51Z,politics,Politics,Supermarkets 'told to stockpile food' as fears grow of no-deal Brexit,"The UK government is reported to have warned supermarkets to stockpile food and other essential supplies amid increasing fears of a no-deal Brexit in less than three weeks’ time. Boris Johnson and the president of EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed on Sunday to continue with the fraught trade negotiations, but ministers have played down the chances of a deal. And in anticipation of shortages prompted by a no-deal, ministers have told supermarkets to start stockpiling goods, according to the Sunday Times. “There was a conversation a week ago when ministers said prepare for no-deal. This weekend the message is that it’s no-deal,” a senior consultant to one of the big supermarkets told the paper. The consultant added: “Supermarkets and ministers are hugely worried about panic-buying. They saw what happened over Covid when people started hoarding toilet rolls and now how quickly it can go wrong.” Food producers have warned supplies of fresh vegetables will be worst hit if tariffs were imposed on goods in the event of a no-deal. They say shortages could last for at least three months. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Retailers and suppliers are doing everything they can to reduce disruption for consumers, including increasing the stock of non-perishable items and looking at alternative supply routes. “The main impact [of] Brexit will be on imported fresh produce, such as much fresh fruit and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or consumers.” The government has also told suppliers of medicines, medical devices and vaccines to stockpile six weeks’ worth at secure locations in the UK. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted the UK has “enough diversity of supply” of medicines in the case of a no-deal. Asked if he could guarantee the flow of medical supplies to the UK, Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Well of course, with things like vaccines and more generally medical supplies the NHS and DHSC (Department of Health and Social Care) already have a widespread programme of stockpiling and security of supply. “So I actually think – you know, there may be shifts – but we’ve got enough diversity of supply.” He also appeared to confirm a separate report in the Sunday Telegraph that the government has drawn up plans for a bailout worth billions for farmers and food producers in the event of a no-deal Asked if the government planned to spend £8bn bailing out farmers, Raab said: “We’ll always look, as we’ve shown through coronavirus, that we want to support those vulnerable communities.” Meanwhile, there continued to be reports of long delays and tailbacks on motorways at the port of Dover as hauliers blamed the queues on stockpiling. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, accused the prime minister of gambling with public supplies. He tweeted that it was “beyond reproach to see the government telling supermarkets to stockpile food because of its own ideology and incompetence”."
2020-12-13T11:30:05Z,politics,Politics,The crying game: is it ever OK for politicians to sob in public?,"Viewers of ITV’s Good Morning Britain were treated to an unusual spectacle on Tuesday morning: the phoney political weep. Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid watched as Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was shown footage of William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old from Warwickshire, receiving the UK’s second coronavirus jab. William Shakespeare. From Warwickshire. If you thought the billions of public pounds that have vanished this year were siphoned off by Tory cronies, you’d be wrong. In fact they were spent keeping William Shakespeare alive, guarded by the SAS, for this patriotic photo opportunity. After Hancock watched the clip, something strange happened. The MP for West Suffolk paused and then raised his right knuckle to his eye. He smirked before attempting to squeeze out a single perfect tear for Piers. It didn’t work. His face was as dry afterwards as it was before. “You’re quite emotional there,” Piers said, a note of scepticism in his voice. Morgan is the Mozart of making people cry. Through his Life Stories franchise he has provoked blubbing in everyone from Jayne Torvill to Cristiano Ronaldo. He can spot a crocodile at 1,000 paces. “It’s just been such a tough year for so many people,” Hancock said, visibly thinking mainly of Matt Hancock. He wasn’t the only politician to find this week a bit much. Across the soon-to-be-fortified North Sea, Angela Merkel’s voice cracked as she urged her citizens to stick to the coronavirus rules. You can see why leaders are drawn to crying as a tool. Voters claim to want their elected leaders to be “real people”, and “authentic”. Winston Churchill cried so frequently – at funerals, when he was made chancellor, when Parliament applauded him for sinking the French fleet – that Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson nicknamed him “Cry-Baby”. When he wept on a visit to an East End air raid shelter in 1940, a woman called out: “You see, he really cares. He’s crying!”
Barack Obama’s tears as he spoke about the Sandy Hook massacre in 2016 were widely seen as evidence he was a feeling leader who’d hit his breaking point on gun violence. When Hillary Clinton cried in a 2008 New Hampshire primary it helped prove she was human. In an age where short video clips are shared to millions within minutes, a few well-timed tears can be a shortcut to sympathy, but crying in public is a risky business. Donald Trump has said the last time he’d cried was when he was a baby, and that he sees it as a sign of weakness in men. Plenty agree. Ed Muskie’s alleged tears in the 1972 Democratic primary basically cost him the nomination. Margaret Thatcher was accused of being less than iron-like when she cried. Recent examples are hardly more edifying. Theresa May looked weak crying as she resigned. George Osborne blubbing at Thatcher’s funeral was widely derided. Even Obama’s tears were scrutinised for signs of fraud. Journalists crying has become more common. It’s not enough to read the reports. You now have to show you’re moved by them, too. When Van Jones, the political commentator, broke down on CNN as it became clear that Trump wasn’t going to be re-elected, there were rumblings from some quarters that he might be over-egging it. For crying to be effective it has to at least appear spontaneous. The real thing is easier to recognise than describe. In 2014 ITV surprised the ex-footballer Ian Wright with his inspirational teacher Mr Pigden. Wright broke down. He’d thought he was dead. You can tell the real deal because the weeper’s instinct is often to try to conceal it. Nobody likes how they look when they’re crying. Wright covered his face with his hat. In general, sportsmen can cry whenever they like, because we have no expectations they’ll be mature or composed. Andy Murray has the look of someone who’s going to bludgeon you on Culloden Moor, but in fact cries at the merest provocation. Actors are an unusual case. If they can cry on demand, they ought to be able to not cry on demand, which is why the Oscars waterworks tend to stick in the craw. But they’re paid to have a lot of emotions near the surface. Crying has been co-opted by talent show formats because it makes good TV. If you’ve been ejected from Bake Off or The X Factor, not crying marks you out as a psychopath. Matt Hancock is not the kind of politician who cries. He’s the epitome of the middle-manager type, who sticks to the script and can take a beating when necessary. You got the sense that he knew the whole Good Morning Britain situation was ridiculous, so only half committed. It almost looked as though he was laughing. William Shakespeare (the original, with all respect to the newly vaccinated man in Warwickshire) knew how fine the lines are between comedy, tragedy and farce. By sobbing at little things as well as big set pieces, Churchill proved that he had a depth of feeling, rather than an eye for PR. The lesson for politicians is simple: if you’re going to cry, cry all the time. Matt Hancock will get a chance to prove it when Winston Churchill from Oxfordshire gets his jabs next week."
2020-12-13T08:30:02Z,politics,Politics,The EU's red lines were clear in 2016,"The French, said George Canning, an early 19th-century British foreign minister, “have but two rules of action: to thwart us whenever they know our object, and when they know it not, to imagine one for us, and set about thwarting that”. It is a centuries-old British narrative, reflected in recent headlines: “Le bust-up”, “France derails Brexit talks”. With elections approaching, Emmanuel Macron, under pressure from Marine Le Pen, is obviously playing hardball. Blame the French. As far as Brexit trade talks go, however, it does not reflect reality. For once, in a famously fractious bloc, there is unity. France may speak louder than most, but on the question that really matters to Europe, it is far from alone. On 24 June 2016, the day after the Brexit referendum, the EU’s then top trio of Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Martin Schulz issued the bloc’s first formal response to a decision they said they regretted, but respected. The EU was united, the presidents of the European commission, council and parliament said, and would defend its stability and its interests. Any agreement with the UK must therefore be “balanced in terms of rights and obligations”. In the days that followed, German’s chancellor Angela Merkel and François Hollande, France’s president at the time, clarified further. “There can,” Merkel said – adopting a term destined to become famous – “be no cherry-picking” of Europe’s single market. There must be “a palpable difference between members of the European family, and non-members,” Merkel said. Hollande agreed: being part of the single market “has advantages”, he said. “The UK must face the consequences of its decision”. More than four years later, after a “frank” discussion over dinner about a future trade deal found “very large gaps” between the two sides and with just three weeks of the transition period left, the EU band’s line-up may have changed. Its music has not. “The principle of fair competition is a precondition to privileged access to the single market,” Ursula von de Leyen, Juncker’s successor, said on Friday at the conclusion of an EU leaders’ summit that spent the sum total of 10 minutes discussing Brexit.
“It is the largest single market in the world, and it is only fair that competitors to our own companies face the same conditions on our own market.” Clément Beaune, France’s new Europe minister, agreed. “The British want tariff-free access to the single market, but without any conditions on social, environmental, labour, health, safety standards,” he said this week. “That’s unacceptable.” Merkel – still Germany’s chancellor - sang from the same hymn sheet. “Our companies must be able to count on fair competition conditions, now and in the future,” she said. “One thing is clear: the integrity of the single market must be maintained.” The single market is the European Union’s crowning achievement. Economically, belonging to it is by some distance the biggest benefit of being an EU member. Ideologically, it symbolises members states’ commitment to ever closer cooperation.
What is it exactly? If the customs union (which Britain is also leaving) got rid of tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, the single market harmonises regulations across the bloc, meaning goods are made to the same standards, and according to the same rules. It is, says Fabian Zuleeg of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre think tank, “a complex legal construct that relies on uniform and effective application of the law across multiple different jurisdictions.” Within it, “economic actors, including governments, have rights and obligations that are adjudicated and enforced through independent courts”, Zuleeg said. The entire point is to ensure there are “no exceptions, no loopholes, no differences in interpretation; that there is enforcement, and implementation”. The single market is the most level of level playing fields. So for the EU27 to accede to a demand from a large, neighbouring and economically significant third country – the UK – for preferential access to it without a binding commitment to abide by its rules is simply unthinkable. It would undermine the essence of the bloc. That is why the EU27 are not budging. That is why, when Boris Johnson suggested bilateral talks with Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, they rebuffed his advances: the EU27 decided long ago its red lines to protect the single market, put them in Michel Barnier’s mandate, and have stuck to them. “The commission is our negotiator,” Johnson was told. That is why, while different countries have different concerns (fisheries, for example) and domestic politics weigh heavier on some (France) than on others, it is wrong to assume that these are what is driving the EU27’s obduracy. Nothing substantive that any one member state, including France, has said about their requirements for the future trade deal has, thus far, been contradicted by another. All agree that no deal, regrettable as it would be, is better than a deal that risks giving UK companies an unfair competitive advantage in Europe’s single market - now or in the future. That was the position in 2016 and it is the position now."
2020-12-13T08:30:01Z,politics,Politics,"Parisians: ‘We love Britain’s culture, its energy, its people. It’s sad you don’t love us too’","At the Châtelet branch of Boulinier, a Paris bookshop that has stocked English language books since 1845, shoppers were yesterday reflecting on a spate of British newspaper headlines threatening to send Royal Navy gunboats to board invading French trawlers in the event of a failure to agree a trade deal. Anglophiles like Didier Aubert, 72, a retired civil servant, said the threats were “ridiculous”. “That’s not how Britain used to behave. Civilised countries who are meant to be close allies should not be reduced to this. I completely understand Britain leaving the EU, and I’d love to see France do the same, but this Brexit drama is now absurd. It appears that some British, people I normally respect enormously, have no idea what they are doing,” Aubert said. He added: “Who would have thought the British would be threatening France with their military because nobody can agree on a trade deal?” Of all its European neighbours, France has long been the country Britain – minus Scotland, still loyal to the Auld Alliance – loves to hate. In France, this animosity is not widely reciprocated. On the whole, the French like the British, and, while they may be fed up with interminable Brexit negotiations hijacking the news agenda, they regret that Britain apparently cannot wait to see the back of them.
Neither do they understand why Britons swoon over the Netflix series Emily in Paris, and love to settle in their countryside, snapping up property in Normandy and the Dordogne, but do not, apparently, like the people they find here. “I absolutely love England, and especially London. Everything from the sense of style and energy to the underground is very impressive,” Redouane Belkacem, a 16-year-old student, told the Observer. “London is also a city where lots of different people come together to get the best out of life. It doesn’t matter what your culture is – you are welcome.” Lilas Farré, 18, a Paris art student, was sad that Brexit was ending free movement. “The sad thing for people my age is that Brexit will make it much harder for us to spend long periods in Britain. Students will certainly find it a lot more complicated, and that’s very sad. I’ve been to England lots of times, mainly to London and Exeter, and I love it there. I love the culture, the atmosphere, the rock music and most of all the English themselves,” Farré said.
Jâcques de Roquefeuil, 65, a former employee of France’s SNCF state railway, had just returned from a visit to Northumberland and said he had often stayed in Grantham, the birthplace of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, or as the French call her, La Dame de Fer (Iron Lady). “The people I know there were not supporters of Thatcher and they’re not too impressed with Boris Johnson either. Of course I want things to go well with Brexit, because a smooth transition is very important for Britain and the EU. Sadly, the Brexit process is not proving to be smooth.” He added: “I have lots of friends in Britain and I love the civilisation and the countryside, so all this is very sad to me.” Imad Attahiri, 34, a social worker, said he believed Brexit was about economics not culture. “It’s really all about the choice of the British people.” Apart from concerns about the future for French trawlers if they are excluded from British coastal waters, Brexit is not high on the country’s news agenda. The French have other fish to fry. Like Britain, France is struggling with the economic, cultural and social fallout from the coronavirus, and also faced recent protests – involving Black Bloc agitators who clashed violently with police – over a new security law. Even Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National (formerly the Front National) – among the fiercest critics of the EU in France – has seen the way the Brexit wind has blown and stopped even mentioning Frexit. “The British are naturally obsessed with Brexit, but that doesn’t mean we are,” Bruno Thomas, 63, a Paris café manager said. “We have too many problems of our own.”"
2020-12-13T06:01:03Z,politics,Politics,"Our jobs and future depend on a deal, business warns Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson has been warned that the fate of millions of jobs, Britain’s most deprived regions and the UK’s manufacturing base rely on him reaching an 11th-hour trade deal with the EU, as senior figures from every corner of the economy issued a final plea for a compromise. Amid frustration and disbelief among prominent business people that a deal has still not been secured, consumer groups, universities, farmers and both large and small retailers said a deal was essential to allow them to cope with the impacts of Brexit, even with a deal in place. Some simply called on ministers to be honest about the impact of no deal. Businesses said they were still finding issues over their Brexit readiness with the transition period ending in less than three weeks, deal or no deal. Meanwhile, business groups in areas such as the north-east said they would be left “exposed” with no deal in place. Consumer groups also warned of the impact on cross-border consumer rights, food prices and travel once the transition period ends. However, a government spokesperson signalled last night that it was ready and willing to embrace no deal, saying that it had made “extensive preparations and invested £4bn for the end of the transition period, because regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, we must be ready on 1 January”. The spokesperson said that while “there will be challenges and bumps to overcome”, it had “laid the groundwork to minimise the disruption which occurs in either scenario”. It is understood that business groups were still privately urging ministers to push for a deal this weekend, with the deadline for talks set for Sunday night. While the cabinet signed off their support for a no-deal outcome should Johnson opt for it, chancellor Rishi Sunak was understood to be getting hourly updates amid huge pressure on the Treasury to push for a deal. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the manufacturer’s lobby group, Make UK, warned that many of the 2.7 million jobs supported by manufacturing businesses were heavily dependent on trade with the EU. “A no deal would be catastrophic for Britain’s manufacturers, a sector which came to the nation’s aid when the Covid crisis struck,” he said. “It is vital the prime minister and president of the EU commission work together and find a pragmatic solution to deliver a zero-tariff and zero-quota deal to avoid additional friction at the border.”
With warnings that a no-deal outcome would be “existential” for the UK car industry, making it unprofitable overnight, Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “The resulting tariffs would put our manufacturers at a disadvantage in export markets, raise prices for consumers and make the UK uncompetitive, both as a market and producer. We know the UK government understands this, and we hope it will do whatever it takes to secure a deal that safeguards the sector and hundreds of thousands of livelihoods that depend on its success.” The president of the National Farmers Union, Minette Batters, said: “More than 60% of our agri-food exports go to the EU, making it British farming’s largest trading partner. Reaching a deal is critical to maintaining those trade links and without it there will be significant disruption for British food and farming. The government needs to be straight with businesses about the impact of no deal and address many outstanding issues, such as ensuring the necessary authorisations are in place for agri-food exports and guaranteeing there will be sufficient financial support, advice and resources for businesses.” Business groups in regions that voted in favour of Brexit warned that their reliance on EU trade meant they wanted the prime minister to compromise. Jonathan Walker, director of policy at the North East England Chamber of Commerce said the body had been making the case for a trade deal for four years because of the area’s economic reliance on Europe. “The EU is the north-east’s largest marketplace and the government’s own analysis has clearly set out how exposed we would be to the consequences of a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “It is ridiculous our businesses now only have a matter of days to prepare fully for the biggest change to trading conditions for generations with no clarity on how they will have to operate.” The absence of a tariff-free deal would mean that supermarkets and their customers face £3bn in tariffs from next year, according to Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. He said four-fifths of UK food imports arrived from the EU each day. “While retailers are doing all they can in time for 1 January, no amount of preparation for retailers can completely mitigate disruption to food and other essential goods that come from or through the EU,” he said. Tony Danker, the CBI director-general, also issued a plea to the prime minister to look at what’s at stake in the negotiations. “With less than three weeks to go, we also need to plan in parallel for 1 January, deal or no deal,” he said. “We need both sides to be deeply practical – and to remove the immediate threat of a damaging cliff edge.”
Sue Davies, head of consumer protection at Which?, said no deal would have significant impacts for consumers in the immediate term “with a likely adverse effect on cross-border consumer rights, food prices and travel once the transition period ends”. She added: “One of the consequences of the likely economic uncertainty is that people could see the value of their pensions or investments impacted.” Abta, the leading association of travel agents and tour operators, urged for clarity whatever the rules will be. The rules about future travel in Europe remain unclear. Universities UK said that no deal would see “immediate disruption to universities’ activities and could have longer-term consequences for their international competitiveness”. It added: “There must be assurances that no deal will not disrupt universities’ existing supply chains, halt EU and UK data flow, or hinder the future mutual recognition of professional qualifications.”
Meanwhile, a huge dossier of concerns about the lack of Brexit preparedness, whatever happens in trade deal talks, was published by parliament last week. Warnings over preparedness were received by the business select committee from groups including the Law Society, the Association of Convenience Stores, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the offshore oil and gas industry and the Mineral Products Association. Arla Foods, a cooperative owned by about 11,200 dairy farmers based in seven northern European nations, said even now they were finding “new issues that we have not been aware of before”. A UK government spokesperson said last night that 900 more officers had been hired to manage the border, with 1,100 border staff set to be recruited by March. They added there were more than 20 existing helplines to provide advice to specific sectors, and that import controls would be introduced in stages. “We’ve developed a playbook which maps out every single foreseeable scenario with minister-approved courses of action so we can implement them immediately if needed,” they said."
2020-12-13T04:55:10Z,politics,Politics,"Bailouts, blame and broken glass: UK papers paint grim picture of possible no-deal Brexit","The Brexit talks deadline gives the Sunday newspapers plenty of material as they report variously on possible food shortages, industry bailouts and the alleged desire of German chancellor Angela Merkel to see Britain “crawl across broken glass”. Ministers have warned supermarkets to stockpile food amid possibilities of a no-deal Brexit, with shortages feared as talks with the European Union remain deadlocked, the Sunday Times newspaper reports.
It says that Boris Johnson is set to take control of planning if Britain opts for no deal and will chair an exit operations committee to prepare the response. Suppliers of medicines, medical devices and vaccines have been told to stockpile six weeks’ worth at secure locations in the United Kingdom, the report added. The Sunday Telegraph headline says “Billions in no-deal help for farmers and factories” as it reports that the government has identified four areas of the economy – sheep farmers, fishermen, car manufacturers and chemical suppliers – that are most at risk of EU tariffs if Britain is catapulted out of the bloc without a trade deal.
The funding package could be worth between £8-10bn, the paper adds. There is a more lurid image on the front of the Mail on Sunday, whose front page headline claims “Merkel wants Britain ‘to crawl across broken glass’”. It cites an unspecified “source” as saying that the German chancellor was “determined” to see Britain suffer rather than reach a compromise on the sticking points of future government aid and fishing.
It also has the line that Johnson is “taking control” of no-deal planning by chairing a “super-committee” to run alongside the existing no-deal preparation group chaired by Michael Gove. The Sunday Express, pugnacious as ever, proclaims “No-deal: we are ready!”, with a strapline reading “Britain says EU offer is ‘unacceptable’ as PM unveils plan to avoid Brexit chaos”.
The Observer reports on despair among senior Tories at the prospect of a no deal, led by Lord Heseltine. “Tory grandees’ fury over PM’s ‘nationalist’ no-deal Brexit”, the headline reads, and quotes the former cabinet minister as saying that he knows personally that several current cabinet members share his belief that leaving without an agreement will be the worst decision taken by a British government in modern times.
“This government will be – and should be – held responsible for quite simply the worst peacetime decision of modern times. I know personally of members of the cabinet who believe this as firmly as I do. I cannot understand their silence,” Hesltine writes for the paper. The Sunday Mirror’s forlorn headline is “Hours from a no deal”, as it reports that there are “fears of huge food price rises and job cuts” if Britain leaves without a deal and has to pay tariffs to import goods from the EU.
There is also despair in Scotland where the Scotland on Sunday devotes its front page to the “Brexit muddle” as it investigates EU subsidies, the politicians who have benefited from them and what the future holds.
The Herald on Sunday predicts the “The world’s most vicious break-up”, but it’s not even talking about Brexit, it’s referring to the possibility that the current track will lead to Scotland leaving the UK, or “Scexit”."
2020-12-13T00:02:51Z,politics,Politics,Tory grandees’ fury over Johnson’s  ‘nationalist’  no-deal Brexit,"Boris Johnson faced a rising tide of anger from senior Tories and business leaders last night as he appeared ready to embrace a no-deal Brexit and prepared Royal Navy gunboats to defend UK fishing waters. With the prime minister and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, due to decide on Sunday whether to halt stalled talks and make the momentous decision to accept no deal – an outcome that would lead to tariffs and quotas on UK-EU trade and rising prices – Johnson’s handling of the final stage of negotiations has caused astonishment in his own party, and the EU. Fearing the disastrous effects of no deal, former cabinet ministers called for talks to resume despite Sunday’s “final deadline”, to make sure 2021 does not begin against a backdrop of twin crises caused by the pandemic and Brexit.
Tobias Ellwood, Tory chairman of the defence select committee, also expressed outrage at government-inspired headlines about plans to use gunboats to patrol fishing waters – confirmed by the Ministry of Defence – saying they were “absolutely irresponsible” and damaging to the UK’s reputation abroad. Damian Green, a former cabinet minister, led calls from Tory remainers for talks to last as long as is needed to reach a deal. “Every rational person in Britain and Europe knows a deal would be better all round, so I still cling to the hope that reason will win the day,” he said. A government source said: “Talks are continuing overnight, but as things stand the offer on the table from the EU remains unacceptable. The prime minister will leave no stone unturned, but he is absolutely clear: any agreement must be fair and respect the fundamental position that the UK will be a sovereign nation in three weeks’ time.” A Downing Streeet source said the talks in Brussels remain very difficult. Writing in the Observer today, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, expresses his disbelief that businesses have still not been informed of the rules under which they will have to operate from 1 January. “Businesses need detailed answers, not vague letters, posters or television adverts,” Marshall writes. “It is hard to believe that we still have to ask ministers for clarity on the nuts and bolts of trade – things like rules of origin, customs software, tariff codes, and much more besides – just a fortnight before the end of the transition period.” He adds that lack of clarity will mean investment decisions will be delayed: “Businesses can and will adapt to the UK’s new trade reality. Yet they’re not miracle workers or mind-readers. Without official guidance, many will pause long-term planning and hold back on investment.” The use of gunboats to patrol UK fishing waters in the event of no deal was backed by Admiral Lord West, a former chief of naval staff. “It is absolutely appropriate that the Royal Navy should protect our waters if the position is we’re a sovereign state and our government has said we don’t want other nations there,” he told the BBC. But the behaviour of the Johnson government drew outraged responses from pro-Remain Tory grandees. Also writing in today’s Observer, former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine says of Brexit and the slide towards no deal: “This government will be – and should be – held responsible for quite simply the worst peacetime decision of modern times. I know personally of members of the cabinet who believe this as firmly as I do. I cannot understand their silence.” Heseltine adds: “Christmas is upon us and before the country goes back to work we are on our own. Sovereign, in charge, control regained. None of that creates a single job, one pound’s worth of investment or any rise in living standards. We will have risked our trading relationship with the world’s largest market which accounts for nearly half our imports and exports.” Meanwhile the former Tory party chairman and European commissioner Chris Patten said Johnson was not a Conservative but an “English nationalist”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today that he feared for the UK’s future when it was finally out of the EU single market, “which we of course helped to build because the main constructor of the single market was Margaret Thatcher”. On Sunday the Cabinet Office releases details of its latest Brexit planning, which suggests a willingness by Johnson to accept a no-deal. A Whitehall source said preparations had been thorough but predicted difficult moments, including clashes with foreign fishing boats.
“We’ve hired 900 more officers to man the border, with 1,100 border staff set to be recruited by March. There are over 20 helplines to provide advice to specific sectors, and we’ve even given businesses more time to prepare by introducing import controls in stages, he said. “Come 1 January we’ll have to move quickly and decisively to tackle issues if they arise. We’ve developed a playbook which maps out every foreseeable scenario with minister-approved courses of action so we can implement them immediately if needed. “These plans work in real life, not just on paper. We’ve run live exercises moving fresh produce and fish across the border, and scrambled naval vessels to respond to threats of illegal fishing in our soon-to-be sovereign waters.
“We’ve tested our traffic management plans and are confident we have the tools to mitigate disruption and queues at the border which will inevitably occur in the early weeks as traders adjust to the new requirements. By building more lorry spaces than we need, prioritising lorries carrying fish and day-old chicks, and launching the ‘Check an HGV’ service, goods can keep moving smoothly through Kent.” Greg Clark, the former business secretary and current chair of the Commons science committee, said: “It is clearly unacceptable for the UK to be expected to agree to be unilaterally punished if we declined to follow future EU policy.”"
2020-12-12T16:31:55Z,politics,Politics,Brexit fishing row evokes memories of 'cod wars' with Iceland,"News that four Royal Navy patrol ships will be ready from 1 January to help protect UK fishing waters in the event of a no-deal Brexit has evoked memories of the “cod wars” – a battle over fishing grounds off Iceland that lasted almost 20 years until it was resolved in the mid-1970s. The first cod war, a phrase coined by Fleet Street, began in September 1958, when Iceland, concerned about overfishing and its impact on a cornerstone of its economy, extended its fishing limit from four to 12 nautical miles from its coast. Britain refused to recognise the unilateral declaration and deployed three frigates and an ocean minesweeper to protect British trawlers. They were ranged against the Icelandic coastguard, consisting in total of eight small patrol vessels, the largest being the 693-tonne Thor. On 1 September 1958, the then-Manchester Guardian reported: “According to Icelandic sources, they intend to fire into the bridge of any trawler inside the twelve-mile limit which fails to stop after a shot across the bows.”
Nine days later, the paper carried an account by skipper Jim Crockwell, of how a party from Thor had boarded his trawler, the Northern Foam. “We were fishing in the protected area known as Spearmint II,” he said. “And we were in dense fog. Visibility was nil. I could see there were two ships approaching on the radar screen, and I supposed that they were other ships fishing in the area. They were going about the same speed as we were, but in the opposite direction. Suddenly Thor appeared out of the fog on our port side and Maria-Julia came up on our starboard side. The Thor positioned herself on our port bow.” Crockwell said the officer in charge of the boarding party advised him to go on to the Icelandic gunboat but he refused. Another demanded to see his papers, but the skipper told him: “Go jump in the ocean and get lost.” Crockwell and his crew were eventually saved by the intervention of HMS Eastbourne. Tensions reignited in 1973 when Iceland extended its exclusive fishing zone to 50 miles. Royal Navy frigates were again deployed to protest British trawlers, the British embassy in Reykjavik was stoned and a Grimsby trawler was shot at. Ramming and net-cutting incidents increased again in 1976, when the zone was increased to 200 miles, an extension endorsed by the European Community, the forerunner of the EU. On 1 June of that year, however, an agreement was reached after Nato-mediated sessions that Britain would be allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200-mile zone as long as their catch was limited to 50,000 tonnes. As Sir Alan West, a former admiral and chief of naval staff, said about the current plans for Royal Navy involvement: “There is no doubt if you are a fisherman who has fished for years there – they are, as our fishermen are, quite stormy people – and you get a bit of a punch-up and you might need some marines and things.” The effects of the 1976 deal were to have a devastating impact on British trawlermen fishing Arctic waters, most of whom were made redundant. The government announced in 2000 that those affected and their families would share a £25m compensation package. • This article was amended on 14 December 2020 because Iceland does not have a navy, as an earlier version said. This has been corrected to refer to the Icelandic coastguard."
2020-12-12T16:00:42Z,politics,Politics,"'Brexit preparation? It's a shambles, and will be for months'","Brexit, whether in no-deal or an agreed form, poses significant challenges for many sectors of the British economy. Here we talk to two businesses people for whom overcoming those obstacles is an imperative. The haulier “Hell, I think sums it up reasonably well,” says Rob Hollyman, 59, of his firm’s Brexit situation. The lack of definite information has plagued the director of Youngs Transportation and Logistics, based in Purfleet, Essex, with a depot in Southampton. The company has a £17m turnover and 160 staff. Last year it applied for permits to continue sending lorries to Europe after Brexit, and was granted two - which were then not required in the transition period. Last Wednesday, Hollyman heard that a new application for 2021 had been turned down, for reasons he couldn’t fathom. “Later,” he says, “the EU said UK trucks could go in and out till June. All that heartache, effort and panic was unnecessary.” Youngs has already decided to subcontract more work to EU hauliers as a safety net, but with many of these reluctant to come into the UK because of delays, costs are rising. Comments by Michael Gove about businesses failing to prepare still rankle. “How can we prepare with no information,” says Hollyman. “It continues to be a shambles. It’ll be turmoil for two to three months. Ultimately we will cope and get things done. But if there are delays, we’ll have to increase prices, costs per unit will go up, and supermarket prices will follow.” Gwyn Topham The food producer “We’re getting messages from lots of our suppliers saying if there’s anything we need urgently, we should get it now, says Nimisha Raja, who runs Nim’s Fruit Crisps. The Kent-based fruit and vegetable crisp maker has already stockpiled 40,000 lemons and five tonnes of courgettes from Spanish suppliers. The next big orders will be for cucumbers and oranges. “The products we bring in are ‘just in time’. We can’t afford to have eight tonnes of lemons sitting around because the documentation hasn’t been correctly filled in.” Her main fear is running out of raw materials: this would mean letting down customers, which include supermarkets and craft gin subscription boxes. “Tens of thousands of people wouldn’t get what’s been advertised if we couldn’t supply them,” she says. Nim’s has already reinvented itself this year after demand for takeaway sandwiches, crisps and drinks collapsed during lockdown. It now sells its products as ingredients to other companies, with sales up by a quarter on last year. However a deal with a German supermarket was recently cancelled due to the uncertainty around import taxes. “I can’t understand what no-deal could possibly mean,” she says. “To get a deal would be a relief – we’re prepared for that.” Zoe Wood"
2020-12-12T15:12:31Z,politics,Politics,Tories criticise Boris Johnson over navy gunboats Brexit threat,"Senior Conservatives have criticised Boris Johnson’s handling of the Brexit trade negotiations and his threat to deploy Royal Navy gunboats to patrol UK fishing waters in the event of no deal. With the Sunday deadline for reaching an agreement fast approaching, the Ministry of Defence confirmed four 80-metre armed vessels had been placed on standby to guard British waters from EU trawlers from 1 January, in the absence of an agreement on fishing rights.
Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, called the threat of deploying gunboats “irresponsible”, when attention should be focused on striking a deal, while the former EU commissioner Chris Patten accused the prime minister of behaving like an “English nationalist”. Johnson said on Friday that fishing rights were one of the two major impediments to a deal, the other being how to maintain fair competition once the UK is able to set its own standards and regulations from the end of the transition period in three weeks’ time. The readying of the navy vessels is likely to be interpreted as a warning to Brussels over the consequences of no deal being agreed on trade – an outcome both sides have said is now the likeliest outcome. Ellwood, a former defence minister, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think these headlines are absolutely irresponsible. We need to be focusing on what is already in the bag – 98% of the deal is there, there are three or four outstanding issues. “Important though they are, let’s park those for the future. Let’s get this deal because economically, but most importantly, international reputationally this would be so damaging to Britain – it would be a retrograde step, a failure of statecraft.” Patten, also speaking to Today, accused Johnson of being on a “runaway train of English exceptionalism”. The former Conservative party chairman added: “I hope that I’m wrong to feel so depressed about the outlook but I don’t think that Mr Johnson is a Conservative, I think he is an English nationalist. “And all the things that Conservatives used to believe in – like standing up for the union, like not attacking our institutions, like the judges, like believing in international cooperation – seem to have gone out of the window.” The chief trade negotiators, the EU’s Michel Barnier and the UK’s David Frost, were due to start negotiating again shortly before midday on Saturday in Brussels, with talks also scheduled for Sunday. The details about efforts to shore up protection of British waters emerged after such a move was suggested by some government backbenchers, including the Shrewsbury MP, Daniel Kawczynski. He tweeted on Friday that naval forces should be deployed in the new year “to prevent illegal French fishing in our waters”. Sir Alan West, a former admiral and chief of naval staff, said it was right for the Royal Navy to be deployed if necessary. “It is absolutely appropriate that the Royal Navy should protect our waters if the position is that we are a sovereign state and our government has said we don’t want other nations there,” he told Today."
2020-12-12T13:20:35Z,politics,Politics,"Children will die due to UK overseas aid cuts, paediatricians say","Cutting the UK’s overseas aid budget will result in a significant number of children dying “with negative impacts lasting generations”, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has said. Joining a chorus of voices opposing the reduction of overseas aid funding from 0.7% to 0.5% of Britain’s gross national income, the RCPCH said the evidence was overwhelming that aid helped children’s health and any reduction would have far-reaching consequences. “We call on the government to keep its promise to the world’s poorest children to spend 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid,” it said in a joint statement with the International Child Health Group, a speciality group within the RCPCH. “The collateral impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is causing severe disruption to preventive and curative health services in the poorest settings, particularly for children. Estimates suggest that more than a million excess child deaths could occur as a result. To reduce our commitment further, just as global needs intensify, will result in significant further loss of life, with negative impacts lasting generations.” The former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair, sitting MPs, charities and aid experts have all condemned the cut, announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in last month’s spending review, despite the 0.7% commitment being a manifesto promise and having been enshrined in law in 2015. The positive impact aid could have was demonstrated by research showing that a 1% increase in health aid reduces infant deaths by 2.6% in sub-Saharan Africa, and that for every additional aid dollar allocated to malaria control, the rate of child infection and death falls, the RCPCH said. Global child mortality had fallen by more than half over the last three decades, substantively supported by increases in aid funding, but the death toll remained bleak, it said. Around 15,000 children die each day from conditions which are avoidable or preventable. Around 2.4 million babies died within the first month of life in 2019. The RCPCH said: “In the rich world, we are largely insulated from the horror of children dying needlessly. These rates of death are neither inevitable nor natural.” It said healthy child development was associated with stronger economic growth, which enabled poor countries to become less aid-dependent, and to take on the funding of their own development. Echoing warnings from many groups that women and girls would be hit the hardest, the RCPCH said aid reduced adolescent births and supported reduction in gender inequalities, helping women to deliver babies safely, care for newborns, and nurture their families. “Put simply, aid saves children’s lives and can set them on a path to life-long health,” the statement said. “Without doubt, aid should be closely scrutinised and used to achieve maximum benefit; aid should be able to show ‘value for money’. Saving children’s lives is an imperative – a moral act and one of the best and most effective investments for future global growth.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “We will continue to protect the world’s poorest. The UK is one of the highest aid donors in the G7 and next year we will spend £10bn on overseas aid. “Through our £1.65bn funding over five years for Gavi, the vaccine alliance, we are supporting the immunisation of nearly 75 million children in the world’s poorest countries. “We intend to return to the 0.7% target when the fiscal situation allows.”"
2020-12-12T12:55:17Z,politics,Politics,Brexit stockpiling causing 10-mile tailbacks in Calais,"Brexit stockpiling is causing 10-mile lorry queues and delays of up to five hours in Calais, it has emerged, as hopes of a trade deal fade. Sources close to the president of the Hauts-de-France region said there had been 50% more heavy goods vehicles on the approach roads to the French port and Eurotunnel in the past three weeks. “November and December are always busy months, but extreme stockpiling because businesses are trying to get goods into the UK before 1 January is the main cause,” the source said. “Normally we have about 6,000 trucks, but now it is about 9,000. It shows the extreme of the consequences of Brexit whether there is a deal or not. Trucks are having to slow down all along the A16 back to Dunkirk with delays of up to 17km.” The delays in crossing the Channel are causing acute problems in the UK. Honda and Jaguar have had to halt production temporarily because of parts shortages, and it emerged on Friday that Ikea had been besieged by complaints because of what it called “operational challenges” as shipments of its flatpack furniture are held up at clogged ports. The tailbacks give a glimpse of things to come next year when customs, standards and immigration checks will kick in on both sides of the channel. Eurotunnel said it believed delays on the British side would continue for the next three weeks. Its contingencies centre on the worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit involving up to 7,000 lorries queuing in Kent. Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Friday they were unlikely to reach a post-Brexit trade deal by Sunday. Hauts-de-France leaders have been planning for Brexit congestion since the first threat of no deal in 2018, when the regional president, Xavier Bertrand, made a furious speech in the European parliament warning of a “dark scenario”. The French authorities calculated at the time that a two-minute delay at the port or the Eurotunnel gateway would lead to queues of 27km on either side, so slow-moving queues of 17km will be read in some quarters as an achievement. Tailback traffic is also quickly caused by security incidents, with the continuing issue of migrants trying to board lorry trailers.
The delays have been matched by long tailbacks at the Eurotunnel, caused partly by a reduction in the number of ferries because of Covid and the number of empty lorries returning to the continent after their stockpiling deliveries. Queues sometimes stretching back at least five miles have formed almost every day for the past two weeks. “We are seeing several hundred trucks above forecasts on midweek days,” a Eurotunnel spokesman said. Recent company figures show traffic 11% up on last year for November. Eurotunnel said contingency plans, also modelled since 2018, meant it could move traffic on to the trains quickly. “We expect it to be like this for the next three weeks with some tailing off as we get close to Christmas and then drop off in the first week of January,” the spokesman said, adding that there would be less travel than usual because of Covid restrictions. “Lots of companies have said their production for the first two weeks will stop because of the nervousness of what is coming so that will have an impact and we also believe the authorities are going to be lenient in the first few days after 1 January.” The drive to stockpile flows from the fact that customs, regulatory and agrifood checks will be introduced deal or no deal because the UK is leaving the single market. Further disruption is expected over the weekend in Kent with a live test of Operation Brock, the no-deal traffic contingency plan for the M20, put in place on Friday night. The UK is hoping to mitigate the impact by phasing in checks over six months, but businesses have voiced concerns that the customs software and the special electronic Brexit passports for international freight drivers to get into Kent will not be ready in time for Brexit day. A House of Lords committee wrote to Michael Gove on Thursday to say it was “not confident that all necessary technological, physical and welfare arrangements will be in place in time to avoid or mitigate disruption”. It raised concerns voiced by software experts that some key customs systems are only going live at the end of the month while others are still in development and testing. In the letter Sandip Verma, the chair of the EU goods sub-committee, criticises the “default expectation” of the government “that everything will be ready”, which is “reflected in the worrying lack of contingency preparations”, including failure to get all traders ready, including SMEs that cannot afford customs agents."
2020-12-12T12:53:19Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer winning Tory Leave voters for Labour – poll,"More Leave voters than Remainers have swung from the Tories to Labour since the last election, according to a major polling project that suggests Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has made some early progress in bridging the Brexit divide. A large 7,000-strong poll, designed to examine the political changes that have taken place since Labour’s disastrous result, found that the party was showing signs of winning over some of those who backed the Tories last year. The Tories won support from 70% of those who voted Leave and 20% of Remain voters at the 2019 election. Labour won 16% of Leave voters and 49% of Remain voters. The latest polling found that the Tories now have the support of 63% of those who voted Leave and 21% of Remain voters. Labour is backed by 20% of Leave voters and 53% of Remain voters. It represents a swing to Labour from the Tories among Leave voters of 5.5 points. The swing among Remainers was just 1.5 points. The pollsters said that a significant part of the swing was down to Leave voters turning against the Tories, now saying they did not now know who they would vote for. Some 18% of Conservative Leave voters now say they do not know how they will vote. Meanwhile, the net movement of Conservative voters to Labour since the election is roughly the same as the net movement of Green and Lib Dem voters to Labour – about 500,000 voters in each group. It challenges suggestions that Starmer has largely boosted Labour’s vote share by winning Lib Dem and Green voters. The study, launched as part of a new Opinium ebook on the last election, comes with Labour poised to back any Brexit deal that is agreed with the EU. The move is causing unease at all levels of the party. Starmer has suggested he will order his MPs to back a deal in the “national interest”, making clear it is preferable to a no-deal outcome. Chris Curtis, the senior research manager at Opinium, said: “This data will be particularly important for Labour to consider when deciding how to vote on a potential Brexit deal. The data shows that there are lots of Leave voters who are going off the Conservative party, but haven’t yet been won over by Labour. The party will want to avoid alienating them with the decision it makes.” Several figures in the shadow cabinet, the unions and prominent backbenchers want the party to abstain in a Brexit deal vote, concerned that backing a deal will prevent Labour from criticising it in the future – while abstaining will not stop its passage. However, Starmer’s team has been holding meetings with party figures for weeks in an attempt to prepare the ground for voting in favour of a deal. There is also a feeling among Starmer’s team that Remain voters are not as focused on Brexit as they once were, following the last election. The Opinium study found that Starmer is doing better among Leave voters than the Labour party as a whole, suggesting that he may have the ability to reach some more Tory voters who are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with the party, but have yet to make the jump to Labour. Starmer’s approval rating among Leave voters was -5, with 27% approving of him and 32% disapproving. A huge lead for the Tories among older voters at the last election is also showing evidence of closing. The Conservatives had a 38-point lead among those aged 65 and over. It remains high, but has closed to 26 points. Labour has a marginal lead among working-class voters, following suggestions it was behind among that group at the election. It is now backed by 40% of so-called “C2DE” voters, compared with 38% for the Tories. Meanwhile, the Tories lead among the more affluent voters. It leads 42% to 38% among “ABC1” voters. The gender gap that emerged at the last election persists. The Tories lead 43% to 35% among men, while Labour leads 41% to 38% among women. Curtis said: “Labour’s vote share has increased under the leadership of Keir Starmer, with the party now just two points behind the Conservatives. But what is more interesting are the trends underlying the swing back to the party. Labour is seeing greater swings towards them among older voters and Leave voters, the key groups they have struggled with in recent years. This indicates that some of the major divides that have haunted our politics for the past few years might be starting to fade. “A key element seems to be the handling of the pandemic, with many Leave voters who backed the Tories last year thinking the government has done a bad job. The party is therefore only holding on to 70% of the Leave voters who backed them, as opposed to 78% of their Remain voters.” Opinium polled about 7,000 people online between 27 November and 8 December."
2020-12-12T12:32:52Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: UK and EU continue trade talks as deadline looms,"Trade talks between the UK and the EU are continuing with less than 48 hours to go until the deadline imposed by both parties to reach a deal. With both sides saying on Friday that an agreement on trade was unlikely, Boris Johnson met Michael Gove, the minister who has responsibility for Brexit planning, to “take stock” of plans for a no-deal exit from the EU. The UK is also readying four Royal Navy patrol ships to help protect its fishing waters from 1 January in the event a deal cannot be reached.
The 80-metre-long vessels, armed with machine guns, would have the power to halt, inspect and impound all EU fishing boats operating within the UK’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which can extend 200 miles from shore. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Blyth in Northumberland on Friday, Johnson said fishing was one of two significant impediments to a deal – the other being how to maintain fair competition once the UK is able to set its own standards and regulations from the end of the transition period in three weeks’ time. On Saturday, Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the commons defence committee, called the threat to use Royal Navy gunboats to protect UK fishing waters irresponsible at a time of more pressing threats. “We’re facing the undignified prospect right now of our overstretched Royal Navy squaring up to a close Nato ally over fishing vessel rights when we are witnessing an increasing presence of Russian drone activity and subsurface activity – our adversaries must really be enjoying this blue on blue,” the former defence minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “This isn’t Elizabethan times any more, this is global Britain – we need to be raising the bar much higher than this.” He said the focus should be on reaching a deal, warning that failure to do so “would be so damaging to Britain – it would be a retrograde step, a failure of statecraft”. However Sir Alan West, a former admiral and chief of naval staff, said the navy should protect UK waters from foreign fishing vessels if asked to do so in a no-deal Brexit scenario. “It is absolutely appropriate that the Royal Navy should protect our waters if the position is that we are a sovereign state and our government has said we don’t want other nations there,” the peer told Today. “There are complications in that you can push vessels aside, you can cut their fishing tackle, but boarding these foreign ships, they’ll need to pass probably a little thing through parliament to give authority to board and get on them. “There is no doubt if you are a fisherman who has fished for years there – they are, as our fishermen are, quite stormy people – and you get a bit of a punch-up and you might need some marines and things.” The French MEP Pierre Karleskind, the chairman of the European parliament’s committee on fisheries, also warned about the consequences of no deal, as he called for calm about the potential deployment of the Royal Navy vessels.
“Let’s keep cool. Let’s keep calm. I was just looking at a history book,” he told Times Radio. “The creation of the French Royal Navy was done in 1294 in response to naval battles between French and English fishermen. So this is a long, long history between our two nations. “You’re saying it’s about fish but let’s think just a few seconds. Do you really think it’s only about fish that navy ships are used and will be used? I don’t think so. I think there are other interests like the control of the border, especially the question of migrants.” He added: “I really think a no-deal would be a lose-lose deal. Lose for you, lose for us. I’m pretty sure of that. I don’t know if a deal would be a win-win, but I’m absolutely sure that a no-deal would be a lose-lose deal.” Johnson declared on Friday that a no deal on trade was “very likely” as it emerged that Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel flatly rejected his appeal for direct talks earlier in the week. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, issued a similar warning about the trajectory of the talks earlier on Friday."

2020-12-11T16:02:15Z,politics,Politics,Divorce lawyer's Brexit advice: 'Know your financial outlook in advance',"The two sides seem miles apart and the language between them is harsh. After years of uneasy coexistence, a split seems inevitable. If Brexit seems like an acrimonious divorce, that’s because it is – and at least one expert in the field says the negotiating teams could learn a thing or two about the art of the civilised breakup. Here are top tips for a successful split by Emma Gill, the director of divorce and family law at Vardags solicitors. How are you going to break the news? “You cannot put a price on goodwill. Work out how you are going to tell your soon-to-be ex that it’s over. Do you need the support of friends and family when you do it? I have clients who told their partners on WhatsApp. There should be personal contact, but maybe later on. Goodwill in a divorce … goes an awfully long way.” What about the money? “Get your finances in order before you go; gather together all your paperwork. You can’t make a decision until you know what your financial outlook looks like.” Practicalities “Brexit is like a popularity contest between two parents who are appealing to their children [their electorates] to ensure they get the right answer. It’s a really uncertain time. [It’s more difficult] if you can’t sit down as a couple and explain to your children what their life will look like in future. Do it before anyone takes any precipitous action … Create as much certainty as possible for everyone as you can – so that they can get on with their lives. I would be very surprised if the EU and UK were like parents holding hands at a friend’s wedding in the future.” Keep talking … and don’t write silly letters “Keep a line of communication open. If communication was great before, you probably wouldn’t be having a divorce. Every single fractured relationship comes down to one little seed – of someone feeling they are being taken for granted [or exploited]. Anger is a perfectly natural and understandable emotion and it’s right to be able to express it, but you need to do so in a reasonable way. Don’t write silly letters to fuel the anger. If you keep talking it will put you on a better path as separated parents. “Every case is settleable. The biggest barrier is where one party just does not want to deal with the matter. They bury their head in the sand like an ostrich. You need a neutral third party to highlight where parties are being silly with each other, to sketch out what a settlement would look like. There’s value in creating a bit of pressure for everyone so that they can only leave [the proceedings] when everyone [reaches an agreement].”"
2020-12-11T15:28:19Z,politics,Politics,UK and EU say no-deal Brexit is now most likely outcome,"Boris Johnson has put Britain on course for a no-deal Brexit, claiming it is now “very, very likely”, as it emerged that Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have flatly rejected his appeal for direct talks. In a pointed toughening up of his language, the prime minister claimed Britain was on a path to leaving the single market and customs union without any trade or security agreement, describing it as a potentially “wonderful” outcome. Earlier in the day, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had similarly warned about the trajectory of the talks, telling EU leaders she believed there was a greater chance of a no-deal exit than an agreement.
The two sides remain at loggerheads over the biggest stumbling block of how to maintain fair competition once the UK is able to set its own standards and regulations from the end of the transition period in three weeks’ time. It emerged on Friday that Downing Street had sought to open bilateral talks with Merkel and Macron on Monday, before a telephone call with Von der Leyen the same day, but that both leaders rebuffed his advances, saying the commission was their negotiator. A No 10 spokesman said: “I would point you to the PM’s words yesterday where he said he would go the extra mile to reach a fair deal, including going to Brussels, Paris or to Berlin.”
Speaking to reporters on a visit to Blyth in Northumberland, a day after telling the cabinet to prepare for a no-deal exit, Johnson said the talks were not progressing. “I’ve got to tell that from where I stand now, here in Blyth, it is looking very, very likely that we will have to go for a solution that I think would be wonderful for the UK, and we’d be able to do exactly what we want from January,” he said. “It obviously would be different from what we’d set out to achieve but I have no doubt this country can get ready and, as I say, come out on World Trade [Organization] terms.” On Friday evening, Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had chaired a meeting to take stock of no-deal plans and “post-December 31 readiness” with Michael Gove and other senior officials. The EU and UK have said they will make a “firm decision” about the prospects of a deal by the end of Sunday. During a 10-minute briefing at the end of an all-night summit of EU heads of state and government on Friday morning, Von der Leyen refused to put a percentage on the chances of agreement but told leaders there was a “higher probability for no deal than deal”. Macron denied that he was over-reaching with his demands over fishing access, after being asked by reporters in Brussels. “I’m not asking to have my cake and eat it, no,” Macron said. “All I want is a cake that’s worth its weight. Because I won’t give up my share of it either.” Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the EU would be open to negotiating beyond the Sunday deadline if there were signs of agreement. “In the end, the talks will not fail because a few days more are needed,” he said. “We believe that an agreement is difficult but still possible. We will keep negotiating ... as long as a crack of the window is open.” Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the EU should not “yield” to British pressure over the level playing field provisions in any deal, warning that the bloc should prepare for a “hard Brexit”. The commission president and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, sought to tackle head-on Johnson’s claim that Brussels was seeking to force the UK to keep in lock-step with EU standards, “kind of a bit like twins”. Von der Leyen said zero tariff access to British exporters depended on products being made to a similar standard as European goods. But she added that this was “not to say that we would require the UK to follow us every time we decide to raise our level of ambition”. She went on: “For example in the environmental field, they would remain free sovereign, if you wish, to decide what they want to do – we would simply adapt the conditions for access to our market according to the decision of the UK and this would apply vice versa.” The comments suggested that the EU was retaining the right to hit Britain with automatic tariffs but Rutte later described Von der Leyen’s comments as a “clear step” towards trying to find common ground. He also told reporters that there would be no automatic application of tariffs on British exports to the EU should the UK diverge in environmental, labour and social standards, a sticking point raised by Johnson. “If the UK will deviate too much from the standards on some products in the EU, that you need have to have a structured dialogue on how to avoid those differences in standards,” he said. “That has nothing to do with sovereignty. Because everybody in the world is having these discussions with other countries where you have small or big trading blocs. He is sovereign, he is free, we are all free. This has to do with the practicalities of the internal market. “I would not phrase it like a concession but it’s a clear step because what you obviously would like as the EU is dynamic alignment so that when we change they change. That is when Boris Johnson mentioned ‘the twins’. The twin brother doing the same as I am doing. But that’s not what we ask of him. That I could understand as a concern in terms of sovereignty. “But what we do need to have is when there are too many differences in standards, applying the regulations etc, so there is an unfair advantage for companies in Europe towards the UK or from the UK towards Europe, then … in the spirit of managed divergence, you need to have this process laid out on how you deal with that. And that has nothing to do with trying to undercut UK sovereignty.” An EU official said the Brexit negotiations were proving difficult in the final days. “Negotiations resuming today,” the official added. “To be seen by Sunday whether a deal is possible.” Johnson told his cabinet on Thursday that the government needed to ready itself for a no-deal exit given the terms on offer from Brussels. On Friday morning, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said he believed there remained “a significant possibility” that a deal could be secured, and that the two sides were “90% of the way there”."
2020-12-11T14:00:10Z,politics,Politics,Starmer urged to start cooperating with Lib Dems if he wants to win,"Keir Starmer is being urged to lay the groundwork for cooperating with the Liberal Democrats and Greens at the next general election, by MPs and campaigners who argue the party will struggle to win a majority alone. In a new report, called We Divide, They Conquer, the progressive pressure group Compass sets out the scale of the electoral challenge facing Starmer’s party after last year’s general election. It warns that Labour would need to achieve a swing of 10.52% – larger than Tony Blair’s in 1997 or Clement Attlee’s in 1945 – to win the 124 seats Starmer requires to secure a fragile majority of one. “The electoral facts point to one conclusion: Labour will struggle to win alone. So the party can choose to lose alone and remain in opposition, or build cross-party alliances, lead a new government and transform the democratic landscape,” the report says. While Boris Johnson’s Conservatives would need a swing of just 3.18% against them to lose their majority, the Lib Dems are in a better position to take some of the Tories’ most vulnerable seats. The report, written by the activists Grace Barnett and Neal Lawson, identifies 59 seats it calls “progressive tragedies”, where the combined vote of Labour and the Lib Dems would have been enough to beat the Conservatives and the Brexit party in 2019. They include London constituencies such as Wimbledon, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon as well as “red wall” seats such as Bury North, Derby North and Bolton North East. There is a history of fierce tribal enmity between Lib Dem and Labour activists at grassroots level, but the report highlights areas of policy agreement. These include a significant increase in green investment; reform or replacement of universal credit; ending rough sleeping, and reform or abolition of the House of Lords. But the authors argue that a commitment to backing a more proportional voting system would open the door to a much closer relationship with other progressive parties, which have long supported the idea. “Labour making a firm commitment to back PR would be a game changer for the Lib Dems and the Greens, incentivising them to campaign and vote tactically. This would make it easier for progressives to elect a Labour-led administration, with a big democratic mandate to introduce PR,” they say. During his leadership campaign, Starmer said: “We’ve got to address the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and they feel their vote doesn’t count” – though he did not go on to spell out an alternative. Compass is setting up groups of activists in Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens, who will work to establish cross-party links and cooperate on shared policy priorities. The Labour MP Clive Lewis will launch the report at an event on Monday alongside the Lib Dem MP and former leadership candidate Layla Moran, the Green MP Caroline Lucas, and the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard. Lewis described the current electoral system as “like a game of monopoly where the Tories are always the banker”. Asked how Labour’s leadership should be preparing to collaborate with other parties, he said: “It’s about humility: it’s about accepting that you don’t have a monopoly on wisdom. There are still so many people in the parliamentary Labour party who think, just with the right leader and the right policies we can win outright, and dictate the future. But the future isn’t going to be dictated, it’s going to be negotiated.” The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, has made clear his focus is on rebuilding the party after the bruising electoral defeat that saw his predecessor Jo Swinson lose her seat. But Lib Dem sources pointed out that the most plausible way of ejecting Johnson from Downing Street involved the Lib Dems, as well as Labour, taking seats from the Tories."

But it will also be involved in more direct political activism, such as resisting evictions. “It’s about doing the organising work, and creating a movement that stretches across workplaces and communities,” she said. “The support that we’re trying to give to Momentum members at the moment is to help them set up their own tenants’ union branches locally to them, train them in tenants’ rights, which we’ve been doing alongside London Renters Union; and also just building the political education around the history of housing and tenants’ struggles in the UK and where we need to go next.” Like many on the left of the party, Protheroe Soltani is concerned that Keir Starmer is taking Labour away from the radicalism that saw Corbyn hailed by the Glastonbury crowd in 2017 – despite the fact that Starmer played down policy differences during his leadership campaign. “It’s quite evident to people on the left of the party that they feel they’ve been lied to: and they expected more and better of Keir,” she said. For her, the Labour leader’s decision to suspend the party whip from Corbyn over his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report on antisemitism in the Labour party, after Corbyn was reinstated by the national executive committee (NEC), was “the nail in the coffin”. Since then, Labour MPs and members have been barred from discussing Corbyn’s suspension or voicing solidarity with him by the general secretary, David Evans – a move which was criticised by Momentum as an attempt to stifle debate. The group is now campaigning for the post of general secretary to be directly elected by members, claiming Evans – Starmer’s preferred candidate – has become a “factional player”.
Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been using the language of a “green industrial revolution”, a concept that featured heavily in Labour’s 2019 manifesto – even if the government’s version is on a much smaller scale – and has ditched the rhetoric of austerity, if not the reality. Starmer’s team insist they have spent the past seven months re-engaging with sections of the electorate that had rejected the party in recent years, and introducing Starmer to the public: not an easy task with the nation in the grip of a pandemic. And they promise he will set out a more positive prospectus in the new year. But leftwing activists point to issues including the “spycops” bill and the recent Jamaican deportation flight, where they claim Labour has not been vocal enough in its opposition to the government. Even on the awarding of lavish contracts for medical supplies to contacts of Conservative ministers, on which shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves has been relentlessly critical, some leftwingers complain Starmer’s team are still pulling their punches. “It’s been framed in terms of ‘you’ve wasted money’. Let’s call it what it is: corruption,” said Corbyn’s former policy chief Andrew Fisher. “There’s a lack of political analysis, of framing the debate.” Citing Starmer’s decision to abstain on the government’s three-tiered Covid restrictions, he said: “There’s been a bit of an abstention on making an argument – on taking a stand.” “Young people came back into the Labour party under Corbyn because he talked about things like low pay, renters’ rights, abolishing tuition fees: Jeremy’s victory in 2015 came about because of the material reality of Britain,” Fisher said. “For a lot of these young people, they were saying, ‘someone’s speaking up for my needs for the first time’. Those sorts of young people will find other things to do.” James Schneider, who was a co-founder of Momentum before working closely with Corbyn as his director of strategic communications, said he and many of his colleagues on the left have taken their energies elsewhere. He is now working with a group called Progressive International, which among other projects is coordinating a global campaign to force Amazon to treat its workers better and pay more tax. He cited renters’ unions like Acorn, climate campaigns, and upstart trade unions winning victories against gig employers. “We need the party, we need to engage with the party, and we’re part of the party; but it’s not like the leadership is going to do it for us – far from it,” he said. Starmer’s pitch to the electorate, he argued, had been “we’re the nicer part of the establishment, you can trust us”. The left remains a force among the membership: the Grassroots Alliance slate, backed by Momentum and other leftwing groups, took five of the nine seats for constituency party representatives on Labour’s ruling NEC at recent elections. But the lack of an annual party conference – replaced by a series of online speeches and panels – has made it hard even for party veterans to judge the mood. In parliament, Rebecca Long-Bailey’s sacking in June after she shared an article about Maxine Peake that contained an antisemitic trope, dispatched the only member of Corbyn and John McDonnell’s socialist campaign group in the shadow cabinet to the back benches. The campaign group has increased in size since the 2019 election, which saw victories for several leftwing candidates favoured by Corbyn’s team, and includes more than 30 of Labour’s 200 MPs. But the group is now firmly back in its pre-2015 role as a backbench ginger group, lobbying the leadership – including calling on Starmer to reinstate Corbyn. When they look back over Corbyn’s period in charge, even some of his staunchest supporters believe that by the time of last year’s general election, the project had been dragged too far from its radical roots by the drawn-out wrangling over Brexit. Andrew Murray, chief of staff to Unite general secretary Len McCluskey and an adviser to Corbyn, said: “Jeremy did best when he was an insurgent: an outsider. When he got painted into a parliamentary corner, as part of the obstructionist establishment, it was like Samson having his hair cut off.” Like a number of Corbyn’s closest allies, Murray believes a different approach to the fraught issue of Brexit after 2017 could have kept the flame of Corbynism alive. “I think there was a view: ‘We have a hung parliament, Brexit divides the Tories, Theresa May has got no way forward; if we just oppose oppose oppose, we can bring her government down, and have an early general election, which we can win.’ And that wasn’t a mad position to take but clearly it was wrong. We just followed that line into the parliamentary weeds, and got stuck there. Completely stuck there.” Losing the enthusiastic young campaigners who had powered him to the leadership was one of the pressing motivations behind Corbyn’s ultimate decision to plump for a second referendum, but Protheroe Soltani said that her activist friends barely mention Brexit now. Some had drifted away to Plaid Cymru, she said, making her worry about next spring’s elections to the Welsh assembly. But she’s going to stay. After last year’s general election defeat, she realised that “we couldn’t allow ourselves to not keep organising and not keeping fighting for the really important things that we need to see. In my opinion, centrism won’t give us the solution.”"
2020-12-11T06:00:19Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit would make Britons less safe, ex-national security adviser says","A former national security adviser has warned that Britons would be “all less safe” in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as the UK will lose real-time access to a string of European crime databases which cannot easily be replaced. Lord Ricketts said British police face “a serious capability gap” from the end of the year unless the EU and UK can strike a trade and security deal because “the fallbacks are all slower and more clunky”. No deal, he said, would see Britain definitively lose access to the Schengen database containing information about who is wanted or missing across the EU, replacing it with an Interpol system that is not integrated into UK police or border systems. British wanted notices have to be manually inputted into the Interpol system as part of an effort that has required an extra 60 law enforcement staff and which police conceded last month “will have a major operational impact” on investigations. “Workarounds for access to the databases would all involve more time and effort. And in this business speed equals security so loss of real-time connectivity makes us all less safe,” added Ricketts, who is now a crossbench peer. The UK wants to secure access to the Schengen system, which has information about nearly one million people, as part of the overall post-Brexit deal. While security is not seen as a sticking point in the negotiations, the EU has refused to carve out a separate security deal if the trade talks fail. A no-deal contingency agreement outlined by Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, on Thursday made no reference to security, prompting one former senior Whitehall insider to claim Brussels was using the issue “as a pressure point”. UK police have been scrambling to introduce a patchwork of measures to deal with the loss of access to other databases as the uncertainty continues, including the Passenger Name Records (PNR) system, which tracks travel details, and Prüm, which contains DNA and fingerprint records. They admit there is no complete alternative to either. Last month, Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, warned that losing Prüm would mean “the UK would need to revert to individual manual exchanges of data via Interpol channels on a case by case basis”. Prüm is relatively new, with the UK connected since July 2019, but is rapidly proving its worth, Hewitt added. British officers have already made 12,000 DNA matches against data held by 11 countries also linked to the system. Earlier in the Commons, Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Brexit spokeswoman, said the government had been “unable to tell us how border officers and the police would access security data” under no deal. She called on Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster-general, to give an assurance that “the security of the British people will be in no way undermined” if Boris Johnson could not reach a deal with Brussels. “I do not believe that any European member state would wish to affect or compromise the security of its own citizens,” Mordaunt replied, adding in the event there was no deal: “We have measures in place to ensure that our citizens will be safe.” Home Office officials said that recovering sovereign control over UK borders would bring other security benefits, with customs screening on goods helping in targeting guns and drugs. Ending free movement would also allow Britain to ban entry to criminals sentenced to more than one year if the information was available to border force staff at ports of entry to the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Government and police have prepared extensively over the past three years. Our plans are well-developed and well-rehearsed.”"
2020-12-11T04:13:29Z,politics,Politics,'Be careful what you wish for': Boris Johnson warned over 'Australia-style' Brexit trade deal,"As the 31 December deadline for a Brexit trade deal with the EU looms, Boris Johnson has again warned the UK to stand by for the possibility of an “Australia-style” deal. It sounds like something two countries that rely on international trade might reasonably want to embark on, but what would it actually mean? What has Boris Johnson said?
The UK prime minister says it is a “strong possibility” that the “Australia option”, will be where Britain ends up. “Now is the time for the public and for businesses to get ready for January the 1st, because believe me there’s going to be change either way,” Johnson said Thursday night, UK time. “There will be change whether it’s a Canada-style deal or an Australia-style deal, but we certainly now need to make proper preparations for that Australia solution.”
In October, Johnson claimed that due to the stubborn intransigence of the EU he had to conclude that the “Canada-style” trade deal he was seeking was not going to be successfully negotiated without a “fundamental” change in Brussels’ negotiating position. What is an ‘Australia-style’ trade deal? Australia deals with the EU mainly under standard World Trade Organization (WTO) rules – meaning a range of tariffs, quota restrictions and customs checks are applied to many traded goods – although it has spent two years trying to negotiate a more favourable Free Trade Agreement. There are also some unique agreements in place between Australia and the EU, such as concessions on wine imports, that would not apply under a UK-EU deal without further negotiation. Downing Street began using the “Australia-style” term at the beginning of the year as a more palatable shorthand for a no-deal Brexit. Carl Bildt, the co-chairman of the European Council on Foreign Relations, has said on Twitter that Johnson “probably thinks it sounds better like that”. “Someone should tell him that Australia is actually busy negotiating a trade deal with the EU.” How is Australia’s trade relationship with Europe? On Thursday the former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull described it as unsatisfactory during an appearance on the BBC’s Question Time, citing the very large barriers for agricultural exports in particular.
“Be careful what you wish for,” Turnbull said. “Australia’s relationship with the EU is not one from a trade point of view … that Britain would want, frankly.” The EU is Australia’s third largest trading partner, third largest services export market and third largest source of foreign investment, but the FTA negotiations show the Australian government feels it could extract much more value from its European trade. What’s next? The “Canada-style” deal, as Johnson terms it, which would have involved reduced tariffs on imports and quotas, appears doomed judging by his most recent comments. He now appears to have pivoted to selling the benefits of the “Australia-style” deal (or not having a deal, effectively). “It’s now a strong possibility, strong possibility, that we will have a solution that is much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” he said on Thursday. “That doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing, there are plenty of ways, as I’ve said, that we can turn that to the advantage of both sides in the conversation, there are plenty of opportunities for the UK.” The significant difference between Australia and the UK in relation to existing trade with the EU is the volume and type of goods traded. Australia trades about 11% of its goods into Europe, most of which are raw materials, while the UK trades in more than half of its goods, including a far wider range of items. The impact of the relatively unfavourable terms that exist between trading partners under WTO rules will therefore have a far greater impact on the UK than they do on Australia."
2020-12-10T23:50:52Z,politics,Politics,Top Tory says Dominic Cummings's trip was 'deeply unfortunate',"Dominic Cummings’s notorious trip to Barnard Castle in April was a “deeply unfortunate episode” that undermined the government’s coronavirus message, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has admitted. Appearing on the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday, Buckland was asked by the host, Fiona Bruce, if he thought the former chief Downing Street adviser broke the guidelines. “Look, it was a deeply unfortunate episode. There is no doubt about that and it didn’t help when it came to creating a consistent message,” Buckland replied. It marks the first time a senior government minister has publicly acknowledged this since the paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, said there were “inconsistencies” in Cummings’s account of his actions during lockdown and apologised to her constituents for how the incident “undermined key public health messages”. Douglas Ross, who was then Scotland minister, resigned in protest over the affair. At the time, as many as six cabinet ministers privately disclosed to colleagues that they thought Cummings should go, and several did not publicly defend or express support for him. In May, Buckland wrote in the Swindon Advertiser that he “completely understood” the strength of public feeling on the issue, but did not comment further.
Earlier that month, the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed that the No 10 aide had driven 264 miles from his London home to his parents’ property in Durham on 27 March with his sick wife and child, at a time when the public were being told to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus. Cummings also admitted to the 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle, claiming he wanted to test his eyesight and to check if he was fit enough to make the long drive back down to London. The revelations unleashed a wave of public anger. MPs were bombarded with tens of thousands of emails from furious constituents and Boris Johnson faced growing discontent and revolt among his own backbenchers at his refusal to sack Cummings. Durham’s former police chief said the Cummings affair undermined lockdown enforcement and a study published in the Lancet found there was a clear and lasting Cummings effect on public confidence in the government’s handling of the pandemic, with willingness to adhere to guidelines plummeting, particularly in England. The tumultuous Cummings era came to a dramatic end in November when Johnson ordered him to leave Downing Street with immediate effect following a bitter row over the departure of Lee Cain, who was then No 10’s director of communications."
2020-12-10T20:09:33Z,politics,Politics,Ports gridlocked and retailers struggling as Brexit deadline looms,"The government is facing growing pressure to take action at the UK’s gridlocked container ports, as the looming Brexit deadline is also resulting in thousands of extra truckloads of goods heading to the Channel ports in France, causing delays and traffic queues. The delays radiating out from major container ports such as Felixstowe, Southampton and London Gateway are now being felt acutely in a number of industries. Retailers are struggling to get stock into stores and to customers in time for the critical Christmas period. On Thursday, Honda was forced to halt production for two days at its Swindon plant due to a shortage of car parts. The Builders Merchants Federation has also reported dwindling supplies of tools, timber and roof tiles. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) and groups representing the UK’s ports, shipping and logistics sectors are now appealing to transport secretary, Grant Shapps, for help.
In recent weeks the congestion at Felixstowe, the UK’s biggest container port, as well as other locations has prompted a growing number of vessels to “cut and run” – either partially unloading or skipping UK calls altogether to dump cargo at Antwerp, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge instead. Retailers are reporting week-on-week shipping cost increases of 25%, with carriers also slapping extra “congestion charges” on shipments to offset berthing delays and longer unloading times in the UK. Andrew Opie, the BRC’s director of food and sustainability, said retailers were “working overtime to rearrange and redirect incoming freight in order to ensure customers can get the items they need, but some delays appear inevitable”. “The last thing the public needs is disruption at the ports continuing into the new year at a time when Brexit will already put the Channel crossings under much greater pressure,” he added. The busy Channel crossings are already feeling the strain of companies stockpiling before the transition period ends on 31 December. French hauliers are reporting an unprecedented volume of traffic on UK routes, with about 8,000 trucks a day estimated to be crossing the Channel in each direction, 30% higher than usual. The extra trucks are causing traffic jams at the port of Calais, as well as near the Eurotunnel terminal. In a joint letter to Shapps, the nine logistics trade groups, including the British Ports Association and the Road Haulage Association, asked the government for help and warned of further potential disruption in January. Rory Munday, managing director of the Daygard Logistics, which moves 250 containers a week through the major ports, said the situation was getting worse as shipping lines unloaded containers at mainland European ports instead of in the UK. The congestion had been a problem since September, he said, and early government action could have prevented it from escalating. The rerouting of goods was adding long delays, Munday said, with some goods now taking five or six weeks to arrive, while import costs had soared. “Many households have had a tough year and next year they will see many of the things they buy weekly increase dramatically in price,” he said.
The end of the Brexit transition period was always expected to lead to teething problems at the border but the pandemic has added a new dimension to crisis planning. Kingfisher, the owner of B&Q and Screwfix, said that within the past month it had begun using six ports, rather than two, as part of its preparations. Thierry Garnier, the Kingfisher chief executive, said the retailer had “anticipated the ports problem and managed it with transport companies … so we are in a good place”. Unlike supermarkets, which rely on supplies of fresh food flowing into the country without a hitch, the DIY group’s products were less sensitive to delays, meaning it would “have a few weeks to adjust” in the event of no-deal."
2020-12-10T20:01:23Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Boris Johnson warns of 'strong possibility' of no trade deal with EU â€“ as it happened,"Thatâ€™s all from us tonight. Iâ€™ll leave you with this report from Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Lisa Oâ€™Carroll on the prime ministerâ€™s warning that there is a strong possibility the UK will trade with the EU on WTO terms after 31 December."
2020-12-10T19:56:30Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: no-deal Brexit now a 'strong possibility',"Boris Johnson has ordered ministers to prepare for the “strong possibility” of a no-deal Brexit, warning that the UK risks being “locked in the EU’s orbit” as senior Tories urge him to find an agreement. After a three-hour summit with the European commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, failed to bridge major gaps between them, the prime minister said he was prepared to “go the extra mile” by flying to Paris or Berlin for face-to-face talks with EU leaders. But he said the EU’s current offer was unacceptable because the UK could not be treated like its twin. “It was put to me that this was kind of a bit like twins, and the UK is one twin the EU is another, and if the EU decides to have a haircut then the UK is going to have a haircut or else face punishment. Or if the EU decides to buy an expensive handbag then the UK has to buy an expensive handbag too or else face tariffs,” he said. “Clearly that is not the sensible way to proceed and it’s unlike any other free trade deal. It’s a way of keeping the UK kind of locked in the EU’s … regulatory orbit.” Johnson’s language echoed his condemnation of Theresa May’s Brexit deal. After he resigned as foreign secretary in 2018, he told that year’s Tory party conference that Britain must not be “locked in the tractor beam of Brussels”. He added on Thursday: “I do think we need to be very, very clear. There is now a strong possibility – a strong possibility – that we will have a solution that is much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU.” Downing Street said Johnson had overwhelming cabinet backing for his stance despite official forecasts suggesting no deal would knock an extra 2% of GDP off an economy already hit hard by the Covid crisis. “What I told the cabinet this evening is to get on and make those preparations. We’re not stopping talks, we’ll continue to negotiate but looking at where we are I do think it’s vital that everyone now gets ready for that Australian option,” Johnson said. The Australian option is Johnson’s name for trading on World Trade Organization terms with the EU, meaning tariffs being imposed on a wide range of goods. Meanwhile, lorry queues built up in Kent for the third day in a row, attributed to Brexit stockpiling, Covid vaccine deliveries and Christmas traffic. Heavy congestion is expected over the weekend with a live test of no-deal contingency plans. Barriers will be put in place to create a contraflow system as part of Operation Brock, Kent’s longer-term contingency plan for Brexit gridlock. Similar plans known as Operation Transmission are being prepared around Portsmouth international port. Johnson’s blunt statement came amid warnings from senior Conservatives that “the world is watching” as Brexit negotiations enter their final phase. Some MPs said they were discussing whether they could use parliamentary tactics to block a no-deal exit. After Wednesday evening’s dinner between Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen ended at an impasse with a new deadline set for Sunday, Tory MPs have become increasingly concerned that the risk of a no-deal exit on 1 January is rising. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence committee, said: “The world is watching this. We are being marked for our international prestige, our statecraft and how we deploy it. And what we lose will be huge.” He pointed to the security implications of a no-deal exit. “There will be economic repercussions but also security ones. Our Channel waters are being buzzed by Russian submarines, our airspace by Russian jets. We need alliances – and Europe needs to stand and work together. This would be us turning the other way, just as we assume the G7 presidency.” The European commission published its own no-deal contingency plans on Wednesday, including allowing airlines from the UK to operate flights across its territory and keeping roads open to British hauliers for six months – but only if the UK reciprocates. Under the same terms, Brussels will also offer UK fishermen access to its seas and open negotiations over quotas. Johnson’s spokesman appeared to suggest that would be unacceptable, however, saying: “We would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state.” The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said a no-deal exit would be a “failure of statecraft”, but he laid the blame on the EU for failing to understand the UK position. “I still think that the Europeans are overestimating the political space that Boris Johnson has on this,” he said. “That’s why I think it’s a very perilous situation.” Damian Green, chair of the One Nation group of Tory MPs, said: “It has always been in Britain’s best interest to leave on friendly terms, with a deal that allows people and trade to flow as freely as possible. That is still true, even in these last few days.” The former minister Stephen Hammond added: “Ending the year without a free trade agreement would be bad for Britain and the EU. I really urge the negotiating teams to find a solution – for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe.”
The former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a supporter of Johnson’s leadership campaign, said it was vital every effort was made. “At this critical juncture, every sinew must be stretched to secure a deal. Not at any price; the country voted to leave and we are a proud independent nation. “But no one should be in any doubt of the economic consequences of proceeding without a deal on 1 January next year.” The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, castigated the government for failing to get agreement, urging the prime minister to take control of the negotiations and “bring back a deal”."
2020-12-10T19:16:32Z,politics,Politics,EU makes fishing and transport no-deal offers in return for 'level playing field',"The EU will also offer British fishermen access to its seas and open negotiations over quotas, if the UK government reciprocates. The European commission said the offers were for a limited period and it was only willing to act to avoid the worst disruption, including the risk of outbreaks of violence. In a move that will only serve to irritate the British government in the context of the troubled talks on a future trade deal, the commission insisted its offer depended on the UK having “equivalent” regulations. “A level playing field requires that, even after the end of the transition period, the UK continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards,” state the contingency documents to help the bloc prepare for a no-deal exit. In haulage, that would include the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies and the maintenance of the current levels of protection for workers and the environment. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the publication of the contingency plans had been expected and they echoed proposals from September 2019. “We’ll obviously look at the details very closely. We’ve already set out our own plans in the event of a free trade agreement not being reached,” he said. He played down the risks of supply disruption in the event of no deal, saying the UK had a “resilient supply chain” and had made extensive preparations. The publication of the contingency measures, long sought by EU member states, follows agreement on a new Sunday deadline for the negotiations between the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. The timetable was set at a dinner in Brussels on Wednesday night between Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, where “frank” and “lively” exchanges led to little being resolved.
EU leaders arriving in Brussels for a summit on Thursday offered a downcast assessment of the state of the talks. Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said: “I’m a bit more gloomy today. As far as I hear, there was no progress made in the recent days. It’s problematic, of course. That is a huge challenge we’ve always said that we are preparing for the worst … hoping for the best. And now, it seems, difficult, it’s a difficult situation.” Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, urged the commission to do everything it could do to overcome the obstacles. “It is very difficult, and from talking to colleagues no one understates the challenges that lay ahead – but it’s important for the citizens of Europe we do everything we possibly can to get an agreement,” he said. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said it was “in everyone’s interest that an agreement is reached”, but insisted the EU’s line could not and would not change. She said the bloc could not show more flexibility on fisheries, adding: “We can offer many things, but not flexibility.” Deals could be so bad they were “not worth adopting”, she said, and the EU would “not make an agreement that undermines companies in Denmark, Sweden or Germany”. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the talks were unlikely to be extended beyond Sunday’s deadline without substantial concessions from Brussels. But in a hint that the government hopes discussions might continue after the weekend if progress is being made, Johnson’s spokesman said: “Both the prime minister and Ursula von der Leyen have agreed that a firm decision should be made about the future of talks by Sunday.” He declined to say what the substance of any potential compromise might be. Raab said Brussels would need to back down from its demands on controlling fishing waters and laws on standards. “It’s fair to say that, whilst there was a good conversation last night, and it was frank and it was candid, the significant points of difference remain. I don’t think we can keep going on at that pace without having some progress and some flexibility,” he told the BBC. “On the fisheries, we’ve accepted that there needs to be some sort of transitional period but we must be able to control access to our own waters. We’ve agreed that we’d follow the EU’s approach to free trade deals with countries like Canada and Korea in relation to the so-called level playing field requirements. “What we’re not going to be treated … is in a way that no other country would accept, and nor would the EU accept. It’s about some basic respect for democratic principles.” Raab accused the bloc of lacking “pragmatism and flexibility”. The Tesco chairman, John Allan, has suggested food bills could rise by 5% as a result of the tariffs and disruption from a no-deal Brexit. But Raab told the BBC that tariffs would be a “very minor proportion” of food prices."
2020-12-10T18:53:42Z,politics,Politics,The Brexit Brussels dinner: fish and frank talk but no one left satisfied,"In the final few moments, at the end of a long dinner on the 13th floor of the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters, Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen slipped away from their advisers and chief negotiators to talk alone in a corner of the room. It was a tête-à-tête between two leaders mindful of the historic nature of their discussions. Their conversation was intense, and notable for its apparent frankness; the body language made that clear to observers. The entire evening, as Von der Leyen would later tweet, had been “lively” – but this was not two politicians merely talking past each other. Both appeared to understand each other’s point of view, sources told the Guardian, and concluded it was worth “one last go” to reach a Brexit deal, even amid warnings of increasingly gloomy prospects. A Sunday deadline was set. Johnson had arrived in Brussels from RAF Northolt shortly after 6.30pm with his chief negotiator, David Frost, and Frost’s deputy, Oliver Lewis. Sir Tim Barrow, the outgoing British ambassador to the EU and a key figure in the negotiations, met the RAF Voyager as it touched down on the tarmac. The first port of call for their convoy was the ambassador’s residence on Rue Ducale, an early 19th-century terraced house overlooking the city’s Parc Royal, where Johnson and his advisers sat for an hour to discuss the evening to come. Armed with sheaves of papers detailing the outstanding issues in the negotiations, the four men made the short drive to the Berlaymont, escorted by the flashing blue lights and sirens of police motorcycle outriders. Johnson and his team were met by Von der Leyen and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. As the prime minister got out of his car, Von der Leyen ushered him in. “Allons-y,” she said – let’s go. Preparing for the official photographers, Johnson asked if they were taking off their masks for the cameras. “Yes,” Von der Leyen replied in English, but added: “Keep distance. Then … you have to put it back on immediately.” “You run a tight ship here, Ursula,” Johnson told her, “and quite right too.” The group were joined by Stéphanie Riso, a French economist and deputy head of Von der Leyen’s cabinet, who has been the commission president’s main link to the negotiating team, and Jens Flosdorff, a former journalist and longtime adviser. Initial conversations were stilted and a little uneasy but then they set about the problems ahead of them. After a short opening discussion, dinner was served in Von der Leyen’s private quarters, with everyone at a social distance. Barnier’s preference for fish – a stock over which the negotiators have quarrelled in the past – was respected. Downing Street would later say the meeting in Brussels had been “frank” – diplo-speak for heated. “Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged,” a UK government source said. Von der Leyen tweeted: “We had a lively and interesting discussion on the state of play on outstanding issues. We understand each other’s positions. They remain far apart. The teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these issues.” EU sources counselled against those who read the statements as suggesting there had been rows or flared tempers. “The British press misinterpret us sometimes when we put things in English,” said one. “By lively, we mean it was not a dour conversation as if they were dug in their first world war trenches battling.” The source added: “They understand the politics – and they were talking in a way that was frank, you could see that.”
A UK official reiterated that there had been a refreshing candidness to the discussion, but no breakdown – and yet no deal either. “The prime minister made clear his determination not to leave any route to a fair deal untested, but emphasised that any agreement must respect the independence and sovereignty of the UK,” the source said. The British party left the Berlaymont at 11.10pm local time and went back to Rue Ducale. Sources said there was some despondency about the night’s discussions. Frost, Lewis and Barrow went off to a back room to pore over the developments. Nothing had been resolved, a source admitted. Neither side’s negotiators had received new instructions. But hope, at least in Brussels, was not lost. “It is about threading the eye of the needle,” one insider said. Not a deal or no deal at this stage but, even amid growing preparations for eventual failure, a final push. • This article was amended on 11 December 2020 to correct a reference to sheaves from sheaths."
2020-12-10T18:13:00Z,politics,Politics,Chinese officials linked to Hong Kong arrests escape UK sanctions,"The UK Foreign Office has caused dismay among critics of China after announcing new travel bans and asset freezes against 10 human rights abusers in four countries but not imposing sanctions – like the US – against Chinese officials. Nathan Law, a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, who left the territory for the UK in July after a sweeping national security law was passed, said he was disappointed. “It cannot be about a lack of evidence,” he said. “This is a political decision. I really think this is about this UK hedging strategy and I hope it will come to an end. There is nothing to expect from China and there is no fantasy to be had about the Chinese communist party.” Rahima Mahmut, the UK representative for the World Uyghur Congress, described the absence of any Chinese officials as “painful and hurtful” adding: “I hope it is a matter of time. Our people are murdered, sterilised and raped.”
In the sanctions announced, the UK said it was placing travel bans and asset freezes on 10 politicians, officials and others responsible for gross human rights violations in Gambia, Pakistan, Russia and Venezuela. The measures, introduced on Thursday – International Human Rights Day – are the third set of sanctions to be announced by the UK under its new independent human rights sanctions regime. The EU introduced its own regime of human rights sanctions this week. Backbench MPs had this week pressed the Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams to impose sanctions on Chinese officials involved in arresting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. He said the issue was under consideration. This week the US imposed sanctions on 14 Chinese officials. On Thursday it set sanctions on Huang Yuanxiong, chief of the Xiamen public security bureau, Wucun police station, for involvement in gross violations of human rights in Xiamen. The US state department said: “Huang is associated with particularly severe violations of religious freedom of Falun Gong practitioners, namely his involvement in the detention and interrogation of Falun Gong practitioners for practising their beliefs.” Luke de Pulford, co-chair of the inter-parliamentary alliance on China, said he had helped put a huge dossier of evidence on human rights abuse in front of the UK officials, as had the US. The Foreign Office announced it was imposing sanctions against three Russian individuals, and against the Terek special rapid response unit responsible for torture and other human rights violations against LGBT people in Chechnya. In Venezuela, sanctions will be imposed on three senior security figures responsible for human rights violations under Nicolás Maduro’s regime. They come in the week Maduro organised widely challenged national assembly elections, which the UK has refused to recognise. One of those sanctioned is Rafael Bastardo, commander of FAES (special action forces) until 2019. The remaining sanctions are imposed on the former Gambia president Yahya Jammeh and his wife. In Pakistan the UK has sanctioned Ahmad Anwar Khan, former senior police superintendent in Malir district, Karichi, who had already been sanctioned by the US treasury for being responsible for mass executions. He retired from the police force. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “Global Britain will stand up for democracy, human rights and the rule of law as a force for good in the world.” Britain claimed it was acting in concert with the US, which was also announcing new designations under separate human rights policies. It is expected that the UK will present a new set of sanctions in January and that these will be focused on individuals thought corrupt – the first time the country will cite corruption as a reason to impose asset freezes under the legislation."
2020-12-10T17:57:47Z,politics,Politics,UK business travellers to EU 'face fines' over post-Brexit permits,"Business travellers will face fines of up to €20,000 (£18,240) if they do not apply for special permits for visits to conferences or exhibitions in the European Union if there is no Brexit deal for the service industry, industry leaders have warned. “What you can’t do post-Brexit as a third-country national is simply think that you can get on Eurostar and rock up as you did before when we were a member state of the EU, you can’t just do that,” said Tim Thomas, a consultant with specialist firm International Employment Mobility Consultancy. Make UK, which represents some of the biggest manufacturers in the UK, said it is concerned that the issue of business travel for service engineers will not only arise in a no-deal scenario but could arise if a trade deal comes home without a full services section. Service engineers are the army of workers who are called out at short notice to EU factories, offices and industrial sites to fix everything from hospital scanners to lifts and aircraft parts. “There is a real nervousness about it among our members,” said Ben Fletcher, director of Policy at Make UK. “All the focus is on goods and there is just not enough detail on this to make our members feel comfortable.” “One firm has told us that in an average month they have about 10,000 people movements … to go and do service-related work across the EU,” he said. He declined to identify the company but said they had a “very large manufacturing base in the UK” and had heavy duty machinery in factories and equipment inside aircraft that needed servicing regularly. Any barriers to a company’s service-level agreements could impact their ability to sell their products to the EU, said Fletcher. “A service-level agreement would sometimes guarantee a service engineer, present within hours rather than days,” he said. “There is a real nervousness about how that can work post-Brexit.” The threat is a consequence of the UK’s decision to quit the single market as part of the hard Brexit the government is pursuing. Time-limited travel trips and a deal for services were part of the negotiating objectives said out by the government earlier this year. In a non-negotiated outcome, UK visitors will have to “navigate the rules of 30 different countries” said Thomas, with different regulations in each and heavy prices to pay for non-compliance. Posted workers who do not have permits currently can face fines “typically of between €10,000 and €20,000 per worker for non compliance”, according to Thomas. But enforcement in some countries has been branded punitive with fines of up to €50,000 in Austria. To add to the red tape challenge, the rules in each country will be different. “Some countries will allow you attend a trade show, others will allow you to attend but not exhibit while others will allow you to exhibit but not conclude a contract,” Thomas said. “I think most people are still in a state of partial or total disbelief when they hear about this.”"
2020-12-10T17:50:51Z,politics,Politics,Pupils face mass testing as tier 3 Covid measures loom in London,"Thousands of children will be tested for coronavirus in schools across London, Kent and Essex, in a bid to stem rising infection rates which have put the capital on course for tier 3 restrictions next week. Public Health England (PHE) officials have urged the government to move London, with its population of 9 million, to the strictest measures when the tiers are reassessed on 16 December, unless the data shifts significantly. In a briefing with ministers on Thursday evening, London MPs were told to expect the worst, as the most recent weekly surveillance survey by PHE revealed that the capital now had the highest rate of coronavirus infections in England. A number of Conservative MPs are expected to lobby ministers to keep the capital in tier 2, given that mortality rates remain relatively low and the London NHS is managing admissions reasonably well. “Public Health England wanted this to happen two weeks ago and are adamant now, but a lot of people will want to see harder evidence,” one MP said. Another MP described the data as “awful” and said they believed a change was inevitable. “We are heading to tier 3 for sure,” the MP said. The Treasury has reportedly previously warned ministers that putting London into tier 3 would cost 550,000 jobs. Leading the Downing Street daily briefing, the health secretary, Matt Hancock said he was “particularly concerned” about the number of cases in London, Kent and Essex, and that test data showed that cases were rising fastest among secondary school children, aged 11 to 18. The rate among adults in London was “broadly flat”, but the rise in young people was likely to be replicated in other age groups and required immediate targeted action, he said.
The mass testing will be carried out in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London and parts of Kent. “I want to urge all those involved to step forward for the testing,” said Hancock. “It is important that 11-18 years-olds get tested in these boroughs, irrespective of whether they have symptoms.” Commenting on the new mass testing of secondary school pupils, Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, questioned why schools in England were remaining open. “The government is yet to explain why during this emergency testing period public health is best served by schools remaining fully open,” he said. “A very short-term period of home learning while test results are obtained would ensure further transmission does not occur in schools among the most affected group.” The announcement in England came as Wales’s education minister announced that secondary schools and colleges in Wales would move to online learning from Monday in a “national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus”. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, welcomed plans for mass testing in the south-east but said the move in Wales was a “much more robust response to an increasingly worrying situation”. On Thursday the UK recorded 20,964 more coronavirus cases, up 4,386 on the previous day – the highest daily rise since mid-November. Another 516 deaths were reported in 24 hours, slightly down on the 533 deaths confirmed the day before. All regions of England recorded week-on-week falls in infections, except for eastern England, where the rate rose from 116.2 to 147.2, and the south-east, where it increased from 142.2 to 160.8. Following months with some of the highest case numbers, infection rates have fallen across much of northern England, where many areas are in tier 3. The West Midlands had the steepest fall in cases, dropping to 158.4 per 100,000 people, down from 196.8 the previous week. South-west England had the lowest rate at 77.3, down from 91.2.
Three-quarters of the capital’s boroughs (24 of 32) recorded an increase in coronavirus cases in the week to 4 December, and the city had the highest average infection rate in the country, at 191.8 per 100,000 people for the week of 30 November to 6 December, according to PHE figures, up from 158.1 per 100,00 in the previous week. England’s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said that a third wave was “not inevitable” but warned that the country was moving into a “very risky period”. “Christmas is a period when we can do things, that’s the reason why the rules have been relaxed. That doesn’t mean we should do things,” he told the briefing. Hancock said that tens of thousands of people had received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine this week in 73 locations, and this would be extended to a further 10 sites next week with vaccinations beginning in GP surgeries and care homes by Christmas. But he warned that the fight was not over, adding: “So don’t blow it now.” The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, repeated the warnings, tweeting: “We can’t lower our guard now – we’ve worked too hard for too long to let this virus endanger the people we love.” PHE figures showed that Greater Manchester – where local leaders fought for increased support following months of restrictions – had 160.1 cases per 100,000 people as of 4 December, compared with 194.1 on 27 November.
The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said it was clear that the region had a case to move into tier 2. “We will be making that case to government over the next couple of days,” he said. Meanwhile NHS test and trace launched its “business plan” – expected to be in place by March – which would see regular coronavirus testing in workplaces, pubs and theatres. This will be combined with serial testing – where people are sent a box of lateral flow tests to take each day for a week – to help cut the isolation period from 14 days to seven for contacts, and mass community testing in tier 3 areas. More than 62,000 people in Britain have died as a result of coronavirus, the highest death toll in Europe."
2020-12-10T16:24:09Z,politics,Politics,Mordaunt goes through the looking-glass and down a rabbit hole | John Crace,"It’s been such a year of horrors that it’s become easy to lose track of just how weird things are. But Thursday was one of those days when we slipped a little further through the looking-glass. Only a year ago many opposition MPs were still hoping for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU on the off-chance that the public might have changed their mind. Now those same MPs are the ones pleading for the government to just get a deal – any deal, however crap – to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 December. Their expectations have fallen that low. At the same time most Tory MPs, who had previously bigged up the “oven-ready” deal and had openly boasted of a new trade deal being the easiest deal in the world and that a no deal was unthinkable, are now urging Boris Johnson to go for that very same no-deal Brexit. No more mucking about with an EU that is stubbornly hanging on to notions of fish, governance and level playing fields – the same issues it has been going on about for years – and just leave on World Trade Organization terms. So we’re in an upside down world where Labour appears to have more interest in the government clinching a last-minute deal than the Conservatives. Go figure. In the Commons there was a distinct sense of deja vu as, for the second time in a week, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, had secured an urgent question to ask her opposite number, Michael Gove, to give an update on the state of the Brexit negotiations. And for the second time in a week, the Govester declined to attend in person and sent his understudy, Penny Mordaunt, to do his dirty work for him. And for the second time in a week, Mordaunt had precisely nothing new to say. Mainly because there was nothing new to say but partly because even if there was, Mordaunt would be among the last to know. So she rattled through what she had learned from the 24-hour news outlets. Boris Johnson had flown to Brussels for dinner with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and had achieved as little as everyone had expected. Other than that, the previous day’s deadline had been moved to Sunday. So in the meantime we were where we were, with the UK and EU still a long way from any agreement, but a deal was there to be done provided the EU gave way on all their red lines. After all, it was the least they could do given that the UK had withdrawn its threat to break international law in an agreement it had negotiated less than a year ago. This was all a bit much for Reeves and you could sense the despair in her voice as she responded. How come we knew more about what the two leaders had eaten – fish, followed by an Australian-style pavlova: nice shade there from the EU – than what they had actually said to each other? And how come Boris had returned and gone straight into hiding? Shouldn’t the prime minister be showing a little more leadership by making a public statement to reassure the country that there were at least some contingency plans if the shit really hit the fan? What were the plans for the nations’s security? After all, the EU had published its contingency plans, which seemed to amount to things getting steadily worse for the UK up until a time when someone came up with anything better. At which point Mordaunt lost the plot and started blaming Labour for the failure to agree a trade deal. In Pennyworld, Labour was guilty of treason for daring to hope for a positive outcome to the negotiations. The same negotiations she herself had just said she wanted to end positively. Labour’s crazy idea that a deal was better than no deal had completely undermined the government’s position. By trying to accommodate a bad deal on the grounds that it was the least worst option, they had somehow managed to make a no deal far more likely. This was like blaming the Poles for the German invasion of Poland in 1939. At times like this, satire is pointless. Just transcribing the lunacy is more absurd than anything I could possibly make up. “We all want a deal,” said Labour’s Hilary Benn. Only it was increasingly clear that wasn’t true, as Tory after Tory stood up to say they would be far happier with no deal and that they would be devastated by any deal other than one that entailed the EU capitulating on all its demands. It’s yet to dawn on them that the whole point of a trade deal is that it inevitably involves external governance and a loss of sovereignty, but that these losses are outweighed by the gains. Thereafter we slid further and further down the rabbit hole. Labour’s Bill Esterson wondered if we could have an economic impact assessment of any deal with the EU that we turned down, just so we could compare it to the 2% loss in GDP that the Office for Budget Responsibility was predicting for a no deal. Just so that we could have a sliding doors moment when we could see how much better life might be without lorries full of food and medicines parked up on the French border. Mordaunt didn’t think this was a good idea. Far better to jump into a no deal without any regrets. Almost as an afterthought, Mordaunt added that Sunday might not actually be the final deadline after all. We might decide to carry on talking pointlessly up until 31 December because that might make the end of transition even more dramatic. If no less inevitable. Either Mordaunt was lying to herself and the Commons or she is a wee bit dim if she thinks the EU is going to significantly change its position in the next three weeks. So the thought lingered that Reeves and Mordaunt would be back next Monday with the same urgent question and the same lack of answers. And if that doesn’t give you nightmares, it does me."
2020-12-10T16:04:55Z,politics,Politics,The EU's no-deal Brexit plans: what they are and what they mean,"The European commission has published a series of no-deal contingency plans, warning that the outcome of the Brexit trade and security negotiation “remains uncertain today, even though the end of the transition period is very near”. The proposals are said to offer poorer terms than would be contained in a trade deal and are targeted at sectors where there is seen to be no alternative. They are temporary and must be reciprocated by the UK, the commission has said. Flights For a maximum of six months, air carriers will be able to continue flights from the UK to the EU. Safety certificates for aircraft parts approved before the end of the transition period will continue to be valid for aircrafts registered in the EU. Under EU law, operating licences to fly between destinations within the bloc are reserved for airlines that are majority-owned and in effect controlled by EU, EEA or Swiss nationals. EasyJet, Ryanair and the British Airways owner IAG are all affected. The EU is providing for a six-month grace period. Roads Without a trade agreement, hauliers seeking to take freight across Europe would be reliant on successfully applying for a limited number of permits. The UK industry was granted fewer than 2,000 permits for 2021 in the annual lottery for third-country hauliers driving into the EU – a fraction of the 10,000 it needed. The European commission proposal says: “The strict limits that govern the number of permits mean that these would not be sufficient to carry goods by road between the UK and the member states and would result in serious disruptions, potentially even threatening public order.” Regular coach services would also be interrupted. The commission has offered to keep roads open to British hauliers and passenger bus services for six months. The UK government would have to commit to maintaining regulations “equivalent to those of the EU on fair competition as well as social and technical” issues. Channel tunnel Without contingency measures, the Channel tunnel would have to be shut down in the event of no deal. In order for a new legal agreement between France and the UK to be negotiated, a nine-month extension of the current authorisations is being granted. Fish The commission says ending the Brexit transition period without a deal on access to fishing waters “could be very disruptive for the economic livelihoods of coastal communities, and threaten the sustainable nature of fishing in the waters concerned”. The EU is proposing to maintain reciprocal access. There would then be a negotiation of catch quotas for next year. A UK spokesman said: “Whether we leave the transition period on Canada- or Australia-style arrangements, we will take back control of our waters. We would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state.” Money The EU has agreed to set aside €5bn (£4.56bn) in a Brexit adjustment reserve to help member states most affected by the UK’s exit from the bloc, with or without a deal. France has been lobbying for help for its fishermen. “In terms of the regions and sectors most affected, it is already clear that a no-deal scenario poses specific risks to the EU fishing industry,” the commission said. “The proposal will reflect this reality.” Emergencies The European commission has set up a “Brexit hotline” for the governments of the 27 member states directly to contact experts in Brussels. The capitals have been told to avoid doing side deals with the UK. The commission writes: “The EU collectively has a stronger bargaining power than each member state acting alone. This bargaining power benefits all member states. It must be used to ensure a level playing field between the EU and the UK.” UK response A UK government spokesman said: “This kind of statement from the EU is expected – they set out a similar proposition in September 2019. The UK government has already set out its own plans in the event no free trade agreement is reached and we’ve said that we would discuss practical arrangements with the EU. The EU’s contingency measures were only set out this morning and we will look at the details closely.”"
2020-12-10T15:55:49Z,politics,Politics,How will the EU travel ban affect Britons who have booked holidays?,"British holidaymakers will be barred from the EU from 1 January as the European commission has indicated there will be no exemption for the UK from Covid-19 safety restrictions, apart from for Northern Ireland residents travelling to the Republic of Ireland. What does it all mean for Britons with a holiday booked in 2021 – or sooner? How much of an impact will this have? On the face of it, this is not great news. However, it’s important to note that the Foreign Office is still advising against all nonessential travel to most of mainland Europe, bar a few holiday destinations such as certain Greek islands. This means relatively few people have holidays booked in the early part of 2021, as in most cases travel insurance is invalid. It also gives popular European tourist destinations time to consider their options (see below). I am due to travel in December: does this affect me? No, this only becomes an issue after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. You can still travel until then, albeit with the existing restrictions and the quarantine requirements when you return. What about the February half-term ski rush – or city breaks? Arguably this is the next big getaway, but it was already looking highly unlikely to go ahead as normal – for UK residents at least. Most European ski resorts are closed – or open only to locals – and look set to remain so for the February half-term. However, if the Foreign Office changes its travel advice between now and then and EU resorts open up, Britons could find themselves turned away at borders. British residents planning a city break to, say, Lisbon could also find themselves turned away until the EU lifts its Covid ban on non-residents arriving for tourism – unless Portugal offered Brits a “travel corridor”, as seen in the summer. I am booked to travel in spring: have I lost the money I spent on the trip, or am I insured? If you have booked a package ski or other similar holiday (a flight and hotel package), the tour operator will have to cancel the trip and you will be entitled to a full refund. Anyone who booked their own ski or other trips – driving themselves or flying to the Alps, and booking their own accommodation – will almost certainly find that their travel insurance will not cover them for cancellation. Even Insurefor.com, the company that bills itself as the insurer prepared to cover those willing to travel in the face of the Foreign Office advice, says customers are not covered for cancellation if they are refused entry to a country because of a Covid-related restriction. How will this be resolved? Abta, which represents the travel industry, says the European council’s proposal is only a recommendation and that individual countries are able to implement their own measures, including options such as travel corridors and testing. If by Easter infection or immunisation rates in the UK are better – or no worse – than EU destinations, it is likely that some EU countries will unilaterally decide to allow UK tourists to come, in an attempt to save the tourist industry, with others soon following suit. An Abta spokesperson said: “It is too early to say what restrictions might be in place on 1 January, given the uncertain nature of the pandemic, but we know that UK travellers are hugely important to a number of EU destinations, including some winter sun favourites like the Canary Islands and Madeira.” Is this all because of Brexit? Yes. The fact that we are leaving the EU means that we join countries such as Albania and Turkey when it comes to entering the EU. On Thursday morning the Netherlands announced that all non-EU citizens would have to show a negative Covid-19 test result when entering the country by air or sea. This will affect British tourists from 1 January onwards. Arguably we can expect more of this in the coming months."
2020-12-10T14:32:51Z,politics,Politics,Oliver Cromwell did it but will Boris Johnson? Why MPs might sit on Christmas Day,"The last time parliament sat in Westminster on Christmas Day, business began with the second reading of a bill about the holding of sheriffs’ courts in Wiltshire, before moving on to discussion of the forest laws in the Forest of Dean. The circumstances, granted, were exceptional: the date was 1656 and Christmas observances had been outlawed by Oliver Cromwell’s Long Parliament. The Commons benches might have been suspiciously empty that 25 December, but those MPs who had turned up were eager to show that this was a day as mundane as any other. Coronavirus restrictions notwithstanding, Christmas will still be celebrated this year. But for Britain’s 650 MPs, it is possible that it will be a particularly puritanical holiday. Last-gasp talks on Brexit remain on a knife-edge, but if Boris Johnson does secure a deal with the EU, any potential agreement would have to be ratified by both the Commons and the Lords by the deadline of 31 December. If that means forcing MPs to sit between Christmas and the new year to get the deal passed, the government is willing to do so, it has been reported. Government officials have even looked into the historical precedent for sitting on Christmas Day itself, the Sun reported; while that may be unlikely, one source told the paper, MPs could be called back to parliament on Monday 28 December, despite it being a bank holiday. “Anything is possible,” the source said. There is always some flexibility in parliamentary timetables, says Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government, although there has been pressure in recent years to agree term dates early, particularly for the sake of those with caring responsibilities. “It’s a more businesslike way of running parliament to know in advance what your dates are going to be.” This year, however, the government has deliberately left itself extra room for manoeuvre in case it needs to rush a deal through parliament; a recess motion, which agrees the termly dates, has not yet been introduced. On Wednesday evening, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, said that while he hoped all parliamentary business could be concluded by Monday 21 December, he would be happy for there to be extension if MPs needed a little more time. “I’d like to believe that we’d all be going up on the date that is expected of the house. But if need be – the house is the servant. And therefore I am happy, us being that servant, to ensure that we can run, as far as I’m concerned, up to Christmas Eve.” It is not, however, his decision; rather MPs would be asked to back a government motion to sit later. Even if more time is needed to pass a possible deal, says White, it would not necessarily mean yanking MPs away from turkey curries in their constituencies to come back to London. And, unlikely as it might seem, they would have Covid-19 to thank. Because of the new parliamentary procedures put in place to cope with the pandemic, she notes, many hundreds of MPs have registered for proxy votes, allowing the party whips to vote on their behalf. And with Keir Starmer expected to whip Labour MPs to back a deal, it is unlikely to encounter too much resistance. “So it’s certainly the case that in order to have the votes of the members needed to pass the legislation, you wouldn’t need them all to be in Westminster right now.”"
2020-12-10T14:01:10Z,politics,Politics,'It has hammered us': 2019's election voters on a difficult year,"Belfast East The mist of uncertainty that worried east Belfast voters in the run-up the general election has given way, a year later, to a depressing clarity: things have got worse. Covid-19 has battered Northern Ireland’s economy, health system and power-sharing government. And Brexit has become only more ominous, with warnings of possible disruptions to trade and food supplies in January. It is a grim end to a year that began on a positive note. In January the main political parties agreed to restore a power-sharing government after three years of political paralysis. Prodded by the British and Irish governments and chastened by electoral losses, Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) joined other parties in reviving the mothballed executive and assembly at Stormont. Then the coronavirus pandemic swept through the region in March and buffeted the executive for the rest of the year.
“We feel we’ve lost almost a year of our lives,” said Robert McCourt, 67, who along with his wife, Delphine, was scathing about official handling of the pandemic. “The Dominic Cummings affair undermined the whole thing,” he said, alluding to lockdown breaches by Boris Johnson’s former adviser. “I don’t really feel there’s a good deal of guidance coming out of the London government or the government here. It feels very slapdash.” The couple were in France from March to June and were taken aback by the lax norms upon returning home, said Delphine, 45. “In Tesco we were the only ones wearing a mask. We got very strange looks as if we were from another planet.” Diverging policies and advice in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland undermined coherence, she said. “This pandemic has shown to the world how disunited the United Kingdom is.” Gavin Robinson, of the DUP, beat Naomi Long, the Alliance leader, to become MP for Belfast East, but Long ended up as justice minister in the Stormont executive. Polarisation fanned by Brexit made it difficult to feel hopeful about politics, Long told the Guardian last November. Now, after months of rows and brinkmanship in the Stormont executive, she sounds close to despair. Anyone with an ounce of “sense or sanity” would reconsider participation in the body after “shameful and embarrassing” tactics, most recently by the DUP which opposed coronavirus restrictions, Long recently told RTÉ. “We have a lot of work to do to repair the damage done ... and not find ourselves in that same position again.” If there was another such debacle, the executive might not survive, she warned. Last November the McCourts, though remainers, welcomed the Brexit deal Johnson had negotiated with the EU as the least worst option. The prime minister’s subsequent threat to override the deal has revived the spectre of disruption to Northern Ireland’s trade and food supply. “It makes the UK look like a rogue country, a banana republic,” said Delphine. Her husband was trying to be philosophical. “I’ve said to Delphine: ‘Dream, but don’t plan.’” • Rory Carroll, Ireland correspondent
Camborne and Redruth Before last year’s general election and with Brexit dominating, Don Gardner was planning for 2,000 Christmas lunches and teas to be delivered to around 200 families from the Transformation CPR food bank that he runs in Camborne, Cornwall. This year he’s due to deliver to 321 families, and facing a logistical nightmare. “Brexit has almost disappeared from the news. Covid has taken over,” he said. Lockdown in March meant his food donation points in churches, schools and surgeries closed overnight. At the same time, demand for food in Camborne, Pool and Redruth’s deprived neighbourhoods, which are among the 10% most deprived in the country, tripled from around 8,000-9,000 meals a month to 26,000. This came as Gardner lost 95% of his volunteers because they were over 70 and vulnerable. “I don’t panic. I looked for a way out,” said Gardner, 75. Instead of food donations, he appealed for money. Instead of bulk-buying in supermarkets – prohibited during lockdown amid panic-buying – he turned to a catering company. Food is now decanted from large catering packs – normally sold to restaurants – and frozen. Furloughed workers have stepped in as volunteers. Financial support from Feeding Britain and the Cornwall Community Association allowed him to buy industrial freezers and to provide ready-made frozen meals for children during school holidays. Local farmers have donated fresh vegetables, normally sold to local hotels and guest houses. On 23 December the Christmas hampers will be delivered to the most deprived by volunteers with vans and by Cornwall fire service. Help had come from all quarters, Gardner said. “The Cornish people have really pulled together on this. I could cry sometimes when people ring me up.” And he has had to transform the way the food bank operates against a backdrop of intense personal grief. In the summer he lost his wife to a sudden, non-Covid illness. Restrictions prevented him from seeing her in hospital for a month, until he was allowed one visit to say goodbye. What he fears now is how people will cope in January. He expects Christmas spending combined with job losses will mean demand for the food bank “go through the roof”. Brexit was one of the deciding issues that helped the Conservative MP George Eustice, now the environment secretary, increase his majority in marginal Camborne and Redruth in 2019. Gardner voted to leave, and Brexit was a factor in him lending his vote to the Conservatives, when he perhaps normally would have voted Labour. For now, he has no regrets. “We just need to get it done and pick up our country and get on, that’s what I feel,” he said. He doubts, too, if a Labour government would have handled the pandemic better, “because it would still be the same scientists, and that’s where you’ve got to get the information from.” But he wonders if the fallout from Covid will lead to the Conservatives struggling to hold the seat. The huge debt the country faces worries him, “the cost, and how the government of the day deals with it, and how that will affect the people I see in the food bank”. “Covid is hopefully a one-off,” he said. “But the prosperity of the country will be tested and tried big time because of the huge debt. I don’t expect it to be paid off in my lifetime, but it’s my grandchildren’s lifetimes.” • Caroline Davies
Glasgow North East The Covid crisis led to dramatic changes in Helen Carroll’s community work. The drop-in centre she ran at Springburn shopping centre was shuttered in the lockdown, and suddenly the emphasis shifted. Within weeks, Carroll and her ally Brian Casey, the area’s Church of Scotland minister, were organising emergency food parcels from Casey’s church. They estimate they fed 4,000 families through the summer, as its meeting rooms were converted into makeshift food and clothing banks. They drew on Scottish government funds, charitable donations and support from Casey’s colleague in the local Catholic church. The local Orange Order chipped in too. They sourced fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and menu cards to supplement the tinned soup and pasta.
“It has been the busiest year of my life,” Carroll said. When the lockdown began, many locals were in denial, she said. “But then when services started disappearing, there was that panic of trying to get food. [It] began with people just turning up at the church door in tears, they were so stressed. It was really, really bad.” The centre of Glasgow North East constituency, Springburn was once the area’s industrial engine room. The closure of its once famous locomotive and railway works led to sharp economic and social decline. Its last railway works, nicknamed the Caley, closed in July last year. The latest official data records 27% of residents reporting limiting long-term physical or mental health problems; 34% of residents are economically inactive, against a Scottish average of 23%; 27% report having no educational qualifications, well above the Scottish average of 10%. In last December’s general election, Glasgow North East voters ejected the then Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, in favour of the Scottish National party’s Anne McLaughlin, on a low turnout of 56%, as the SNP again won nearly all Scottish Labour’s Westminster seats. Like Carroll, Casey feels exhausted. Covid has killed several dozen of his parishioners, and the crisis has greatly worsened the health of others. Casey estimates he buried 200 people in the six months from March to September; normally it would be 180 a year. There have been suicides, drugs overdoses, the morbidly ill dying sooner and a spate of care home deaths. “It has been a year where we’ve had to work very, very long hours, seven days a week,” he said. “Because if we didn’t, people would starve.” There have been positive developments. They are now hoping to convert a vacant two-storey bank into a new drop-in centre, with consultation spaces for council agencies such as Skills Development Scotland and for Glasgow Kelvin college to put on vocational courses, Carroll said. And the old drop-in centre, a repurposed shop provided rent-free by Springburn shopping centre, still houses weekly substance abuse and mental health groups. “We’ve had a lot of success stories and managed to do a lot of good stuff,” Casey said. “It has definitely brought lots of fragmented groups together. But we’re dealing with our bereavements and it has hammered us emotionally. We’re frayed at the edges, just about managing.” • Severin Carrell, Scotland editor
Wrexham Peter Hopwood thought long and hard before he cast his vote for the Tories in Wrexham at last year’s general election. “It was a very big deal for me,” he says now. “I’d always been Labour through and through.” Hopwood, 88, spent 45 years working as a miner in the north Wales coalfield and 18 as a carer before finally retiring at 80. But he was fed up with Labour infighting and attracted by Boris Johnson’s pledge to “get Brexit done”. A year on, he says he thinks the UK government has done a “reasonable job” in the face of the desperate challenge of Covid. “Nobody had been in this situation before. Mistakes were made – for example, they shouldn’t have let people go from hospitals into care homes, spreading Covid. But it’s easy to say these things with hindsight. I wouldn’t have liked to be in the prime minister’s position.” What does Labour have to do to win his vote back? “Stop fighting with each other for a start. Keir Starmer’s a better prospect than Jeremy Corbyn but the party is still squabbling.” Labour had held Wrexham since 1935 and in the mid-1970s had a majority of more than 16,000. But in 2019, lifelong Labour supporters changed allegiances and the Tories took the seat. Dawn, 55, who divides her time between caring for her family and volunteering with organisations that help the homeless, switched from Labour and plumped for the Brexit party. “It was a protest vote,” she says now. “EU migration here had got out of control and was making life very difficult for local people.” But she believes the Tories have “made a muck” of the Covid crisis. “I think I was right to vote for the Brexit party at the time but I’ll be going back to Labour next time.”
When the Guardian spoke to Eirian Hughes, 51, in 2019 she was not sure who to vote for, having previously backed Labour, the Tories and Ukip. In the end she didn’t bother to vote. “I just couldn’t decide. None of them seemed right.” She has had a tough 12 months. For a while she was furloughed from her job as a cleaning supervisor in a shopping centre, and her hours are down from 40 to 25. Hughes was one of the 59% of the electorate in Wrexham who backed leave in the EU referendum. “We’re still waiting for all that to be sorted,” she says. “I’m fed up with it. I’m not sure I’ll ever vote again.” It hasn’t all been doom and gloom in this corner of north Wales. The town’s football team, Wrexham AFC, have attracted headlines around the world after the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the club.
Bill Long, a 31-year-old teacher, summed up the mood last year as “very fed up, tired and scared”. He is no fan of Wrexham’s new Tory MP, Sarah Atherton. But despite the Covid crisis, he has been impressed to see new shops and bars opening. “I also feel the town’s people have treated the virus seriously in the main.” A complicating factor in Wrexham’s political picture is that policy areas such as health and education are the responsibility of the Welsh Labour-led government. Dave Gray, a Labour-supporting entrepreneur who runs a business centre, arts projects and festivals, is impressed by how the Welsh government responded. “I’ve never really been fully behind the idea of an independent Wales but I really think the Welsh government has come into its own,” he says. “If there was an independence vote soon, there would be more for it than there were before Covid.” • Steven Morris"
2020-12-10T14:00:01Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's year of U-turns: from Covid tests to free school meals,"He walked triumphantly back into No 10 wielding an increased majority a year ago to chants of “Get Brexit done”. But the tune soon changed and Boris Johnson has gone from “Mr Brexit to Mr U-turn”, in the words of one German newspaper, as he has lurched from disaster to disaster. Here we trace the winding road of his government’s many U-turns. Mass community testing 12 March 2020 One of the earliest and perhaps most damaging of the volte-faces of Johnson’s government was the decision to end the mass testing programme despite advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) that it was vital. Instead, Johnson announced that health workers would focus solely on testing those already in need of hospital care. The decision appeared all the more bizarre because the previous day NHS England had announced a “significant expansion of coronavirus testing” and insisted that the demand for tests had never exceeded its existing capacity. Announcing the decision, Johnson said: “I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” The visa surcharge 21 May 2020 Johnson backed away from a policy that would have required people coming to the UK to work for the NHS to pay a health surcharge of hundreds of pounds, after criticism from his own party that it was “mean-spirited and immoral”. The prime minister waved away Labour pleas to exempt NHS staff – many of whom are on the minimum wage – from the charge, claiming it would contribute about £900m per year. The IFS later estimated that he had inflated the figure by an order of magnitude. The next day, shortly before he was due to take part in the weekly clap for carers that critics said betrayed his hypocrisy, Johnson backed down. Proxy voting 3 June 2020 The government resisted calls to allow proxy voting, insisting that shielding MPs be paired with an opponent who agrees not to vote to even things out. But only a day later, Boris Johnson relented under heavy criticism. Marcus Rashford’s free school meals campaign 16 June 2020 Downing Street was determined not to budge from its position of refusing to help feed hungry children outside of school term time in the face of a popular campaign led by the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford – and signalled the strength of feeling by sending ministers out to do a round of media interviews. The next day, Johnson claimed to have only just learned what his own office had been doing and reversed the policy. He thanked Rashford for helping bring it to his attention, and the footballer later became an MBE. The NHS app 18 June 2020 In April the health secretary Matt Hancock, trumpeted plans for an NHS mobile app that he said would be “crucial” to stopping the virus spreading. Trials were undertaken and ministers continued to insist on pursuing the project, on which millions of pounds are believed to have been spent. Months later they finally acknowledged that warnings that the system would not work had been right all along and that the UK would now have to wait for an app being developed by major technology firms. It took until September for the UK to be equipped with a tool that Hancock had said was crucial in April. Face coverings in shops 14 July 2020 The government insisted in June that it was not necessary to make face coverings mandatory in shops because people would not be in close proximity for long. In July, ministers decided it was necessary to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Huawei ban 14 July 2020 Two in one day. Boris Johnson had refused to heed Washington’s warnings that Huawei posed a threat, signalling in January that he was minded to allow the Chinese firm to work on the UK’s 5G infrastructure. But he backtracked and it was announced that Huawei kit would be stripped out of the 5G phone networks by 2027. Exam results in England 15 August 2020 “Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results that we’ve got today are robust. They’re good, they’re dependable for employers,” Boris Johnson told the nation. His education secretary, Gavin Williamson, who had ignored warnings about the suitability of the algorithm used to produce them, added that there would be “no U-turn, no change”. Two days later the government U-turned, announcing there would indeed be a change. Face masks in schools 25 August 2020 Days before secondary schools in England were due to reopen, Johnson scrapped his government’s plan to advise against wearing face masks. That came only hours after one of his cabinet ministers had publicly insisted there were no plans to scrap the policy. Scores of headteachers had already stopped listening to Johnson’s advice and were planning to allow or encourage their pupils to wear face coverings in the communal areas of schools. The eviction ban 10 September 2020 Fears that an “avalanche” of homelessness could push up Covid infection rates forced a partial rethink of government plans to end a ban on evictions that was introduced during the first national lockdown. England’s second lockdown 31 October 2020 Scientific advisers recommended a two-week national “circuit breaker” lockdown for England in September. But Boris Johnson was resolute in his defiance, spending a month telling the country that to follow the advice would mean economic disaster. In October he announced a month-long national lockdown, saying “no responsible prime minister” could ignore how bad the situation had become. Furlough scheme extension 5 November 2020 The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, seen as a conservative voice on spending, had been looking to wind the furlough scheme down. But he was forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns as the scale of the second coronavirus wave became apparent. Perhaps the most notable was the announcement that the scheme would be extended until March 2021. Marcus Rashford’s free school meals campaign – again 8 November 2020 The prime minister was bitten, yes. But he was not shy. Once again he stood defiantly against Rashford’s campaign to get the government to keep helping to feed children from poorer backgrounds during school holidays. Once again, he was forced into a U-turn. After spending weeks insisting he would not put up the money this time, ministers announced a £170m winter grant scheme for families struggling as a result of Covid-19."
2020-12-10T13:44:08Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces legal challenge for clearing Priti Patel of bullying,"A legal challenge has been launched against Boris Johnson’s decision to clear Priti Patel of bullying despite advice that she had breached the ministerial code. Lawyers for the FDA union sent a pre-action notice to Downing Street on Wednesday accusing the prime minister of acting unlawfully when he chose to stand by his home secretary and overrule his independent adviser. The letter, first reported in the Times, accuses Johnson of “setting a damaging precedent which gives carte blanche to the kind of unacceptable conduct which the home secretary was found to have committed”. The union hopes the letter is the first step towards a judicial review of Johnson’s decision. The government has so far refused to make public the full Cabinet Office investigation led by Sir Alex Allan, which concluded that Patel’s actions amounted to bullying. The government is expected to fight any legal challenge against Johnson’s decision. The move comes after Jonathan Evans, the chair of the committee for standards in public life, launched a review of probity rules, which will include the ministerial code. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, told the Guardian: “The prime minister’s decision has laid bare the inadequacies of the ministerial code as a mechanism for dealing with the conduct of ministers when it comes to their civil servants. The code provides no commitments or rights to the civil servants who were bullied by the home secretary nor any mechanism for challenge. “Unless this perverse decision by the prime minister, ignoring the evidence provided to him, can be challenged in the courts, it essentially deprives civil servants of the very protection against ministerial misconduct which the code is meant to ensure.” Allan resigned last month after Johnson reportedly tried to persuade him to tone down the report. Overruling his adviser on ministerial standards, Johnson acknowledged that while Allan had concluded Patel’s behaviour could “on occasion” be described “as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals”, he had “full confidence” in the cabinet minister. The legal letter sent on Wednesday states: “Civil servants in the Home Office and beyond will rightly object to their conduct being measured against a standard of conduct and unacceptable bullying which, it seems, does not apply to the home secretary or other ministers.” Sir Philip Rutnam, who quit as the department’s permanent secretary after accusing Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him, is taking the home secretary to an employment tribunal in September. He claims he was forced out following anonymous briefings after blowing the whistle on her behaviour. Patel denies all allegations against her. The government has been approached for a comment."
2020-12-10T13:30:51Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May accused of breaking rules in blocking drugs expert,"Theresa May has been accused of breaking the code for public appointments as prime minister after it emerged that she blocked the appointment of a drugs expert to the Home Office’s drug advisory panel because he had been critical of the scale of NHS cuts. The individual, who does not wish to be named, was barred from the Advisory Council of Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) after he co-signed a letter claiming that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was “gaslighting” public health workers. He becomes the third respected expert to have been blocked from the panel after having their online activity vetted by government officials since 2017. There has been growing concern over political interference in the appointment of experts to supposedly independent committees. In October 2018 the then home secretary, Amber Rudd, had been content to appoint the expert, but May overruled her. May was previously accused of attempting to delete sentences from a Whitehall report that concluded there was no link between harsh drug laws and levels of illegal substance use. The expert’s case came to light when the commissioner for public appointments, Peter Riddell, on Monday published a ruling on the matter, after the expert had complained that his comments online had been misrepresented by officials who compiled a dossier of his posts. Concerns were raised about comments on a teachers’ strike over funding at the school of the expert’s son, a critical letter about drug treatment cuts sent to a periodical in response to a book review, and the signing – alongside hundreds of other clinicians – of an open letter to Hunt about cuts to mental health services that alleged he was “gaslighting” clinicians over NHS funding levels. The decision by No 10 led to the post being vacant for months. Previously, a chief pharmacist at an addiction service and the director of drug law centre were blocked from the ACMD by the Home Office after the former criticised NHS cuts and the latter called for drug policy reform. This prompted a criminal justice expert to quit, claiming political interference in the appointment process was seriously undermining the panel’s independence. Prof Alex Stevens, expert who quit, said: “This case shows clearly that ministers have broken the Nolan principles of public life and the governance code for public appointments. Both require ministers to act solely in the public interest when making public appointments. “By barring this and other candidates from appointment to the ACMD on the basis of their prior criticisms of government policy, they have damaged the independence of the ACMD and breached their duties to act objectively and impartially.” Graham Parsons, the pharmacist also blocked from the ACMD, tweeted: “Lesson is don’t criticise the government in any form or you won’t get on an independent body even if you are an expert in the field and have evidence-based practice as the foundation for your practice.” Stevens highlighted concerns that there was no official barrier to ministers filling “purportedly independent advisory committees with people whose views they find ‘suitable’,” after the Office of the Public Commissioner said it had “no remit to rule on” blocked appointments or “the relevance and proportionality” of vetting. Riddell ruled that the expert was treated fairly at interview but should have been given an opportunity to respond to the concerns raised following vetting, along with being offered feedback. In response to criticism on social media, the commissioner tweeted: “You raise important points about the independence of ACMD but the government’s code allows ministers to decide public appointments without giving reasons. As PAC [public appointments commissioner], I regulate the fairness of the process but this doesn’t involve questioning ministerial motives.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Ministers make appointments to the ACMD in line with the governance code for public appointments. The commissioner for public appointments has found that the Home Office followed the process correctly in recruiting members to the ACMD.”"
2020-12-10T13:30:07Z,politics,Politics,Brexit deal or no deal: your quick guide to the negotiations,"What happened on Wednesday night? Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, met in person over a three-hour scallop and turbot dinner to try to unlock the Brexit trade negotiations deadlock. As expected, both sides agreed to continue talking – but they agreed that the gaps between their positions remain wide. Can we read anything into the language of their statements? Unlike the previous two meetings, there was no joint statement following the leaders’ summit. Some have concluded this is a reflection of the depth of division at the dinner table. A statement from a Downing Street source was the more pessimistic of the two, stating “very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged”. Von der Leyen stated more positively that “we gained a clear understanding of each other’s positions” but added “they remain far apart”. How does this compare with previous Brexit summits? The statements are conspicuously different from after last year’s breakthrough meeting in the Wirral between Johnson and Leo Varadkar. The then taoiseach revealed they had found a “pathway to a possible Brexit deal”, and days later a deal was sealed. By comparison, the optics of Wednesday night’s outcome were not good. Does this mean all hope of a deal is dashed? No. Both sides have said talks will continue until Sunday and Downing Street said the prime minister was resolved to try to get a deal, saying: “The PM does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested.” Is Sunday a firm deadline? The Brexit trade talks have been punctuated by at least four formal deadlines laid down by either the EU or the UK. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, recently said “never say never” – and indicated that talks could go right up to 31 December, the legal end of the transition period. Raab told Sky News on Thursday that Sunday will be a “point of finality”, but this could be a hardening of language to ratchet up pressure on the EU to compromise. Some believe the language in the dual statements could be part of a choreographed set-up for a victory to be declared by Johnson. While the mood in Brussels has been downbeat, according to the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, sources in the EU have been saying in the past few weeks that Brussels would be comfortable with assisting Johnson to deliver what can be painted as a victory to the British public – or more notably his hard Brexit backbenchers – if that is what it takes to seal a deal. What happens if there is a deal? Any deal must be approved by EU member states, the European parliament and the British parliament. Trade deals should be allowed 21 days’ scrutiny in parliament, under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. But there is not enough time for that unless MPs were to sit every day including Christmas Day until New Year’s Eve. Instead, the prime minister is expected to fast-track legislation for the deal and, provided he gets the support of Labour in the form of a vote of support or abstention, the law will sail through. On the EU side, the European parliament has agreed to sit in a special session on 28 December, but many of the 730 MPs may protest that they do not have time to examine a 700-page document to make an informed decision about their voting preference. In this scenario, the European council of member state leaders can approve that the deal can be provisionally implemented on 1 January, arguing exceptional circumstances. What about no-deal planning? The government has dusted down no-deal contingency plans that had two outings last year – one in preparation for a crash-out on 29 March 2019, and another in October when it appeared that Johnson, as the new Conservative party leader, was prepared to walk out with no deal. The plans involved putting the army on standby to deal with any problems getting food and medical supplies through ports, and also potential civil unrest. Planes should be allowed to keep flying and lorries to keep moving in the event of no deal after the European commission set out its contingency plans on Thursday, which would allow aviation and road transport to continue as now for six months from 1 January – as long as the UK government agrees to maintain a “level playing field” in standards."
2020-12-10T12:39:34Z,politics,Politics,Councils vow to defy UK rule on deporting migrant rough sleepers,"A growing number of councils, charities and other organisations have pledged to boycott new Home Office rules to criminalise and deport migrant rough sleepers. The Home Office changed the UK immigration rules on 1 December, although it has not yet published guidance about how to apply them. Local authorities, MPs, anti-trafficking organisations and homeless organisations including Crisis and St Mungo’s are warning that the rules, which could withhold leave to remain from migrants found to be rough sleeping or revoke it from those who have it, will punish and criminalise some of the most vulnerable. The majority of the UK’s migrant rough sleepers are in London, with about half of those rough sleeping in the capital thought to be migrants. The Greater London Authority is refusing to cooperate with the Home Office and has stated: “The GLA and its commissioned services will not collaborate with such draconian measures.”
Haringey council has said it will not collaborate with the Home Office on the new policy, and Islington council has said the same, warning that this kind of cooperation with the Home Office will compromise relationships of trust with vulnerable rough sleepers. Southwark council has also voiced concerns. Public Interest Law Centre is bringing a legal challenge against the rules. It warns that the policy will create a “chilling effect” on migrant rough sleepers’ willingness to approach services for support and so could increase rough sleeping. It says the new rules are so general that migrants who are office workers found sleeping at their desk late at night or travellers sleeping at an airport before catching an early morning flight could find themselves caught up inthem. The centre previously brought a successful legal challenge against a government policy to deport EU rough sleepers in December 2017. The Labour MP Apsana Begum described the policy change as “despicable” and called for it to be scrapped. She said: “It effectively criminalises rough sleepers who were not born in the UK and adds to the draconian rules already facing those who are seeking asylum or permission to remain.” Benjamin Morgan, who runs a rights project for homeless migrants at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: “We’re heartened that opposition is mounting to these changes to the immigration rules, which effectively criminalise rough sleeping among non-UK nationals. We believe these changes are unlawful.” The chief executive of St Mungo’s, Steve Douglas, said: “It is disappointing that this proposed change in approach has not been discussed with the homelessness sector, where there is real concern that it will increase distrust of the Home Office’s intentions and could drive people with a legitimate right to remain away from essential services.” One 38-year-old migrant rough sleeper from east Africa, who has been street homeless for three years, said he feared being rounded up and detained as a result of the new rules. “I’m not allowed to travel, to work or to claim benefits. What are we expected to do? The government is making decisions for us. My life is no longer my own.” A government spokesperson said: “For the small minority of migrant rough sleepers who continue to refuse government and local authority support and repeatedly engage in persistent antisocial behaviour, the new immigration reforms mean they could lose their right to be in the UK. “This would be a last-resort measure, and initially individuals would be asked to leave voluntarily with government support. In the event that they refuse, we may take the step to remove them.”"
2020-12-10T12:25:40Z,politics,Politics,Worst UK economic slump for 300 years not a good platform for Brexit talks,"Brexit deal or no Brexit deal, the UK faces a rocky few months as businesses, left dangling until the last minute, find out what kind of relationship the UK is going to have with the EU from 1 January. All eyes are on the last-minute talks between Boris Johnson’s team at No 10 and their counterparts in Brussels. Not much else matters ahead of the climax on Sunday. Looking back to October, as the Office for National Statistics does in its assessment of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), feels like shining a light on a period of relative calm, albeit one where the warning signs were flashing red again. The month-on-month figure showed that GDP increased by just 0.4% to give a quarterly rise of 10.2%. While the manufacturing and construction sectors barrelled along, increasing output by 1.7% and 1% respectively, the services sector slumped back to register a tiny 0.2% increase. It shows that Britons were expecting a second lockdown in November and had already begun to limit their journeys, visits to attractions and spending in the shops. “Rishi’s dinners”, the chancellor’s notorious “eat out to help out” subsidy that spurred the restaurant trade in August, and possibly the virus as well, had run its course and most families were beginning to hunker down again. Government restrictions also played a major role following the introduction of regional rules in three tiers that placed much of the north under the most severe clampdown. The lockdown month of November is expected to register a fall in GDP, while December’s output – labouring under the twin restrictions of Covid rules, cargo jams at UK ports and heightened Brexit uncertainty – is likely to end the year on a sour note. Most City analysts have forecast a drop in GDP over the last quarter of the year to leave the economy about 8% short of where it was at the end of last year. Not only is this the worst economic slump in 300 years, it is the worst possible platform for the prime minister to plunge the UK into a destabilising last-ditch battle with the EU. It’s almost like watching the “chickie run” scene in the film Rebel Without a Cause that pits the James Dean character, Jim Stark, against his rival Buzz Gunderson in a car race to a seaside cliff-edge. Buzz dies after his jacket sleeve becomes entangled in his car door and his attempt to bail out fails. Let’s hope the UK’s representatives in the Brexit talks have planned their negotiating strategies with greater diligence.
A bungled no-deal Brexit would put the UK on course for a second quarter of negative growth and a second recession in little over a year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said earlier this month that the UK will lag behind every other major economy apart from Argentina. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said last month Britain was on course for one of the worst periods of income growth since records began in 1955. Even a deal is likely to leave many questions unanswered, keeping Britain’s place near the bottom of the international league for some time yet."

2020-12-10T04:42:11Z,politics,Politics,'Deadlock at dinner': what the papers say about the Brexit talks,"The high-stakes Brexit dinner in Brussels on Wednesday night between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen is given top billing by almost all the papers, with the severity of the crisis lost on none of them. “Deadlock at dinner” is the Mail’s headline, with the paper describing a “dramatic night over fish supper”. It characterised as “gloomy” a No 10 source’s statement that “significant obstacles” and “very large gaps” remained before the Sunday deadline set for a deal.
The Telegraph’s splash says: “Four days to save trade deal after Brussels talks go badly”. It reports Johnson did not want to leave “any route to a possible deal untested” but he was downbeat about the chances of an agreement after his three-hour dinner with von der Leyen. It says there are warnings that even if talks restart, a deal is by no means guaranteed.
The Guardian’s final edition front page says “PM and EU agree Sunday deadline to avoid no deal”, with EU leaders warning that an deal is on the edge of failure. It says Johnson told the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that Britain could not accept terms that would tie the UK to EU rules. As Johnson met von der Leyen, the EU commission president warned him to “keep distance”, adding that after he removed his mask he needed to “put it back on immediately”. The PM responded: “You run a tight ship here, Ursula, and quite right too.”
The Express’s first edition took an unsurprisingly tough line, with “Boris: take it or leave it”, saying the prime minister was “standing firm” against EU attempts to “punish” the UK for leaving the bloc. Its second edition went further with the headline: “Boris walks away from the EU”. It says Brexit negotiations have “just 72 hours to save trade talks”.
The Times also supports Johnson, saying the PM “refuses to back down in face of Brexit deadlock”. It says the PM said EU leaders must “drop proposals to punish Britain” if it failed to follow future European regulations, while also insisting a good deal was within reach. The paper also said Keir Starmer had hinted Labour would back a deal, promising to vote “in the national interest”.
The i goes for a food pun over the leaders’ high-stakes dinner, with the headline: “Fudge for last supper at EU talks”. It says Johnson has highlighted fisheries and regulatory standards as the main sticking points, but also asks “Cheddar or Brie?”, quoting a supermarket boss saying Brexit could change the way Britain eats.
The Mirror splashes on “Tesco’s food stockpile for no-deal”, saying the supermarket giant is building up food supplies for the new year, amid fears talks in Brussels will fail. It quotes Tesco’s chairman, John Allan, warning of empty shelves and soaring prices if the UK defaults to World Trade Organization terms after 31 December: “We’re stockpiling as much as we can,” Allan says.
The Sun devotes just a small front page slot in its first edition on the Brexit talks, with the headline “PM meal or no deal bid”, saying Johnson tried to break the deadlock in Brussels. It’s second edition however has the headline, “BoJo vow after 3hr fish supper: Let’s mullet over”, with the paper noting the talks will be back on Sunday.
The FT devotes its Brexit coverage to “Britons barred from entering EU on January 1 as virus shutters come down”. It says the end of the Brexit transition period means the UK will be subject to a system that allows “non-essential travel from only a handful of non-EU countries with low Covid-19 infection rates”, according to the European commission."
2020-12-09T23:58:24Z,politics,Politics,Holidaymakers from Great Britain barred from EU after 1 January under Covid rules,"British holidaymakers will be barred from the European Union from 1 January under current Covid-19 safety restrictions, with the EU commission indicating there will be no exemption for the UK. Only a handful of countries with low coronavirus rates are exempt from rules that prohibit non-essential visitors from outside the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) – with the UK included only until the end of the Brexit transition period. There will, however, be an exemption for Northern Ireland residents travelling to the Republic of Ireland. EU member states agreed in October to adopt a European council proposal to allow non-essential travel from a small group of countries with lower levels of Covid cases including Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. An EU commission spokesman last week said there were no plans to extend that to the UK. “This is a decision for the council to make,” he said. Within the EEA, or Schengen-associated states, Norway has also confirmed it will bar UK visitors from 1 January, according to the Financial Times. The imminent bracketing of British tourists with those of other non-EU countries such as Albania and Turkey underlines the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit. EU member states can override the European council recommendations in theory, should they wish to . Leisure airlines including easyJet had reported a surge in bookings for 2021 in recent weeks after news of a vaccine, but many of those trips will be in doubt. A UK government spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on decisions that could be taken by other states on public health matters. “We take a scientific, risk-based approach to health measures at the border, and it is of course in the interests of all countries to allow safe international travel as we emerge from the pandemic.” Under European rules, individuals can still enter the bloc in certain cases, mainly for work – including aid workers, care workers, diplomats, healthcare professionals, military personnel, seasonal farm workers and transport workers. Entry for study, transit, and urgent family reasons is also permitted. European nationals living in the UK can still travel to the bloc. The Foreign Office currently advises against all non-essential travel to most of Europe, bar some holiday destinations such as certain Greek islands, and quarantine on return is required for those who choose to travel. With most insurance policies invalidated by the FCO advice – and with the end of the Ehic (European Health Insurance Card) reciprocal health cover scheme on 31 December – UK travel industry sources said that outbound bookings were currently very low for winter sports holidays in 2021. • The headline and text of this article was amended on 10 December 2020 to clarify that Northern Ireland residents will still be able to travel to the Republic of Ireland from 1 January under the current rules."
2020-12-09T22:30:50Z,politics,Politics,Masks slip as Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson meet,"Boris Johnson experienced an awkward exchange with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, just before their make-or-break Brexit dinner in Brussels on Wednesday, when she urged him to maintain social distancing After the prime minister arrived at the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters just after 8pm local time, the two leaders went to pose for the cameras. Johnson asked Von der Leyen if they were taking their masks off. She agreed that they could do so, but told him to “keep distance” as they briefly removed their face coverings, prompting him to quickly step back. She added: “Then we have to put it back on. You have to put it back on immediately.” The PM responded as he donned his mask again: “You run a tight ship here, Ursula, and quite right too.” The pair then headed off for a three-course dinner as talks on a post-Brexit trade deal remained “on a precipice”. Flanked by his chief negotiator, David Frost, and senior aides, Johnson spelled out the UK’s position, telling Von der Leyen and the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he could not accept the terms in a treaty that would tie Britain to EU rules. EU sources told the Guardian the bloc planned to publish its no-deal contingency plans “very soon indeed” in order to keep planes flying and to protect borders in the event of the talks collapsing irretrievably. The outcome of the dinner was being anxiously awaited across the continent, amid growing fears of economic and security chaos when the transition period ends in just three weeks’ time. When the 27 EU heads of state and government meet on Thursday to begin a two-day summit, Von der Leyen is likely to update them on the talks."
2020-12-09T22:28:20Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson and EU set Sunday deadline to decide on Brexit deal,"A Brexit deal must be sealed by Sunday or there will be no deal, Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen agreed after a “lively and frank” three-hour summit that set the stage for a dramatic final act of the negotiations. Despite nine months of troubled talks, “very large gaps” were said to remain between the UK and EU. The leaders said they should come to a deal or no deal outcome by the end of the weekend, with pressure on both sides to find time for parliamentary ratification. Downing Street said the meeting in Brussels had been “frank” – a diplomatic expression for a heated conversation. The commission president, Von der Leyen, tweeted: “We had a lively and interesting discussion on the state of play on outstanding issues. “We understand each other’s positions. They remain far apart. The teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these issues. We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend.” An EU source close to the negotiation said that while the difficulties were real, both sides still believed a deal was possible. Flanked by his chief negotiator and senior aides, Johnson had told the European commission president and the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he could not accept terms in a treaty that would tie Britain to EU rules. As he spelled out his position over a three-course meal of scallops, turbot and pavlova in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters, EU sources said the bloc planned to publish its no-deal contingency plans “very soon indeed” in order to keep planes flying and protect borders in the event of talks collapsing irretrievably. A senior No 10 source said: “The prime minister and Von der Leyen had a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations. “Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged. The prime minister and Von der Leyen agreed to further discussions over the next few days between their negotiating teams. “The prime minister does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested. The prime minister and Von der Leyen agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks.” Earlier in the day EU leaders had told their parliaments the negotiations were on the edge of failure. “At the moment we are on the precipice of a no-deal [Brexit],” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told the Irish parliament. Johnson arrived at the commission’s headquarters just after 8pm local time, where he posed for pictures with Von der Leyen before retreating to a meeting room with their chief negotiators for a half-hour discussion. The two teams, joined by further officials, then sat down to a fish dinner. As Von der Leyen and Johnson met, the commission president warned him over the need to remain Covid-secure, telling him: “Keep [your] distance.” She added that the prime minister should remove his mask. “Then we have to put it back on,” she said. “You have to put it back on immediately.” “You run a tight ship here, Ursula, and quite right too,” Johnson responded.
The dinner ended after just over three hours. The 27 EU heads of state and government will meet on Thursday, when Von der Leyen is likely to update them on the talks. Sources said the leaders would not engage in a debate and did not intend to make any decisions on Brexit during the two-day summit. EU capitals now face a nervous wait for answers from Brussels. In the Bundestag, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had said earlier in the day that her government was willing to let the negotiation collapse if Downing Street continued to reject the EU’s approach. “If there are conditions coming from the British side which we cannot accept, then we will go on our own way without an exit agreement,” she said. “Because one thing is certain: the integrity of the single market has to be maintained.” The main hurdle is seen by both sides as the EU’s demand for an “evolution” or “ratchet” clause to ensure that as one side upgrades its standards, the other is not able to enjoy a competitive advantage. Before flying to Brussels from RAF Northolt, Johnson told the Commons that the EU had tabled terms no British prime minister could accept. “Our friends in the EU are currently insisting that if they pass a new law in future with which we in this country do not comply or don’t follow suit, then they want the automatic right to punish us and to retaliate,” he said.
“And secondly, they’re saying the UK should be the only country in the world not to have sovereign control over its fishing waters. I don’t believe that those are terms that any prime minister of this country should accept.” The description of the EU’s negotiating demands was rejected in Brussels, raising hopes that Johnson was establishing a “straw man” argument to blow away later in favour of a compromise that he can sell to his Brexiter backbenchers. “I don’t recognise that, it doesn’t ring a bell,” said one senior EU diplomat. “I don’t know what he is referring to, let’s put it that way.” Merkel told German parliamentarians that the EU, with the “evolution” clause, was merely seeking to manage the inevitable divergence in environmental, social and labour standards, which are currently shared. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has agreed to non-regression from a common baseline of standards at the end of the transition period. But EU negotiators want a forum for discussion when the current minimum standards become outdated owing to developments on one side. There would then be arbitration and the potential for one side to hit back with tariffs or other corrective measures if the other drags its feet on agreeing a new “level playing field” of minimum standards. Downing Street fears this will mean an alignment of standards via the back door. The House of Commons could sit as late as Christmas Eve should it be required to pass a Brexit bill, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said on Wednesday. Under current plans, the Commons will stop sitting on December 21, but he told Sky News that recess could be delayed."
2020-12-09T21:57:19Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson sets out his red lines at last-ditch Brexit dinner,"Boris Johnson set out red lines for the final days of the Brexit negotiations at a dinner in Brussels with Ursula von der Leyen – but made his case that a deal was still possible even as Europe prepared for the worst. Flanked by his chief negotiator and senior aides, the prime minister told the European commission president and the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he could not accept terms in a treaty that would tie Britain to EU rules.

Talks looked set to continue up to the weekend at least but EU governments put themselves on notice for a last-minute breakdown. Johnson, however, made it clear that he believed a compromise could be made. It came after EU leaders told their parliaments the negotiations were on the edge of failure. “At the moment we are on the precipice of a no-deal [Brexit],” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told the Irish parliament earlier in the day.

She said: “We currently more or less have the same legal system, a harmonised legal system, but over the years the legal systems will diverge regarding environment law, labour law, health legislation, everywhere. “For this we need to find agreements about how each side can react when the other changes their legal situation. Otherwise there will be unfair competition conditions, which we can’t do to our companies. This is the big, difficult issue which is still on the table, next to questions about fishing quotas and similar things.” The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has agreed to non-regression from a common baseline of standards at the end of the transition period. But EU negotiators want a forum for discussion when the current minimum standards become outdated owing to developments on one side.

2020-12-09T20:35:19Z,politics,Politics,Brexit's fishy business called for turbot-charged talks,"Fish was on the menu for Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen – and not just as one of the key issues of the Brexit talks. As part of their starter at the Wednesday dinner at the Berlaymont in Brussels, the two leaders dined on one of the most contentious subjects of the negotiations: scallops. British and French fishermen have clashed over access rights to scallop beds in the Baie de Seine, off the coast of Normandy in northern France. No deal on fishing could lead to skirmishes on the seas similar to the 2018 “scallop wars”. Fishing was one of three items on the agenda that the chief negotiators prepared, on which teams have yet to find a breakthrough. Negotiations are thought to be close on the level of access for EU boats to seas within the UK’s 200-mile exclusive economic zone, with a transition period for phasing in changes. But David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, tabled new demands on Sunday about the ownership of vessels in British seas. After the starter of pumpkin soup and scallops, another seafood dish was served for main course, perhaps to keep the easily diverted Johnson on message. This time it was turbot, also found in British waters, served steamed with mashed potatoes with wasabi and vegetables. Turbot is one of the demersal fish that the UK is happy to include in a deal – unlike mackerel, a pelagic fish, which the UK has suggested should be removed from talks. Dessert was the less controversial pavlova with fruit and coconut sorbet – though a dish that sounds suspiciously like an exotic take on an Eton mess. The two leaders had an extremely limited choice of places to dine in Brussels. Belgium is in lockdown until 13 December, with cafes and restaurants closed. Apart from the catering at the European commission’s headquarters, the only other option would have been hotel room service. Still, such an alternative might have been more imaginative than Wednesday’s dinner. The starter sounded strikingly similar to what was offered to Johnson during his last visit to Brussels in October 2019: scallops with pumpkin mousse."
2020-12-09T18:59:54Z,politics,Politics,Covid: Sunak mulls tougher VAT rules for Uber drivers and Airbnb landlords,"Rishi Sunak is considering toughening up VAT rules for the Uber drivers and Airbnb landlords central to the rapidly expanding sharing economy as the Treasury considers ways of repairing the damage to the public finances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The chancellor has taken the first steps towards increasing the government’s VAT revenues with the publication of a consultation document calling for feedback from digital providers and their competitors. Sunak is concerned that the rapid growth in the sharing economy has eroded the tax base because many of the 5 million-plus people providing services through online platforms earn too little to be registered for VAT.
According to pre-crisis estimates the sector was on course to have revenues of £140bn in the UK by 2025. In a sign that the chancellor could be considering rapid action, the consultation period ends in early March, shortly before the expected date of the budget, delayed from this autumn as a result of the pandemic. Sunak is aware that many of those involved in the sharing economy, especially drivers who were already struggling to get by, have been severely impacted by the loss of business caused by the pandemic. But he is also looking to raise revenues after being told by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that the government was on course to run a record peacetime budget deficit, or gap between government spending and tax income, of £394bn – almost 20% of national output – this year. Last month a report commissioned by the chancellor recommended an overhaul of capital gains tax that could raise up to £14bn a year. The Treasury paper released on Wednesday noted that the five big sharing economy sectors in the UK: collaborative finance, short-term accommodation, passenger transportation, on-demand household services and on-demand professional services , could secure a 20-fold increase by 2025 in the total value of transactions from just £7bn in 2016. At the time, the consultancy firm PwC predicted 30% annual growth in the sharing economy. Sunak believes that as more people buy services from non-VAT registered providers through digital platforms he is being deprived of tax revenues needed to fund public services. Currently, a business only needs to register for VAT if it has annual revenues above £85,000. The Treasury said it had no precise figures for the number of sharing economy providers that were registered for VAT and this made it difficult to put a figure on the revenues “at risk”. The consultation paper said the digital economy created “huge opportunities for the UK’s economy and society through stimulating enterprise and aiding optimal use of scarce resources. However, the government is also aware that it could potentially create certain challenges to the VAT tax base.”.
After listening to both sides of the argument, the Treasury said where appropriate it would come up with a response that would “ensure fair competition and a level playing field for all businesses, whether operating in the sharing economy or as a traditional business, regardless of their size and location”. The consultation paper mentioned no specific company but said the sharing economy was normally about hiring out labour or renting out assets, or a combination of both. “An example of hiring out labour would be offering to perform household repairs and building works. An example of renting out of assets would be an individual placing their apartment for rent as a short-term letting. An example of combining labour and assets would be a driver offering passenger transport using their personal car.” In the previous full financial year, VAT contributed £130bn to the state’s coffers, with most of the goods and services eligible for the tax paying the main rate of 20%."
2020-12-09T18:56:49Z,politics,Politics,PM labelled clueless after confusing India farm protests with Pakistan conflict,"Boris Johnson has been labelled “absolutely clueless” after a parliamentary gaffe where he appeared to confuse massive farmers’ protests that have closed down swathes of India with the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan. Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi addressed Johnson during prime minister’s questions, asking for him to comment on the demonstrations in India, which have seen tens of thousands of farmers camped out around Delhi in protest at new agriculture laws that they say will destroy their livelihoods. “Many constituents, especially those emanating from Punjab and other parts of India, and I were horrified to see footage of water cannons, teargas and brute force being used against peacefully protesting farmers,” said Dhesi. Addressing Johnson, Dhesi asked: “So, will the prime minister convey to the Indian prime minister our heartfelt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock, and does he agree that everyone has a fundamental right to peaceful protest?”
However, Johnson appeared confused over the protests that Dhesi was referring to and responded: “Our view is that of course we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle.” Dhesi, who has been vocal supporter of the farmers and initiated a letter pledging support for the protests signed by 35 other MPs, looked perplexed at Johnson’s response. He later took to Twitter to criticise the prime minister. “It might help if our PM actually knew what he was talking about,” he wrote. Johnson’s response prompted both mirth and anger in India, with many frustrated that Pakistan had been mentioned when they have no role in the protests.
Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, general counsel for seccessionist group Sikhs for Justice, said: “We are extremely disappointed that the prime minister confused the current farmers’ protest with the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. People’s lives are at risk here, and the PM must pay attention to the severity of the situation in Punjab, where brute force and teargas are being used by the Indian authorities against farmers protesting peacefully.” The UK government has so far refused to be drawn into the ongoing protests in India, with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office saying the matter was an internal one. “The police handling of protests is a matter for the government of India,” said an FCDO spokesperson last week."
2020-12-09T18:25:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Johnson claims Brussels wants power to 'punish' UK if it does not implement future EU laws – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has arrived in Brussels where he is shortly due to meet Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, to discuss whether or not a UK-EU trade deal is possible. There will be a short meeting ahead of a working dinner, also attended by Lord Frost, Michel Barnier and other officials. At PMQs earlier Johnson adopted a belligerent tone, repeatedly insisting that Britain would flourish in the event of no deal and accusing the EU of wanting to â€œpunishâ€� the UK. He told MPs: Our friends in the EU are currently insisting that if they pass a new law in future with which we in this country do not comply or donâ€™t follow suit, then they want the automatic right to punish us and to retaliate. And secondly theyâ€™re saying the UK should be the only country in the world not to have sovereign control over its fishing waters. I donâ€™t believe that those are terms that any prime minister of this country should accept. Johnsonâ€™s stance was warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs, and any Tory backbenchers who are fearful of the consequences of no deal have not been expressing their reservations in public. Many observers still think that ultimately both sides will negotiate a compromise, but Johnsonâ€™s performance at PMQs will have reassured the sovereignty purists on his own side for whom this would be unacceptable. Tonightâ€™s meeting is being billed as a conversation, not a negotiation, and almost certainly it will not culminate in the announcement of a deal. There may well be an agreement to allow talks to resume at negotiator level, although if Johnson and Von der Leyen conclude that consensus is impossible, they could tell Europe to prepare for no deal.
Angela Merkel has said the major obstacle to a Brexit deal is not access to British fishing waters but future regulatory standards in the UK, adding that she expects the talks to continue for days to come. A Brexit threat to the British banger in Belfast has been lifted, Michael Gove has said, as the EU and UK declared peace over the food supply across the Irish Sea. People with a history of significant allergic reactions should not receive the Covid vaccine, the medicines regulator has said, after two NHS workers experienced symptoms. Prof Chris Whitty, Englandâ€™s chief medical officer, has warned of a â€œdisastrousâ€� resurgence in coronavirus cases if people stop adhering to social distancing guidelines now that the mass vaccination programme has begun. Labour faces a continuous decline in its traditional heartlands unless it challenges â€œan enduring perception of us as ineffective, complacent or indifferentâ€�, a stark report by a group of the partyâ€™s MPs has warned. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. As and when there is any news from Brussels, there will be details here. The Johnson/Von der Leyen dinner starts at 7.30pm, and so any read-out is no likely to come until after 9pm."
2020-12-09T18:01:42Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson sets himself up for a disastrous dinner date | John Crace,"One sometimes wonders whether Boris Johnson is aware you can watch British television in Europe. For either the prime minister was setting himself up for one of the biggest climbdowns – even by his own standards – in modern political history or his dinner on Wednesday night with the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is going to be one of the shortest on record. With awkward silences at that, as the EU appears in no mood to budge. Maybe Von der Leyen should rethink the menu and just go for chicken nuggets and chips so Boris can get an earlier flight home. Because at this rate a no-deal Brexit is looking a certainty. The tone had been set right at the start of prime minister’s questions with Johnson’s reply to the Tory backbencher and longtime Brexiter Edward Leigh on the chances of a trade deal agreement. Boris didn’t even attempt to moderate his language. Not a word about how far both sides had come in the negotiation, just straight for the jugular about how the EU was trying to punish the UK and that if we didn’t get what we wanted on fishing rights, sovereignty and level playing fields then it could get stuffed. “We will prosper mightily” if we leave without a deal, he said. Leigh looked beside himself with pleasure. A further 2% fall in GDP was what he had always wanted. The orgasm that would make the four years of tantric Sexit that had preceded it worthwhile. Brexit was also on Keir Starmer’s mind, as the Labour leader ran through some of Johnson’s previous convictions. The oven-ready deal that was anything but. His promise that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were zero. His September declaration that leaving without a deal would be a failure of statecraft. Was there anything else he had forgotten that Boris wanted to add to the charge sheet? Johnson merely grinned inanely, tugged his hair and began ad-libbing. It was good to hear Starmer talking from Islington, “his spiritual home”, where he was self-isolating. Keir corrected him: it was actually Camden. Though he could have pointed out that Islington had been Boris’s home up until a year ago when he had finally been kicked out after one affair too many. Having cleared that up, Boris rehashed the nonsense of “oven ready” only applying to the withdrawal agreement, before repeating “prosper mightily”. His phrase of the day. Along with “delphic”. Time and again he accused Starmer of delphic silences over Brexit. Again Starmer slightly missed a trick, as what we have had from Johnson is delphic white noise. Loads of words spilled out in no particular order and all equally meaningless. Perhaps the height of mindlessness was Johnson’s observation that Labour had yet to say whether it would support a deal. It seemed to have escaped Boris that the whole reason the negotiations were still continuing was that there was no deal to support. Still Starmer came as close as he ever has to saying he would back any crap deal over none. Not least because the Conservatives might need the opposition votes if the hardline Brexiters cried “betrayal” and chose to rebel against the government. Then Johnson’s days really would be numbered. Next up was Michael Gove to explain how the government would now be signing up to the Northern Ireland protocols, which it had negotiated and signed up to in the withdrawal agreement less than a year ago. This being the Govester – Westminster’s ultimate shapeshifter and a far more accomplished liar than Boris will ever be – he managed to make this sound like a major triumph of diplomacy on his part, rather than a decision not to violate international law. A negotiation in which he had both managed to hoodwink the EU into not building a mini-embassy in Northern Ireland and restricting them instead to having 15 observers dotted around the country telling UK customs officials what to do, and securing grace periods of up to six months for some goods to maintain supply lines and ensure no one starved to death. It’s a tough gig following Gove because the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster manages to mix so many untruths and half-truths, along with a few connecting sentences that may be factually correct, that it’s hard to know where to begin. With the truths that may mean nothing or the lies that conceal the reality. Labour’s Rachel Reeves chose to hedge her bets and not get stuck into a semantic battle in which there would be no winners. Rather she tried to stick to the known knowns. That a three-month period of grace wasn’t that long, and how many UK customs agents he had managed to recruit. Inevitably, the Govester avoided answering those questions, though he did confirm to Bernard Jenkin that under the new regime parts of Northern Ireland would still be covered by EU “acquis” and subject to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Yet somehow he managed to convince Jenkin – along with Richard Drax, who asked a similar question – that this was a victory for the UK and not a concession we had agreed to a year back, as they both sat down looking reasonably satisfied with the answer. Had it been anyone but Gove, they would have been spitting blood. Gove’s ability for mendacity reached its zenith in response to a question from Labour’s Ben Bradshaw. When he had said UK citizens could still be able to take part in the Erasmus scheme, he had meant that those students currently on the course wouldn’t be thrown off it. And when he had said British citizens would still qualify for EU healthcare, he had only been talking about those still living in the EU. One wonders what lies the Govester has to tell himself to allow him to sleep at night. Still, at least Gove had finally got round to agreeing that the UK would be doing what it had already said it would. The more pressing question was whether Johnson would do what is best for the country or what is best for his position in the Tory party. We’ll need an answer to that one in a matter of days."
2020-12-09T16:20:52Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: no checks on supermarket supplies to Northern Ireland,"A Brexit threat to the British banger in Belfast has been lifted, Michael Gove has said, as the EU and UK declared peace over the food supply across the Irish Sea. In what some called “sausage wars”, both sides agreed a six-month delay on mandatory health checks on all chilled meats going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and a three-month grace period for all other food suppliers selling into the supermarkets and corner stores. The deal hammered out by Gove and the European commission follows concerns raised by Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s that they would have to curb meat, dairy and fish supplies because of Brexit checks that were supposed to kick in from 1 January whether there is a trade deal or not. “Our agreement also prevents any disruption at the end of the transition period on the movement of chilled meats. British sausages will continue to make their way to Belfast and Ballymena in the new year,” Gove told MPs on Wednesday. The cabinet minister branded his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič “the sausage king of Brussels” as they shook on the deal. Government sources said conversations would continue with the EU to ensure reciprocal free flow of food products after the six-month grace period. “We want the enduring arrangement on that. In fact we see it as the broader UK-EU issue here. We want bratwurst coming into GB and for our sausages to go into Paris. The discussion needs to be had next year,” said a source. Traders had expressed fears that every item in a food truck would be subjected to checks, with the example of a ham and cheese sandwich requiring two health certificates for each ingredient.
The government also confirmed two other wins for the talks: no exit or export declarations needed for goods going from Northern Ireland to Britain, and no tariffs to apply to goods coming in from Britain. This will apply to trusted traders for the next three and a half years, after which the arrangement will be reviewed. Gove said that had tariffs applied, supermarkets would have to pay and then apply for a rebate on all goods, including “58% on a pint of milk and 98% on a bag of sugar from Liverpool”. Labour’s Hilary Benn said the deal showed “what can be achieved” when opposing sides worked together. But Glyn Roberts, an independent retailer representative, said the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, had been unable to say whether the grace period also applied to his suppliers. “It is absolutely unacceptable that the government could make a major statement and not have this information available, which risked one third of corner stores and independent chains,” he said. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson told the Commons that the new system threatened Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, and the “real test will be and how these measures work on the ground, rather than the spin given in this house”. Sources said the concession was made as part of a package of arrangements hammered out in an UK-EU joint committee in exchange for the UK dropping its law-breaking Brexit clauses in the internal market and taxation bills. There has also been a deal allowing 15 EU officials to be permanently based in offices in Belfast, to help traders get to grips with the new system to and monitor enforcement by UK officials. Their presence represents a U-turn for the government months after it told Brussels it could not open an office in Belfast. The officials will have access to all UK databases, and controls will be able to take place at any time without prior notification. They will not have a building but appropriate office space will be found, sources say. Of the four border control posts at Northern Ireland ports, two are not yet fully completed and will function as temporary structures. Denis McMahon, the permanent secretary in Northern Ireland’s environment department, told MPs that the border posts were 80% ready for the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January but the rollout of checks “won’t be pretty”. Robert Huey, the chief veterinary officer for Northern Ireland, said there would be delays at the border on 1 January as they did not have the time to prepare without details of checks. He told the Northern Ireland affairs select committee that health checks would apply to 100% of live animals and horses and 30% of meat such as minced beef, but some goods deemed low risk would face 1% checks."
2020-12-09T16:11:29Z,politics,Politics,England's chief medic whitty warns of Covid surge if social rules ignored,"England’s chief medical officer has warned of a “disastrous” resurgence in coronavirus cases if people stop adhering to social distancing guidelines now that the mass vaccination programme has begun. Prof Chris Whitty told MPs that the winter months were high risk for the NHS, particularly because of respiratory infections. He stressed the importance of immunising an estimated 20 million people made a priority for a jab before any substantial easing of restrictions. He told a joint hearing of the Commons committees for science and technology and health and social care that the UK was heading into spring 2021 “in much better shape than three or four months ago”, but he warned against complacency. “That would be disastrous, because then actually the wave would come back incredibly quickly. We’re all very nervous about January and February, which is the highest risk period for the NHS in particular, March as well. The alternative is to say actually there is an end to this, we just need to get ourselves through this last period, and we really must be self-disciplined, as we have been all the way through this year.” This week some of the most vulnerable people in the UK received the first shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside a clinical trial, as the NHS began the most ambitious mass vaccination programme in its history. Older people in care homes, other people over 80 and health and care workers are first in line for the vaccine, followed by people with health conditions and younger people. Despite vaccines being “by far the strongest tool in our box”, said Whitty, very few people would recommend “starting to really remove [restrictions] during a high-risk period of the year, which the winter always will be for respiratory infections, until you have got covered the tiers which the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has laid out.” He added: “I want to be very clear. For the next three months we will not have sufficient protection. The idea we can suddenly stop now because the vaccine is here – that would be really premature, it’s like someone giving up a marathon race at mile 16. It would be absolutely the wrong thing to do.” An estimated 20 million people are included in the JCVI’s priority list for the Covid-19 vaccine, which includes everyone aged 50 and over, and anyone from age 16 upwards who has a health problem that puts them at serious risk from coronavirus. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last week and is reviewing clinical trials data for the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine and the US National Institutes of Health/Moderna vaccine. Giving evidence to the session, June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, said the regulator expected a further package of trial data from AstraZeneca in the coming days, which would inform its decision on granting a licence for emergency use. Further data from trials of the US Moderna vaccine are expected in the next week or two. Whitty said he expected to have a portfolio of three to four vaccines by the middle of next year. Clinical trials of the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines showed they helped to protect against severe Covid-19 disease, but it is less clear whether they prevent infections entirely and stop people spreading the virus. Whitty said the short-term impact of the vaccination programme would be to reduce hospitalisations and deaths. The virus would still circulate, however, leaving many people at risk of “long Covid”, a mix of medical problems that persist months after a person has seemingly recovered. On the prospects of returning to a near normal life, Whitty said that at some point society, through political leaders, would say the level of risk from the infection was tolerable, “just as we accept that in an average year 7,000 people die of flu, and in a bad flu year 20,000 people die of flu”. He added: “At a certain point you say actually the risk is now low enough that we can largely do away with certainly the most onerous things we have to deal with. This will be a kind of gradual retreat. But it is a de-risking process, rather than it’s just going to go away.”"
2020-12-09T14:57:21Z,politics,Politics,"For seasoned EU watchers, Brexit trade talks look uncannily like Grexit","It was a marathon even by the European Union’s standards. For hours, leaders of countries in the eurozone argued, haggled and shouted at each other. After breaks for refreshment, they argued, haggled and shouted some more. Rumours swirled around the packed media room. Eventually, as Brussels was waking to a new morning, the 17-hour overnight summit staggered to an end. All participants were in agreement that victory had been snatched from the jaws of defeat. Despite the brinkmanship, a deal was eventually done – as seasoned EU watchers had always said it would be, even when all hope seemed lost. This is not a bit of crystal ball gazing before Boris Johnson’s dinner with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, but a recap of how Grexit – Greece’s departure from the eurozone – was averted in July 2015. For veteran EU watchers, the Brexit trade row looks uncannily like the clash between Athens and Brussels five years ago, which also involved a referendum where EU terms and conditions were rejected. The stage is the same, some of the dramatis personae – most notably Germany’s Angela Merkel – are still cast members, and the script has followed a familiar pattern: endless talks going nowhere leading up to a make-or-break meeting at which both sides have to decide whether they want to do a deal. Johnson is not the first politician with a mandate to take on the EU. Back in January 2015, Alexis Tsipras became prime minister of Greece after the country had endured half a decade of misery. Its economy had contracted by a quarter, one in two young people were out of work, and the country was only able to pay its debtors courtesy of financial support from the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which came with harsh strings attached. Tsipras called this “bailout barbarity”. His equally charismatic finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said that having won an election on an anti-austerity platform, democracy should be respected and the bailout terms eased. Other EU countries, most notably Germany, disagreed, and the negotiations went nowhere fast. For months, meetings of eurozone finance ministers were dominated by the crisis, with one blowing up spectacularly in February when Varoufakis rejected Europe’s proposals, before a four-month sticking-plaster bailout extension was patched together. On 26 June, Tsipras said he would hold a referendum on the bailout terms being offered by the EU. Two days later, Athens was forced to impose capital controls after the ECB refused to increase its support for Greek banks. On 5 July the referendum rejected the terms of the new EU loan and, by decisively saying no to another dose of austerity, set the scene for a crisis summit the following weekend at which Greece’s future as a eurozone member would be decided. Tsipras was subjected to what EU insiders called “extensive mental waterboarding”. Greece would stay in the eurozone and get a new bailout, but only after agreeing to reform the tax and pension system, to liberalise the labour market and deregulate other parts of the economy. The terms were even tougher than those on offer before the referendum. It was clear who had come off worst. “They crucified Tsipras in there,” said one senior eurozone official who attended the summit, according to the Financial Times. “Crucified.” So will history repeat itself? While there are similarities between Grexit talks in 2015 and Brexit talks in 2020, there are also important differences.
For a start, those gathered round the table on that July weekend knew Tsipras had no real intention of taking Greece out of the single currency. Indeed, he had signalled as much between the result of the referendum and the Brussels summit by replacing Varoufakis with the more emollient Euclid Tsakalotos. Varoufakis promptly called the deal “a new Versailles treaty”, comparing it to the 1967 Greek coup d’état but using banks, not tanks. And there were clashes, teargas and molotov cocktails on the streets of Athens that week as MPs voted the unpopular measures through. All things considered, Johnson would rather secure a trade deal than not, but trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms would not be so nearly as momentous for the UK as leaving the euro would have been for Greece. The choice is no deal or a relatively thin deal. Finally, it is worth noting that trade talks do not always end with countries stepping back from the brink. Sometimes – as was the case for the World Trade Organization in Seattle in 1999 and in Cancún in 2003 – they fail."
2020-12-09T14:24:11Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson makes little splash in a Brexit-bored Brussels,"As Boris Johnson’s motorcade swept into the European commission headquarters on Wednesday night, it was greeted with an interminable line of 27 fluttering blue and yellow flags – and a lone red, white and blue union jack, drooping forlornly at the end. The symbolism was substantial. On the pavement, the TV cameras were gathered. There was a small and very British protest in favour of a deal: Three Wise Men dressed in colourful homemade robes singing bravely in the cold. “Star of Europe, star so bright,” they carolled. “Guide us to a deal tonight. Stop us leaving, kicking, screaming, with no deal and with no rights.” Hector McGillivray, a retired commission staffer, waved a homemade star because “Boris badly needs some guidance”. His friend Jeremy had a “box of empty promises”, while Hussain was offering some face-saving masks. But other than that, the crunch dinner to decide the fate of Brexit stirred precious little passion on the half-frozen, and almost wholly deserted, streets of Brussels’ European quarter. Few knew it was happening; even fewer cared. “Are they really?” asked Emma Delprez, 37, a PR consultant, after she was informed earlier in the afternoon that the British prime minister and Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, were to meet in a do-or-die attempt to break the deadlock. “I had no idea. I’ve kind of given up following it, to be honest. It seems to have been going on for ever. I don’t understand the ins and outs of it but the English do seem to be causing a lot of trouble. I hope whatever they get is worth it.” Wrapped in a quilted jacket, scarf and gloves on his way to pick up a panini on the Rue Archimède, Dimitri Vermeulen, 48, a corporate lawyer, was more dismissive still. “I’ve got no clue what will come out of it,” he said. “The Brits don’t know what they want – or at least they do, but they also know it’s not possible, and that the alternative will be a disaster. So it’s not surprising they’re finding it hard to make up their minds. But really, I’ve lost patience with Brexit.” Behind him, the lights of the Berlaymont, the 13-storey steel, glass and concrete commission building where Johnson and Von der Leyen dined, were largely dimmed. As with all the European buildings in Brussels, its staff have mainly been working from home since March. The cafes and restaurants of the surrounding streets, filled with multilingual chatter in non-Covid times, were closed bar the odd optimistic sign insisting “Open for takeaways”. It was 2C and the wind whistling through the office blocks of the Schuman roundabout made the few people who were out reluctant to stop. It felt a suitably desolate backdrop to the high-stakes encounter that, more than four years after Britain voted to leave the bloc, may finally decide whether it does so with a deal regulating the future trading relations with its largest partner. “Actually, I don’t even know whether it will do that,” said a tall Dane working for “a part of the EU” so unwilling to be further identified. “It’s all theatre, isn’t it? Or it is for Johnson, anyway. He has to show he’s taken the fight to the enemy, that he’s battled for Britain to the bitter end. That’s who he is.” But what no one yet knew, the Dane said, rubbing his gloved hands together, was whether “it’s theatre aimed at dressing up a great British climbdown as some kind of victory, or allowing him to pretend the talks’ failure is all Europe’s fault. And I suspect we won’t know that straight away.” In the children’s playground on the Square Ambiorix, a couple of hundred metres from the Berlaymont, Claire Martens, 31, was pushing her small son – face barely visible beneath an oversized woollen hat – on the swings. “I’m past caring,” she said. “I think it’s very sad, but it’s gone on for long enough now. If they want to really go off all on their own, they should do it. See what good it does them. They never really belonged in the first place, did they?”"
2020-12-09T14:00:18Z,politics,Politics,'I'd still vote Tory': voters in Leigh still unconvinced by Labour one year on,"“Can you imagine 50 years ago telling the 2,000 people who worked here that eventually this would be a place where they voted Tory?” asked Trevor Barton, sitting in the cafe at the Lancashire Mining Museum in Leigh, where the pitmen of Astley colliery once received their wages. “They’d put you on a stake and burn you.” It was early March and Barton, a former chief superintendent of Greater Manchester police and chair of the museum, was explaining why he had voted Conservative for the first time in the general election. For the first time in almost 100 years, Labour had lost Leigh, a collection of former mining and weaving towns and villages in the borough of Wigan. It was such a surprise victory that no TV network had bothered to send a camera to the count and it was left to a reporter from the local paper to capture the historic moment on their mobile phone.
James Grundy, the local Tory councillor who won a 1,965 majority, was so sure he would lose that he hadn’t written a speech. “I had 30 seconds to come up with one. How my legs didn’t go from under me I have no idea,” he said afterwards. Until a few years earlier, Barton had been a member of the Labour party. He remains a good friend of Andy Burnham, the local MP before he became the mayor of Greater Manchester. But no way was Barton voting Labour in 2019. Jeremy Corbyn was one reason: “About as patriotic as a box of daffodil bulbs.” The shadow cabinet was another: “I wouldn’t let them push my bloody daughter’s toy pram, never mind bloody run a government.” He wanted “root and branch reform”, a totally different, united Labour party, and described voting for the Brexit party in last year’s European elections as “the stepping stone” to voting Tory. Labour should have promised to honour the referendum result, he said. “If you deny the working-class man, the coalface, the power of their vote, you really have disenfranchised them, and that, that they will not forgive.” Nine months later and Barton, now 77, has been watching prime ministers’ questions most weeks during the pandemic. He has not been impressed with Keir Starmer. Boris Johnson’s mastery of the detail had been “bloody shambolic at times”, he conceded. But Starmer “asks the questions like he’s prosecuting a bloody murder case. There’s no soul in the man. There’s no feeling. Whereas Boris, God love him, for all his mistakes, he takes people with him … He’s a human being and he seems to care, and that’s why I think people are going to stick with him.” Despite his background in law enforcement, Barton was not fussed about Dominic Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle. Durham police investigated and found no crime had been committed, he noted, preferring instead to blame the media. “You guys are not happy sometimes until you’ve actually nailed a poor sod.” Almost a year on from what she called “the campaign of doom”, Jo Platt – who took over from Burnham as Leigh’s Labour MP and lost the seat to the Tories – thinks her party is miles away from winning it back. “It’s a huge mountain to climb and I don’t see any movement,” she lamented from her new job overseeing the renovation of Spinners Mill, one of Leigh’s surviving textile buildings. “People are still focused on the last leader and the state of the party. If I look on social media, people are still bringing up Corbyn or his old frontbench. It’s a big job to get away from that.”
Labour was fighting the wrong battles, she complained. “I hate to use the word, but the ‘culture wars’ side of things, where issues come out that people around here just don’t associate with.” It suits Grundy perfectly to have Labour concentrate on issues with little cut-through in Leigh. The fact that Labour still hadn’t really made clear its Brexit position was ridiculous, he said last week, and its opposition to flights deporting people with criminal convictions to Jamaica was “at right angles to the voters that the Labour party lost at the last election and have been losing sort of gradually over a period of years now.” Grundy said Starmer “looks and sounds like the north London remainer he is”. But he said he wasn’t bullish about his re-election chances. “I think that if you ask people to choose between the government and basically a very divided opposition that hasn’t yet restaked a claim to economic credibility, I’d have very good chance of retaining my seat,” he said. “But only time will tell.” Jess Eastoe is a Labour party activist who knows better than most what exercises Leythers. She runs Absolute Leigh, a hyperlocal Facebook group with more than 40,000 members. She is marginally more optimistic about Labour’s chances, having noticed an uptick of complaints about the Tories as the pandemic has worn on. The argument about free school meals cut through most, she said, “to the point where we had to stop allowing the posts because it just was getting too heated”. Eastoe wants to see a “campaign culture” emerge in the party – “for far too long Labour has seen Leigh as an easy win.” She also wants an end to factionalism in the constituency Labour party, complaining there is still “too much infighting” between the people who still worship Corbyn and the people who hate him. Back in March, Grundy described his disbelief on election night when he watched the counting of votes from ballot boxes taken from the Plank Lane estate, one of the poorest parts of the constituency and Labour’s major stronghold. “The idea that Plank Lane would be 60% Tory – you’d be sectioned [for predicting it],” he said. Plank Lane is where Declan Flannery’s mum runs the Pit Stop cafe, the name a nod to the area’s former mining heritage. Many residents worked at the Bickershaw colliery nearby until its closure in 1992. Flannery, a 25-year-old gas fitter, comes from a Labour-voting family but switched to the Tories in December. “The parties aren’t the same now, are they?” he said in March. “Labour is disconnected from the working class.”
As the anniversary of the election approached, Flanery said he had “switched off” from politics. He was fed up with “all the point-scoring between them – it’s pathetic”. Despite describing Johnson as “bumbling”, he said he sympathised with the prime minister. “I just feel like he’s in a lose-lose situation with anything that can’t get everything right, because I don’t think any country’s got everything, right.” It was too easy for Labour to claim it would have done better, he said, dismissing Starmer as “Captain Hindsight”. Keith Park, a recently retired infectious diseases nurse, agreed. He is one of the many Leythers to say his father, a miner who never learned to read, would have spun in his grave to hear that his son voted Tory in 2019. But he said he’d do the same again, approving of recent policies including cutting the foreign aid budget. “I know Labour were against that. But if you ask the average person in the street, which I consider myself being, am I unhappy? Not necessarily so because, you know, my interpretation of the foreign aid budget is that a lot of money goes to countries that actually don’t need it.” He approved of Starmer kicking Corbyn out of the parliamentary party. “That impressed me a lot. It showed his authority a lot more than Boris did with his dithering over Cummings,” he said. “But I still think we are better off with the Tories in power at the moment … I still think I would vote for the Tory party, but I’m less sure than I was right at the beginning [after the election].”"
2020-12-09T14:00:18Z,politics,Politics,Labour 'red wall' seats lost to Conservatives in 2019 might be 'lost for good',"Labour faces a continuous decline in its traditional heartlands unless it challenges “an enduring perception of us as ineffective, complacent or indifferent”, a stark report by a group of the party’s MPs has warned. The study by the group Labour for the North concludes that some of the “red wall” seats lost to the Conservatives in 2019 “may be lost for good” unless it tackles a deep-rooted “northern problem”, including “the perception that we are a London-centric party”. A year after Labour’s worst general election result since 1935, the report concluded that many voters in the north of England still did not see Labour as representing the area, despite Tory poll ratings slipping nationally in the wake of the pandemic. The report warns: “If not addressed, these figures signal a continuous decline. The constituencies and communities, which for so long we took for granted, have fundamentally changed. “These places began to fall to the Tories in 2017 before leaving Labour en masse in 2019. Unless we recognise how and why, there is a potential that they may be lost for good. Without understanding what isn’t working for us on a local level, we cannot hope to win back power nationally.” Separately, in interviews with the Guardian to mark a year since the 2019 general election on Saturday, 11 Labour council leaders and ex-MPs warned that the party had a huge task ahead to regain the trust of its former voters who switched to the Conservatives last December. They unanimously welcomed Keir Starmer’s appointment as leader as a step in the right direction but said the problems facing the party were more deep-rooted than either Jeremy Corbyn or Brexit. Phil Wilson, the former Labour MP for Sedgefield, which elected a Tory for the first time in almost 90 years in 2019, said he had the impression that some were regretting lending their vote to the Conservatives but that Labour remained “a hell of a long way” from winning back seats like his. “What [Starmer] basically needs to do is to move a million miles away from Corbyn and his worldview…We have still got to win back credibility on the economy. We’ve got to reassure people that we do believe in Britain,” he said. His view was echoed by a hard-hitting report drawn up by a group of Labour MPs in northern seats, led by the shadow health minister Justin Madders, the Bootle MP, Peter Dowd, and Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South. The 10,000-word document says Labour’s “long retreat” from the north of England can be traced back to Tony Blair’s landslide in 1997 and some of the voters lost since 2017 “will be very difficult to get back”. It suggests Labour produce a fully-costed “northern manifesto” at every general election, appoint a shadow minister for the north of England, develop an alternative levelling-up agenda and “embrace inclusive northern and national identities … reflecting patriotism and pride in a diverse northern identity”. A survey carried out for the report laid bare the challenge: “All our survey responses described huge pride in their local areas, and how we were often seen to ignore this.” The report urges Labour not to “get drawn into debates on divisive cultural issues” because it will alienate more socially moderate voters in northern seats if the party is seen as prioritising “divisive questions of identity and culture” over jobs and the economy. The “real danger” for Labour is the cultural divide developing between the “red wall” seats the party lost in recent elections and among the younger voters in diverse cities where it is dominant. It adds: “We have much work to do to re-establish trust with former voters. We should achieve this not by casting back to a past era, but by making sure we listen to their concerns and aspirations, and more often tune our policies and outlook to their priorities. “The greatest risk for Labour is that, in this newly-turbulent politics, we fail to listen to our former voters make efforts to reconnect with them, and allow another party to build lasting links.” Four Durham seats, Bishop Auckland, Sedgefield, Darlington and North West Durham, went Tory in December. Simon Henig, leader of Durham county council, said the political landscape prior to 2016 was irrelevant in today’s debate. “The fact that Tony Blair had a 25,000 majority in Sedgefield is completely irrelevant. It is pre-history. There’s a new landscape that’s been that’s been forged by Brexit and by what has happened with that referendum and the way the 2019 election played out has reshaped England. “The key thing will be what happens after January. What impact does that have? Does that then fulfil what people were voting for or not? And if it doesn’t, what happens as a result of that?”"
2020-12-09T13:01:37Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: no PM could accept trade terms offered by EU,"Boris Johnson claimed no prime minister would be right to accept the trade terms being offered by the EU, as he prepared to fly to Brussels for last-ditch talks. Asked in the Commons by the veteran Tory backbencher Edward Leigh about the prospects for a deal, Johnson said: “Our friends in the EU are currently insisting that if they pass a new law in future with which we in this country do not comply or don’t follow suit, then they want the automatic right to punish us and to retaliate. “And secondly they’re saying the UK should be the only country in the world not to have sovereign control over its fishing waters. I don’t believe that those are terms that any prime minister of this country should accept.”
Johnson was appearing at prime minister’s questions before travelling to Brussels for talks over dinner with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The prime minister’s spokeswoman, Allegra Stratton, said the dinner, which would begin after a short meeting at 7pm, would not be a negotiation. “It’s a dinner, a conversation between two political leaders,” she said. “The prime minister is going to be clear this evening that he can’t accept anything that undermines our ability to control our laws, or to control our waters. He’s going to put that clearly to Ursula von der Leyen to see what her response is.” In the Commons, challenged by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, about the risks of a no-deal exit from the transition period on 1 January, Johnson claimed the UK would be “a magnet for overseas investment”, whatever the outcome. “There will be jobs created in this country, throughout the whole of the UK, not just in spite of Brexit but because of Brexit,” he said. “Indeed, this country is going to become a magnet for overseas investment. Indeed it already is, and will remain so.” He said the UK would prosper whether the outcome of the negotiations was “a Canada solution or an Australian solution”. The Australian solution is Johnson’s shorthand for a no-deal exit from the transition period on 1 January, under which the EU would impose tariffs on British goods. Starmer accused the prime minister of failing to secure the “oven-ready” Brexit deal he had boasted of during last year’s general election campaign. But Johnson said that had referred to the withdrawal agreement, which allowed the UK to leave the EU on 31 January this year. “We had an oven-ready deal, which was the withdrawal agreement, by which this country left the customs union, left the single market and delivered on our promises,” he said. He added that the UK would be able to implement a new immigration regime now, raise animal welfare standards, and strike new trade deals with other countries. The prime minister also attacked Starmer, who was appearing via video link while self isolating, about Labour’s failure to say whether it would vote for a Brexit deal, accusing him of being “sphinx-like” about the issue. Starmer said no decision would be made until there was a deal to scrutinise, and he added: “My party will vote in the national interest.” He pointed to forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility which suggested, he said, that the cost of leaving the EU with no deal would be higher unemployment, higher inflation and a smaller economy."
2020-12-09T11:22:46Z,politics,Politics,'Quick and easy': what leavers said about a UK-EU Brexit trade deal,"The negotiations have been going on more than four years, with countless rows and ongoing recriminations. Yet as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels on Wednesday night for crisis talks, and both sides sound gloomy about the prospects of success, a trade deal remains elusive as ever. This is not how leading Brexiters thought it would pan out. Here’s a reminder of what they said: Liam Fox The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. The then international trade secretary made the declaration during a radio interview in 2017. Boris Johnson There is no plan for no deal, because we’re going to get a great deal. Said during his time as foreign secretary. Johnson assured Britons there was no need to plan for a no-deal scenario. His statement was quickly slapped down by Theresa May’s Downing Street, who insisted that “contingency planning is taking place for a range of scenarios”. Michael Gove The day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want. A month before the EU referendum, Gove, now the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, insisted the UK would “hold all the cards” if it voted to leave the EU. John Redwood Getting out of the EU can be quick and easy – the UK holds most of the cards. The Conservative MP wrote of his confidence about the Brexit negotiations in July 2016, less than a month after the referendum result. “Too many people in government and the professions seem to think the UK is a weak petitioner which has to be very careful in case we are expelled from the single market,” he said. Paul Nuttall It will be easy to negotiate these terms, it will be easy to negotiate a trade deal, and of course, it is in European Union’s interest just as much as it is in ours. Such was the confidence of the then Ukip leader during an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 17 January 2017. He went on to say he was “not trepidatious about this in any way, shape or form.” Nigel Farage To me, Brexit is easy … We have back British passports, we have control of our fishing waters, and our companies are not subject to EU law through the single market. Said by the man who largely led the charge for Brexit, back in 2016. Gerard Batten What you could do in an afternoon, which won’t take two years, is to say to the European Union: ‘We want to continue with tariff-free trade and so do you, because it’s in your interest.’ Then Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, Batten said Brexit could be sorted “in an afternoon over a cup of coffee”. The Labour MP Alison McGovern hit back at the statement at the time, describing it as nonsense. “The idea that you could sort out customs arrangements for high-value manufacturing like that in an afternoon – that is an insult to my constituents and their jobs,” she said."

Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are due to have dinner together in Brussels at 7pm GMT. Merkel said she did not expect a deal to be in place before an EU summit on Thursday but that hope remained.
Should the meal in the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters be a success, negotiators on both sides expect to resume talks on Friday, and leaders will merely be updated on progress when they meet in Brussels. Speaking in the Bundestag in her traditional address before a summit of the EU’s 27 heads of state and government, Merkel said there remained a chance of a deal. She said: “I don’t think we will know by tomorrow if this will happen or not – at least I can’t promise this, but we are still working on it. “But we are also prepared for conditions we cannot accept. So if there are conditions coming from the British side which we cannot accept then we will go on our own way without an exit agreement. Because one thing is certain: the integrity of the single market has to be maintained.” Merkel said the main stumbling block in the negotiations in Brussels was the EU’s request for an “evolution clause”, or “ratchet clause” as Downing Street has described it. Such a clause would establish a mechanism to ensure that as one side raises their environmental, labour and social standards, the other is not able to sit tight and enjoy a competitive advantage. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has agreed to non-regression from a common baseline of standards at the end of the transition period, but Brussels is concerned that these will soon become obsolete as the bloc develops its rulebook. The EU negotiators want a forum for discussion when the current minimum standards become outdated owing to developments on one side. There would then be arbitration and the potential for one side to hit back with tariffs or other corrective measures if the other drags its feet on agreeing a new “level playing field” of minimum standards. Downing Street fears this will mean an alignment of standards via the backdoor, and is pushing back at anything that will cramp policymaking in Westminster. Merkel said: “There are a number of complicated questions, which mostly are down to how to deal with the dynamic. We currently more or less have the same legal system, a harmonised legal system, but over the years the legal systems will diverge regarding environment law, labour law, health legislation, everywhere. “And how will the respective other side react to this, when the legal situation either in the European Union or in Great Britain will change? And we can’t just say we won’t talk about this, but we not only need a level playing field for today but also for days to come. For this we need to find agreements about how each side can react when the other changes their legal situation. Otherwise there will be unfair competition conditions, which we can’t do to our companies. “This is the big, difficult issue which is still on the table, next to questions about fishing quotas and similar things. But this issue of fair competition between two diverging legal systems – this is the actual big issue for which we need satisfying solutions.” Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, who as taoiseach in 2019 worked with Johnson to find a compromise on the Irish border before ratification of the withdrawal agreement, said he believed Johnson would seek to find another compromise. He said there was a 50% chance of a successful outcome. Varadkar said: “Both sides have more to gain, and certainly more to salvage from an agreement over the next few days than we have to lose. Ultimately, it takes a little bit of politics at the end, and both sides to move a little bit at the end but I think that is possible. “Is Boris Johnson willing to make concessions in those areas? I think he probably is. I think his natural instincts are actually much closer to the more liberal London mayor that he was than the more conservative Brexiteer. I think he wants Britain to be part of the world. I think he wants Britain to be seen as a country that is a first actor, one with high standards. “However, he will be very strong on the sovereignty point and I think any set of common minimum standards, any set of level playing field rules, would have to be ones that the UK wouldn’t feel are imposed on them. And that’s, I think, where the sovereignty piece comes in, and that will be a circle that’s going to be hard to square.”"
2020-12-09T07:18:55Z,politics,Politics,Brexit hurdles and solutions: Boris Johnson's Brussels to-do list,"As Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Brussels in the hope of sealing a Brexit trade deal, he will be armed with a memo from his chief negotiator, Lord Frost. Here are some of the likely key points, big hurdles and potential solutions to be thrashed out at the negotiating table: 1. Deal or no deal? This is the moment to decide just how the prime minister will deliver on his promise to “get Brexit done”. The approach he takes will be critical, as there are plenty of points of detail on which talks could collapse. Any decision will be underpinned by medium-term strategic considerations – what Johnson can sell to his party and the British public as being best for the UK. With no deal, in the short term at least, the economic pain will be greater. The necessary shift to World Trade Organization (WTO) terms would hit sectors such as farming and manufacturing with higher tariffs. And if Johnson walks away, the reality is that the UK will need to return to the negotiating table at some point in the future. But Johnson and Frost will also be considering: could there actually be a better deal on offer next year? Or will a failure to agree this time damage relations with the EU for years to come? And does the prime minister really want Brexit to carry on being a big domestic political issue well into 2021? 2. Fishing This is not simply ideological; it’s also a matter of resolving a complex trade negotiation. This is a sector that directly employs only 8,000 people, according to the Office for National Statistics, and accounts for £400m, or less than 0.1%, of the UK economy. By contrast, financial services accounts for £126bn. So allowing a deal to flounder over fishing makes little sense. Striking a deal also makes sense because UK fishermen want to sell their catch – herring, cod, langoustines – abroad. First, the numbers. EU trawlers currently catch 60% of the total tonnage of fish in Britain’s rich waters. The EU has offered to return 15%-18% of that to the UK; Britain has asked for 60%. It is perfectly possible to split the difference, or perhaps introduce different quotas for different species.
Next, the negotiation timeframe. Norway negotiates fishing quotas each year with the EU, and the UK is aiming to achieve the same – although the bloc wants assurances that its fishermen will not be denied reasonable access. Brussels may also seek to levy punitive tariffs if EU vessels cannot fish in British waters. Such tariffs are unattractive, but giving assurances may be relatively straightforward. Finally, the transition phase. Both sides acknowledge that a deal will bring big change but the question is how quickly to move. The UK wants a three-year transition; the EU position is 10. Again, it should be possible to split the difference, perhaps at five or seven years. 3. Governance and disputes The EU is nervous since the UK tried to break international law by overriding clauses of the withdrawal agreement, in a move considered to be a massive breach of trust. Those clauses were withdrawn on Tuesday, which has been viewed as removing an obstacle to a deal. The EU wants a pretty tough dispute resolution system, including the power to suspend parts of the trade and security deal if the UK breaches the terms of the treaty. Because of a dispute about UK border systems, it may put tariffs on food, for example. A solution here may be to restrict the power to the most egregious instances. The UK would hope the EU would respect its position that the security agreement, at least, cannot be dragged into a trade dispute. 4. Level playing field Brussels’ demand that the UK does not seek to gain competitive advantage by engaging in a “race to the bottom” in social, environmental and other standards is seen as crucial within the bloc. But Johnson’s counterparts know he has been clear that effectively following EU regulations would amount to the UK becoming “a vassal state”. One answer is non-regression: both sides could agree not to water down the standards they have, as ministers have repeatedly made clear that is not the intention of the UK. When it comes to the future, it’s more complicated as the whole idea of Brexit is that there will be some divergence. But the EU says it wants to ratchet up those standards over time and levy punitive tariffs if the standards are not met. The prime minister will stress that the UK does not want to prevent the EU exercising its sovereignty. What would instead be required is a regular process of review, every four or so years. In some respects, this is the most challenging area, because ultimately it requires an act of faith on both sides: that each will behave reasonably in the future. Johnson will have to reassure the EU that the UK seeks a complementary and friendly long-term relationship. 5. Back home With his mandate to “get Brexit done”, a working majority of 85 and a Labour party that has signalled its willingness to back a deal, Johnson considers himself to be in a strong position on home soil. If he secures an agreement that can be said to respect British sovereignty, ultimately it is likely to pass the Commons and be accepted by a large portion of the public. In many ways Johnson’s biggest challenge next year is getting on top of the pandemic, not Brexit."
2020-12-09T00:01:23Z,politics,Politics,"Home Office failure to digitise border system will cost extra £173m, says NAO","The Home Office’s failure to deliver a new digital border system to monitor the movement of people and goods into and out of the UK will cost the taxpayer an additional £173m, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found. Border force staff will instead have to rely upon 26-year-old technology to decide who is allowed into the UK until the scheduled delivery of the Digital Services at the Border [DSAB] programme in 2022, the National Audit Office said. The extra cost has been disclosed in a report released today, which catalogues the Home Office’s repeated delays over 17 years as officials tried to digitise the management of entry to the UK via ports and airports. It has been released amid deepening scrutiny of the UK’s borders, with Border Force officers braced for problems at UK ports on 1 January. With a month to go until the end of the post-Brexit transition period, there is still no clarity about exactly how they will operate when it comes to trade with the European Union. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said the Home Office had “utterly failed” to learn from the mistakes with past failed attempts to update systems. “The Home Office once again lost sight of the programme’s core purpose, trying to add more and more features like baubles on a Christmas tree. “The department plunged ahead without a delivery plan and didn’t address risks. Failure was inevitable,” she said. A plan to digitise the UK’s borders was first launched in 2003 and was originally due for completion in 2011, at a cost of £600m. It was supposed to help staff manage the watchlist of suspected criminals, search facilities and “identify and assess threats”. After repeated problems and delays, the Home Office launched its DSAB programme in 2014, which would allow border force staff to make decisions about people crossing the border and to track goods entering and exiting the UK. Auditors found the Home Office “did not deliver improved digital border systems to its planned timetable of March 2019” which has “increased costs by £173m and means it continues to rely on legacy technology”. The report also reveals that the Home Office plans to remove all data from Schengen Information System II (SIS II), the EU’s police and security database, on 31 December. “While it plans to mitigate the loss of access to SIS II, the implications of replacing this key data source for the programme’s stakeholders are yet to be worked through,” it said. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said such a decision would leave the UK open to people who may be a security threat. “This decision has serious implications for border checks as it means that Border Force will overnight on 31 December cease to have access to any of the 40,000 alerts from SIS II on dangerous wanted criminals across Europe,” she said. Auditors said the rollout of the new digital system has been pushed back to the end of March 2022 and cannot be guaranteed to be on time or within budget. Without it, Border Force staff will rely upon a 26-year-old system to check whether suspects and persons of interest are trying to enter the country, while another system which analyses passenger data is 16 years old, auditors said. The department “estimates that the net impact of its failure to deliver the programme by the end of March 2019 as originally planned is an additional cost of £173m,” the NAO said. The report also warned of technical problems with the Home Office’s new system to monitor the watchlist of suspects and people of interest, which will check passenger details against electronic visas and check on who has a legal right to remain in the UK under the EU settlement scheme. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said the DSAB programme did not achieve value for money by March 2019, failing to deliver what it intended and leaving Border Force staff to rely on outdated legacy systems. He said the Home Office needs to “ensure that it can deliver the programme at the pace and scale it requires”. A Home Office spokesperson said it had accepted the report’s recommendations. “Since 2019, following the reset of the programme, industry confidence in this programme has increased with a clear focus and delivery plan put in place. “This programme will transform the way we secure and manage the flow of people and goods across the border. It will deliver adaptable and modern technology to improve security, increase efficiency and provide a better experience for travellers,” they said. Responding to the report’s disclosure that all data taken from SIS II will be removed from Home Office databases on 31 December, a government spokesperson said: “We have tried and tested Interpol channels, which we can use to exchange information with EU member states and other countries around the world.”"

2020-12-08T19:41:00Z,politics,Politics,Chances of Brexit deal hang on Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen dinner,"The future of Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe will hang on the success of a dinner between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels on Wednesday, it has emerged, as the EU’s chief negotiator warned the chance of a Brexit deal was now “very slim”. Downing Street said the prime minister would join the European commission president at its Berlaymont headquarters on Wednesday evening, where the leaders would seek to break the Brexit impasse over a three-course meal. Johnson will take prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons before flying from RAF Northolt to Brussels to dine with Von der Leyen, armed with a memo from his chief negotiator, David Frost, on the remaining obstacles to a historic trade and security deal with the EU. He will return to Downing Street after the discussions.
Von der Leyen tweeted on Tuesday: “I look forward to welcoming UK prime minister Boris Johnson tomorrow evening. We will continue our discussion on the partnership agreement.” No 10 sources pushed back on rumours that Johnson had wanted to delay the meeting to allow the 27 EU heads of state and government to intervene in the discussions when they gather at the European council summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday. They insisted the prime minister “categorically wants to avoid” such a scenario. A deal is not expected to be sealed at the dinner but Downing Street said if there was progress and goodwill, the troubled negotiations could be expected to resume on Friday after the council summit. EU leaders will be informed of any progress when they meet, or could trigger the bloc’s no-deal contingency measures – keeping planes in the sky and borders safe – if the dinner ends in failure. “It will continue past [Wednesday] if they can make some headway and it’s worth it,” one senior UK official said. Downing Street said it was open to continuing talks into the weekend and beyond, but stressed nothing could go on past 1 January. “We have been clear that the future relationship needs to be concluded by the end of the year and negotiations won’t continue in the new year,” a No 10 spokesman said. “That’s been our position throughout.” Speaking in private to EU ministers on Tuesday, the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has so far resisted calls from some member states to trigger the commission’s no-deal contingency plans, admitted that such measures could soon be necessary given the small chances of success. “We are close to the moment of needing urgent measures which means a contingency plan for no deal,” Barnier said, according to EU sources. “The basis of our future cooperation with the UK is more important than rushing now. We cannot sacrifice our long-term interests for short-term political goals.” Johnson and Von der Leyen agreed on Monday evening to hold a make-or-break meeting with just three weeks to go until the UK leaves the EU’s single market and customs union, with or without a deal. Frost travelled back to London on Tuesday night to brief Johnson after finalising an agenda with his EU counterpart comprising the key remaining differences to be discussed in the summit. A UK government official confirmed they were expecting Frost to “resume negotiations over the coming days” as long as the dinner between the two leaders showed there was scope for change. “It’s clear that some political impetus will be required for the talks to make any more progress,” the source said. “But we must be realistic that an agreement may not be possible.” Barnier had said earlier in the week that he could not negotiate beyond midweek due to a Commons vote on Wednesday on new legislation which would again break international law by overriding clauses in the withdrawal agreement. But Downing Street’s decision on Tuesday to abandon all the Brexit clauses relating to Northern Ireland in both the internal market and finance bills removed that obstacle to more talks. Maroš Šefčovič, the commission’s vice-president, who has been working with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said the move “removed one big obstacle”. He said: “I hope this will create positive momentum for the discussions on the free trade agreement. We’re still very far apart and we’re not hiding this from anyone. We’ve removed one big obstacle from the way and I hope we will see the positive results also coming from this very complex negotiations.” The European commission’s chief spokesman said Johnson and Von der Leyen would not be sealing a deal but trying to find reason to “move forward hopefully with negotiations, which could hopefully continue after that … This is uncharted territory – we’ll have to see how this meeting goes.” Earlier on Tuesday, Johnson said securing a deal would be “very, very difficult”. “You’ve got to be optimistic, you’ve got to believe there’s the power of sweet reason to get this thing over the line,” he said. “But I’ve got to tell you it’s looking very, very difficult at the moment.” On Tuesday night a UK government source similarly downplayed prospects of a deal, saying: “It’s clear that some political impetus will be required for the talks to make any more progress. “If we can make progress at a political level it may allow Lord Frost and his team to resume negotiations over the coming days. But we must be realistic that an agreement may not be possible as we will not compromise on reclaiming UK sovereignty.” Johnson’s cabinet met on Tuesday morning and a spokesman said it was unified around the current position. “We obviously want to continue to try to reach a free trade agreement, that has been our position throughout,” the spokesman said. “But the cabinet also agrees that any agreement must respect our sovereignty and allow us to take back control of our money, laws and borders.” Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said the result of the summit would depend on the UK government’s “political will” to seal a deal. He said: “What we need is political will in London. Let me be very clear: our future relationship is based on trust and confidence. It is precisely this confidence that is at stake in our negotiation right now.” Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, said his government would not be rushed into an agreement that was not in its interests. “If when we look at it we see that it is not as good as not having a deal, we will not hesitate to veto it – as is the case with every other European country who will do this evaluation.”"
2020-12-08T19:23:19Z,politics,Politics,Who's who in the UK and EU negotiating teams,"Ursula von der Leyen, European commission president
It will be only Boris Johnson’s second face-to-face meeting with Ursula von der Leyen when the two leaders try to break the Brexit impasse at a summit in the Berlaymont, the European commission’s star-shaped headquarters in Brussels. During their first get-together in Downing Street in January, the two children of former commission officials shared anecdotes of their times at the European school in Uccle, a suburb of Brussels. “We introduced a very rough game – British bulldog,” Johnson told Von der Leyen of his arrival in 1973 as the son of the commission’s then director of pollution and nuisance prevention division. One could imagine Von der Leyen, who returned to Germany in 1971 when her father decided to make money in the private sector before launching a successful political career in the centre-right CDU, might have given Johnson a run for his money. “Some might underestimate her because she is small in stature but they make a big mistake – a big mistake,” said one diplomatic source who has worked alongside the commission president. “She is business-like, not a people person and extremely ambitious. While he is fluffy and dithering, she is the opposite. Impatient. Prefers action over reflection. But the key thing is her ambition: I think commission president is a staging post for her, not an end point. You look at the middle-aged men fighting over replacing Angela Merkel as chancellor and it makes you think.” Von der Leyen, 62, was a surprise appointment as commission president last July. Her name only emerging in the final days as a compromise candidate, amid a fight among the pan-European groups for top jobs in the EU institutions after the European elections. It made her the first female commission president – and the first German in the job for 50 years. “It was an expert bit of German politicking,” said one admiring official. She came from Germany’s defence ministry – again, the first female minister – where her often male critics referred to her as Flinten-Uschi (“shotgun Uschi”). There were some conspicuous failings during her tenure, most notably a scandal over the state of the Bundeswehr’s equipment. But few blamed her personally given the lack of long-term investment. Even her detractors in Brussels concede that with her past as practising medical doctor, she has proven to be the ideal person to be leading the commission during the coronavirus pandemic. On Brexit, Von der Leyen has increasingly involved herself in the talks, Merkel recently noted approvingly. It has unnerved some member states. “She wants a deal – and possibly at any price,” said one diplomat. “Berlin is the same. But for her it is personal – it is her legacy. It’s that ambition.” An official who has worked alongside Von der Leyen said this did not mean she would allow Johnson to dictate terms. During their well-tempered and long telephone calls in recent days – they addressed each other as Ursula and Boris – she listened to Johnson explain his political difficulties on some of the EU proposals. “It was two seasoned politicians talking,” a source said. Von der Leyen said she understood. “But if he thinks he can charm her, he is very much mistaken,” said an EU official. “She will be all over the detail. And he will see the steel.” The UK team David Frost, UK chief negotiator
A former foreign office mandarin with years of experience of working in Brussels at the UK permanent representation before becoming ambassador to Denmark, Frost, 55, is Boris Johnson’s chief negotiator. Frost, or “the Great Frost” to the prime minister, is often the toughest voice in the room on Brexit, sources say. His counterpart, Michel Barnier, has never been truly convinced that Frost wants a trade and security deal. Sir Tim Barrow The UK’s last permanent representative to the EU is soon to leave Brussels as he has been appointed political director in the foreign office. Barrow, 56, a fan of natty waistcoats and modish suits, is a specialist on Russia and security policy but has been Frost’s right-hand man during the last nine months of talks. He was the first to make the point that the EU’s funding should not be exempt from state aid rules. The EU team Michel Barnier, EU chief negotiator
A former French minister and European commissioner, Barnier was appointed as the EU’s chief negotiator in October 2016. He has seen off one British prime minister and three Brexit secretaries. He has made exhaustive efforts to keep every part of the EU talking from the same hymn sheet, bouncing from meeting to meeting to successfully keep everyone on-side. He has often been Britain’s best friend, trying to find solutions to peculiar British political problems. Stephanie Riso Part of Michel Barnier’s team during the negotiation over the withdrawal agreement, Riso, 44, was promoted to be deputy head of Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. A ball of energy and super-bright, she is regarded as a deal-maker. An economist by training from the Côte d’Azur, she has been Von der Leyen’s link to the negotiation and has in recent weeks been sitting side-by-side with Barnier. EU sources deny rumours that this has created tensions."
2020-12-08T18:18:26Z,politics,Politics,UK drops plans to break international law as Northern Ireland deal is reached,"The government is dropping controversial plans to break international law in relation to Brexit, following a behind-the-scenes deal between the UK and the EU, it has announced. But EU diplomatic sources warned that while the U-turn was a â€œreset momentâ€� for relations with the UK, it was not a gamechanger for trade talks, which remain deadlocked. On Tuesday, the government said it would abandon all the Brexit clauses relating to Northern Ireland in the internal market and finance bills following in exchange for promises by the EU to minimise checks and controls due to be imposed on food and medicines going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain from 1 January. Details on the checks are expected to be disclosed on Wednesday, but the cabinet minister, Michael Gove, and the European commission vice-president, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄ�oviÄ�, announced they had sealed an agreement â€œspecifically for checks on animals, plants and derived products, export declarations, the supply of medicines, the supply of chilled meats, and other food products to supermarketsâ€�. They have also agreed agriculture and fish business would be exempt from state aid rules, and drew up the long-awaited list of goods â€œnot at riskâ€� of being smuggled across the border into the Republic of Ireland. Clearing its in-tray, the joint committee also revealed a decision on the makeup of an arbitration panel to adjudicate on any future Brexit disputes. â€œIn view of these mutually agreed solutions, the UK will withdraw clauses 44, 45 and 47 of the UK internal market bill, and not introduce any similar provisions in the taxation bill,â€� said the statement. The deal was sealed at a meeting of the UK-EU joint committee chaired by Gove and Å efÄ�oviÄ�, which is mandated to implement the Northern Ireland protocol and other parts of the withdrawal agreement signed in January. As part of the agreement there will be an EU presence in Northern Ireland to monitor implementation of the protocol at the border. The Democratic Unionist party condemned the development as â€œunnecessaryâ€� and â€œconcerningâ€�. A government source said the UK believed it had achieved significant shifts in the EUâ€™s position, particularly on the application of state aid under the terms of the protocol. However, two sources cautioned there should not be too much â€œread acrossâ€� of goodwill for the talks with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission, in the coming days â€“ the agreement will mean additional goodwill but it also smoothes the path for no deal. â€œI think you can infer from what we set out on conditions for removing clauses yesterday that weâ€™ve got good outcomes in all the areas we wanted,â€� a government source said. â€œWe always said clauses were there as a safety net, but our preference was to find agreement and pragmatic solutions through the joint committee.â€� An EU source noted â€œgood progressâ€� was being made by the joint committee on minimising checks down the Irish sea and the introduction of law-breaking clauses to the internal market bill in September was a serious setback that damaged trust between the two sides. â€œThis does reset things and has helped lift the downbeat mood but it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean a deal is any closer,â€� they said.
Irelandâ€™s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, described it as a â€œpositive developmentâ€� and business leaders in Northern Ireland reacted with relief. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, described the move as â€œvery welcomeâ€� and â€œhugely positiveâ€�. He is one of several business and farming leaders who have called for the Northern Ireland protocol to be delayed because businesses have not had enough notice to prepare for the remaining customs and regulatory checks that will still apply from 1 January. â€œWith three weeks left to go we still will need an implementation period to allow us to comply with the new requirements. While this is a positive step there is still much to do in little time,â€� he said. Earlier on Tuesday the Food and Drink Federation boss, Ian Wright, had told MPs that the Northern Ireland protocol was â€œa shamblesâ€� with four in 10 producers in Great Britain planning to shelve or reduce the supply of produce to Northern Ireland because of the uncertainty over the Brexit trading regime. Retail NIâ€™s chief executive, Glyn Roberts, welcomed the progress but said â€œthere is a lot of clarification neededâ€� yet to overcome concerns of local shops. â€œThe joint statement refers to â€œfood products to supermarketsâ€� â€“ such an agreement must include all food retailers, including local wholesalers and independent retailers in Northern Ireland,â€� he said."
2020-12-08T17:50:14Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock laps up the vaccine glory and may have shed a tear,"Just occasionally a sucker gets an even break. Normally it’s Matt Hancock who gets all the crap gigs and is No 10’s “designated fall-guy”. But while all Boris Johnson got from his hospital visit to observe one of the first vaccinations – soon every jabbee will be issued with an “I don’t want to be used as a photo op for politicians” sticker – was a whole load of questions on the Brexit negotiations that he couldn’t deal with, Hancock was allowed to bask in his moment of glory. A saviour had risen from the streets and to everyone’s surprise – not least Matt’s – that person was him. Even if it was only for one day. Hancock’s day had begun with a puzzle. Had he or had he not cried on ITV’s Good Morning Britain when watching footage of William Shakespeare of the Stratford-on-Avon area (really) receive his coronavirus jab? Matt certainly appeared tearful, but not everyone was completely convinced. Still, it made good telly. He had said how emotional it was, had lowered his face as he rubbed his eyes and yet it was hard to spot a genuine tear. Perhaps it was just old fashioned British reserve or maybe all his tears had been used up on the 60,000 people who had already died from coronavirus – many of them in care homes as a direct result of his department’s neglect. “It makes me proud to be British,” he said, his voice catching a little, as he conveniently forgot that the vaccine had been made by a German biotech firm working in collaboration with a US pharmaceutical giant.
Certainly by the time the health secretary arrived in the Commons at lunchtime to answer an urgent question on the vaccine’s distribution, he appeared to have recovered his composure. This was to be his moment and he was determined to enjoy every second. So often he has been called on to explain why the government’s response to the coronavirus has been at best hopeless and at worst reckless, but now he was just happy to be festooned with garlands from both sides of the house. This year has been unremittingly grim and MPs from all parties were just glad to have some good news to share with one another. Many seemed rather more emotional than Hancock had on telly earlier in the day. Matt didn’t actually have much to say, beyond repeating what he had said on his broadcast rounds. It was a historic day but we should not get too carried away as the NHS faced a herculean task in introducing the vaccination programme across the country. So far the vaccines were restricted to 70 hub hospitals but he expected other hospitals and care homes to receive supplies by next week. But we were still in for a long haul and if we were to get through it then people should abide by the rules. For some reason, he omitted to say that one way of helping might be to scrap the five-day Christmas free-for-all which was sure to add to the death toll in January and February. By and large – the major screw-ups excepted – the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has tried to adopt an approach of constructive criticism in his responses to Hancock’s coronavirus statements. Today he just went for the full love-in. This was a great day and he wasn’t going to spoil it with any niggle. So all he wanted to know was whether all care homes would get the vaccine by Christmas – spoiler alert: they probably won’t as we don’t have enough stock and can’t be certain when the next batches will arrive – and whether junior NHS staff would qualify as priority recipients. Hancock successfully managed to answer completely different questions while repeating that it had been an emotional day. Jeremy Hunt, chair of the health select committee, then asked the question that was literally on no one’s mind. Was it now safe for everyone to book their summer holidays? He’d got a great deal on a villa in the Seychelles but he’d like the health secretary to give him the nod before putting down a deposit. Hancock merely said he’d already sorted his own holiday in Cornwall. Or failing that, the Isle of Wight. Anywhere in tier 1 basically. Most of the rest of the questions were just as soft. If not quite so random. Everyone welcomed the vaccine but wanted to know when it was coming to a hospital near their constituencies and, while they had the health secretary’s undivided attention, would he consider moving their region down a tier next week in celebration. Matt merely smiled benignly, assured everyone he had the logistics under control and that he would do what he could when the time was right. He even managed to rein back the jingoistic rhetoric of the UK’s place in world history as the first country to administer the vaccine. Though he did mention it twice. There were just a few MPs who dared raise some of the trickier questions. Like why was track and trace still such a disaster when it was going to be key to protecting the nation’s health in the coming months before the rollout was complete. And what were the contingency plans for bringing the vaccine into the country if there were delays at the border caused by Brexit? “We have five contingency plans,” Hancock insisted. Well, could you let us know what they were, asked Labour’s Emma Lewell-Buck. Matt couldn’t. This level of information was top secret and he’d have to kill her if he told her. Which was odd, as Hancock had already told the country what they were during his media round earlier in the day. Lorries, boats, a variety of ports, commercial aircraft and, if all else failed, the RAF. Still, maybe Hancock could be forgiven for this lapse in memory. As he had said on several occasions, it had been an emotional day. Even the losers get lucky sometimes."
2020-12-08T17:27:47Z,politics,Politics,"'We'll be shafted': amid EU trade talks, there's little optimism at Brixham harbour","Even before the sun rose, the harbour-side of Brixham, which bills itself as the birthplace of the trawling industry, was bustling. Fishermen, market workers and merchants were busy with their early morning tasks, landing, preparing, and auctioning off gleaming hauls of dover sole, monkfish and scallops. But in the background, thoughts of the Brexit negotiations taking place hundreds of miles away in London and Brussels were hovering. “I wish they’d get on and get it sorted,” said Dave Brown as he unloaded a catch of bass from his boat, The Thankful. “This could be a really significant moment for our industry. We want our waters and our quotas back.”
Brown has worked from this famous old Devon port for 40 years. He does not feel fishermen from mainland Europe should be barred completely from British waters. “There’s got to be some compromise but it’s just not fair at the moment.” Is he optimistic a favourable deal will be reached? “Not very, to be honest.” In truth, there was precious little optimism at the harbour. The most common responses – accompanied by a variety of colourful expletives – were variations on: “We’ll be sold down the river again” or “We’ll be shafted, we always are.” The mood in Brixham is not helped by a tragedy. Local man Adam Harper, 26, was one of two fishermen who died when the boat the Joanna C sank three miles out to sea last month. “That is a reminder of the human cost of fishing,” said James Walsh, who manages the fishmonger at Rockfish on the harbourside.
“I’d just like to see a fairer deal for the fisherman. We should have a better share of our waters. We’re happy to share but the split needs to favour us more than them. At the moment they [boats from mainland Europe] have free roam and are taking money out of British pockets.” Brixham has been a fishing port since the middle ages and in the 18th century pioneered the use of sailing trawlers, fast powerful robust boats that targeted demersal fish – cod, sole, plaice, haddock. In more recent decades the industry has shrunk and the seafood sector, which includes fishing, aquaculture and processing, represents only 0.1% of the UK economy. But in places such as south Devon it is still hugely important and Brixham is England’s largest market by value of fish sold. This autumn the port enjoyed a run of million-pound weeks, with sales of cuttlefish, scallops and more than 40 types of fish regularly reaching seven figures. Mike Sharp, the owner of two Brixham beam trawlers, said this was the simple reason why the French and other nations were so keen to maintain excellent access to British waters. “From Dover to the Isle of Scilly we have the best fish in the world,” said Sharp. “That’s why the French are kicking off so much.” “We want what I think Boris is trying to achieve – full sovereignty of our waters. Once we have that we can have a yearly agreement to decide who can come in and swap that with the French for access to their waters.” Sharp, who took part in the pro-Brexit flotilla protest on the Thames in London during the EU referendum campaign, said he is not worried by the prospect of no deal. “I don’t mind if it breaks down. I don’t think that will be bad for fishing at all.” But compromises have been floated, such as a transition period or taking some fish – for example, pelagic species such as herrings and tuna – out of the negotiations. Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, the body representing fishermen in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the industry was opposed to a transition period that has been mooted with reviews at the end of three, five, seven or 10 years. “Justice deferred is justice denied,” he said. “The industry feels that it’s been in a relationship with the EU that has worked systematically to its disadvantage for 40 years, so there’s not really a huge sympathy or appetite for extending anything that looks like being tied into the common fisheries policy.” Deas added that the industry will be looking to see the detail of the quota arrangements and that reports that the EU had offered to hand up to 18% of fish caught in British waters back was “meaningless” as there were quota shares for 140 different fish species. “Behind every stock, there’s a story, behind every quota, there’s a story, there’s a community,” he said. One crucial factor haunting Brixham, however, is that the EU is its largest customer with more than 70% of its catch exported to France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. Trevor Sclater, the skipper of Brixham’s newest and biggest beam trawler, Georgina of Ladram, is a rare beast – a anti-Brexit fisherman prepared to speak about it.
“I’ve been anti-Brexit from the start,” he said. “I think it’s disgusting what we’re doing.” Sclater is for equality. “It should be a level playing field. If we have to stay outside the French 12-mile limit then they should stay outside ours. But, he argues, the industry worked well before Brexit. “We fished, we made a living. Why fix something that isn’t broken?” He fears that if boats from mainland Europe are banned from fishing off the British coast, countries such as France will stop accepting the fish caught by UK boats. “I can see on 2 January us not being able to sell our fish. We shouldn’t be putting gateways between ourselves and our nearest neighbours. That’s crazy.”"
2020-12-08T16:56:54Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon’s husband 'contradicted' her evidence to Alex Salmond inquiry,"Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, Peter Murrell, has been accused of contradicting her evidence to a parliamentary inquiry about her meetings with Alex Salmond to discuss allegations of sexual harassment. Murrell, chief executive of the Scottish National party, told a special Holyrood inquiry that his wife had met Salmond at their home on Scottish government business and not as SNP leader. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said his testimony on Tuesday “directly contradicted” Sturgeon’s written evidence to the committee, where she said she had met Salmond as SNP leader. Murrell, who has been married to Sturgeon since 2010, replied: “I don’t accept that.” Opposition MSPs and Salmond believe his evidence strengthens serious questions about whether Sturgeon broke the ministerial code – potentially a resignation matter, because she may have misled parliament. Sturgeon told Holyrood in late 2018 she had met Salmond as party leader. She is already under investigation by Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions, James Hamilton, over whether she interfered with the government inquiry – a claim she has repeatedly denied. Sturgeon has admitted meeting Salmond at her home in Glasgow on 2 April, where they discussed a decision by senior civil servants to launch a formal internal inquiry into sexual harassment complaints against him, dating to his time as first minister. The committee heard last month from John Somers, Sturgeon’s principal private secretary, that if it had been an official meeting in her role as first minister, it would have been in her ministerial diary and minuted. But it was not, he said. Sturgeon has admitted she spoke to Salmond about the inquiry twice before she alerted Lesley Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant, about those contacts in June 2018, the day before the pair met again. It has also emerged Sturgeon did not tell parliament she had met Salmond’s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her first minister’s office four days before seeing Salmond at her home. In written evidence to the committee, Sturgeon said that meeting – which was also not included in her ministerial diary – “did cover the suggestion that the matter might relate to allegations of a sexual nature”. Sturgeon said she agreed to meet Aberdein as she had been worried Salmond might resign from the party. Questioned by Alex Cole Hamilton, a Lib Dem MSP, why Murrell was not told about the meeting given Salmond’s resignation would be a “bombshell” involving a man he worked with closely for decades, Murrell claimed he did not ask what the meetings were about and was not told by his wife. Murrell said Sturgeon was immensely busy and they did not discuss her duties as first minister. “When she says she can’t talk about something, that’s the end of it,” Murrell told the committee. Murrell first told the committee he was not at home during the meeting but admitted under questioning from Andy Wightman, a Scottish Green MSP, that he arrived home while it was going on to find three people in their living room, with Sturgeon and Salmond in another room. It has already been established that the three others were Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon’s chief of staff, Aberdein, and Duncan Hamilton QC, Salmond’s close friend and legal adviser. Murrell told Wightman he said hello and went upstairs for a shower, and did not press his wife on why they were there. Murrell also told the committee he was aware Salmond could be facing investigations in London involving the Crown Prosecution Service at around the time Salmond first appeared in Edinburgh sheriff court on 14 charges of alleged assault and breach of the peace. Salmond was later acquitted of all the charges. None of those charges involved alleged offences in London, and the Met police inquiry did not become public knowledge until early 2020. The Met later announced it was not taking any action on those claims. • This article was amended on 10 December 2020 to restore words which explain that Andy Wightman is a Scottish Green MSP."
2020-12-08T13:09:55Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: Boris Johnson warns securing deal is 'looking very, very difficult'","Boris Johnson has warned that securing a deal at an imminent Brexit summit in Brussels will be “very difficult” but backed “the power of sweet reason to get this thing over the line”. The prime minister, who agreed during a phone call on Monday to meet the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in the Belgian capital, said he wanted an agreement. “You’ve got to be optimistic, you’ve got to believe there’s the power of sweet reason to get this thing over the line,” Johnson said. “But I’ve got to tell you it’s looking very, very difficult at the moment. “We’ll do our level best, but I would just say to everybody – be in good cheer, there are great options ahead for our country on any view. But the key thing is, on 1 January, whatever happens there’s going to be change and people need to get ready for that change.” Asked if he would try to do a deal right up until the wire, Johnson told reporters: “Yeah, of course. We’re always hopeful but you know there may come a moment when we have to acknowledge that it’s time to draw stumps and that’s just the way it is.” The prime minister insisted he would be willing to leave the transition period without a deal. He said: “We will prosper mightily under any version and if we have to go for an Australian solution then that’s fine too.” Australia and the EU do not have a free trade deal and there are tariffs on goods, including 48% on lamb and 84% on beef. In a joint statement on Monday, the two leaders agreed in the coming days they would hold a make-or-break meeting. Sources on both sides pointed to Wednesday or Thursday morning as the most likely times. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, will travel back to London on Tuesday night to brief Johnson after finalising an agenda with his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, of the key remaining differences to be discussed in the meeting with Von der Leyen. No timings for a meeting have been agreed yet. No 10 suggested the discussions would be a forum for genuine negotiation, a suggestion which had been dismissed by the EU. “The prime minister recognises that we have probably taken technical talks as far as they can,” a Downing Street spokesman said. “The in-person meeting will be to see if there is a political way through. Nothing has been agreed yet in terms of the details of the meeting.” Johnson’s cabinet met on Tuesday morning and a spokesman said it was unified around the current position. “We obviously want to continue to try to reach a free trade agreement, that has been our position throughout,” the spokesman said. “But the cabinet also agrees that any agreement must respect our sovereignty and allow us to take back control of our money, laws and borders.” EU leaders will meet on Thursday, when they could sign off on an agreement or trigger their preparations for a no-deal outcome, including temporary legislation to keep planes in the air. Frost, joined commission officials on Tuesday morning to prepare a document for the two leaders on the outstanding issues over fair competition, EU access to British fishing waters and the terms of a dispute mechanism in the event of treaty breaches. Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said the result of the summit would depend on the UK government’s “political will” to seal a deal. He said: “It is good that every effort is undertaken to find a sustainable and good solution. We want to reach a deal but not at any price. What we need is political will in London. Let me be very clear: our future relationship is based on trust and confidence. It is precisely this confidence that is at stake in our negotiation right now.” Roth was speaking at a virtual meeting of EU ministers preparing for Thursday’s summit of the 27 member states’ leaders. Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister, said his government would not bow to time pressure with less than three weeks to go before the UK leaves the single market and customs union with or without a deal. He said: “The truth, the facts, is that there is still a negotiation ongoing … Concretely, it’s complicated and we don’t want to give in to a form of pressure from the British.” He said fisheries was a major issue. “That’s 6,000 jobs in France. It’s a big deal. There is no reason that just because it’s important for the British, we say ‘OK, we give up, you deny us access to your waters and we will go elsewhere’. That’s not possible. We will make efforts, compromises, yes, we have said that honestly to the French fishermen. But sacrifice our fishermen – no. And the British know it … “Yes, we are a bit fed up. But we cannot say that we will slam the door and walk away because we’re tired of it all.” Beaune repeated France’s threat to veto the deal if it failed to protect French fishermen’s rights to operate in British seas and offered the UK the opportunity to undercut EU standards. He said: “We will look at the deal when it’s on the table and we will analyse whether or not it defends our interests. If when we look at it we see that it is not as good as not having a deal, we will not hesitate to veto it – as is the case with every other European country who will do this evaluation. “I do not want to declare these talks a failure. I think we still have some time to negotiate – a few days – and after we have to say clearly, because it’s important for our fishermen, our businesses, we have to say yes, or no.”"
2020-12-08T10:49:20Z,politics,Politics,Lords vote to revoke UK trade deals with countries committing genocide,"Ministers’ scope to sign trade deals with governments that abuse human rights have been severely reduced after a double defeat in the House of Lords. In future, ministers will be required to both undertake a human rights impact assessment for any trade deal, and revoke an agreement in cases where potential genocide is found in a preliminary UK high court ruling. It would be the first time domestic courts were given the right to declare if genocide was occurring in another country. The genocide hurdle has been devised specifically in relation to allegations that China is committing genocide against Uighur people in Xinjiang province, a charge Beijing has repeatedly denied. Peers voted by 297 votes to 221 to back the requirement tabled by the Labour frontbench to withdraw a trade agreement if an impact assessment showed serious human rights abuses. Peers then voted by 287 to 161 to back an amendment tabled by Lord Alton and Lord Forsyth giving the high court the right to make a preliminary judgment on genocide, and requiring an agreement to be revoked if genocide is found. The scale of the defeats late on Monday night may make it harder for the government to overturn the measures in the Commons, although it is understood that some MPs who are normally critical of China are nervous of the constitutional implications of giving the courts a right to make a preliminary judgment on genocide. Defending the genocide measures, the Labour peer and human rights barrister Lady Kennedy said: “The purpose is to ensure that there is a preliminary determination by the high court, not any lower court, as to whether there is genocide. It is pre-emptive: the whole purpose of the genocide convention was to prevent genocide by placing a duty on nations to act to prevent it.” She rejected Conservative accusations that the measure was virtue signalling, insisting the bar for determining genocide, including proving intent, was so high that “such a case could not possibly be brought before the high court of this country and have any serious reception if it were not presented with a whole body of evidence that was highly persuasive and involved eminent lawyers who could testify to the bar having been passed on the definition of genocide”. Lady Falkner said the passage of the law could be a “standout moment” for the UK, saying “China is running a gulag worthy of the description of the Soviet gulags by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, except that from what we now know in real time, not in retrospect, it is much worse”. Speaking for the government, Viscount Younger opposed the measures, saying: “This would strike at the heart of the separation of powers in Britain’s constitutional system, allowing the high court to frustrate trade agreements entered into by the government and ratified after parliamentary scrutiny”. He said it would lead to vexatious allegations of genocide being brought to the court as a means of putting political and international pressure on the government. He added that the UK had no plans to secure a free trade deal with China, but said UK-China trade was worth approximately £76bn. China is the UK’s fourth-largest trading partner, sixth-largest export market and third-largest import market."
2020-12-08T05:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Shadow cabinet MPs express Labour Brexit strategy doubts,"At least eight members of Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet have privately expressed doubts about Labour’s strategy of backing any Brexit deal secured by Boris Johnson, the Guardian understands. Starmer is expected to face down calls on Tuesday for Labour to abstain in a vote on any Brexit deal, and whip in favour of backing it despite the risk of a backbench rebellion. MPs had been contacting Starmer’s office and whips over the weekend, warning of a potential exodus of members otherwise loyal to the Labour leader. Starmer has committed to keenly scrutinise a deal – if one can be secured with the EU – but is understood to believe that nothing has fundamentally changed to shift his thinking.
The prime minister is to travel to Brussels for a meeting with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in the “coming days” in the latest attempt to break the impasse. The shadow cabinet is due to discuss its position on Tuesday. The timing of the meeting was drawn up in the belief the two sides would have clinched a deal in advance. Those who are nervous about backing a deal include MPs who have previously been vocally pro-remain, including the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and others such as Bridget Phillipson, Jo Stevens and Emily Thornberry. One shadow cabinet minister said there was a feeling that Starmer’s mind could still be changed, though other Labour sources said it was unlikely. “Until now it has felt like a fait accompli but now the discussion is out in the open,” the shadow cabinet minister said. “This is a trap that we can avoid, we are not going to get credit from the rightwing media for it. But it is a hard conversation to have because no one wants to make life any more difficult for Keir.” MPs have been divided after a private polling briefing from BritainThinks, which suggested “red wall” seats would not forgive Labour MPs if they failed to back a Brexit deal. While that has convinced some waverers, others believe the polling could not capture the nuances of the question and that Labour may be hamstrung for years with regard to criticising the government over its Brexit handling if MPs vote in favour. Labour whips have been calling restive MPs over the weekend to sound out concerns and Starmer’s office promised he would hold a full meeting of the parliamentary party as soon as a deal was done, in order to hear MPs’ views. The former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw, a close ally of Starmer but an outspoken critic of Brexit, said he had been inundated with emails from constituents concerned about the party’s stance. “MPs and party members who feel most strongly about this are Keir’s most loyal supporters,” he said. “We are all receiving a lot of emails from members who cannot understand why we might do this and even threatening to leave if we do. These are people we cannot afford to lose.” On the backbenches, MPs such as Margaret Hodge and Catherine McKinnell have told whips to go for a free vote or abstention. The row has spilled over into MPs’ WhatsApp groups, where the Brighton MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle clashed with Swansea’s Geraint Davies. Other influential MPs, including those who were in favour of a second referendum, such as Hilary Benn, Thangam Debbonaire and Wes Streeting, now believe Labour should vote in favour of a Brexit deal. Some believe Labour should apply specific tests to any deal in terms of what it delivers for job security and trade – though they are tests any bare-bones deal would be unlikely to meet. Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said: “With the government’s majority the size that it is, the choice Labour faces is whether we endorse Boris’s deal or not. “For me to want to support any deal he makes it has to meet the needs of the British people on security, jobs protection, trade and climate change – without seeing it no one can judge if it does that and time is running out.” MPs are also worried about the effect on Scotland’s elections in May should the party decide to back a Brexit deal – allowing the SNP to lump both Labour and the Tories together as Brexit-backing parties. The SNP is likely to abstain in a vote on any deal."
2020-12-08T02:10:14Z,politics,Politics,"'Showdown in Brussels': PM hanging on for Brexit deal, papers say","Boris Johnson’s “Brexit showdown” with officials in Brussels dominates most of the papers ahead of the summit expected this week between the prime minister and the European commission’s president, Ursula Von der Leyen. After it emerged on Monday that the pair had talked on the phone for more than an hour without making much “tangible progress” on breaking the trade impasse, the nascent Downing Street spin operation made sure the papers were supplied with a picture of Johnson talking on his landline. The Mail picked up the cue with a headline reading “Last call for a deal” alongside the picture of Johnson on his prime ministerial landline, noting also that it has been 1,629 days since the referendum backed Brexit in June 2016.
The Express has the same picture but chooses a more bellicose headline with “Showdown in Brussels”, while the i also features Von der Leyen on the phone with the headline “PM heads for Brussels in bid to break deadlock”.
The Times has a similar choice of words with its splash headline reading “PM heads for Brexit showdown in Brussels”.
The Telegraph, which also features the prime minister on the phone next to a headline saying “Johnson on mission to Brussels”, nevertheless strikes a fairly gloomy note, saying that the outcome of the talks “could define not only his premiership but Britain’s place in the world for decades to come”.
It also quotes EU sources observing that while the UK could seal a deal, Johnson’s trip might be designed “to show that he tried everything he could to get a deal even if he expects to come home empty-handed”. The Guardian’s headline says “PM heads to Brussels after UK holds out olive branch”, reporting that Britain has offered some concessions on the critical issue of the internal market bill in order to secure a deal before finally severing ties on 1 January.
The Financial Times says “Johnson and Von der Leyen to meet in search for way out of trade impasse”, but its main story is on a big business deal: “Uber pulls plug on self-driving car unit to take stake in rival Aurora”. The other big story of the day is the beginning of Britain’s biggest ever vaccination programme as the first people prepare to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech jab against coronavirus.
The Mirror’s headline says “Our fightback starts today” although the Daily Record in Scotland finds the lure of wartime imagery irresistible: “V day”, its headline reads. The V-day line is also irresistible to editors at the Telegraph, Times and Express. The Metro’s splash head says “Roll up for first jabs”."

2020-12-07T22:02:28Z,politics,Politics,"MPs vote to keep law-breaking clauses in Brexit bill, but UK offers to drop them","The government has said it may drop key clauses from a bill that would breach international law by letting the UK unilaterally rewrite parts of the Brexit departure agreement. On Monday night the House of Commons voted down a series of five Lords amendments that had removed the controversial clauses from the internal market bill. The offer to remove the key controversial clauses pacified some Conservative MPs who had deep reservations about breaking international law, though some warned in the debate about the consequences to the UK’s international reputation should no deal be reached. Three Tory MPs rebelled during the votes, including Simon Hoare, chair of the Northern Ireland select committee. Among the MPs who abstained – and are known to have previously expressed concerns about the bill – were the former prime minister Theresa May, the former attorney generals Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright, and the former Northern Ireland secretaries Julian Smith and Karen Bradley, as well as the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. The offer is conditional on the two sides agreeing a final trade deal this week when the prime minister meets the European commission president in Brussels for a make-or-break summit. The reintroduction of the controversial text had looked set to inflame tensions between the two sides at a crucial point in the Brexit talks, until the concession to take the clauses out again was offered by Boris Johnson in a call with Ursula von der Leyen. Speaking in the debate before the vote, Labour’s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said the row over the clauses had been “calamitous, embarrassing and toxic” for the government and had been opposed by everyone from Conservative grandees such as Michael Howard and William Hague to the archbishop of Canterbury and US president-elect Joe Biden. He said it would be hard for the international community to trust that the clauses would be removed. “The one thing this whole saga has shown the world, I’m afraid, is that this government cannot be trusted, because they are willing to rip up international agreements they made less than a year ago.” The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood expressed alarm at the state of the negotiations during the debate on Monday and said the UK’s international standing had been “bruised” by a willingness to flout international law. “It would be an abject failure of statecraft to leave the EU with no deal,” he said. “If more time is required, then so be it. We will live with the consequences for years, indeed decades. We must summon the political courage to get it right. The west is about to regroup. Our voice, our experience, our leadership are needed on the global stage.” In a sign of softening attitudes, a government spokesman said it had agreed via the UK-EU joint committee, a bilateral body of ministers that deals with the withdrawal agreement, to iron out disagreements over the document, signed in January. The breach of international law in the clauses caused an outcry among MPs and the resignation of the government’s top lawyer. The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to amend it to remove the offending elements. Ministers have said these would be restored by the Commons. If this happens, the bill would return to the Lords as part of a process known as ping-pong – but agreement on a trade bill could end the legislative impasse. The spokesman said the UK would be “prepared to remove clause 44 of the UK internal market bill, concerning export declarations … to deactivate clauses 45 and 47, concerning state aid.” Clause 45 of the bill sets out that the UK government could change import and export procedures for goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and amend elements of the associated Northern Ireland protocol, “notwithstanding any relevant international or domestic law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent”. The government’s commitment appeared to mollify some Conservatives in the Lords. Bob Neill, the chair of the Commons justice committee, said it would remove the clause that had “caused most concern to legal commentators … a significant gesture of good faith on Her Majesty’s government’s part and would hopefully remove some of the real concerns that have been expressed.” The business minister, Paul Scully, who opened the debate, said the government was “keen to work in partnership as we do some difficult negotiations … We want to solve these problems rather than have to legislate for them.” The measures, which the government openly conceded would breach international law, prompted criticism from both opposition parties and EU politicians, even if many did see it as primarily a lever for Brexit negotiations. The UK government has insisted that the clauses are necessary as a failsafe to preserve goods going to Northern Ireland in the event of a disorderly Brexit once the transition period finishes at the end of the year, with tariffs added to goods from the rest of the UK seen as “at risk” of entering the EU by going on to the Republic of Ireland. The statement followed last-minute talks in Brussels on Monday between Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the European commission. The UK government statement added: “Good progress continues to be made regarding the decision as to which goods are ‘at risk’ of entering the EU market. Talks continue this afternoon. In the light of those discussions, the government will keep under review the content of the forthcoming taxation bill.” The taxation bill, another post-Brexit measure expected in the Commons imminently, had also been predicted to contain clauses breaching international law."
2020-12-07T20:42:52Z,politics,Politics,Cleverly trots out oven-ready nonsense as No 10 enters Brexit panic mode | John Crace,"You can sometimes tell how much of a state No 10 is in by its choice of minister for the morning media rounds. And sending out the junior Foreign Office minister James Cleverly – living proof of the fallibility of nominative determinism – rather proved that Downing Street was in full panic mode over the progress of its Brexit trade talks. At a time like this, only a minister too dim to sense the danger he was in would do. Cleverly may have his talents, but the only one that he doesn’t keep hidden – apart from to himself; in his own world he is one of life’s winners – is his inability not to make a bad situation worse. It was unfortunate enough for him to claim that there were “plans to get the coronavirus vaccine into the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit”, just that he couldn’t say what they were, as no one had trusted him with the details. That at least did ring half-true – in a desperate situation, Cleverly is one of the last people you would keep in the loop – but the look of confusion on his face rather suggested that no such details yet existed. Worse was to follow, as Cleverly went for the hat-trick on Sky, ITV and the BBC by insisting that Boris Johnson hadn’t lied when he talked about an “oven-ready” deal, because all that he had promised was a withdrawal agreement that was oven-ready. To no great surprise, James got thoroughly rinsed by Kay Burley, Piers Morgan, Susanna Reid and Dan Walker. There can’t have been a conscious being in the whole of the UK – even Boris, who can usually manage to believe his own fibs – who thought that “oven-ready” only applied to the withdrawal agreement. Especially not those who had bothered to read the paragraph in the Conservative 2019 election manifesto that said the Tories were the only party with a deal signed, sealed and ready that put the country on a path to a new trade agreement with the EU based on free trade and friendly cooperation. If the new government line that Cleverly had been sent out to defend is to suggest that the public had either been too stupid to understand its message or had been conned, it’s not a great look. Cleverly merely shrugged and repeated his nonsense over and over again. When in doubt, keep digging. Not quite so useless was the paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, stepping in for Michael Gove, who was holed up in Brussels, to answer an urgent question from Labour’s shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, on the state of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. But only because she made no pretence of knowing anything about anything. Rather, she sounded like a presenter on a 24-hour news channel trying to fill dead air by reading out the same headlines over and over again, telling nobody anything that they didn’t know already. The talks were at a critical stage. She couldn’t say how they were progressing. The sticking points were the level playing field, fishing and governance. And that was about it. Thanks for that, Penny. Reeves sounded rather nonplussed, as if she had expected something a little more detailed from a government minister. She raised the issue of GDP falling by a further 2% with a no-deal Brexit than it already would with a bad deal; she wondered how many of the 50,000 new customs officials had been recruited and trained, and she referenced Cleverly’s inspired new take on the semiotics of “oven-ready” and suggested the deal must have got sent to the wrong address, before sitting down with a sense of impending futility. As well she might, because Mordaunt yet again pleaded ignorance. Please don’t ask difficult questions, she begged, because they were all well above her pay grade. And seemingly above everyone else’s in government. Penny felt everyone’s pain, not least her own. Normally quite composed at the dispatch box, she seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Unlike Cleverly, she has the self-awareness to realise when she’s out of her depth. And right now, she was drowning. What followed was an entirely predictable clash between the Tory Brexiters and the worried well on the opposition benches. Iain Duncan Smith, Bernard Jenkin and Liam Fox led the charge for the headbangers, insisting that the government had already delivered on its promises and that the talks going down to the wire were entirely the fault of untrustworthy Johnny Foreigner. Mordaunt agreed – “No retreat, baby, no surrender” – but you could pick up the reservation in her voice. She was buggered if she was going to be the one who had to break the news to them that the choices were either making the country broker still, or accepting a deal that would have most of them shouting, “Betrayal!” As for the opposition, Mordaunt had nothing to offer other than to suggest that businesses worried about going bankrupt should log on to the government website. Failing that, she had heard there were some vaguely useful webinars in which she herself had not bothered to participate. Perhaps she should, as she might learn something. Mordaunt had excelled herself at knowing nothing. The unbearable lightness of being as performance art. Suggesting that you won’t break international law after all – on a treaty you agreed less than a year ago – providing the EU agrees to your other demands on a free trade agreement doesn’t sound like the strongest negotiating tactic. A bit like promising to obey the Highway Code, so long as your car’s defects are overlooked during its MOT. But it was enough to render the debate on the Lords amendments to the internal market bill, which proposed to break the Northern Ireland protocol, almost anodyne. So much so that the government sent out Paul Scully, the most junior of junior ministers in the business department, to open the debate. To put this in perspective, the departmental cleaners are generally considered better informed. After Scully, a man not even known unto himself, had wittered on for 20 minutes, Ed Miliband had the opportunity to enjoy himself at his adversary’s expense. Though the shadow business secretary couldn’t help looking as if he knew his virtuoso display was wasted on such a low-rent opponent. Like shooting fish in a barrel. But never one to look a gift horse, Miliband pointed out that it wasn’t just the opposition who were queasy about breaking international law; it was almost every grandee within the Tory party. Scully wished he could make himself invisible. Which, in a sense, he already was."
2020-12-07T20:21:51Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Johnson heads to Brussels after UK holds out olive branch,"Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for a face-to-face summit with the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in an 11th-hour attempt to break the impasse in the Brexit negotiations. A long-awaited crunch meeting will be held in the “coming days”, the two leaders said in a joint statement following a phone call lasting over an hour, keeping hopes alive of agreement on a trade and security deal. Sources on both sides pointed to Wednesday or Thursday as the most likely dates. Both EU and UK insiders said there was no certainty that a historic trade and security deal would be secured when the leaders meet, however.
“Talks are in the same position now as they were on Friday,” a UK government source said. “We have made no tangible progress. It’s clear this must now continue politically. Whilst we do not consider this process to be closed, things are looking very tricky and there’s every chance we are not going to get there.” One senior EU diplomat added: “We shall light a candle for them.” The joint statement from Johnson and Von der Leyen came hours after Britain said in the event of a deal it would drop key clauses from the internal market bill that would breach international law by letting the UK unilaterally rewrite parts of the Brexit departure agreement. The move was seen as an olive branch to the EU. It is now just over three weeks from the end of the Brexit transition period, when the UK leaves the single market and customs union with or without an agreement. Chief negotiators are still struggling to find common ground on the thorniest issues despite nine months of talks. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there would need to be a major change in the British approach for the upcoming summit to be a success. “The next two days need to be very different to the last two days,” he said. “In Brussels certainly the mood is starting to shift to contingency planning for a no deal, as opposed to the compromises that are necessary to get a deal done. That is not where we want this to go.” During the call with Von der Leyen, the prime minister outlined his difficulties with EU demands on issues ranging from fisheries to provisions on fair competition. After more than an hour, he asked for a break to confirm with his aides, including his chief negotiator David Frost, that there were sufficient grounds to make the trip to Brussels. EU sources said there had been no need for him make a second call to Von der Leyen to discuss an alternative plan as Downing Street was in agreement on a statement announcing the make-or-break summit. “We agreed that the conditions for finalising an agreement are not there due to the remaining significant differences on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries,” the leaders said. “We asked our chief negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.” Earlier in the day the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had told MEPs the talks were “not far from the very endgame”, warning he would not continue beyond Wednesday. Both sides will need time to ratify any agreement. Downing Street has said it will hold a vote on new legislation overriding the withdrawal agreement on Wednesday – a potentially deal-breaking move. EU leaders will meet on Thursday, when they could sign off on an agreement or trigger their preparations for a no-deal outcome, including temporary legislation to keep planes in the air. A senior EU diplomat said: “The outcome is still uncertain, it can still go both ways. The EU is ready to go the extra mile to agree on a fair, sustainable and balanced deal for citizens in the EU and UK. It is for the UK to choose between such a positive outcome or a no-deal outcome.” Difficulties remain in agreeing terms on EU access to British fishing waters, provisions to ensure fair competition and a system of dispute resolution if the terms of the treaty are breached. Tentative progress on the issue of EU fleets’ access to British fishing waters, as reported by the Guardian, was upended late on Sunday night when Frost is understood to have tabled new demands about the ownership of vessels in British seas. Under the proposals, any foreign majority-owned vessels would not be allowed to sail under the UK flag, sources in Brussels said. Vessels currently need only an “economic link” to the UK, such as landing more than half their catch at British ports or having majority British crews. Companies based in Iceland, Spain and the Netherlands fished 55% of the UK’s fishing quota by value in 2019, according to BBC research published this year. One EU diplomat said: “This has really caused a lot of problems. A paper was handed over late on Sunday night. This is serious.” Barnier said there also remained differences over fishing quota numbers and the UK’s intention to block access to the six- to 12-mile zone, seas in which French and Belgian fleets in particular have fished for centuries. “That is worrying at this stage in the negotiation,” he said. On the so-called level playing field clauses in the treaty, Barnier said the issue of “non-regression” from current standards had progressed well but that common ground had still not been found on the EU’s demand for a “ratchet clause”. The provision would ensure a baseline of minimum environmental, social and labour standards raises on both sides over time. The issue was fast becoming the biggest obstacle to a deal, EU diplomats said. Barnier told ambassadors he was optimistic that an agreement would fall into place on dispute resolution where either side breaches the terms of the deal. Downing Street was yet to agree to provisions that would allow for one side to suspend parts of the deal, known as a “cross suspension clause”, but Barnier said he was confident about finding a solution. It came as Brexiter Tory MPs in the influential European Research Group (ERG) said they would study carefully the text of any agreement reached with the EU. Former party leader Iain Duncan Smith told MPs in an emergency Commons debate on the talks that “the British public voted for a sovereign departure” in a series of coordinated interventions. Veteran Brexiter Peter Bone said he was confident that Johnson would bring back a deal that “takes back control of our laws, borders and trade”, adding: “I bet my house on it that he will not betray those principles.” Particular concern on the party’s right was also expressed about the “ratchet clause” but the ERG is likely to take legal advice and carefully study the deal to see if they believe the UK’s freedom of action is impacted. A hard core of two to three dozen rebels would be ready to vote against a deal in such circumstances, which would be embarrassing for the prime minister who has drawn support from the ERG, but not fatal to a deal being ratified."
2020-12-07T16:50:13Z,politics,Politics,Checks on goods crossing Irish Sea to start from 1 January,"Checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland will be imposed from 1 January with no delays in implementation of Brexit protocols, despite protests from local businesses and farming leaders, the government has confirmed. Local businesses implored EU leaders last month to delay the new trading arrangements, saying they were being given weeks to prepare for a new system that would normally take up to 18 months. But the Cabinet Office confirmed after a meeting between Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, in Brussels on Monday that calls for a delay to the commencement had been rejected. “There will be no grace period on the Northern Ireland protocol,” the Cabinet Office said. Businesses had argued that the rest of the country was being given six months to get used to the changes, with new customs and standards checks in Dover and other ports being phased in over three stages between January and July. They said they were like the “rope in a tug of war” between the UK and the EU and warned of a “huge black hole” in information and a “disconnect” with Westminster and Brussels over the reality of Brexit checks beginning in just 24 days’ time. The head of the Ulster Farmers’ Union said it was only now sinking in that British businesses wanting to sell goods such as farm machinery needed to get special trading numbers, known as EORI numbers, that were specifically for Northern Ireland. And last week it emerged that four in 10 food suppliers said they would pause or reduce supply of produce to Northern Ireland because of the checks, which kick in whether or not there is a deal. The Cabinet Office said “further measures to support agrifood traders will be announced shortly” and that it was “working to resolve all outstanding issues for supermarkets and other traders through the joint committee”. More than 30 business and civic society leaders issued a statement on Monday urging the EU and the UK to conclude a trade deal, saying “a no-deal outcome would place NI under unbearable and unnecessary strain at a time of crisis”. They reaffirmed their commitment to the protocol, but said they had “neither the technical detail nor the time to be ready” for 1 January. Stephen Farry, an Alliance party MP, asked the government again on Monday to ensure that the UK and the EU considered a grace period, telling Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, that businesses “simply don’t have the time any longer to prepare for 1 January”.
Before his meeting with Gove on Monday, Šefčovič said the UK-EU joint committee, which was set up to implement January’s withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, was “working hard to make sure it is fully operational as of 1 January 2021”. At the same time, the government announced that it would be prepared to drop the controversial Brexit clauses from the internal market bill if solutions in relation to free flow of trade with Northern Ireland were agreed. Theresa May’s Europe adviser, Raoul Ruparel, said the incendiary clauses were deployed to create leverage in the trade talks, designed to demonstrate to the EU the negative consequences of a no-deal scenario. • This article was amended on 8 December 2020 to clarify that the reference to there being “no grace period on the Northern Ireland Protocol” was a direct quote from a Cabinet Office spokesperson."
2020-12-07T14:59:48Z,politics,Politics,"Last-minute Brexit deal vital for UK economy, government told","Business leaders and trade unions have urged the government to strike a last-minute Brexit agreement as they warned that the UK economy is ill equipped for a disruptive no-deal scenario. With talks between Boris Johnson’s government and Brussels on a knife-edge, the warnings from leaders in business and industry came as the pound slid on the global currency markets on fears that talks could end this week without a deal. Sterling dropped by two cents against the US dollar to $1.323 on Monday morning as negotiators began last-ditch efforts to strike an agreement before the end of the Brexit transition period at 11pm on 31 December, when UK access to the customs union and single market is set to expire. The pound later recovered some ground but was still down more than a cent at $1.3332. Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said reaching a deal was critical for protecting farmers’ access to the EU, which is the UK’s biggest market, where 70% of agricultural food exports are sold. “It is critically important that both the UK and EU continue to negotiate on a free trade agreement and prioritise securing a tariff-free, quota-free deal as soon as possible,” she said. “There will be significant disruption for British food and farming if there is no deal at the end of the transition period.” Company bosses said there were still big outstanding issues. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said industry would never have foreseen it would be in this position, with manufacturing companies still unable in very large part to prepare. The lack of clarity over a deal could cause chaos within weeks, he added. “The sector now faces the unenvious choice of a catastrophic no deal or a last-minute deal, which will still cause damage to large parts of the sector and threaten jobs and competitiveness. At the very least we need both sides to come to an agreement which will provide at least some certainty and a starting point for industry in the UK and across Europe.” Figures from the Bank of England indicated as few as 6% of companies are fully prepared for the end of the Brexit transition, from a survey of more than 3,000 company bosses published last week. It said as many as 62% of firms are “as ready as they can be”, but business groups said most companies did not know what they were planning for because the details of the new trading relationship have been left until the last minute, preventing them from taking the necessary steps to adjust before Brexit. The head of HMRC, Jim Harra, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that the UK’s readiness for Brexit had improved from the government’s “reasonable worst case scenario” published in September. However, more work needed to be done by both the UK and the EU to prepare. Answering questions from the Labour MP Rushanara Ali, the chief executive of HMRC said: “We keep monitoring it. We will have to be very observant and flexible in the moment [after 31 December]. The latest information is that readiness has improved beyond the reasonable worst case that the government announced several months ago and therefore disruption should be less than that reasonable worst case.” “There can be localised affects, there can be affects on particular routes, there can be affects on particular sectors. I think we’ll have to continue supporting businesses through 1 January and beyond to manage this.” The government’s reasonable-worst case scenario, published in September, involved queues of 7,000 lorries in Kent and two-day delays to cross into the EU. Harra said the UK planned to relax import controls until July, which would help, but that the EU had not reciprocated – raising the prospect of delays.
Harra said that even with a Brexit deal, companies would face additional costs of up to £7.5bn from the administrative burden of filling in customs forms. Firms would need to file as much as 265 million forms, compared with about 54 million per year under EU membership. Businesses still needed key details about tariff rates and rules of origin, while as many as eight major UK ports were not ready to use new IT systems built for processing cross-border vehicle movements, Harra added. “The level of confidence that they and their carriers will be ready to use it on day one is not where we want it to be,” he said."
2020-12-07T14:53:19Z,politics,Politics,What is the ratchet clause and could it sink the Brexit talks?,"For Downing Street, it is a “ratchet” clause. In Brussels the proposal is said to be about “evolution” – a clause in the Brexit treaty that will ensure that as one side develops their environmental, labour and social standards, the other cannot sit tight and enjoy competitive advantages without consequence. On Wednesday Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel said it was the biggest obstacle to a trade deal. What would this clause do? There is agreement on “non-regression” clauses, which would ensure that neither side can undercut a common baseline of standards after the transition period ends on 31 December. But Brussels wants to go further. As the EU develops its rulebook on working conditions or the environment, for example, it is seeking a mechanism to ensure that European businesses are not left at an economic disadvantage if Britain fails to step up its own regulations. As time goes by, the minimum standards protected by non-regression will inevitably become obsolete. They will, the logic goes, need to be upgraded and it should be possible for either side to propose a revision when the time comes. There should be a forum for discussion, it is argued, and a system for dispute resolution, possibly through independent arbitration. If one side drags its feet in agreeing to an upgrade, the EU wants recourse to complain and be given licence to counter the damage to its economic actors. Why is this contentious? The UK says this poses a threat to its sovereign right to make its own standards from 1 January. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, claims that fear of countermeasures could lead to Britain being dragged into following EU policy. The impact of the corrective measures would be asymmetric. If the UK seeks to punish the EU with tariffs, it would be bad for some member states, depending on the products targeted, but they can share the pain around. If the EU puts tariffs on the UK, it could be disastrous as Britain is on its own. Officials in Brussels suspect there is another motivation behind the UK’s scepticism: a future Labour government could agree to upgrades in standards that a future Conservative administration would be powerless to peel back. Once the clause has ratcheted up a policy, there is no way to ratchet down. Downing Street has offered an alternative: a review of the baseline standards after a number years, potentially four. At that point the EU could apply tariffs on certain British goods to correct any imbalance or vice versa. The EU does not like this concept. It fears it will set itself up for an internal row every four years. When the EU applies tariffs, the UK would reciprocate. Every member state has its own interests in terms of products, whether it be French cheese, Italian wine or German cars. To EU eyes, it would also be giving the deal away on the cheap. This is their moment of leverage: a deal with the evolution clause that encourages both sides to do the right thing, or a no-deal exit. Will the row be the cause of a collapse in the negotiation? It is certainly possible. British political considerations are rubbing up against European economic interests in a dangerous way. But on Wednesday the prime minister set up a straw man, ready to be blown down. “Our friends in the EU are currently insisting that if they pass a new law in future with which we in this country do not comply or don’t follow suit, then they want the automatic right to punish us and to retaliate,” he told the Commons. This appears to offer plenty of wriggle room. The EU is not dogmatic about how the clause will work. There is a recognition that it would be democratically unacceptable for either side to have to change a specific law because its trading partner has done so. The EU does not want to lose its autonomy, after all. It is also understood that automatic tariffs are not the way forward. Consultation and arbitration provides a buffer. There is a potential deal to be done."
2020-12-07T14:48:01Z,politics,Politics,"A lexicon of Brexit double-speak: what they say, what it means","A great big Brexit cloud is on the horizon once again, and it’s raining diplomatic double-speak. The back and forth between Brussels and the UK in recent days has left most people bewildered about what is really going on. And no wonder. So here’s a reminder of some of the key phrases beloved by politicians and mandarins – and what they have come to mean. Talks are on a knife-edge A particularly popular one over the weekend. How long anything can stay on such a precariously thin edge is a moot point, but on a knife-edge we remain. Useful as a means of making it sound like a conclusion must surely be close, even as it really indicates that we have been teetering in this position for absolutely ages. They have a maximalist position A sparingly used variation on the cliched “having cake and eating it”, it basically means “they haven’t budged an inch in four years of tortured negotiation” (and neither have we). It could also mean: we are maximally screwed because they want the moon on a stick. There is still time Politicians and negotiators love this one. It really means – we have run out of time. Negotiators who have been there from the start may now feel that the concept of time has lost all meaning, and now find that whenever David Frost says something aggressive about haddock, their mind drifts to childhood trips to the seaside, fish and chips on the pier, salt in the air, seagulls wheeling overhead, Dad’s hand on their shoulder, a prelapsarian world where tariffs on frozen prawns meant nothing. Deal territory We will not be getting off this Eurostar until you remove the tariff on frozen prawns. They tabled last-minute demands They may have done. May alternatively mean: “I listened carefully to everything they had to say since triggering article 50 and if my fingers were in my ears until last week that was simply the will of the British people.” Stumbling block An image which ought to refer to minor impediments which your feet get caught up in, and now suggests something more like the diplomatic equivalent of the Great Wall of China. The principals will be speaking later this evening So far, all eyes have been trained on Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, the chief negotiators. But there’s no way either one of them will want to be blamed for the failure of the talks. So they push the problem “upstairs” – to Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen. We can’t break the deadlock, so now it’s down to you two. Time for calm heads When the diplomats start saying this, it rather suggests all hell has broken loose behind closed doors. Tempers have frayed and the shouting matches have begun. Clarity Lol."
2020-12-07T14:14:50Z,politics,Politics,Murmurs of discontent over Brexit talks could yet become a roar,"In the final throes of Theresa May’s Brexit negotiations, the biggest noises were being made at home, by a squabbling cabinet and a riotous Conservative party. Yet as Boris Johnson’s negotiations reach their endgame, the chatter is strangely muted. First, in the cabinet. While Johnson’s cabinet does not comprise solely hard Brexiters, all were chosen for their roles in the understanding that they would be prepared to back a decision from the prime minister to go for no deal. Some ministers had historically been queasy about a full-scale no deal, including the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and the Welsh secretary, Simon Hart. In total there are eight former remainers in the cabinet, though the top jobs are all held by prominent Brexiters. But over the weekend ministers made it clear privately to the Sunday papers that there was a united resolve to pursue such a path. There is no equivalent of the “Gaukward squad” that existed under May, involving David Gauke, Philip Hammond, Greg Clark and Amber Rudd. James Cleverly, a Foreign Office minister and close ally of Johnson, struck a defiant tone on Monday, saying: “Yes, time is tight, yes it might go right to the wire, and indeed it may well be that we don’t get the deal.” May’s threats of no deal never seemed particularly realistic because of the fierce resistance from the Treasury under the then chancellor, Hammond. Johnson does not face the same resistance from Rishi Sunak. The current chancellor’s most recent spending review did not even mention the impact of Brexit, despite a warning from the governor of the Bank of England that the economic cost of no deal would be bigger in the long term than the damage caused by Covid-19. The most senior minister who is known to have had qualms about the impact of no deal is Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the minister closest to David Frost’s negotiations. Gove’s growing scepticism about no deal was said to have been formed during his time as environment secretary, when he saw the scale of the burden it would put on the sector. But in October Gove said in an article for the Times that he was reconciled to no deal, though he insisted he was “not blithe or blase” about the challenges. That intervention was designed to send a signal to Brussels that everyone who mattered was now entirely onboard. The other challenge could be Brexiter MPs, many of whom have publicly praised Lord Frost’s negotiations. If there are last-minute concessions or compromises by the UK, murmurings of discontent could become a roar very rapidly, as happened after May’s Chequer’s agreement was announced. The red line for the group is total sovereignty – and there are enough in the European Research Group of hard Brexiters to defeat Johnson’s handsome majority. The group receive advice from a group of Brexit-backing lawyers on whether a potential deal would tie the UK to the EU’s rules in any form whatsoever. If it would, they will move against it – and Johnson. Ripe for triggering a rebellion will be any agreement on a so-called “ratchet clause” – which applies when either side develops its environmental, social and labour standards over time, the other side faces consequences such as tariffs on exports should it choose not to follow with equivalent regulations.
Many of those MPs, including the former minister Steve Baker, have also found themselves at odds with Johnson over coronavirus restrictions, so goodwill is in short supply. And many have spoken repeatedly in glowing terms about Sunak, seen as Johnson’s most likely successor. Quieter still are the soft Brexit Tories, vastly depleted in number after more than 20 were dismissed from the party by Johnson last year and more decided not to stand in 2019. Those who remain, including Clark and the former ministers Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine and Huw Merriman, are pretty much resigned to the hardest of Brexits after the 2019 election result. In the end it could be Labour that saves Johnson’s blushes on a deal, with Keir Starmer minded to whip his MPs to vote for any deal to avoid a no-deal scenario. Should this be so, Johnson may have more room for any last-minute concessions, knowing he will pass whatever deal he secures."
2020-12-07T14:04:24Z,politics,Politics,What happens if the UK and EU fail to agree a Brexit deal?,"Fears that the UK and the EU will not agree a trade deal were fuelled by Michel Barnier on Monday when he told envoys in Brussels that he “cannot guarantee” an agreement. Although hopes have been raised about a breakthrough on fishing, his words caused a drop in sterling and give a glimpse of the volatility that can be expected in the event of no deal. What happens if there is no agreement? The political fallout will be intense domestically and internationally. The UK’s economy, already reeling from the pandemic, will be dealt another shock with tariffs on imports and exports introduced from 1 January. It has been said frequently that a no-deal Brexit would represent a failure of politics, and it is likely that it would damage relations between the UK and the EU for some time. The EU has said the notion that it would just resume talks next year is “dangerous thinking”. A Cabinet Office document leaked to the Guardian outlined the devastation of the worst-case no-deal scenario. “The likelihood of a systemic economic crisis has increased and will have major impacts on disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade/commerce and market stability, and security decisions/capability improvements in the context of prosperity,” it said. What changes would there be to trading relations? Trade barriers in the form of customs and regulatory checks will come in, as the government has already decided the UK is leaving the EU customs union and single market. No deal would mean tariffs and quotas on imports and exports would increase prices of cars by 10% and some foodstuffs, such as cheese and beef, by 50% or more. What about the impact on the economy? The Office for Budget Responsibility last week warned that industries such as manufacturing, financial services and agriculture would be hammered by no deal, which would wipe 2% off the UK’s economic output on top of the hit caused by Covid. A report on Friday by the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance found that seven in 10 firms “expect a no-deal Brexit to negatively impact their business”. “New data on how businesses are preparing for Brexit, while simultaneously coping with the largest economic shock for a century, suggests that only 59% of UK businesses consider themselves to be at least ‘somewhat prepared’ for a no-deal Brexit,” it concluded. “The consequences of no deal are severe and the spread of the pandemic has only increased the importance of agreeing a deal,” they added. Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland protocol, which mandates that the region follows EU rules on customs and standards, kicks in deal or no deal. However, in a no-deal situation the UK government has threatened to disapply the protocol and remove the barriers. This would poison relations with the Irish government and the EU because of the perceived risk to the invisible border with the Republic of Ireland. Fishing The UK would have control over its waters and would be entitled to block access from EU fishing vessels.
However, the Cabinet Office says in the worst-case scenario, “EU and UK fishers could clash over the lost access to historic fishing grounds” with blockades at French ports including Boulogne, where much British fish is processed. Delays of one to two days could result in value loss of 60% of fresh crab and live/fresh scallop exports. Food prices An estimated 30% of food eaten in the UK is imported from the EU, according to the Cabinet Office, with 10% coming across the Channel. Prices would be affected by tariffs, sterling depreciation and supply chain disruption. Cabinet Office analysis suggests prices could increase across the board by 3-5% as a result of tariffs on imports from the EU. “Lower-income households are more exposed to food price rises: around a 10th of expenditure is on food and non-alcoholic drinks for the average UK household; the equivalent figure is around 15% for the poorest 20%. Lower-income households also tend to have less ability to ‘trade down’, probably because they are already purchasing cheaper products,” says the analysis. Tourist and business travel Tourist visas for travel to Europe could be imposed and business travel, even to meetings in European capitals, conferences or exhibitions, would require significant paperwork and advance notification. The Cabinet Office document had this warning: “UK nationals travelling to the EU after the end of the transition period will be treated as third-country nationals (TCN). They will face additional checks at Schengen border, leading to significant delays. TCN visa requirements and work permits will adversely impact business mobility, as would the lack of social security coordination in a non-negotiated outcome.”
Aviation and haulage The EU would make time-limited unilateral measures to allow planes to continue flying and trucks moving goods to and from the UK. There could be severe disruption nonetheless. In a no-deal scenario, truckers would need special permits and the transport minister Rachel Maclean recently admitted that the UK has only a fraction of the permits needed for the 39,000 trucks involved in cross-border transport. “The UK has up to 1,668 annual and 5,040 short-term permits available for 2021,” she said. Supply chains The government has already warned of queues of up to 7,000 lorries in Kent in the event of a deal. Disruption to supplies would be greater in the event of no deal. Medicines The government has secured more than £80m in ferry capacity as a no-deal contingency for the supply of medicines and other high-priority goods. Science and Erasmus No deal would end the UK’s participation in the EU’s flagship £80bn Horizon Europe programme and the educational exchange programme, hitting university research heavily. Data A data deal is needed to enable businesses to continue trading online and support businesses that rely on cross-border data exchange, such as financial services, medical and security collaboration, hospitality and transport. Security and policing No deal would end decades of joint law enforcement, including the UK’s departure from the European arrest warrant and European programmes involving live passenger data exchanges critical in criminal and counter-terror operations, as well as programmes sharing police alerts on missing persons, stolen goods, DNA and fingerprint data."
2020-12-07T12:47:01Z,politics,Politics,Michel Barnier says Brexit talks will not go beyond Wednesday,"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has set a new deadline for the Brexit negotiations, warning that the talks will not go beyond Wednesday. During briefings to MEPs and EU ambassadors in Brussels, Barnier said the negotiation was “not far from the very endgame”, and talks are expected to continue into midweek but no further. Both sides will need time to ratify any agreement, and Downing Street has said it would hold a vote on new legislation overriding the withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, a move that would be seen in Brussels as the end point. A senior EU diplomat said: “The outcome is still uncertain, it can still go both ways. The EU is ready to go the extra mile to agree on a fair, sustainable and balanced deal for citizens in the EU and UK. It is for the UK to choose between such a positive outcome or a no-deal outcome.” The focus of the negotiation remains on maintaining fair competition over time, EU access to British fishing waters, and a system of dispute resolution if the terms of the treaty are breached. EU leaders will meet on Thursday, when they could sign off on an agreement or trigger their preparations for a no-deal outcome, including temporary legislation to keep planes in the air. Senior diplomats in Brussels were predicting a difficult phone call between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Monday evening, the second such call in a matter of days. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: “Having heard from Michel Barnier this morning, really the news is very downbeat. I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today.” Johnson’s official spokesman said: “We are clearly in the final stages now. But we will continue to negotiate. “We’ve been clear … our negotiating team are over there with the aim of reaching an agreement. And that’s what we’ll continue to work on. “Our team is in Brussels now, continuing to negotiate. Our aim is to reach an FTA and that’s what we’re working towards,” he said. He reiterated Johnson’s declaration the country would “continue to prosper” and thrive in the event of no deal. Progress on the issues of EU fleets access to British fishing waters, as reported by the Guardian, was upended late on Sunday night when David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, tabled new demands about the ownership of vessels in British seas. Under the proposals, any vessels majority-owned or staffed by EU nationals would not be allowed to sail under the UK flag, sources in Brussels said. Vessels currently need only an “economic link” to the UK, such as landing more than half their catch at British ports or having majority British crews. Companies based in Iceland, Spain and the Netherlands fished 55% of the UK’s fishing quota in 2019, according to research published this year. EU sources had said the two sides were close to a deal earlier in the day, but Barnier quelled any optimism, telling ambassadors on Monday morning the negotiation was “difficult” as he explained the new British demand. One senior EU diplomat said: “This has really caused a lot of problems. A paper was handed over late on Sunday night. This is serious.” Barnier said there also remained differences over quota numbers and the UK’s intention to block access to the six- to 12-mile zone, seas in which French and Belgian fleets in particular have fished for centuries. “That is worrying at this stage in the negotiation,” he said. Barnier said the issue of “non-regression” from current standards had progressed well but common ground had still not been found on the EU’s demand for a mechanism to ensure a baseline of minimum environmental, social and labour standards raises on both sides over time. The issue was fast becoming the biggest obstacle to a deal, EU diplomats said. Barnier told ambassadors that he was “optimistic” that an agreement would fall into place on dispute resolution. Downing Street was yet to agree to provisions that would allow for one side to suspend parts of the deal, known as a “cross suspension clause”, Barnier said. He added that he believed there was a way forward."
2020-12-07T12:30:22Z,politics,Politics,'Boris Johnson's lustre has faded': European media dissect painful Brexit talks,"For more than four years now, European media and commentators have said, the interminable Brexit saga – the endless stop-start, the succession of “crunch moments” – has been mere choreography, a bit of background drama to prove to voters on both sides that the negotiations were tough. Now, though, it is getting beyond a joke – and one side is mainly to blame, according to some. “What can the negotiators do in the coming days that they haven’t tried long ago?” asked Germany’s Handlesblatt. “The main culprit is undoubtedly Boris Johnson.” The British prime minister, the paper said, “demands absolute British sovereignty. This position is untenable. Every trade agreement presupposes a certain waiver of sovereignty, and every day Johnson insists makes it more difficult to give in”. The only hope for a successful outcome, it concluded, was that Johnson “cannot really be interested in a no deal. Because, according to his own government’s forecast, this would permanently depress UK growth by two additional percentage points”. For Die Welt, Johnson has “always insisted that Britain would not have to make any painful compromises if it left the EU. He rejected an extension of the transition period. He insists Britain will thrive with a no deal. It is difficult for him now to make the concessions necessary for a deal”. Walking away from the talks was “not an option” for the Europeans, agreed the Netherlands’ NRC Handelsblad, even if the EU’s negotiator, Michel Barnier, was now “millimeters away from what is acceptable to member states. The EU has reached its pain threshold with regard to the concessions it can make”. But it is Johnson who faces the more difficult decisions, the paper says. “The consequences of failure are greater. He is under too much pressure from the Brexiteers within his own group. Sovereignty is a sacred concept to them. Cede too much and they will not hesitate to withdraw their support.” But at the same, it added, “Johnson will also know that no deal will make his political life more difficult. He will have to answer for an even bigger economic downturn, after saying for years that a deal was a piece of cake. And that could increase support for independence in Scotland and fuel renewed instability in Northern Ireland.”. France’s Libération said Brexit had already “beaten all the popes in history”, with three years elapsing between the death of Clement IV in 1268 and the arrival of Gregory X in 1271. “The Brexit logs have been in the chimney for 1,625 days, since 23 June, and there is still no sign of white smoke,” the paper said. Libération did not dare predict the outcome of the talks. “The negotiators are armed with instructions on possible compromises – on fisheries, the level playing field, dispute arbitration. On the extent of those compromises will depend the outcome of these negotiations. But one thing is clear: despite British accusations that France is blocking progress, the European commission continues to speak with one voice.”
A lack of European trust in the British government did not help, said Le Monde. Should there be no deal, it said, “the EU expects the UK to respect its engagements in the withdrawal agreement. But Johnson is threatening to reintroduce his internal market bill, containing clauses that violate that divorce treaty”. Spain’s El País was even harsher on the prime minister. “The final chapter of Boris Johnson’s career has yet to be written, but just a year after his landslide election victory in December 2019, the lustre of the UK’s most popular politician in decades has already faded,” the paper said. “Johnson is gambling his medium-term future on three things that are beyond his control: the success of the coronavirus vaccine, an optimistic economic bounce, and the willingness of Brussels to ignore all his rudeness and finally agree a Brexit deal before the end of the year.” The Irish Times was not hopeful. “For the EU, protecting the single market from unfair competition has always been a central aim,” it said. “But for Johnson, any deal that appears to require Britain to shadow EU rules is unacceptable, which is why he sought such a narrow deal rather than one more valuable to the British economy. “Johnson needs this week’s negotiations to end in a deal. The only question is how expensive he has made it for himself – and whether it is a price he can afford to pay.”"
2020-12-06T22:00:20Z,politics,Politics,"With time close to running out, Brexit talks reach crunch stage","It seems like deja vu, yet another crunch week with talks centring on three issues: fisheries, fair competition and governance. But with key meeting of EU leaders at a council summit on Thursday, most are agreed there are only three or four days left to seal an agreement. “If the ambience warms up again and great progress is made, and it is just about sorting out the detail, then you can always find more time,” environment secretary George Eustice told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC on Sunday.
“But unless we can resolve these quite fundamental divergences at the moment then we are going to have to take a position in the next few days,” he added. Is there appetite for no deal? While most believe no deal will be catastrophic for both sides, the threat of it remains, even as a strong negotiating tactic at the very least. The Sunday Times reported 13 cabinet ministers including eight remainers as ready to support no deal. Sources confirmed “there will be very little push back” from the cabinet if Boris Johnson opted for no deal and there were reports that Steve Baker, who led the rebellion against Theresa May’s deal to remain in the customs union, is willing to lead opposition if hard Brexiters feel betrayed.
The Centre for Brexit Policy, supported by one of Baker’s allies Owen Paterson, is circulating a “Brexit deal scorecard” to help MPs decide if any deal keeps manifesto promises. Latest on fishing arguments A major breakthrough on Sunday evening looks as if all that remains is political approval – which is not guaranteed with the French threatening to veto any deal. Details are not yet known but agreement will have rested on quotas, access and a transition period for the sector. The EU wants a deal for 10 years. Eustice told the BBC the UK was “open” to a multi-annual agreement “maybe running for three years”. Latest on level playing field
Level playing field issues have also to be resolved, though Theresa May’s former special adviser on Europe, Raoul Ruparel, noted recently that both sides had “adopted slightly ridiculous hard-line ideological positions” and the evolution of ratchet clauses designed to ensure a narrow gap between standards on workers rights and environmental rights was solvable as the original EU proposal allowed UK a veto on any changes to future alignment. Latest on dispute resolution But there are also issues over dispute resolution. While an independent arbitration process is expected, the UK has protested that Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, tabled legal text giving the EU the right to “lightning tariffs” immediately imposed on the transgressor. This has been described as a political resolution for disputes, but comes with expensive risks of “whack-a-mole” trade wars, according to Cambridge law professor Catherine Barnard."
2020-12-06T20:23:07Z,politics,Politics,Breakthrough on fishing rights as Brexit talks hang in the balance,"A major breakthrough has been made in Brexit negotiations on the rights of European fleets to fish in UK waters, EU sources said last night, leaving a Franco-German demand that Britain follow EU laws as the final hurdle to a historic trade and security deal. Sources in Brussels said the two sides had all but finalised terms on the level of access for EU boats to seas within the UK’s 200-mile exclusive economic zone, with a transition period for phasing in changes understood to be between five and seven years. The talks are now going to the wire on the so-called “ratchet clause” under which the UK government would have to follow EU environmental, social and labour standards as they develop over time or face tariffs on British exports. In an unwelcome development for Boris Johnson, France and Germany have instructed the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that they are united on the need for the UK to face consequences over future divergence from the EU rulebook as policy changes. The EU is proposing that it should have the power to unilaterally hit British exports with tariffs in the event that Whitehall fails to follow Brussels’ upgrades to its regulations. UK sources said that the negotiations would collapse unless that demand was dropped within the next 48 hours. British negotiators are instead offering to review the deal in an unspecified number of years to allow the terms of trade to be changed if there is significant divergence. A UK government source close to the negotiations said: “There won’t be any agreement if the EU don’t recognise reality. We’ll only keep talking if there is some movement and we think there’s any point”. Boris Johnson will talk to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Monday evening, in what EU sources said was a major moment in the troubled talks. The talks resumed in Brussels on Sunday after Johnson and Von der Leyen agreed there was reason to believe a deal was still possible during a phone call on Saturday evening. The negotiation had been paused by the two chief negotiators – David Frost and Barnier – on Friday after they were unable to bridge the gaps between the sides on rules to ensure fair competition, fishing access in UK waters and a system for dispute resolution. “We’re going to be working very hard to try to get a deal,” Frost told reporters as he arrived at Brussels-Midi train station on Sunday morning. “We’re going to see what happens in negotiations today and we will be looking forward to meeting our European colleagues later this afternoon.” It is understood that the call between Johnson and Von der Leyen did not come to any political fix on the outstanding issues, but that the prime minister successfully rammed home his political difficulties in selling a deal that bound Britain to Brussels. Johnson will have to sell the deal to the Brexit hardliners of the European Research Group. On Sunday its deputy chair, David Jones, said the ERG had “huge confidence in David Frost and the team,” and the remaining sticking points appeared to be “an internal matter for the EU”. Sources on both sides of the negotiation said that the issue of the “ratchet clause” was now the pressing issue, with EU rights to catches in British fishing waters all but settled. Neither side were willing to provide details of the agreement given the sensitivity of the negotiation. On Sunday night a government source denied there had been any breakthrough on fisheries, saying: “Nothing new has been achieved on this today.” Sources said there was also good progress on Northern Ireland with an announcement by the UK-EU joint committee being prepared on easements aimed at “minimising” checks on food produce going from Great Britain to the region following protests from businesses including Sainsbury’s. However, they said it was unlikely the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol on 1 January could be delayed as requested by local business and farming interests, whether there is a deal or not, saying “there is little scope” around this issue. In a complicated game of Brexit chess the NI moves will depend on the language used by the government about the reintroduction of the internal market bill, on Monday, and the finance bill, on Wednesday, both of which include incendiary clauses to disregard the Northern Ireland protocol. On Sunday, France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, repeated the threat of a French veto amid divisions among the 27 member states over the necessity of a deal this year, but also hinted at a compromise on the thorniest issue. “The British want access to the single European market without constraints for their social, environmental or health standards, which is unacceptable,” he said. “For our part, we are ready to put in place a system in which a divergence of standards would be allowed but beyond which corrective measures would be taken. “The British tell us that this is unfair because other third countries do not have these same constraints, such as Canada. But we have to realise that the UK will be our major trading partner outside the EU tomorrow. There is 10 times as much trade between the EU and UK than with Canada. It is therefore normal to seek guarantees that they will not engage in unacceptable dumping.” It is understood that Frost was made aware of the comments during the talks in the European commission Berlaymont headquarters. Sources said that the concession over divergence to some degree was welcome. Negotiators are trying to craft provisions that both recognise that the UK is free to make its own rules but that also protect the single market from goods produced with a lower cost base due to differences in regulations. Downing Street fears that allowing the EU to unilaterally put tariffs on British goods where there is divergence will put an inappropriate onus on policymakers in Whitehall to follow Brussels’ lead. The UK has also yet to agree to non-regression over current standards because of differences about the definition of the “common high standards” and means of correction where an agreement is breached. Efforts are under way to find a compromise but divisions have emerged between countries such as Germany and Ireland, who believe it is vital to sign a deal this year, and the Élysée Palace. Macron is of the opinion that it might be better to restart talks in 2021 than rush into a hasty agreement that will set European businesses back in decades to come.
“The British tell us that they would only need 24 hours to do this [ratify], but we must also think about the time that will be needed to explain this agreement to our companies,” Beaune said. “So in the coming days, we will have to decide either to continue to negotiate or go ahead with no deal. Because if this is the case, it is better to know now than at Christmas.” “Within the EU27 there are different sensitivities – it would be naive to deny it,” he added. “We will not give in to time pressure. As for the [German] chancellor [Angela Merkel], she wants a deal, but she also defends our demands – and she knows the European market well enough to guess how the German economy would suffer from a bad deal.” EU sources said Germany had in the past 24 hours agreed to support France’s position on fair competition, after Paris’s stance on fishing access was softened. The UK government’s plans to table legislation on Tuesday that would again break international law by again overriding clauses in the withdrawal agreement on tariffs on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is seen as a natural deadline for a deal in Brussels. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the trade and security deal running to more than 600 pages of legal text was “97% or 98%” adding that “we are more likely to get a deal than not”."
2020-12-06T19:30:55Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May's negotiator on EU tactics and her worst Brexit day,"Raoul Ruparel was Theresa May’s special adviser on Europe during the first round of Brexit negotiations. Here he talks negotiating tactics, strategies, how exhaustion in the room will play out and how the former prime minister recovered from the lowest point in negotiations when she was humiliated in Salzburg. How much time is left? “Both sides have got themselves into an ideological corner and are struggling to get out,” he says. If a deal is not struck by 11 December time is probably up. “If it goes past the council meeting on Thursday, if you can’t get anything to unlock the impasse by then, you might have a few days beyond but if it goes into December 14, 15, 16, it’s hard to see it being salvaged.” The legal text does not have to be finalised by Thursday but the outline breakthrough solution does. What will negotiators be doing at the 11th hour? “Ultimately, the red lines and the constraints are set up a level above so you sort of do the best with the framework and working with it. “There will be some frustration, having to go this route yet again. They’ve been going round in circles on these issues for months. But we also have to remember at this stage, the people in the room are united in the aim of wanting to land a deal and the difficulties tend to be with people outside the room. That makes the atmosphere slightly, slightly more positive for everyone. So while I think the officials will be tired frustrated, quite tense and feeling the pressure, they are ultimately working towards a common goal. “There will be pluses and minuses. They’ve been in the weeds of this stuff for a year and that means you’re obviously very attached to your negotiating position and it’s sometimes hard to step back and see the bigger picture. But equally because you are exhausted, you want to get this done.” What was the worst moment of the first round? The nadir was when Theresa May was left fighting to save her Chequers Brexit plan and with it her authority as prime minister after she was ambushed at the end of the Salzburg summit in 2018 when EU leaders unexpectedly declared that her proposals would not work. “I think both sides misread the other side. And, therefore, it was quite a low point in terms of the gap and obviously because it was at the highest level it was quite a serious.” Two days later a clearly enraged May made a televised statement demanding the EU “show us some respect”, saying the UK could not accept a simple brushing aside by Donald Tusk. It proved the recovery point. “I think both sides realised that this had gone wrong, and the EU realised they had gone too far as well, so there was a dialling back and rapprochement.”
Tactics – bring up old stuff. One negotiation tactic used in trade talks is “dredging up old stuff” to try to wear the other side down on other points where you don’t want a compromise. This is exactly what Downing Street believe the EU did last week when it protested it had introduced new elements to the negotiation table at the 11th hour. “I don’t know the exact details but I am told the reports are accurate that they reintroduced issues on the level playing field they thought was settled as a way of getting leverage somewhere else,” says Ruparel. It forces the other side, the UK, to reopen the chapter, “bring out the old arguments explaining why this or that can’t happen and demolish their position”. In this scenario, the hope of the EU would be once it agrees the UK was right all along, it will come across as having conceded, making the UK feeling obliged to compromise on something else. “We’ve seen them deployed before in terms of dredging up old things,” says Ruparel.
Can the deal be unlocked? “I think it’s rare that brand new ideas are brought to the table but they will be going back and looking at stuff previously discounted and might try again.” The Irish border was an example of this. A border down the Irish Sea was mooted at the outset of the first phase but “very quickly shelved” but was dusted down at the 11th hour by Boris Johnson who was able to succeed because it was “crunch time” but also because he had momentum and support on the backbenches. “If it was deployed at any other time in negotiations it probably wouldn’t have worked. It just happened to be the right answer at the right time,” says Ruparel. Establishing leverage and communications weapons Briefing politicians and the public is critical in establishing support for positions in negotiations, he says. “The EU were much more effective than us” in the first round, briefing diplomats and holding regular press conferences and briefings for interest groups, helping establish their position as the orthodoxy in public discourse. The Irish backstop controversy was a case in point, he says. The EU got their position out not just in communications but in their legal text long before the UK had fully rehearsed the arguments. “It was effective. They were very good at putting their hardline unreasonable positions early, making it difficult to move them off their positions.”
“The UK side has been better in this stage in trying to counter that and being on the front foot on its positions,” he says. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, standing up in the House of Commons declaring the UK was prepared to breach international law with the internal market bill is an example of this. While it “also has its side-effects in terms of undermining trust”, said Ruparel, “it’s clearly something that they feel generates leverage for them by demonstrating the potential negatives of no deal and difficulties there might be for the EU side” in respect of Northern Ireland."
2020-12-06T18:03:07Z,politics,Politics,Ministers face double defeat in Lords over China trading links,"Ministers face a double defeat in the Lords over Britain’s trading links with China as peers prepare to back a cross-party move to block trade agreements with any country deemed by the UK high court to be committing genocide. The manoeuvre is in addition to Labour-led plans in the upper house to require a government human rights risk assessment before backing a Brexit trade deal. The cross-party plan would be one of the first times that the UK courts would have role in assessing if genocide has been committed. It has the support of the Labour human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat campaigner David Alton and the former Tory cabinet minister Michael Forsyth. The novel procedure is due to be debated as an amendment to the trade bill in the Lords on Monday, and if passed the measure already has strong Conservative backbench support in the Commons, including from the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith. The amendment is designed to show there can be a UK-based remedy to act against genocide, and its drafters see it in the first instance as a practical weapon to combat the human rights abuses allegedly committed by the Chinese government against the Uighur people in Xinjiang. The government opposes the proposal, and although the Labour frontbench in the Lords has tabled its alternative way to inject human rights considerations into all preferential trade agreements, it says it does not regard the two measures as mutually exclusive and it will also back the Kennedy proposal. Advocates of the cross-party proposal at one point feared Labour was putting up its amendment as an alternative. Labour regards its proposal as broader because it concerns all human rights abuses, not just genocide. In a letter to fellow peers explaining the cross-party amendment, Lady Kennedy said it would prevent the UK “from pursuing trade deals with genocidal states, and creates a mechanism for the preliminary determination of genocide through the UK courts. “This is a novel and ingenious way of solving the inertia around genocide determination while remaining consistent with long-standing UK policy: that genocide determination is a legal matter for judges, not politicians. The amendment only applies to trade deals, and does not cancel out the need for a United Nations investigation, however remote such a prospect might be.” She argues peers have a moral duty to act. In the letter she points out that Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who prosecuted the Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milošević in the Hague, supports the measure. Kennedy’s letter has prestigious support of Alf Dubs, Dawn Primarolo, Ken Clarke, Paul Boateng, Janet Royall, Tessa Blackstone, and Valerie Amos. It also has the backing of the all-party parliamentary group on the Uighurs, led by Yasmin Qureshi MP, together with Labour members of the all-party group on the prevention of genocide. The Labour frontbench amendment calls for the Department for International Trade to undertake risk assessments to determine if the trade agreement would be compliant with the UK’s international obligations, including if there have been serious violations of a wider range of human rights, including torture and threats to the right to life and freedom from slavery. Critics of the Labour measure say that although it is an advance, it lacks teeth."
2020-12-06T17:24:16Z,politics,Politics,Even dedicated Brexit-watchers reluctant to call deal or no deal,"The carefully staged photo of Boris Johnson’s Saturday phone call to Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, showed him gesturing forcefully into the ether in the moody half-light, keeping negotiations alive to the last. At some point over the next 48 hours or so, however, the talking will have to stop. The British prime minister must then make the momentous decision about whether to walk away or not. Even the most dedicated Brexit-watchers are reluctant to call it. “Half the politics points towards a deal, half the politics doesn’t,” said Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. In the short term, signing on the dotted line would allow Johnson to make good on his promise to the British people to “get Brexit done”, closing down the space for Keir Starmer’s Labour party to attack him for failing on his own terms. It could also expose Labour’s divisions, as has already been the case in recent days. Starmer is minded to support a deal, but a growing number of backbenchers are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of joining the Tories in the voting lobbies.
With 2021 set to be a significant year for Britain’s role on the world stage, when it chairs the G7 and hosts the Cop26 climate summit, a deal would also help to wipe the slate clean, rather than saddling the UK with a reputation as an unreliable negotiating partner. The additional economic cost of a no-deal Brexit is huge, according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It would knock an additional 2% off GDP in 2021 as the UK struggles to bounce back from the Covid recession, and add £12bn to public borrowing in 2021-22 at a time when the Treasury is already grappling with the costs of the pandemic. Yet the most committed Brexiters, wary of economic models, have rarely been swayed by a few percentage points either way, believing something more fundamental is at stake. The next few weeks promise significant disruption, deal or no deal, as traders and travellers adapt to a dramatically different relationship with our neighbours. Ministers may fear being more squarely landed with the consequences if they have claimed negotiating success.
Johnson will also be acutely aware of the risk that his erstwhile supporters cry betrayal, at a time when the Tory parliamentary party is already restive about the missteps that have plagued his handling of the pandemic. His leadership launch in the plush surroundings of Carlton House Terrace, Westminster, in June 2019 was bristling with Spartans, as the die-hard Brexiters called themselves, and their backing helped to carry him into No 10. With key figures such as Suella Braverman and Jacob Rees-Mogg in his cabinet, the European Research Group (ERG) has been relatively quiescent during Johnson’s premiership. Covid restrictions, rather than fish quotas, have been the biggest flashpoint for backbench dissent, and the ERG has been kept well-briefed on developments in the talks. Downing Street can be in no doubt, however, that if the details of the deal appear to point to continuing alignment with EU rules, Johnson would face a furious backlash from his erstwhile supporters.
They would be unlikely to muster the 55 votes necessary to trigger a leadership challenge, but many of Johnson’s staunchest backers have already deserted him. A well-drilled group of malcontents could make his premiership very difficult just as he hoped to be emerging from the long, lost year of Covid. “Just how rough the ERG would cut up is a big issue,” said Menon. Westminster-watchers would also be keeping a keen eye on Dominic Cummings’ blog, for signs that Johnson’s former chief aide had spotted evidence of a sellout. Ultimately though, the question will be whether the details of the final deal can be squared with Johnson’s own conception of sovereignty. He is notoriously flexible in his political beliefs, but allies insist the idea that the UK must be allowed to diverge from the EU in a range of areas, from animal welfare to labour standards, is the essence of what Brexit means to him. His chief negotiator, David Frost, was chosen because he understands and shares that view. Which way Johnson jumps will depend on the fine details of how the UK will pledge to police its own state aid regime, what recourse the EU will have if the UK diverges in key areas, how disputes will be resolved, and what share of each others’ fish stocks they can land. With the European council gathering on Thursday, the decision cannot be postponed much longer. As Mujtaba Rahman of the consultancy Eurasia Group put it: “There’s a lot of damage and pain that the UK’s experienced as a result of Brexit, and the only tangible benefit as far as he is concerned is the ability to do things differently. He’s grappled with that issue and thought about it for the past four years. The only question is, what price is he willing to pay to achieve that?”"

2020-12-06T14:12:06Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: France hints at compromise with UK over divergence from EU standards,"France will back a trade deal allowing the UK to diverge from EU standards but the bloc should not be time-pressured into agreeing damaging terms in the final hours, France’s European affairs minister has said, as the Brexit negotiations restarted in Brussels. Clément Beaune, a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, repeated the threat of a French veto amid divisions among the 27 member states over the necessity of a deal this year, but hinted at a compromise on the thorniest issue. “The British want access to the single European market without constraints for their social, environmental or health standards, which is unacceptable,” he said. “For our part, we are ready to put in place a system in which a divergence of standards would be allowed but beyond which corrective measures would be taken. “The British tell us that this is unfair because other third countries do not have these same constraints, such as Canada. But we have to realise that the UK will be our major trading partner outside the EU tomorrow. There is 10 times as much trade between the EU and UK than with Canada. It is therefore normal to seek guarantees that they will not engage in unacceptable dumping.” The EU’s demand for a mechanism to ensure the UK is not able to undercut European businesses through diverging from Brussels on environmental, labour and social standards has dogged the negotiations. Downing Street claimed that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, tabled fresh demands last week that would have effectively have forced the UK to align with the EU, a claim dismissed by officials in Brussels. Beaune’s comments highlight the complex compromise that the negotiators are trying to craft: provisions that both recognise that the UK is free to make its own rules but that also protect the single market from goods produced with a lower cost base due to differences in regulations. Downing Street fears that allowing the EU to unilaterally put tariffs on British goods where there is divergence will put an inappropriate onus on policymakers in Whitehall to follow Brussels’ lead. The UK has also yet to agree to non-regression over current standards over differences about the definition of the “common high standards”, and means of correction where an agreement is breached. Efforts are under way to find a compromise but divisions have emerged between countries such as Germany and Ireland, who believe it is vital to sign a deal this year, and the Élysée Palace, where Macron is of the opinion that it might be better to restart talks in 2021 than rush into a hasty agreement that will set European businesses back in decades to come. “The British tell us that they would only need 24 hours to do this [ratify], but we must also think about the time that will be needed to explain this agreement to our companies,” Beaune said. “So in the coming days, we will have to decide either to continue to negotiate or go ahead with no deal. Because if this is the case, it is better to know now than at Christmas.” “Within the EU27 there are different sensitivities – it would be naive to deny it”, he said. “We will not give in to time pressure. We will not accept an agreement at all costs on the pretext that we are getting closer to the deadline. “As for the [German] chancellor [Angela Merkel], she wants a deal, but she also defends our demands – and she knows the European market well enough to guess how the German economy would suffer from a bad deal.” The troubled talks restarted on Sunday after Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, found reason to believe a deal was still possible during a phone call on Sunday evening. The negotiation had been paused by the two chief negotiators – David Frost and Barnier – on Friday after they were unable to bridge the gaps between the sides on rules to ensure fair competition, fishing access in UK waters and a system for dispute resolution. “We’re going to be working very hard to try and get a deal,” Frost told reporters as he arrived at Brussels-Midi train station. “We’re going to see what happens in negotiations today and we will be looking forward to meeting our European colleagues later this afternoon.” Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the trade and security deal running to over 600 pages of legal text was “97 or 98%” adding that “we are more likely to get a deal than not”. The UK environment secretary, George Eustice, said the prime minister would have to “take a position in the next few days” on whether a Brexit deal could be struck. In interviews on Sunday morning, Eustice echoed reports overnight that the cabinet had agreed to back a decision to leave the transition period on 31 December without a trade and security deal. Eustice told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday the government was planning to reinstate parts of the internal market bill that break international law – but also accused the EU of taking a “ludicrous” position on fishing rights that was not consistent with the same laws. He told Ridge talks were “in a very difficult position – there is no point denying that”. “There was some hope early last week progress was being made, and at one point it looked like there might be a breakthrough but then the European Union added a whole load of additional demands after that which caused some problems. “We will continue to work on these negotiations until there is no point doing so any further but there is no point denying that what happened late last week was a setback.” On Sunday morning, unnamed cabinet ministers who had supported remain in the Brexit referendum were quoted in the Sunday Times as giving Boris Johnson their “rock-solid” support if he concluded that no-deal was necessary. One said: “The PM should do what is best. He has total, 100% rock-solid cabinet support.” Another cabinet remainer said: “I’d much rather we had a deal but he’s got a no-deal mandate if that is his judgment.” Eustice told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “We probably are now in the final few days in terms of being able to decide whether there can be an agreement. “If the ambience warms up again and actually great progress is made and it’s just about sorting out the detail you can always find more time, you can always extend. But unless we can resolve these quite fundamental divergences at the moment then we are going to have to take a position in the next few days.” Eustice said the EU’s demands on future fishing rights were “ludicrous” and would mean the bloc would have access to British waters “in perpetuity”. He claimed the industry would be able to handle tariffs imposed under a no-deal scenario but that such tariffs could be unmanageable for farmers, saying: “The main species we export, the levels of tariffs on fish, unlike agriculture actually, are manageable.” He also acknowledged there would be “some impact” on food prices if no trade deal was done. “There will be some impact on prices but the analysis that has been done by some of the economic modellers is that it is quite modest – less than 2% as a result of tariffs,” he said. “It would be higher on some things such as beef and pork but those make up a relatively small proportion of the overall family shop.”"
2020-12-06T06:15:01Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer urged to wait before telling MPs to approve Brexit deal,"Some of Labour’s union backers have urged Keir Starmer to wait before telling Labour MPs to support a Brexit deal, amid growing unease within the party over the leader’s policy. Several sources said Starmer was already set on backing a Brexit deal should it be agreed and return to the Commons for a vote. Some in his team believe the issue is too big for the party to abstain on, and fear opposing the deal would suggest they preferred a no-deal outcome. However, in a conference call with Labour’s affiliated union bosses on Friday, Starmer was urged by some to back away from a decision over the potential vote until the details of any agreement are published and properely analysed. With unease mounting among some MPs and peers, those opposed to supporting a deal are keen to reopen the option of abstaining in any vote. One union insider said any decision to vote for the Brexit deal would hand a campaigning slogan to the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales at next year’s local elections. The pro-Remain Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) led the calls for Starmer to wait before deciding to endorse a deal, but other unions said Labour risked no-deal should it back away from endorsing an agreement. While Unite’s Len McCluskey is understood not to have intervened in the conference call, his union – Labour’s biggest financial backer – is said to be supportive of backing a Brexit deal to show former pro-Leave voters that the party accepts the referendum outcome. Asked about Friday’s call, TSSA’s general secretary Manuel Cortes said: “Until we see the text of a deal – if one is eventually reached – it’s too early to say which way our Labour party should whip its MPs. If we don’t know what’s in it, how can we decide whether to vote for it or not?” Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister, has been talking to Labour MPs, peers and unions for several weeks about the prospect of a Brexit deal vote as part of a concerted effort to keep them on board, but concern is building. There is still opposition to voting in favour of a deal within the shadow cabinet, with even shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said to be torn. Others still unsure are understood to include shadow justice secretary David Lammy and shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry. Several MPs were “really pissed off” by what they saw as a concerted attempt by leadership to marginalise those with doubts about backing a deal, one insider said. Concerns have also emerged among Labour Lords. Former leader Neil Kinnock told fellow peers in a private message: “Johnson’s ‘deal’ will not cover the huge and prolonged NON tariff impediments and costs of Brexit or safeguard the industries, services, communities and people who will be harmed by that reality. If Labour supports the ‘deal’, all our future justified criticisms will be rebuffed by ‘but you voted for this!’ and, because it will be true, it will be lethal. “We must abstain and explain that this is the rational course when faced with a damaging ‘yes’ and a disastrous ‘no’. Johnson will get his ‘deal’ through the Commons anyway and he must OWN the outcome – if we share ownership, we share complicity in the harm to our country (the most vital issue) and we give him a totally unwarranted credibility.” One Labour figure who backed a second referendum said it was a miscalculation by Starmer’s team to think that “the relatively small proportion of former Labour voters who are highly motivated by Brexit will in any way be persuaded to back the party again because it is backing a deal”. They added it was also a mistake to assume the huge number of Remain voters who backed Labour in 2017 have “nowhere else to go”."
2020-12-05T21:35:34Z,politics,Politics,Military planes to fly Covid vaccines in to Britain to avoid ports hit by Brexit,"Tens of millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured in Belgium will be flown to Britain by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit, under contingency plans being developed by the government. Both the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and senior sources at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed to the Observer on Saturday that large consignments would be brought in from 1 January by air if road, rail and sea routes were subject to widely expected delays after that date. Civil servants from the MoD and military planning staff have recently met officials from the government’s vaccine taskforce to discuss the plans, with priority being given to speedy transfer of the doses. “We will do this if necessary. The plans have been discussed,” said a DHSC source. The move shows that ministers are ready for severe disruptions at ports and commercial airports whether or not there is a Brexit deal, and are not prepared to allow the vaccine to be held up in any circumstances.
News of the preparations to fly in vials came as it was announced that Brexit negotiations would resume in Brussels on Sunday after Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed following a telephone conversation that there were still grounds for hope that a deal will be struck in the next few days.
In a joint statement, the leaders said they would talk again on Monday evening, with the two sides searching for a breakthrough with just three weeks until the UK leaves the single market and customs union. “In a phone call today, we welcomed the fact progress has been achieved in many areas,” they said. “Nevertheless, significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. Both sides underlined that no agreement was feasible if these issues were not resolved. “While recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved. We are therefore instructing our chief negotiators to reconvene tomorrow in Brussels. We will speak again on Monday evening.”
A government source close to the talks said: “There is barely any time left and there is no doubt that this process may not end in agreement. “This is the final throw of the dice. There is a fair deal to be done but it will only happen if the EU is willing to respect the fundamental principles of sovereignty and control.” The European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted: “We will see if there is a way forward. Work continues tomorrow.” Theresa May’s former chief of staff Lord Gavin Barwell told BBC Breakfast on Sunday that he believed a deal on a post-Brexit trade agreement was “definitely still possible”, although it would rely on whether or not both sides are “prepared to make the compromises necessary”. “Both sides are going to have to compromise if we’re going to get a deal from this situation,” he said, adding: “We are now 25 days from the end of the transition period and business, both in the UK and in Europe, have no idea on what terms they’re going to be able to trade with their nearest market from January 1. That is a pretty shocking failure.” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, pushed both sides to make the compromises necessary to find agreement. He tweeted: “I welcome the fact that negotiators will resume their discussions on an EU and UK trade deal in Brussels tomorrow. An agreement is in everyone’s best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal.” Rachel Reeves MP, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: “The British people were promised a deal and, with time running out, we urge both sides to get on with reaching an agreement. “We can then focus on the job at hand, which is securing the economy and rebuilding our country from the pandemic.” The main areas of difference remain over the so-called level playing field arrangements to ensure fair business competition, and EU access to UK fishing waters. Sources close to the negotiation said the situation was serious, with the final political issues proving hard to solve. In London, MPs will debate and vote on the controversial internal market bill on Monday . The government is then due on Wednesday to table the finance bill, containing new clauses that override the withdrawal agreement previously struck with the EU, a move that would effectively mark the end of talks. But there is an expectation among senior diplomats that agreement should be found before then, with EU leaders able as a result to sign off on a deal at a virtual summit of EU leaders on Thursday. The cautiously positive outlook in Brussels contrasts with the recent warnings from Downing Street that a deal is hanging in the balance. UK sources on Saturday said Downing Street hoped for more realism from the EU side after Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, was said to have tabled unacceptable proposals on Thursday. It was claimed the proposals on domestic subsidy control and standards would effectively force Westminster to align with the EU rule book. Brussels was also said to have demanded a 10-year pause on any changes to fishing access for European fleets in the UK’s exclusive economic zone. David Frost, the UK negotiator, has offered a three-year transition period.
With or without a deal, businesses will face many extra checks on goods leaving and entering the UK. The prospects of a deal are creating political challenges for both major parties. Leading Conservative Brexiters will be studying any agreement closely for evidence that the UK has given ground on fishing or been tied to the EU’s state aid rules. Many have already rebelled against the government over its coronavirus measures. Some Tory donors who backed Johnson’s bid to become leader over his Brexit stance are also understood to be nervous about his willingness to give ground to the EU in order to secure a deal. UK officials with knowledge of plans to import the vaccines said other ways to transport them would be considered in addition to military planes, including via the express freight service that was set up to carry medicines and medical equipment by road, rail and boat to the UK in 2019, ahead of Brexit. But flying them on military planes would be the fastest and present the least risk of delay, allowing consignments to be flown into military or other airports near centres from where the vaccine could be distributed. Since the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK by regulators last week, 800,000 doses have already been imported via the Channel Tunnel and are being held at secure locations. A total of up to five million doses are expected to come into the country by the end of the year. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Saturday that the vaccine could bring the loosening of restrictions before the end of March. In an interview with the Telegraph, he said he “can’t wait [...] to get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility, not laws set in Parliament”. He added: “There’s no doubt that having the vaccine early... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions, but until then we have got to follow them. Help is on its way.” After 1 January, when the EU transition period ends and delays are expected at borders, another 35 million will be transported to the UK. An MoD source said: “If we need to use military planes to bring them in, we will. If the request is made we will be ready.”"
2020-12-05T18:26:29Z,politics,Politics,Brexit negotiations to restart in Brussels after Johnson call,"Brexit negotiations will resume in Brussels on Sunday after Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed that a trade and security deal was still possible in the immediate days. In a joint statement, the two leaders said they would talk again on Monday evening, with the two sides searching for a breakthrough with just three weeks until the UK leaves the single market and customs union. “In a phone call today on the on-going negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we welcomed the fact that progress has been achieved in many areas,” they said. “Nevertheless, significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved. “Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved. We are therefore instructing our chief negotiators to reconvene tomorrow in Brussels. We will speak again on Monday evening.”
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted: “We will see if there is a way forward. Work continues tomorrow.” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, pushed both sides to make the compromises necessary to find agreement. He tweeted: “I welcome the fact that negotiators will resume their discussions on an EU and UK trade deal in Brussels tomorrow. An agreement is in everyone’s best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal.” Sources close to the negotiation said the situation was serious with the final political issues proving hard to solve. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, and Barnier had said on Friday that they would pause their negotiations in London having failed to find common ground. There was no suggestion that a compromise had been found in the phone call, which ran for about 90 minutes, but sources on both side sounded optimistic that common ground could be found. Leaving King’s Cross for Brussels on Saturday morning Barnier had told reporters: “We keep calm, as always, and if there is still a way, we will see.” EU sources said the negotiations had now come down to big political decisions on the three contentious issues: fisheries, fair competition and dispute resolution. Every other part of the treaty, which is expected to run to more than 600 pages, is in order, it is understood. The European commission president and the prime minister, who is at Chequers, started speaking on the phone shortly after 4.30pm. “The differences are real but they just need a bit more time,” one EU source said. “I can imagine they will continue talking to Tuesday.” The government is due to table the finance bill, containing new clauses that override the withdrawal agreement, on Wednesday, a move that would effectively mark the end of talks. But there is an expectation among senior diplomats that agreement should be found in time, with EU leaders then able to sign off on an agreement at a summit on Thursday. The cautiously positive outlook in Brussels contrasts with the recent warnings from Downing Street that a deal is hanging in the balance, with the EU said to have suddenly hardened its positions. UK sources on Saturday said Downing Street had hoped for more realism from the EU side after Barnier, was said to have tabled unacceptable proposals on Thursday. It was claimed the proposals on domestic subsidy control and standards would effectively force Westminster to align with the EU rulebook. Brussels was also said to have demanded a 10-year pause on any changes to fishing access for European fleets in the UK’s exclusive economic zone. Frost has offered a three-year transition period. An EU official dismissed the claims. “It is a bit cheeky,” said one. “Our positions have been entirely clear from the start.” A second described the claims over a 10-year transition period as a “strawman”. “That isn’t a problem, there is a compromise to be found,” said one source from a fishing nation. Despite a series of headlines blaming the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for upturning the negotiations over fishing rights, the issue is not the major obstacle to a successful negotiation, sources on both sides said. The more difficult gap to bridge lies in the EU’s demand to be able to unilaterally hit back through tariffs or suspension of parts of the treaty if the government undercuts the bloc’s environmental, social and labour standards. The EU also wants the owners of European businesses to be able to seek redress in UK courts should there be evidence that government subsidies have left them at a competitive disadvantage. Source said the two sides had further locked horns over whether EU funds will be exempt from state aid rules and whether the UK or Brussels will authorise subsidies in Northern Ireland. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, who last week suggested France could wield its veto if the terms brought back failed to meet expectations, was more placatory on Saturday. He said: “We hope to have a deal. We are still trying to have one so there aren’t additional tensions, there aren’t customs duties and things like that, and so that notably for our fishermen there is access to British waters. It’s very important. But we won’t do a deal at any price.” “We can talk, make compromises,” Beaune said, “but we will not say to our fishermen we’ve sacrificed you all for them. They will be defended to the last. We’ve been honest, transparent, that things won’t be the same after 1 January, but there is no reason for them to be somehow sacrificed or taken hostage by the negotiations.”
Johnson and Von der Leyen discussed how they may pinken their red lines to find common ground on the “level playing field” provisions and suitable access for EU fishing boats to British waters at the end of the year. In a joint statement on Friday evening, Frost and Barnier said they had not been able to come to terms on the final issues and that the historic trade and security negotiation would be paused.
“After one week of intense negotiations in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries,” Barnier and Frost said in their statement. “On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations. President von der Leyen and prime minister Johnson will discuss the state of play tomorrow afternoon.” Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, has been privately criticised by diplomats from some member states for her zeal in seeking a deal with the UK. It is feared in some EU capitals that, as with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the intention is to secure an agreement at any price, as one senior EU diplomat in Brussels described it. Merkel’s spokesman urged both sides on Friday to look past their red lines to strike a deal. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said: “For the chancellor, and that hasn’t changed in recent weeks, the willingness to compromise is needed on both sides. If you want to have a deal then both sides need to move towards each other. Everybody has their principles, there are red lines, that’s clear, but there’s always room for compromise.”"
2020-12-05T15:42:02Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick controversy was factor in ethics adviserâ€™s resignation,"Boris Johnson’s failure to authorise an inquiry into the controversial approval of a £1bn homes project by his housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, also played a role in the recent resignation of the prime minister’s ethics adviser. Alex Allan quit his position last month after the prime minister overruled his advice and cleared the home secretary, Priti Patel, of bullying allegations. Legal and Whitehall sources have revealed, however, that Allan was already concerned that the prime minister had not requested an inquiry to examine the controversy around Jenrick’s backing for a housing development by billionaire Richard Desmond that would help the Tory party donor avoid tax of £45m. After sitting beside Desmond at a fundraising dinner, Jenrick overruled the local authority Tower Hamlets in east London and the government planning inspectorate to give permission for the development. Desmond donated £12,000 to the party a fortnight after permission was granted. Johnson had sole authority to request an inquiry into Jenrick’s conduct when the revelations emerged over the summer, a process that would have been overseen by Allan. Jenrick has denied any wrongdoing or bias but admitted his decision had been “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”. John Biggs, the Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets, said Allan’s apparent disquiet on several issues reflected what he called a “comprehensive ethical vacuum” at the heart of government. He added: “This doesn’t remotely surprise me. The failure to act shows a more comprehensive ethical vacuum.” Meanwhile, new polling shows the extent to which Johnson’s decision to overrule Allan’s advice and stand by Patel, despite a report that concluded her behaviour had breached the ministerial code, has harmed the government. Nearly half (43%) of the British public say their confidence in the government decreased because of its handling of the bullying claims, according to the survey by Opinium with Compassion in Politics. A fifth of Conservative supporters said that confidence in their own party had been reduced by the issue. Alex Thomas, programme director at the Institute for Government, said the Jenrick and Desmond saga exposed the situation whereby the prime minister has the absolute authority to launch misconduct investigations and also has the final say in their outcomes. Thomas, who was a senior civil servant for 17 years, and was civil service head Jeremy Heywood’s private secretary from 2016 to 2018, added: “It’s important that allegations are investigated and it’s also important that there is an independent oversight. For the health of the system, [the issue] would benefit from a proper investigation without prejudice to the outcome.”"
2020-12-05T12:10:27Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: why is Boris Johnson taking over talks with the EU?,"Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will speak on Saturday in an attempt to unblock talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. Why is Boris Johnson talking to Ursula von der Leyen on the phone? After nine months of negotiation on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, the two chief negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, are rubbing against their red-lines in key areas, and it now requires a political intervention. Some of those red lines will have to be pinked, at the very least, for a deal to be secured. That requires political direction. Frost and Barnier issued a joint statement on Friday evening calling a temporary halt to their talks. “After one week of intense negotiations in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries,” Barnier and Frost said in their statement. “On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations.” What is the problem? Despite the headlines, fishing is not the dealbreaker. Downing Street briefed that last-minute EU demands for a 10-year transition period for changes to fishing access for European fleet in British waters had rocked the negotiation. But the two sides have been discussing the terms of a transition period for months, and a compromise will be found. The more significant issues lie in Barnier’s demands for provisions to ensure that Brussels can unilaterally hit back at British economic interests if the UK diverges from EU environmental, labour and social standards. It is a matter of principle to the government that policymakers in Westminster need not be boxed into following EU standards. There is a dispute over how to define the common high standards from which neither will regress. As EU and UK policy develops, there is also not yet agreement on a mechanism to ensure undercutting comes with consequences. Meanwhile, the EU is concerned about the UK’s future regime for controlling domestic subsidies, or state aid. It wants an independent regulator in the UK to act on treaty-embedded shared principles with the option of taking unilateral action to suspend parts of the deal or apply tariffs where it is feared that a subsidy will distort trade. For Downing Street, this smacks of EU state aid rules being applied in the UK via the backdoor. In short, Johnson has always said that Brexit is about divergence but the EU does not want to offer up “zero tariff, zero quota” access to its single market to British companies if they are able to operate with lower costs bases due to differing regulations in the UK. It is a matter of self-protection. What will it happen? Saturday is not deal day. Anything agreed in terms of pinking the red-lines will be passed down to the negotiators who will work on legal text. This will then be presented to EU ambassadors in Brussels and the cabinet in Westminster as early as Sunday for scrutiny. Only then will it be clear if there is a deal. It could plausibly be no-deal day if Johnson and Von der Leyen both take a rigid approach to these issues. UK government sources have said there is only a 50% chance of success. Barnier was quite downbeat as he left London for Brussels on Saturday morning, telling reporters that the two sides would need to see if there was “still” a way forward. EU sources suggest, however, that agreement is within reach and the problems are resolvable. In Von der Leyen, Johnson is dealing with a negotiating partner that sorely wants an accord and is willing to challenge the resistance of some member states on concessions. Much depends on whether the prime minister feels the same."
2020-12-05T11:16:06Z,politics,Politics,Fears of long HGV tailbacks at Brexit lorry park near Warrington,"Concerns have been raised about tailbacks of as many as 700 lorries a day queuing for Brexit checks in a new government site to be opened near Warrington. The lorry park in Appleton Thorn was previously used as a coach interchange for the holiday company Shearings, and was chosen because there were no suitable sites available for lorries coming from Ireland into Liverpool, Holyhead and Heysham ports. There has been strong local opposition to the prospect of HGV traffic building up in the town, and the chief executive of Warrington borough council, Steven Broomhead, said he was extremely concerned about gridlock and pollution. “This application wasn’t determined by the local authority. It’s been imposed on us and the best they could really do is give us some financial support to get some traffic measures in,” he said. Local residents have launched an appeal to monitor the impact of the site. The chairman of Lymm parish council, Geoff Hawley, told local media: “We are vehemently opposed to the development and have very serious concerns about the facility and its potential impact on Lymm and south Warrington. “The parish council will be liaising with the relevant organisations to minimise its impact on Lymm’s residents and visitors.” The Warrington site is one of 10 “inland border facilities” the government is opening to cope with lorry congestion around key ports including Dover and to provide facilities for HMRC checks on customs declarations for goods coming into the country. The other facilities include two sites at Ashford in Kent, Birmingham airport, Ebbsfleet just south of the Dartford bridge on the Thames estuary, Manston airport in Kent and North Weald in Cambridgeshire. The latter site, which will located close to junction seven of the M11 north of the M25, will cater for lorries coming from Felixstowe and Harwich in the east and airfreight from Stansted airport just a few miles north. The government has said that in the worst-case scenario there could be queues of as many as 7,000 lorries trying to board ferries and Eurotunnel trains in Kent cause by inward and outward traffic. Queues up to five miles long formed in Kent 10 days ago when the French authorities tested their Brexit immigration software. A government spokesperson said: “We will have the necessary infrastructure in place by the end of the transition period, with construction in progress. “We have consulted with local residents at every stage of the planning process, publishing detailed plans for the proposed sites online, and writing to residents to invite them to submit comments on the proposals. “We have also held extensive conversations with local authorities and MPs ahead of submitting proposals for the sites, and we will continue to engage with all local stakeholders as these plans progress.”"
2020-12-04T20:36:24Z,politics,Politics,Durham police assessing file on Dominic Cummings' lockdown trip,"Durham police have confirmed for the first time they are assessing a dossier from a former senior prosecutor that says Dominic Cummings should face charges over his account of his movements during lockdown. For months Durham constabulary has refused to investigate the prime minister’s former chief aide beyond the three-day inquiry it conducted in May. But on Friday it said officers were examining new evidence submitted in a 225-page dossier more than a month ago. The documents, compiled by lawyers for the former north-west chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, allege that Cummings perverted the course of justice in relation to his Downing Street rose garden statement about his journeys to the north-east of England in March and April. The Met police, which also received the dossier and was urged to investigate, told Afzal’s lawyers that the issues raised were matters for Durham constabulary – “notably the allegation of perverting the course of justice”. Durham police has not ruled out charging Cummings for perverting the course of justice. A spokesman for Durham constabulary said: “A report was submitted to Durham constabulary at the end of October and we are continuing to consider its contents.” It is understood that a senior investigating officer has been appointed. This marks a change in approach from the force, which had said nothing publicly about Cummings since a 391-word press release issued on 28 May following a three-day investigation in to Cummings’s movements. That statement said Cummings may have breached lockdown rules by travelling to Barnard Castle on 12 April, but the force decided to take no further action and it made no finding on his decision to leave London for Durham. At the time the force also said there was “insufficient evidence” that Cummings travelled to Durham a second time on 19 April, as initially one witness told the Guardian and the Mirror. In his rose garden statement Cummings claimed he had evidence that proved he was in London that day. Boris Johnson told MPs that he had seen that evidence, but No 10 has refused repeated requests to release it. In August the Guardian and the Mirror revealed that four people had claimed seeing someone they believed to be Cummings in woods near Durham on the morning of 19 April. They included Dave and Clare Edwards, who gave statements to the police about the sighting at the same time Cummings was giving his rose garden statement. The submissions from Afzal’s lawyers said Cummings’ account appeared to have influenced Durham constabulary’s initial investigation. It included statements from witnesses, including the Edwardses, which questioned the conclusions of Durham police about Cummings’ movements. It also included statements from at least three people in Barnard Castle, which raised doubts about Cummings’ claim that he was only there for 15 minutes and strayed no more than 15 metres from his car. The dossier also accuses Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, of multiple offences under the coronavirus regulations for leaving their primary home in London and their second home in Durham without, it says, a reasonable excuse. Afzal said: “It appears that, to their credit, Durham police have taken seriously the evidence and allegations contained within our report, including the very serious allegation that he perverted the course of justice. We remain concerned that nobody should be above the law and police and prosecutors should follow wherever the evidence takes them.” Last month Cummings resigned as Boris Johnson’s chief aide, following an internal Downing Street feud about his influence.

2020-12-04T19:36:32Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Johnson and Von der Leyen to take over with direct talks,"The Brexit talks will enter their final act on Saturday with a shift to direct negotiations between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, following the failure to find agreement in London. In a joint statement, David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said they had not been able to come to terms on the final issues and that the historic trade and security negotiation would be paused. The year-long negotiation had long been expected to end with arbitration between the two political leaders, although there remains no certainty that an acceptable compromise will be found. “After one week of intense negotiations in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries,” Barnier and Frost said in the statement. “On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations. President Von der Leyen and prime minister Johnson will discuss the state of play tomorrow afternoon.” It is understood Johnson and Von der Leyen will talk by phone on Saturday afternoon. It is believed that a major bone of contention for the UK side is Brussels’ intention to exempt all EU funding from the future state aid rules, a contentious move raised by one of Frost’s deputy negotiators some weeks ago but which has yet to be resolved. EU sources were swift to reject claims from Downing Street, which were briefed to some newspapers, that a demand for a 10-year transition period for phasing in changes for European fishing fleets was an obstacle to a deal. “The UK wants a short transition, we have asked for a much longer one. There is a middle way – and that is not the cause of any problem,” a source said. Earlier in the day the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, stepped in to urge both sides negotiating in London to move past their red lines to strike a deal, even as the French government said it could wield its veto if the deal failed to match expectations.
Despite concerns being raised in Paris, The Hague, Copenhagen and Rome about the concessions already offered by Barnier, Merkel’s government said that further compromise should be made if it would secure a trade and security deal. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said: “For the chancellor, and that hasn’t changed in recent weeks, the willingness to compromise is needed on both sides. If you want to have a deal then both sides need to move towards each other. Everybody has their principles, there are red lines, that’s clear, but there’s always room for compromise.” Sources said both Merkel and Von der Leyen had shown “absolute determination” to push the deal over the line despite the concerns of some over the detail. “The member states will take their time when they get the deal through,” said one diplomat. “Agreement at negotiator level doesn’t necessarily mean it is a deal.”
No 10 is keen to secure an agreement in time for legislation implementing the deal to pass through both houses of parliament before Christmas. Government officials acknowledge they may have to ask MPs to sit until 23 December if a deal comes later than the start of next week. On Friday, the European council president, Charles Michel, promised the member states they would have sufficient time to scrutinise any terms settled between the negotiating teams. But the former Belgian prime minister said both sides had a responsibility to make the talks work. “We’ll see in the next two days what the next steps are at this point in the negotiations,” he said. “It will be up to the commission to take a position, and when the time comes, and the time has not yet come, it’ll be up to the member states to take a position as well. ” Earlier in the day, Clément Beaune, France’s European affairs minister and a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, said his country could act unilaterally if the terms were not right. “I think it’s also the case for our partners that if there were a deal that isn’t good, which in our evaluation doesn’t correspond to those interests, we will oppose it,” Beaune said. “Yes, each country has a veto, so it’s possible. France like all its partners has the means of a veto. We must make our own evaluation of course of this deal, that’s normal. We owe that to the French people, we owe it to our fishermen, and to other economic sectors. “I want to believe we will have a good deal, but to get a good deal, you know, it’s better to be frank and to say our interests. We have been very clear, sometimes the Brits a little less so, about our interests.” A No 10 spokesman had earlier reiterated the UK government’s insistence on protecting “sovereignty”. “There are still some issues to overcome. Time is in very short supply, and we’re at a very difficult point in the talks,” the spokesman said. “What is certain is that we will not be able to agree a deal that doesn’t represent our fundamental principles on sovereignty and taking back control. That includes controlling our borders, deciding on a robust and principled subsidy control system, and controlling our fishing waters.” The details of any deal will be scrutinised closely by pro-Brexit MPs, whose support carried Johnson into Downing Street. They say they will not wave through an agreement that cedes too much regulatory control to Brussels. A senior Tory MP in the European Research Group said: “I think it’s more likely than not that we will have a deal by Monday. I’m cautiously optimistic about it, subject to the detail – the devil is in the detail. “As far as fisheries are concerned, everybody would have to be satisfied that the fishing industry was happy with the deal. On state subsidies, anything that left us permanently tied to EU regulation would not be acceptable. But I have every confidence the British negotiators are aware of that and are approaching the talks with that in mind.” With Labour likely to back an agreement and Johnson sitting on a comfortable majority, it is almost certain to pass, even in the face of a significant Tory rebellion.
UK government sources had claimed on Thursday that the negotiations had taken a sudden step backwards after furious French lobbying pushed the EU to make late demands. The apparent hardening of the EU position was said to have destabilised the protracted talks, undoing progress made over the previous 24 hours. Both sides believe Sunday evening or Monday morning is the deadline for the year-long negotiation. Beaune said the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained. “We mustn’t hide it because there are businesses, our fishermen, citizens who need to know and so we must prepare for a risk of no deal. That’s to say on 31 December there will be no more free circulation, and free access to the UK market and vice versa. “But it’s not what we want … I still hope we can have a deal but I also say to our fishermen, to our producers, to our citizens, that we won’t accept a bad deal.” The talks remain focused on the level of access EU fishing boats will be given to British waters at the end of the year and the “level playing field” provisions. The EU is seeking assurances that the UK will not be able to distort trade through subsidies or by undercutting on environmental, labour and social standards."
2020-12-04T17:16:07Z,politics,Politics,Windrush victims accuse Priti Patel of 'deeply insulting' behaviour,"Priti Patel has been accused of “deeply insulting and patronising” behaviour by victims of the Windrush scandal after she branded those calling for deportation flights to be stopped as “do-gooding celebrities”. In a letter to the Home Office, prominent Windrush campaigners and support organisations said the home secretary’s remarks were “ill-judged and ill-informed” – and accused her of using their name to try to score political points. They reacted after Patel used a newspaper interview to hit out at more than 80 black public figures who called for the cancellation of a deportation flight to Jamaica of several convicted criminals. The coverage included quotes from Home Office sources criticising lawyers acting on behalf of people targeted for deportation. The campaigners fear the unlawful removal of people who have the right to remain in the UK. On Wednesday morning, the Home Office deported 13 men to Jamaica but 23 others were granted a reprieve after the government acknowledged some may have been victims of modern slavery. In her interview with the Daily Mail on Friday, Patel claimed it was insulting to see “ill-informed Labour politicians and do-gooding celebrities attempting to conflate the victims of Windrush with these vile criminals set for deportation”. Her words infuriated Windrush victims, who said in a letter of reply: “We, the leading Windrush campaigners and organisations, co-signed the same letter as other leading black figures – many of whom have parents and grandparents of the Windrush generation – to express our significant concerns with her mass deportation flight to Jamaica.” The signatories included Natalie Barnes, whose mother Paulette Wilson was wrongly detained and threatened with deportation, and Anthony Bryan, who was wrongly held for five weeks, before being booked on to a flight to Jamaica despite not having been there in more than 50 years. Bryan said: “You can’t trust the Home Office to do the right thing. We need everyone to get involved in campaigning.” He said he had been upset by Patel’s comments, adding: “I’m still waiting for the Home Office to do right by me.” The letter was also signed by Windrush victims Glenda Ceaser, Ewaldo Romeo and Michael Braithwaite, as well as Bishop Desmond Jaddoo and other campaigners. They told the home secretary her comments were “deeply insulting [and] patronising”. Patel referred to those targeted for deportation as “rapists and murderers” but Jacqueline McKenzie, a solicitor at McKenzie Beute and Pope, who has worked on Windrush cases, said not all of them were very serious offenders, and the original list of names for proposed deportation had included many people who had been in the UK since childhood and whose offences were less serious. “When you learn a bit more about their backgrounds there are examples of people who are victims of grooming, people who have been in care, people with very disaffected lives and I think we need to factor that into the debate,” she said. The letter, to which McKenzie was also a signatory, came as lawyers acting on behalf of several people facing deportation said they had received death threats and increased their security since Patel’s criticism. Amer Zaman said his firm Cranbrook Legal had received several emails, including one that warned him to “expect a package” and that he would not be “alive much longer”. He said he was in the process of reporting them to the police. Miranda Butler, a barrister at Garden Court Chambers, said Mail Online’s decision to name her and others needed to be seen in the context of broader concerns about the security of lawyers involved in immigration cases. The Bar Council and the Law Society, as well as fellow government ministers, have pleaded with Patel to stop her attacks on them. A third lawyer, Sheraaz Hingora of Clarendon Park Chambers, said he and his colleagues had also been the objects of abuse. He said: “The aggressive and threatening messages I have received since the article have been distressing, particularly with the recent rhetoric against immigration lawyers from the government. It feels like I have become a target when I was simply doing my job. “People seem to forget that the work we do is also designed to protect innocent British children from the serious detriment caused to them by the deportation of a parent.” Last week’s campaign was supported by the model Naomi Campbell and the actor Thandie Newton. They signed an open letter last week to several airlines calling on them to refuse to provide deportation flights for the prisoners. The letter said in part: “Until justice has been delivered for all Commonwealth Windrush victims, any deportations to Commonwealth countries risk further unlawful removals of Windrush generation members or Windrush descendants who may have the right to remain in the UK but do not yet have the required paperwork.” Labour’s immigration spokesman, Holly Lynch, has led MPs’ opposition to the deportations, telling the Commons on Monday the full consequences of the Windrush scandal had not yet been established. She added: “With that in mind, what assessment has been made to ensure that none of those scheduled to be on the flight are eligible under the Windrush scheme, or have been affected by the wider immigration injustices that impacted the victims of the Windrush scandal?” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We reject the underlying insinuation of these allegations. Any form of violence or threatening behaviour is completely unacceptable. “None of the individuals on the flight were eligible for the Windrush scheme and their cases were checked by the Windrush help team.” Mail Online have been contacted for comment."

2020-12-04T15:27:30Z,politics,Politics,What is happening in the Brexit talks?,"Is this the final act in the negotiations? Time has run out and both sides recognise that it is make or break for the trade and security negotiations with just three weeks to go before the UK leaves the EU’s single market and customs union. There are perhaps just 48 hours to go in the negotiations. On Friday evening the two chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier, issued a joint statement saying that they had failed to come to terms and the talks held in the basement of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in Whitehall would be paused. Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, will hold talks on Saturday afternoon to find a political fix, with the two negotiators having run out of ground in their respective mandates. Will there be a deal? It is looking increasingly likely but the four-year-long Brexit process may have a few twists and turns left to come. There is no certainty that a political fix will be found by the leaders. The UK team claimed on Thursday evening that the negotiation had taken a major step back because of new EU demands resulting from French lobbying. The EU was said to have started pushing for further and harder assurances over the role of a UK regulator of subsidies, or state aid, a claim dismissed outright by Brussels. But sources concede that the issue remains difficult. The EU wants all its funding from Brussels to be exempt from state aid rules, unlike Treasury funding. It also wants the domestic regulator to be given the power to approve or block subsidies based on shared EU-UK principles written in the treaty. A failure of the regulator to abide by the principles would give the EU the opportunity to unilaterally hit back through tariffs on British goods or even suspension of part of the trade deal. France has said it will not tolerate a deal that provides a possible competitive advantage for UK businesses in the European market place. Clément Beaune, the French EU affairs minister, said Paris would be willing to veto the deal if necessary. The agreement will require unanimity among the 27 member states. And the French are not alone in feeling nervous. Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium are all concerned by the possibility that Barnier will concede too much to get the deal over the line. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is repeating his mantra of being willing to leave the transition period on “Australian terms”, the Kafkaesque phrase he uses to describe a no-deal exit. Australia does not have a trade deal with the EU. Is this just last-minute theatre? Certainly one would expect a sudden burst of posturing from both sides as it comes to the decisive hours. But there are real principles at stake and both sides are rubbing up against their red lines. Germany has the rolling presidency of the EU and called on Barnier to address ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, as some European capitals were getting jittery about the lack of information on the most contentious parts of the deal: access to UK fishing waters and the maintenance of a level playing field through equivalent subsidy control regimes and standards over time. But it did not calm the nerves. Barnier was warned he was close to overstepping in the concessions he was offering. What happens now? The crunch talks between Johnson and Von der Leyen will probably to lead to a compromise to be put to the domestic stakeholders – the EU member states and the British cabinet – for scrutiny. If all is well, it is expected that the moment of truth will come on Sunday evening or Monday morning – deal or no deal. The internal market bill returns to the Commons on Monday. The government has said it will return the contentious clauses, taken out by the Lords, breaking international law by overriding clauses on the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. On Wednesday, the finance bill, breaking international law again by overriding further clauses in the treaty, is expected to be tabled. If the government goes ahead with these pieces of legislation it will show that all hope of securing a deal has gone. The EU has made it clear that it will not agree to a deal if Downing Street goes ahead with unilaterally rewriting the withdrawal agreement. But the good money is on a deal which would make the contentious clauses redundant."
2020-12-04T14:42:13Z,politics,Politics,Neil Kinnock: backing Brexit deal politically 'lethal' for Labour,"The former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has privately warned party colleagues that backing a Brexit deal could be politically “lethal”, saying the prime minister must be made to “own” it. With talks entering their final crucial days, opposition parties are turning their minds to whether they will support the government if it clinches a deal and then brings it to the House of Commons. During discussion on the Labour peers’ WhatsApp group about the issue, Lord Kinnock said: “If Labour supports the ‘deal’, all our future justified criticisms will be rebuffed by ‘but you voted for this!’ and, because it will be true, it will be lethal.” Instead Kinnock supported the view expressed privately by some shadow cabinet members, who would prefer to see Labour abstain – a decision that would be unlikely to prevent the deal going through. “We must abstain and explain that this is the rational course when faced with a damaging ‘yes’ and a disastrous ‘no’,” Kinnock told colleagues. “[Boris] Johnson will get his ‘deal’ through the Commons anyway and he must OWN the outcome.” Cabinet Office officials have been working on a future relationship bill that could potentially be quickly passed through both houses of parliament in the event of agreement. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is minded to whip his MPs to vote in favour – perhaps after trying to amend the legislation. He believes a no-deal exit would be disastrous and wants to send a message to Brexit voters who rejected the party at last December’s elections that Labour has heard them. But that has raised concerns among some shadow cabinet members and scores of backbench MPs. The Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats have not yet made a final decision on how they will vote, but one concern on the Labour benches is the risk that with critical Holyrood elections coming up next year, a vote for a deal would allow Labour to be lumped together with the Tories. As Labour leader, Kinnock lost the 1992 general election to John Major, despite the economy having suffered a deep recession. It is understood Kinnock’s intervention was part of a lively discussion prompted by a Guardian article written by Peter Mandelson. Lord Mandelson said: “Boris Johnson is putting Britain at a massive and permanent disadvantage in relation to its biggest export market.” He also conceded that he and fellow proponents of a “people’s vote” had made a softer Brexit deal less likely – and urged Labour not to fall out over the issue. Labour peers were addressed on Wednesday by Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, who is liaising with the party on Starmer’s behalf about Brexit and has held a string of meetings with different groupings. Johnson’s approach involves leaving both the EU single market and the customs union, which will entail a significant increase in bureaucracy. Starmer whipped his MPs to abstain in this week’s vote on coronavirus restrictions, in which more than 50 Conservative MPs opposed their own government’s plans. Labour wanted to see more business support for the areas under the tightest rules, and greater powers given to local leaders to determine how their areas tackle the pandemic.
But Johnson then attacked Starmer during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. “Captain Hindsight is rising up the ranks and has become General Indecision,” said the prime minister. Divisions over Brexit dogged Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. A well-organised backbench caucus, as well as several shadow cabinet members including Starmer, pressed him towards rejecting Theresa May’s deal and ultimately accepting the need for Labour to support a referendum. A Lib Dem spokesperson said: “In the final hours before a deadline, we still don’t know what Brexit Boris Johnson will present to MPs and the country. However, the Liberal Democrats have always been clear we will not vote in favour of any deal that is destructive for British jobs, security or our environment.”"
2020-12-04T14:38:48Z,politics,Politics,UK business leaders warn of Brexit red tape 'tidal wave' even with deal,"Business leaders have warned that a Brexit “tidal wave” of red tape is going to hit British industry on 1 January even if a trade deal is struck in the coming days. The Confederation of British Industry deputy director general Josh Hardie pleaded with the UK and EU to redouble efforts to get businesses prepared, saying speed was now of the essence. He said he was confident there would be a trade deal in the coming days, because to walk the UK and 27 EU countries over a cliff edge on 1 January would be a failure of politics. “I find it almost impossible to believe that politicians on both sides would allow our countries to slip into no deal. The mutual interest in getting a deal has genuinely never been stronger post-pandemic – or mid-pandemic,” he said. “Preparation doesn’t mean protection if a tidal wave is coming. You can put in place the sandbags, and that helps a bit, but the water is still going to get through,” he said. As survey after survey shows businesses do not have the full information they need to be prepared for Brexit, Hardie urged the UK and EU to inform businesses what any trade deal would require them to do to be Brexit-compliant crossing from Dover to Calais, or any other UK-EU border. “Once the free trade agreement is over the line, don’t breathe a sigh of relief and down your pens. Actually move on to the next thing, because this has some way to go,” he said. Ben Fletcher, a director of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, predicted a period of hibernation for some businesses in early 2021. “I think there is a lot of nervousness and a lot of uncertainty. Some firms are saying to us: ‘We’re just not going to attempt to move goods in and out of the country, because we want to see how the land lies in the first couple of weeks,’” he said. Food and drink suppliers are particularly nervous of goods perishing, with Scottish politicians urging a “fish and chicks” policy to allow trucks carrying shellfish and day-old laying hens to get to the top of the queues likely to develop in Kent. Business concerns come a week after a five-mile lorry queue developed on the approach road to the Eurotunnel in Folkestone as the French rehearsed Brexit checks. Both Make UK and the CBI have called on the EU to state whether it will reciprocate on some of the “flexibility” being shown by the UK, which has decided to ease in Brexit customs and regulatory checks over six months to mitigate disruption. Fletcher said some firms were so “physically and intellectually tired” that they simply did not have the capacity to “spend two weeks over Christmas reading a very, very complicated deal and getting advice on what it means for them, and attempting to update their systems”. The CBI added that some critical information needed by business to prepare was outside the scope of the free trade agreement and needed to be agreed swiftly, including arrangements on cross-border data transfer, permits for business travel for engineers servicing machinery, and in particular rules of origin, which will determine what goods are defined as “British” and eligible for sale in the EU in a trade deal. “Will businesses be fined for making honest mistakes at the borders? What about phasing in rules of origin changes?” asked Hardie. A cohesive and concerted government and business effort to mitigate the queues and chaos will be critical in the countdown to 1 January and in the immediate aftermath. “One of the things the pandemic has taught us is that when business and government work together the outcomes for communities are better. We need to apply that same rigour to the next two months. All of our shoulders to the wheel will move us further and faster than us doing it separately,” said Hardie. With just 26 days to go to January, “every day matters”. He said it behoved everyone to get “those people who have sadly lost their jobs due to the pandemic” back into employment as soon as possible, and that needed a pragmatic post-Brexit approach. “We need to get them back into work as quickly as possible to do that. We need businesses that can invest, to have a stable environment. So every day that is wasted [on not preparing for Brexit] is a day that actually communities are paying for,” he said."
2020-12-04T13:55:45Z,politics,Politics,Vaccine expert tells ministers: 'Stop boasting and get public onboard',"Government ministers should stop politicising the Covid-19 vaccine by boasting about being the first to license it, the head of a leading research group has said. Heidi Larson, the director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), said the government should instead focus on building support for the jab or it will lose the confidence and trust of the British people. “I don’t think it is in the interest of the government to be racing along without building the ground,” Larson said. “Unfortunately it feels like announcements are made more politically. “The message – ‘We are the first ones in the world to get there’ – may be a message to other countries but that does not matter if you don’t have your public behind you.”
Larson, an anthropologist, said she did not think the British public were overtly against taking a Covid vaccine but, having announced the licensing of one, ministers needed to explain “what it will look like between now and April”. “[We need] the longer term plan rather than bit-by-bit headline news. Telling the full story will be important.”
The VCP was developed in response to hesitancy and misinformation about vaccination programmes, such as those that caused a boycott of polio eradication efforts in northern Nigeria in 2003–04. Larson pointed out that while the UK had approval for emergency use of the vaccine, more regulation was needed before mass immunisation was possible. Only a small number of people were likely to be vaccinated in January, she said, and the plan beyond that “needs to be carefully” thought out. There was a need to get out into communities, “hearing them, engaging with them and building that ground before vaccines are widely given. If we don’t do that it risks being a problem.” Survey work done by the VCP about people’s feelings towards a vaccine was “a wakeup call to the public health community … we have some work to do to build confidence”, she said. But if the vaccine was delivered in the right way it could be a “huge opportunity” to build confidence in inoculation more broadly. Larson said the UK was only at the beginning of the process of learning about the Covid vaccines. “We should make that as much a public-wide journey as possible and bring people along together, rather than deciding which bits of information are given from time to time.” She noted there were logistical challenges around delivering mass vaccinations. She said: “Particularly the Pfizer one needs extremely cold refrigeration and the handling of it is not overcomeable but will require extraordinary logistical support and training up of those who will be handling it.” Healthcare professionals also needed to be brought onboard, not just in terms of taking the vaccine but answering questions from members of the public. Larson said all vaccines underwent extensive scrutiny and progress would be monitored “to make sure that people are safe”. “No company or government has any interest in putting out a vaccine that is not safe enough. That is bad for business, bad for government and bad for the public. The public need to remember that, even if they hate big business, they have no interest in putting out a vaccine that will ruin their reputation. And no government wants to put something out to harm the voting public. I think there are some highly distrusting people who just distrust as the default.”
She said her message to government was to get out into, and listen to, communities, and use “every moment we have before we are ready to go widely with the vaccine”. And she warned against waiting and getting “lost in statistics”. In terms of mandatory vaccination, Larson said she could not see the government adopting this approach, but proof of vaccination could be required for travelling to some places. “Certain countries, for example, now require you to get yellow fever vaccinations or they don’t let you into the country, some countries may add Covid to that.”"
2020-12-04T12:34:47Z,politics,Politics,Why Boris Johnson's Covid metaphors fall flat while Van-Tam's enlighten,"At least when Tony Blair intoned that “a new dawn has broken, has it not” a few short hours after his election victory on the night of 1 May 1997, it was actually dawn. These days the metaphors emanating from 10 Downing Street seem to bear less and less resemblance to reality. Boris Johnson, our leader in this crisis, evokes men on horses, bugles tooting, a veritable cavalcade of military metaphors to keep us chipper as we wait to be vaccinated. For the health secretary, Matt Hancock, echoing Blair, “the light of dawn is on the horizon”. This apparently means “it’s the moment to stand firm until morning so we can look back and see clearly that everything we gave was not for nothing … but so we could build back better for everyone.” Look closer, however, and you’ll see a front of mixed metaphors rolling in alongside clouds of obfuscation. It’s not that metaphor itself is the problem. In fact, it’s virtually impossible to communicate without metaphor. As the psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett writes in her new book, 7 ½ Lessons About the Brain, the ability to pick out similarities among very different objects or experiences is what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Indeed, metaphors are so common that the various figures of speech we use mostly fade into the background – just like that one there. But when a metaphor leaps out at you it’s a sign that something’s up: either a brilliant new insight, or a cringeworthy attempt to convince. Johnson’s tooting arguably falls into the latter category. There’s something condescending about peppering your speeches with martial banter when most people are looking for straight talk. The contrast with Johnson’s hero, Winston Churchill, is notable. Erik Larson, in his recent study of the latter’s leadership during the blitz, tells us that Churchill would always begin speeches “with a sober assessment of the reality of the threat – and he would not sugarcoat. He would state as frankly as he could what was actually happening, but then he would follow with … realistic cause for optimism. Not happy talk, but a rational appraisal.” Which is not to say the occasional overblown metaphor can’t be charming, or even offer some much-needed comfort. Enter the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, the unlikely hero of the moment, whose clear explanations of what we are facing are spiced up with unexpected yet endearing metaphors. They are not meant to impress or to rouse, just to better enable us to understand what is going on. Early in November, amid jubilation over the first vaccine efficacy results, Van-Tam transported listeners to a rainy platform somewhere far from home. “This, to me, is like a train journey where you’re standing on the station – it’s wet, windy, it’s horrible – and two miles down the tracks, two lights appear and it’s the train. And it’s a long way off.” On BBC Breakfast on Thursday he revealed that, like any good science communicator, he had been honing his skills for some time. “Many years ago,” he said, there was a lance corporal who used to ask him medical questions “as they sat around in tents in Snowdonia”. That was where Van-Tam “practised the art of turning medicine into stories”. He has engendered such a level of trust that his stories, unlike Johnson or Hancock’s, are very likely to be believed by a large number of people. Experts, it seems, are back in fashion. The latest service announcement from Van-Tam is unlikely to reverse that trend. “The train,” he said on Wednesday, “has now slowed down safely, has now stopped in the station. And the doors have opened.” David Shariatmadari is the author of Don’t Believe a Word: From Myths to Misunderstandings – How Language Really Works"
2020-12-04T11:09:41Z,politics,Politics,Peers seek to enshrine human rights in post-Brexit trade bill,"A cross-party group of peers are to try and amend the government’s flagship post-Brexit trade bill to prevent ministers from making trade deals with countries that abuse human rights. The proposal, which will be debated when the bill reaches the report stage in the House of Lords on Monday, would give MPs and peers a chance to scrutinise the human rights record of any country the UK is seeking a deal with. Put forward by members of the House of Lords, including the Rt Rev Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans, and David Alton, the veteran human rights campaigner and crossbench peer, the plan would mean any trade negotiations must be preceded by an assessment of the other country’s human rights record. Another check would come before any deal was ratified, with ministers obliged to show it would comply with the UK’s human rights obligations. Finally, the government would produce an annual report on compliance with rights laws by trading partners. All these would be presented to relevant committees of the Commons and Lords, with the possibility that the courts could be used to challenge trade deals that breached rights standards. Abuses are defined in the amendment to cover both the most serious contraventions, such as genocide, as well as torture, inhuman treatment, slavery and other internationally-defined breaches. The amendment is also proposed by Ray Collins, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman in the Lords, who is the first signatory, as well as his Lib Dem equivalent, Jeremy Purvis. Those behind the plan hope to win support among Conservative MPs who have warned against over-close trade links with China, in contrast to the “golden era” of relations with Beijing sought under David Cameron. The China Research Group of Tory MPs produced a report this week calling for an approach towards China shaped in part by acknowledgement of its serious abuses in places like Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The amendment organisers say that one route to a mutual trade arrangement with China could be via the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) free-trade area, which currently groups countries including Japan, Canada, Australia and Mexico. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, has held talks with CPTPP members about British membership, while China has also been mooted as a possible future member. Other possible trade deals which could fall under the scope of the amendment would be with Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar. The UK has held initial talks on this with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups the states together. The human rights amendment also has won Conservative support. Arminka Helić, a former adviser to William Hague when he was foreign secretary, now a Tory peer, said the plan “is important both in terms of the standards we set for ourselves, and also the signal we send to other countries”. She added: “As William Hague said in 2011: ‘Where human rights abuses go unchecked, our prosperity suffers as well. How we are seen to uphold our own values is a crucial component of our influence in the world.’ That is as true today as it was a decade ago, and this amendment is a reflection of that.” Labour’s involvement in the amendment will be seen as part of efforts to position the party central to a post-Donald Trump era of international rules. A party source said: “We have to get away from the old system of applying different rules to different countries, depending on what’s financially expedient, especially when it comes to basic issues like the violation of human rights.” A Department for International Trade spokeswoman said: “The UK champions human rights globally. The trade bill only applies to trade agreements that have already been signed with the EU, which we are rolling over as an independent trading nation. “None of the agreements we have signed – and which have been scrutinised by parliament – have eroded any domestic standards in relation to human rights or equalities.” Proponents of the amendment say, however, that the EU has existing deals with some countries accused of abuses, for example Egypt, and as part of a regional arrangement, with Cameroon."
2020-12-03T20:24:49Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks falter as UK claims EU is hardening negotiating stance,"Brexit negotiations took a sudden step backwards on Thursday afternoon, Downing Street said, after furious French lobbying pushed the EU to make late demands. The apparent eleventh hour hardening of the EU position was said to have destabilised the protracted talks, peeling back progress made over the previous 24 hours. UK sources said the EU had started pushing for further and harder assurances over the role of a domestic regulator of subsidies after the transition period, a claim dismissed outright by Brussels. A UK government source said: “At the eleventh hour the EU is bringing new elements into the negotiation. A breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding.” EU sources said the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, could return to Brussels on Friday to brief officials and diplomats on the latest development, while it is widely believed that the tortuous negotiations could reach a climax at the weekend.
On Wednesday, France’s ambassador in Brussels had been among 11 representatives of EU member states saying that Barnier had to hold firm in the talks. Senior EU diplomats said on Thursday that the consensus was that Barnier was currently treading on some of the “red lines” set out for him in the negotiation, although they expected him not to go further. The wobble in the talks could tee-up a long expected arbitration meeting between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. It has long been thought that the choreography of a deal would require a stormy moment before agreement was finally signed at a political level. The development came as France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, visited his country’s biggest fishing port to warn that his government had to compromise and to say that coastal communities should prepare for a “new era” as the Brexit talks entered decisive days. With negotiators working through the day and night in London, Castex travelled to Boulogne-sur-Mer, in Pas-de-Calais, to advise representatives of the fishing industry that they should ready themselves for change. He promised “national solidarity” to “the territories concerned” and repeated the familiar mantra that France would not accept a trade and security deal with the UK at any price. Castex said Europe’s coastal communities would not be treated as a pawn in the wider trade and security talks. But in response to calls from Olivier Leprêtre, the president of the Hauts-de-France regional committee for maritime fisheries, for maintaining current access to UK waters, the prime minister counselled that France had to accept a new reality. “It is a negotiation and a negotiation must lead to compromises,” Castex said. “And we must be with you in these compromises. A new era is about to begin. I would like there to be a specific support plan … the state will take its responsibilities.” During a briefing on Wednesday, the French ambassador in Brussels had told Barnier that Paris would prefer to restart talks with the UK in 2021 rather than rush into a deal damaging to European interests. France was far from isolated among the 27 member states’ representatives in advising Barnier that in several key areas he was close to over-stepping his negotiating mandate, with one diplomat on Thursday suggesting the EU negotiator was treading “on the red line” in the most contentious areas. But on Thursday the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said the EU should trust in Barnier to deliver. “We are now at a very critical and sensitive point of the negotiations,” he said. “I want to see a deal done and I believe a deal is possible. It’s clear to me that the landing zone is there for an agreement. We can’t all be negotiators at the table, we’ve got to have faith and trust in the negotiating team to get a balanced deal over the line.” Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, went further prior to a meeting with France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, in Paris. Coveney argued that it would be “a very dangerous assumption” that new talks could easily resume after a no-deal outcome, citing the “political tension that would follow” and “significant disruption, costs, stress, and blame games between Brussels and London”. “There’s a good chance we can get a deal across the line in the next few days,” he told Ireland’s Newstalk radio. “We are in the space of days not weeks. Closing out a negotiation as complex as this one is never going to be easy. It’s going to be full of tension and standoffs, as both sides try to close out a deal that is acceptable.”
EU sources said there were just days left for a deal with Monday pencilled in as a cut-off date because of Downing Street’s intention to reinsert Brexit clauses allowing it to disapply parts of the withdrawal agreement into the internal market bill, which returns to the Commons on Monday. On Wednesday, Johnson’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said the prime minister was hopeful of a deal, but equally confident if talks failed. “He is optimistic but he’s also always said that he is confident and comfortable that we would be OK without a deal.” While the fishing industry accounts for less than 0.1% of the British economy, the sector is emblematic of Brexit, with Johnson frequently declaring the importance of establishing sovereignty and control over who has access to British waters, including the narrow strait at the Channel, where the French land 80% of the cod catch. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Johnson had lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, down from 80%, but this has been rejected by the EU. At an event organised by the European Policy Centre thinktank, Stefaan De Rynck, a senior member of Barnier’s team, said “significant divergences” remained and that the outcome of talks was uncertain. But he said both sides were committed to securing a deal."
2020-12-03T19:15:59Z,politics,Politics,'High-value' business travellers to be exempt from quarantine in England,"Senior company executives are among travellers set to be exempt from Covid-19 quarantine restrictions for international arrivals in England, meaning they will not have to self-isolate for up to a fortnight. Recently signed elite sportspeople, performing arts professionals, TV production staff and journalists will also not have to abide by quarantine restrictions if arriving from a country outside of England’s travel corridor from 4am on Saturday. Announcing the move on Twitter, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said “high-value business travellers” would be exempt from quarantine rules in an effort to boost the economy, “subject to specific criteria being met”. It is understood that the exemption will apply to senior company executives, such as directors or their equivalents, either returning or travelling to England who can deliver “significant” economic benefit. They will only qualify for the exemption if their work requires them to be there in person. Currently, travellers coming from non-exempt nations have to quarantine for two weeks, but as of 15 December people will be able to pay for a private coronavirus test to reduce their isolation time to as little as five days, as long as they return a negative result. The new “test to release” regime comes after months of lobbying by the struggling airline industry. Senior executives classed as bringing “significant” economic benefit are understood to include those whose work creates or preserves 50 or more jobs for either an existing UK-based business or a new UK business within one year of their arrival. Shapps tweeted: “New Business Traveller exemption: From 4am on Sat 5th Dec high-value business travellers … will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to ENGLAND from a country NOT in a travel corridor, allowing more travel to support the economy and jobs. Conditions apply.” He added: “From 4am on Sat 5th Dec certain performing arts professionals … TV production staff … journalists and recently signed elite sportspersons will also be exempt, subject to specific criteria being met.” Giving additional detail, the Department for Transport published information on the government’s website stating that from 4am on Saturday “individuals undertaking specific business activity which would deliver a significant benefit to the UK economy – including activity that creates or preserves 50+ UK jobs – will no longer need to self-isolate when travelling or returning from non-exempt countries. Individuals will only be exempt when undertaking the specific business activity and will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity.” It added: “Exemptions will also come into force at the same time for domestic and international performing arts professionals, TV production staff, journalists and recently signed elite sportspersons, ensuring that industries which require specific, high-talent individuals who rely on international connections can continue to complete their work.” The DfT said Public Health England “do not anticipate these changes will raise the risk of domestic transmission, due to the protocols being put in place around these exemptions, however all exemptions will remain under review.” All travellers would still be required to show and complete a passenger locator form when arriving, the DfT added."
2020-12-03T18:38:33Z,politics,Politics,"Public want EU deal, London mayor's office tells local Labour MPs","City Hall has told London Labour MPs that the public “overwhelmingly” wants them to back a Brexit deal, as Keir Starmer tries to avert a damaging party rift on the issue. After Labour’s crushing defeat in last December’s general election, Starmer is minded to whip his MPs to vote in favour of a deal if last-minute negotiations lead to an agreement in the coming days. The Guardian has seen an email sent to all London Labour MPs by a senior adviser to the mayor, Sadiq Khan, which points to private polling suggesting that even remain voters in the capital would like politicians to support a deal. The email reads: “Essentially our research shows that Londoners now overwhelmingly want politicians to back a trade deal with the EU if agreed in the next few weeks, even if that deal falls short of the benefits of EU membership (42% – 16%). “This result is particularly interesting as support is more or less equal across remainers, leavers and supporters of all main parties. Hope this is useful ahead of any deal.” Sources at City Hall – the base for the London mayor and London Assembly – insisted the intention was merely to pass on factual background information to help inform discussion in the party about the issue. But some of the MPs who received the message suspected it had been prompted by Starmer’s office, which is engaged in an intensive lobbying operation to persuade the parliamentary party to fall into line. Starmer’s team denied they were responsible for the polling. A Labour source said: “A number of organisations have been asking the public about what they think about how we heal the country and move on from Brexit. As you would expect there are a lot of Labour MPs who are interested in this information.” Khan is a longtime ally of Starmer, and like the Labour leader was a strong supporter of the People’s Vote campaign. Speaking in Portsmouth on Thursday, Starmer said: “We’ll have a look at that deal as soon as we see it and make our position then, but I can’t emphasise enough how a deal is in the national interest. We are a united party, pulling forward, focusing on the future, and that’s how we’ve been operating for the last eight or nine months, since I’ve been leader of the party.” Boris Johnson’s majority of 80 means the deal would be highly likely to go through even if Labour abstained, but Starmer and his team believe the consequences of a no-deal exit from the transition period would be too dire for the party to stand on the sidelines. Some of Starmer’s shadow cabinet colleagues, including the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, and the shadow equalities secretary, Marsha De Cordova, believe it would be better to abstain, however, rather than risk being accused of waving through a deal that they believe could have disastrous economic consequences. Many backbench Labour MPs are agonising about whether they could support a deal, with some estimating that up to 60 could rebel if Starmer whips them to vote in favour. Whatever the details of any deal, it will involve a much looser trading relationship with the EU than the agreement struck by Theresa May that Starmer vehemently rejected when he was shadow Brexit secretary. Labour’s London MPs, including Emily Thornberry, David Lammy and Catherine West, were among the strongest voices calling for a referendum in the 2017-19 parliament, amid fears that the Liberal Democrats could make inroads into Labour’s support with their strong anti-Brexit message. But party strategists are now keen to send a message to Brexit voters that Labour has heard their voices, after so many leave seats fell to the Tories last year."
2020-12-03T18:33:43Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: death toll passes 60,000 as 414 more Covid-19 fatalities recorded – as it happened","Boris Johnson has said that he expects life to be â€œmuch more close to normalâ€� by Easter and that by the summer people will be able to attend big events like weddings. He made the prediction in his latest â€œPeopleâ€™s PMQsâ€�, when he was responding to questions from a woman with a wedding planning business who said she had lost all her bookings this year. Johnson said a combination of the vaccine, plus mass testing, would make a difference by Easter. He said there would come a point where â€œlife [will be] much more close to normal, which we think will be by Easterâ€�. And by the summer the wedding industry would be alright, he said. Itâ€™s my strong hope and belief that by the summer, one way or the other, whether by vaccination, which I hope and believe we will have delivered by Easter, or by lateral flow testing, we will be in a different world. My hope is that by summer it really will be a different world for the weddings and events industry. Johnson has said he wishes he had had a better understanding of asymptomatic Covid transmission at the start of the pandemic. Asked during the Q&A about his biggest regrets, he replied: The truth is in this country we didnâ€™t have that experience that they have in some far eastern countries, of Sars. They had a history of knowing about these very difficult respiratory infections, which we didnâ€™t have. There will be a lot of work to be done at looking at the lessons to be learned. I think the one thing that I wish I understood in the early days â€¦ I just wish weâ€™d realised how much the disease could be transmitted without symptoms. If weâ€™d known that single fact it would have made a big difference to our early response. We do know it now. And thatâ€™s why testing is so crucial. During the Q&A he also hinted that the government would be using tax cuts and deregulation to regenerate the economy next year.
The UK governmentâ€™s official Covid death toll has exceeded 60,000 deaths, just three weeks after it reached 50,000. It is too early to know if a flu-like revaccination programme will be needed to combat Covid-19 in the future, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, Englandâ€™s deputy chief medical officer, has said. NHS staff will no longer be among the first people to be vaccinated against Covid-19 after a rethink about who should be given priority. Politicians, health professionals and commentators in Europe and the US have questioned Britainâ€™s decision to fast-track approval of a vaccine and criticised what some saw as the jingoistic tone of its announcement. Some Christmas rail engineering works will start later and hundreds of miles of roadworks will be paused to minimise possible disruption during the UKâ€™s 23-27 December travel window, the government has announced. Sainsburyâ€™s, Asda and Aldi have fallen into line behind rivals Tesco and Morrisons by promising to repay nearly Â£900m of emergency taxpayer support. The Welsh government is under fire over changes to its Covid travel and hospitality rules which critics say will lead to people from Wales crossing the border for nights out in England. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-12-03T17:40:39Z,politics,Politics,Party with one councillor registers one of UK's biggest political donations,"Even in an era when British politics seems endlessly surprising, this was an eye-opener: one of the biggest individual political donations this year has gone not to the Conservative party or to Labour but to a tiny group in Surrey with just one councillor. The news came in the quarterly update of donations produced by the Electoral Commission. Amid a list dominated by unions and businesses handing sums to the big parties was notice of £204,888.20 going to the Hersham village society. It is fair to say that outside the somewhat niche political circles of Elmbridge borough council, most people will not have heard of this particular party. One of a string of village-based independent groups that run Elmbridge council in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, it has for decades represented the interests of a small commuter-belt outpost best known, if at all, as the home of the punk group Sham 69, who immortalised it in their 1979 hit Hersham Boys. The money came in the will of Richard Greenwood, a Hersham man who died last year aged 84, seemingly without any living relatives. The bequest came as a surprise even to his local party. “I can’t even say I knew him, actually,” said Roy Green, the party’s one councillor. “He only made out his will about three days before he died, and he left big sums of money to various organisations, not just us but a local hospice and the MCC. “He left over £1m in all. No one knew he was that rich – he lived in this little ex-council house. I think one of our committee had lived opposite him and helped him in the past. He must have decided we should benefit.”
There is only one snag: as well as being the Hersham village society’s only councillor, Green, who has represented it since 1979, is likely to be its last. “I’m up for re-election in May, and I actually don’t think we’ll even be putting anyone up for election, as most of us have just got too old to carry on,” he said. “My brain is willing, but physically it’s getting difficult. Last night I had a three-hour council meeting, sitting in my office, staring at a screen, and my back was killing me. And that was the third long meeting this week. “On Monday, I went to the funeral of one of our members who was in his 80s, and he’d been with us for over 30 years. But we don’t have younger people coming forward.” Luckily, the money is still being put to good use. Green said the society was “more of an amenity and social group”, although it has to register as a party because members stand for election, meaning Greenwood’s bequest was registered as a donation. It provides volunteers to run the local community centre, which will now get a revamp, along with funds for activities such as a youth group and a Saturday night cinema club. Green described the cinema club as “mainly for older people, so they can get out at least once a week”. The society is in the process of handing most of its unexpected windfall to other local groups, including the Brownies, a scheme to help homeless people, a charity housing former racing greyhounds, and Hersham in Bloom, which plants flowerbeds. Up to now, Green admitted, the tiny party/community group had tried to keep its new wealth quiet so as not to be inundated with requests. It was a nice problem to have, he added. “It was a lovely sum of money, a complete surprise, I can tell you. So we’re giving donations where we can. There’s not much money going to these small organisations, it normally goes to the bigger ones.”"
2020-12-03T15:33:04Z,politics,Politics,How Jonathan Van-Tam won the nation's trust on coronavirus,"When the pandemic began, ministers settled on what they hoped was a reassuring combination for delivering advice to stay home and save lives: they turned to Prof Chris Whitty and the familiar, rumbling voice of the actor Mark Strong. Eight months later, the chief medical officer and Hollywood star have been supplanted by a man who is junior to one and might be viewed as having less obvious charisma than the other. But the public verdict is clear: Jonathan Van-Tam, the wryly ebullient deputy chief medical officer with a penchant for overworked metaphors and Boston United football club, appears to have won the nation’s trust. And on Thursday, as the government began to roll out its vaccine communications strategy in earnest, he found himself moving from the cold gravity of the Downing Street briefing room to the warm but terrifying gaze of Holly and Phil. Van-Tam’s elevation to “scientist of choice” to tour the TV studios and bring the government’s message about the importance and safety of vaccinations may, on its face, seem surprising. Until this year, the closest brush with fame for the former editor of the journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses had come in the form of routine reminders to get a flu shot. Nor does the bespectacled 56-year-old’s teacher-who’s-had-enough-of-3B-but-also-wants-to-get-to-the-pub manner immediately suggest him as a likely household name. Nonetheless, it was Van-Tam who found himself touring BBC Breakfast, 5 Live and ITV’s This Morning. A government insider quoted by Politico’s Playbook reflected: “JVT is definitely the most trusted and liked voice. People like Whitty’s wise man act. [Patrick] Vallance and Simon Stevens don’t come up on the radar. The less said about Jenny Harries the better.” While that primacy is partly based on his sensible advice and willingness to break ranks when the time calls for it – on Wednesday he punctured Boris Johnson’s Panglossian optimism to suggest people may be wearing masks for years to come – it could be his way with words that has cemented his place in the public consciousness. Addressing the public about the easing of lockdown in May, the professor pleaded: “Don’t tear the pants out of it.” But he couples bracing clarity with a penchant for more allusive riffs: there have been glide paths, penalty shootouts and “the wait for a train on a windy night”. In one press conference, when working from home, he decided to finish each of his answers with the word “over”, seeming more like a trawlerman radioing the harbour on a stormy night. Meanwhile, he has been willing to eschew the formality that might be expected to go along with his job by framing his advice in thoroughly everyman terms. On Thursday he returned to the familiar theme of the advice he would be giving his mother – get the vaccine as quickly as possible – and told his audience that she calls him “Jonny”. He also conjured a new bit of football imagery with something twisty but effective about 70th-minute equalisers and the need for the country to nick a late winner, and he suggested Father Christmas would be at the front of the vaccine queue. It remains to be seen whether the man who may now have supplanted the comedian Robert Webb as Boston’s most famous son will be content to return to the relative obscurity of officialdom. If not, Strong, the star of the Kingsman franchise, might be well advised to seek a word with his agent. So might Matthew McConaughey: this week he found himself five places below Van Tam in Grazia magazine’s “chart of lust”."
2020-12-03T15:26:37Z,politics,Politics,Manchild Gavin Williamson plumbs new depths of stupidity | John Crace,"Much to everyone’s surprise, we have learned that Boris Johnson can – just occasionally – engage his brain before speaking. Having begun the Wednesday night Downing Street press briefing with his usual mangled militaristic and jingoistic metaphors about “the searchlights of science” and Britain having pioneered vaccination in the 18th century, he actually twice refrained from saying that Brexit was responsible for the UK being the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Just imagine. A prime minister known for being a lying, opportunistic chancer actually decided to tell the truth for once. Would that the same could be said for some of his cabinet colleagues. Only on Wednesday, Matt Hancock and Jacob Rees-Mogg had described the vaccine as a Brexit bonus. On Thursday, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary manchild who has yet to move up to secondary school level and whose career since winning Fireplace Salesman of the Year two years running in 2006 and 2007 has been a mystery to us all, ratcheted up the nationalism to a new level. Asked by LBC’s Nick Ferrari if Brexit had meant that the UK got the vaccine ahead of the EU and the US, Gav went rogue. “Well I just reckon we’ve got the very best people in this country,” he said, “and we’ve obviously got the best medical regulator, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn’t surprise me at all because we’re a much better country than every single one of them.” Even for Gav – the man, who before he was sacked as defence secretary, Private Pike, for leaking National Security Council briefings, had said in response to the Salisbury poisonings that “Russia should shut up and go away” – this was well out there. Just think about the level of stupidity for a moment. Not only does Williamson have no firsthand knowledge of other country’s medical regulators – don’t forget he is also the education secretary who failed to spot in March that the coronavirus pandemic would have knock on consequences with the cancellation of school exams – he is seemingly unaware that Pfizer is a US company and that the vaccine is being produced in Belgium. Quite apart from a willingness to casually insult the rest of the world for being more crap than the UK – one day Gav might like to compare global coronavirus death rates – he had singled out two countries that were at the forefront of the development of vaccines. It was much like saying that Britain was now in the lead in the space race because we have Tim Peake. You’d have thought that Williamson might want to cut his losses at that point and try to steer the conversation back to his department’s plans to make exams easier next year. Or failing that, plans to admit girls to Eton: something that might have led to some unwanted pregnancies in Boris’s time. But he carried on regardless, ignoring his special adviser who must have been making frantic throat cutting gestures in the corner of the room. Asked again if he was actually saying that Brexit had given the UK an advantage, he continued digging. “I think just being able to get on with things,” he said, “deliver it and the brilliant people in our medical regulator making it happen means that people in this country are going to be the first in the western world – in the world – to get that Pfizer vaccine.”
As if the rest of the world was on a deliberate go-slow, bogged down in pointless bureaucracy to deny their people the vaccine. One day it may dawn on him that the race to find a vaccine has been a global effort. You have to wonder what kompromat Gav has on the prime minister for him to somehow still remain a cabinet minister. Thank God then for England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, the breakout star of the government’s team of scientific advisers, who had been sent out to do all the morning media rounds, on the grounds that he was just about the only person in the country the public trusted for independent advice. Talking on BBC Breakfast and Radio 5, he immediately trashed Williamson by saying no one should read anything much into the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency being the first to license the vaccine. Other countries were also working round the clock and he expected some of them to give their approval long before a needle had been jabbed into any Brit’s arm. JVT – as he’s come to be known – gave similarly measured responses to other questions. The vaccine was our equaliser in the 70th minute: he can’t resist a football or train analogy. No, it hadn’t been fully tested on pregnant women, people over 50 were being prioritised because they accounted for 99% of all coronavirus deaths, the AstraZeneca results were looking promising as none who had been given the vaccine had been hospitalised and the long-term aim was for as many people as possible to be vaccinated to relieve pressure on the NHS and reduce infection rates. And he was sure the MHRA were working as fast as possible on approving other vaccines but that they were an independent body and couldn’t be rushed. All the facts that ministers should have been saying but with the politics stripped out. Who knows? Experts might even catch on post Brexit after all."
2020-12-03T13:32:29Z,politics,Politics,Lord Maginnis faces 18-month suspension for homophobic bullying,"A peer who verbally abused a parliamentary security guard and called an MP who complained about it a “queer” is facing suspension from the House of Lords for at least 18 months following a report by a conduct committee. Ken Maginnis was found to have used abusive language to a parliamentary security officer as he tried to enter the estate without his pass. When the Scottish National party MP Hannah Bardell raised the incident in the Commons, describing it as “one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff I have seen”, Lord Maginnis said she was only doing so because he opposed gay marriage. “Queers like Ms Bardell don’t particularly annoy me,” the former army officer told the Huffington Post, as well as describing the security guard as “crooked”, “a little git” and a “jobsworth”. The Lords’ conduct committee recommended that Maginnis’s suspension should be extended indefinitely if he fails to engage constructively with behaviour change training. “His suspension should not end until that training is successfully completed and Lord Maginnis is able to demonstrate a clear understanding of how his behaviour impacts on other people in the parliamentary community,” the report said. The House of Lords will decide on 7 December whether to bring the suspension into force. Maginnis was accused of verbally abusing the security guard Christian Bombolo when asked to show his security pass in January at the London Underground entrance to the parliamentary estate at Westminster. Witnesses including Bardell said the peer shouted and became rude and aggressive. He was accused of making further homophobic remarks about Bardell and the shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, after a breakfast meeting hosted by the all-party parliamentary group for the armed forces. Maginnis sent an email to the MP James Gray, the chair of the APPG, copied to a number of other parliamentarians, with the subject heading “Discrimination by Homos”. In the email he complained to Gray that Pollard had “deliberately not called” on him to speak, despite acknowledging his indication of wishing to ask a question. He described his exchange with Pollard after the meeting as one in which Pollard had “threatened me with his ‘boyfriend’”. In another row over the incident, with the Labour MP Toby Perkins, Maginnis overheard saying: “I am not going to be bullied by queers.” Bombolo told the committee that Maginnis’s comments made him feel “humiliated and worthless”. The Lords conduct committee said this incident constituted bullying. “The committee has recommended Lord Maginnis of Drumglass be suspended from the house for at least 18 months for breaching the code of conduct in relation to behaviour that constituted bullying and harassment against four different complainants including a parliamentary security officer and three MPs. “Lord Maginnis’s harassment related to the protected characteristic of sexual orientation and the language he used was homophobic and offensive.” Maginnis, 82, the former Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, has been at the centre of controversy several times. In 2012, he was criticised after equating homosexuality with bestiality. In August 2013, he was fined after being found guilty of assaulting a man during a road rage incident. The Lords’ commissioner for standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrief, who carried out an investigation into the independent peer, had initially recommended a ban of nine months. He appealed against this, but the committee found he had shown “very little insight into the impact of his behaviour on the complainants, and no remorse for the upset he had caused”. Instead, it added, he had “portrayed himself as a victim of a conspiracy … and continued to refer to the complainants in a disobliging and sometimes offensive manner”. The committee said it should review whether Maginnis had engaged with his behaviour and shown a willingness to apologise to those he had abused and insulted before being allowed to return after suspension. “Given the lack of insight into the impact of his behaviour shown during his oral appeal and the absence of remorse, the proposed minimum suspension of nine months should be increased. We therefore propose that the term of suspension should be doubled to a minimum of 18 months,” the committee concluded."
2020-12-03T12:54:44Z,politics,Politics,Four in 10 UK food firms to cut supplies to Northern Ireland – poll,"Four in 10 food and drink businesses have said they are going to stop or reduce supplies going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because of Brexit, a poll of some of the UK’s biggest producers has found. The alarming survey result will confirm the worst fears of MPs, particularly those in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), as well as of retailers and the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland. Just over 20% of suppliers polled said they were planning to “pause GB-NI deliveries to ensure we can be legally compliant with NI rules”. A further 11.6% said they were going to pause supplies “while we assess if it remains a viable market” with 4.7% saying they would reduce the volume of goods sold from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The survey is the third monthly poll on Brexit conducted by the Food and Drink Federation about business readiness for the end of the transition period. It said it polled 50 members including some of the biggest food suppliers in Britain responsible for household-name brands. “They are businesses that would be familiar to shoppers,” said Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the FDF. The poll comes just days after Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s warned they might have to reduce supplies of certain produce lines to Northern Ireland. Goudie said many businesses were not clear on what needed to be done post-Brexit to trade in Northern Ireland and were unaware they needed different labelling for the region after 1 January, and that they needed to apply for a specific economic operators registration and identification (EORI) for Northern Ireland. Up until now trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been seamless, but customs, regulatory and health measures are being put in place from 1 January as part of the Brexit Northern Ireland protocol agreed by Boris Johnson last year. Goudie said one of the biggest problems was that “there is a real lack of clarity and detail on what actually needs to be done to get products in Northern Ireland, and how the processes of the borders will actually work in practice”, both from the UK and the EU.
While more than 95% of those polled had an EORI number for trading in the UK, only 33% had obtained one with an XI prefix to allow them to continue trading in Northern Ireland. The numbers were being issued automatically by those who registered with a new government contracted body, the Trader Support Service (TSS), in Northern Ireland. The TSS only launched a few weeks ago and there was no public communications campaign to drive home the message to traders in Britain, said Goudie “Even the cut-off point for registering with TSS to get an NI EORI number was 23 November – if you want to get one now you have to register manually,” he said. “They need to extend that date.” He backed calls for an “adjustment period” for the Northern Ireland protocol saying businesses needed “in excess of four months” to make the changes needed. “It was 5 November when they updated the labelling guide on the government website. It’s all come too late in the day,” he said. He said the “light touch” approach in the early weeks that the government has indicated would apply would offer “no legal basis” for trading for companies seeking to indemnify themselves by achieving 100% compliance with local laws. “They cannot legally sign those forms so that’s a major reason [why they are pausing supplies],” said Goudie. Many businesses had prepared for Brexit by stockpiling, buying time until the new trading rules to become clearer. Last month, Northern Irish businesses called for the EU to delay the introduction of the Northern Ireland protocol warning they “simply will not be ready” for the mandatory checks on 1 January. The Cabinet Office said: “Further measures to support agrifood traders will be announced shortly and we are working to resolve all outstanding issues for supermarkets and other traders through the Joint Committee, where we have agreed an intensified process of engagement with the EU.” It added that traders who were being automatically allocated an XI EORI number would receive letters from HMRC by 11 December and those who already have a GB number could sign up for the TSS by 14 December for an XI one. Businesses who haven’t applied for a trading number yet could apply for both an XI and GB EORI at the same time."
2020-12-03T09:00:00Z,politics,Politics,Are small businesses really ready for Brexit?,"With just 29 days to go before the end of the transition period, the government is urging businesses to get ready for Brexit. But how are small to medium-sized businesses â€“ the family businesses that are the backbone of the country â€“ faring? We returned to businesses we spoke to in 2018 about the issue and the answers we got ranged from contempt about the â€œWestminster bubbleâ€� to multiple claims that hauliers, suppliers and courier companies were providing more information about the new import and export paperwork than the government. Philip Rowell has already upped sticks and moved his company to Barcelona. â€œThe experience has been 100% positive. I wouldnâ€™t return to the UK now. In fact Iâ€™m doing everything I can to extricate my remaining financial ties with the country,â€� he said. Businesswoman and TV Dragonsâ€™ Den panellist Deborah Meaden warned of disruptions to supplies deal or no deal
But what about others? Sally Stephenson, The Pencil Case, Cowbridge, Wales
Sally runs a schoolwear and stationery shop selling everything from uniforms to pens but â€œhasnâ€™t the faintest ideaâ€� of what to do after a German supplier told her she would have to be responsible for all customs imports procedures. She buys from UK and EU suppliers but is particularly worried about suppliers of the popular German pen brand Lamy, and Depesche, â€œa really famous brand of childrenâ€™s colouring books that people actively come to us forâ€�. Knowing change is coming and not knowing what to do about it, she decided to pile cashflow into buying four monthsâ€™ worth of stock, â€œa tough decisionâ€� for a tight micro-business such as hers, which employs two full-time and two part-time staff. â€œWhat Iâ€™ve been doing all week is ordering tons of stock to get in before Christmas so that it sort of buys us time for things to settle down and hopefully some sort of agreements to be put in place,â€� she said.
â€œThere is no chambers of commerce in our town to help. The Federation of Small Businesses have been able to help with a few bits and pieces but we are all in the same boat as weâ€™ve no idea what to prepare for and what conditions we will be trading in.â€� What does she think of government support? â€œTheyâ€™ve been absolutely useless. Iâ€™m getting more information from my German supplier and the courier company than I am from them.â€� Peter Qvortrup, Audionote, Brighton
Peter has been running businesses for 40 years and employs 50 people in the UK and about 25 in two other sites in Lithuania and Austria for Audionote, a high-end audio company supplying domestic sound systems, ranging in price from Â£6,000 to Â£3m, to music professionals and wealthy clients. â€œWe have poured hundreds of thousands of pounds buying parts and putting them in storage since May. If thereâ€™s going to be a deal, itâ€™s still going to be so narrow andit is not going to solve the problems of getting stuff in and out of the country,â€� he said. He imports about 75% to 80% of the parts for the bespoke sound systems, with exports accounting for 95% of turnover. â€œThe most serious issue for us is: how does the regulatory environment look from 1 January?â€� he said. â€œEven at this late stage â€“ with four weeks to go â€“ we donâ€™t know exactly where we will be on 1 January. It may well be that we canâ€™t ship anything into the EU for a year because the CE mark that we have on our products is no longer valid. â€œThe fallout from this is going to be significantly worse than the worst predictions.â€� Asked what he thought about Michael Goveâ€™s plea to business to get ready, he could hardly conceal his disdain. â€œItâ€™s all good and well to say: â€˜you must get readyâ€™, but I mean â€“ get ready for what? Itâ€™s like saying get ready for school, but where are my clothes, where is my school?â€� Mark Ormiston, Ormiston Wire, London
Ormiston Wire produces specialist cable and braid, and counts prestigious work in its portfolio including an umbrella installation in Heathrow airport and Thomas Heatherwickâ€™s Bleigiessen sculpture in the atrium of The Wellcome Trust. â€œThe government is telling us to get ready for Brexit and they donâ€™t know themselves if itâ€™s deal or no deal. â€œWe have been totally ignoring all Brexit communications from anyone as, surprise surprise, we have more important things to worry about,â€� said the managing director, Mark Ormiston. â€œThis government is inept, especially dealing with business. We are getting in as much raw material in as we can from Europe before the end of this year as possibly it will be mayhem in the next.â€� Julian Tandy, World of Water Beds, Pen-y-groes, Wales
World of Water Beds is a small family company with two main suppliers â€“ one in Denmark and the other in Exeter. Tandy said he was prepared. He has his Economic Operators Registration and Identification number to complete customs declarations and has investigated that the tariff rate for his imports is zero. But he said his costs were going to go up by between 15% and 18% and that was going to hit the customer in the pocket. At the moment they can order direct from Denmark with no import costs but the paperwork is going to add a cost per pallet whether there is one or 10 things on it. â€œIn a deal scenario we still have customs clearance and that is going to cost Â£25 to Â£50 per pallet and that will be passed straight on to the customer,â€� said Tandy. Heâ€™s also concerned the facility to pay net VAT charges on a quarterly basis is going to disappear, eating into his cashflow. â€œThatâ€™s another financial burden on top of Covid,â€� he said. â€œAt the moment we donâ€™t know what the situation is going to be so it means we are selling products without knowing how much it is costing you. â€œIf they were to say this is happening in January 2022 we could prepare but it is happening in four weeksâ€™ time. â€œIt is completely unacceptable for any government to expect a business to run like that.â€� Are you an SME with a Brexit story?

2020-12-03T00:01:28Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer faces shadow cabinet split on support for Brexit deal,"The shadow cabinet is split over whether to back a Brexit deal, as backbench Labour MPs warn that up to 60 could rebel if Keir Starmer insists they back the government rather than allowing a free vote. Two backbench MPs said the potential for a frontbench reshuffle – and new shadow ministerial posts – had been raised when the issue had come up in conversations with Starmer’s office, as a way of containing potential rebels. Those in the shadow cabinet who have made vocal arguments in favour of abstaining at the vote including the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, the shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, and the shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, according to multiple sources. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, is torn, one source said, “between his heart and his head”. Those who have underlined the need to vote in favour of a deal are said to include Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, and Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary.
One shadow cabinet source said the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, a former MEP who represents the heavily remain seat of Oxford East, was also in favour of abstaining. But an ally of Dodds insisted she had not yet made a decision, and would judge any deal on its merits – and compare it with the promises made by ministers. “If there is a deal, she will want to go through it with a fine-tooth comb – that’s the way she operates. She will make a decision based on the evidence in front of her,” the source said. At a speech at Bloomberg on Wednesday, Dodds made clear Labour was sceptical about any Brexit deal. “It is not a foregone conclusion that we will emerge with a deal … If we do obtain a deal, media reports suggest it will be as thin as gruel,” she said. Shadow cabinet sources said there were unlikely to be top table resignations. “There have been healthy discussions about how we proceed from here. Ultimately, no one disagrees that the divide between leave and remain is over – but we’ve got to show we are serious about moving forward as a party and as a nation,” a source said. Another shadow cabinet source said there was “just a difference of opinion on what is best, both now and trying to predict the future”. Most of those involved in the disagreement have long-held views on the subject – the only person who has made an obvious conversion is the Labour leader himself, it was claimed. However, there is more widespread anger among backbench MPs, dozens of whom may be prepared to break the whip if Starmer orders them to back the deal, the Guardian has been told. MPs confronted their party’s leader about the issue at a private meeting on Wednesday and some now believe the leadership may be more open to the idea of abstaining or allowing a free vote. Those likely to resist voting for a deal are likely to span ideological divides in the party, from new leftwing MPs unwilling to back a Boris Johnson deal to metropolitan MPs, veterans of the People’s Vote campaign. Labour insiders say Starmer’s team has been taken aback at the scale of the concern inside the party, especially the hostile reaction to a rumour that the former Darlington MP Jenny Chapman, now a senior member of Starmer’s staff, was co-ordinating a letter from Labour MPs saying the party should back a deal. The crunch point is likely to be next Tuesday’s shadow cabinet meeting, a day after the governing national executive committee meets to finalise the party’s response to the equality watchdog report into antisemitism. The leftwing pro-Europe pressure group Another Europe is Possible is mobilising a campaign of grassroots pressure to oppose the vote, with a few thousand letters to MPs and the leadership from members. It comes as a report by the Tory thinktank Onward paints a difficult choice for Labour on the issue. It found that the party had the potential to recapture former Labour voters in northern England, as one in five Conservative voters, mostly concentrated in these seats, “lent their votes” at the last election, doubling the party’s majority from 42 to 80. However, it found the Conservative coalition of shire seats and northern towns was “highly homogeneous in terms of values” especially social-cultural issues, and that Labour was struggling to bridge the divide between its traditional and metropolitan seats. Will Tanner, the director of Onward, said: “Unless Keir Starmer radically changes Labour’s younger, metropolitan coalition, he will have to do the political splits to unite his party and be unable to reach other voters with a fundamentally different set of values.”"
2020-12-02T19:43:08Z,politics,Politics,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it’s been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK’s first female prime minister? It’s a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests. It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away. The council’s controversial decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised. Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: “We find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.” He added: “She was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country’s has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.” For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward. “It’s been a long hard road. There’s been a few knocks and bumps along the way,” Schonhut said. “It’s nice to see things finally coming to fruition.”
She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini Brexit,” she said. She hopes it’ll attract visitors to the museum and the local area. Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum. Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . “In the area we’re living in we’re seeing a huge number of homeless people, we’re seeing food banks springing up all over the place.” Burgess added that given Thatcher’s controversial legacy it was a “poorly judged decision” to push ahead with the statue. “There’s got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.” Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. “It’s a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books. “I appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it’s a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.” Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. “The first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Colston statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.” He added: “I think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.” • This article was amended on 8 December 2020 because an earlier version misnamed Edward Colston as Edward Coulson.

2020-12-02T19:10:44Z,politics,Politics,Boris misjudges the mood as mind wanders to petty point-scoring | John Crace,"A day that offered the country so much hope in a relentlessly grim year was one on which to put party politics on hold. At least that was the view taken by Keir Starmer in an appropriately subdued prime minister’s questions. He began – as had Boris Johnson – by expressing his gratitude to the scientists at Pfizer/BioNTech and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for developing the coronavirus vaccine and for the speed at which it had been licensed, before asking for details of who would be the first 400,000 people to receive the jab when the first doses arrive later this week. And at first it seemed – unusual, I know – that Johnson was taking a serious question seriously. There was none of the jingoism to which some of his ministers had fallen prey. The accident-prone Alok Sharma had tweeted that “in years to come we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity’s charge against this disease”. Er, I think not. The vaccine was developed by a Turkish immigrant couple in collaboration with an American pharmaceutical company. Matt Hancock, a late convert to Brexit, meanwhile was claiming it was only because the UK had left the EU that it had managed to approve the vaccine. Which was just untrue. Instead, Boris was far more cautious in his approach, partly because he doesn’t know the details – he’s only had 10 months to work out how different doses of the vaccine might be rolled out – but also because he didn’t want the whole country to start acting as if we were all suddenly in the clear. This was just the start, he reminded MPs, sounding surprisingly clear-headed. There was a tiering system for the vaccine but he couldn’t yet say which care homes and over-80s would be first in line. Or how the vaccine would be delivered. Small steps and all that. But Johnson could only maintain the act for so long. After not appearing particularly enthusiastic about Starmer’s offer of cross-party working to counter the disinformation of the anti-vaxxers, he completely ignored the Labour leader’s question on the conduct of the Arcadia Group directors. So what if a few more people lost their jobs? Just add them to the total. Instead, he went on the attack by accusing Keir of having failed to support the government in its new coronavirus measures the previous day. This was the real Boris. Major Sulk unable to let go of any resentment. He’d gone through the charade of doing the statesman bit and wanted to squeeze in the few third-rate gags he had prepared that morning. Starmer refused to rise to the bait, instead observing that he had given his reasons for abstaining – it wasn’t that the new measures were too punitive, rather that they didn’t go far enough in offering financial support to industries under threat – and that when Johnson had abstained as foreign secretary over the third runway at Heathrow, he had done so under the guise of a pointless £20k round trip to Afghanistan. That clearly stung Johnson, but he wouldn’t let up. All thoughts of the vaccine were long erased and all he had on his mind was petty point-scoring. “I’d take him more seriously if he had voted with the government,” he continued, conveniently forgetting that if Labour had not abstained then he would have lost Tuesday night’s vote, and that he had already forgiven his own backbenchers who had either voted against him or abstained, on the grounds that they had been acting out of a strong sense of principle. The irony was lost on Boris but not on the rest of the house. “He used to be Captain Hindsight,” Johnson blundered on. “Now he’s General Indecision.” If nothing else it was an act of insubordination coming from Major Sulk. The gag probably sounded better when he had practised it in the shower. As it was, it raised only a few half-hearted laughs from the most loyal Tory backbenchers. Starmer’s instincts had been correct and Boris had misjudged the mood. This was a day for the country to come together, not for the leaders of the two main parties to squabble like children. Somehow, without even realising it, the prime minister had again snatched humiliation from the jaws of defeat. At the Downing Street press conference later in the afternoon, it sounded at first as if Johnson had had second thoughts about his lack of warmongering nationalistic rhetoric at PMQs. In his opening remarks, he waffled on about the “searchlights of science” hunting down the invisible enemy, “biological jiu-jitsu”, how Britain had pioneered the idea of vaccination and how the UK had led the way by being the first country to buy the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. But after Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, had spelled out the logistical problems of rolling out the vaccine to those who needed it most, and Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said how moved he had been by the truly global effort to develop a vaccine – he even squeezed in another of his legendary train analogies, along with observing that the vaccine wasn’t some yoghurt that could be taken in and out of a fridge (he should see the sell-by dates of some of the stuff in our fridge) – Boris calmed down a little. So much so that when twice pressed to say that we basically owed our lives to Brexit and that we would never have got the vaccine if we had stayed in the EU, he declined both times. Even though he was probably dying to say yes. Come the end he was even sounding vaguely like a prime minister. It won’t last, so make the most of it while you can. • This article was amended on 4 December 2020.

2020-12-02T18:38:43Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Johnson confirms it will take months until most of vulnerable group are vaccinated - as it happened,"Boris Johnson has warned people not to â€œget their hopes upâ€� about an early release from the threat of coronavirus after the UK has become the first western country to license a vaccine. It is a landmark moment in the fight against the pandemic, but at PMQs, and later at a press conference, Johnson struck an uncharacteristically cautious note, stressing that it would be months before the impact of the breakthrough was widely felt.
Johnson and Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, have confirmed that most care home residents will need to wait for their vaccine because of difficulties in transporting the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech product - despite the fact that care home residents are meant to be getting it first. (See 11.23am.) Stevens said the vaccine has to be stored at such low temperatures that it can only be moved a few times, while the packs of doses - with 975 doses per pack - cannot be easily split. He said the first people to receive the jab from 50 hospital hubs would be the over-80s, care home staff and others identified by the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] who may already have a hospital appointment. At their press conference at No 10 Johnson said: It will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected - long, cold months. Johnson has refused to back claims from some of his ministers (see 3.54pm) that Brexit helped the UK to approve the vaccine early. (See 5.40pm.) Johnson has played down the prospect of the tiering system being abandoned when MPs next have to vote for it before 3 February. Asked if he accepted the measures would have to be rolled over, he replied: We will judge the situation ... on the basis of the data. But I think, for the time being, you have got to take it that tiering is going to be a very, very important part of our campaign against coronavirus. Johnson has played down suggestions from Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, that people will be adjusting their lives to take account of Covid for years to come. Van-Tam told the press confernce: Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party and throw our masks and hand sanitiser and say â€˜thatâ€™s it, itâ€™s behind usâ€™, like the end of the war? No, I donâ€™t. I think those kind of habits that we have learned from... will, perhaps persist for many years, and that may be a good thing if they do. Johnson made it clear he took a different view. He added: And, maybe ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal. Van-Tam also said that he did not think coronavirus would every be eradicated, and that it could become a seasonal problem. He said: I donâ€™t think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever. I think itâ€™s going to be with humankind forever. I think we may get to a point where coronavirus becomes a seasonal problem. I donâ€™t want to draw too many parallels with â€˜flu, but, possibly, that is the kind of way we would learn to live with it. Care home bosses in England have accused the government of â€œjumping the gunâ€� by announcing that relatives can start hugging their relatives again, and say they are already turning loved ones away because the required Covid tests have not yet arrived. The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine. Britainâ€™s preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic was undermined by scientists believing that such a disease was unlikely to reach UK shores and spread widely, the former chief medical officer for England has told MPs. Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-12-02T17:59:34Z,politics,Politics,"Tory Covid tiers rebels will not face sanctions, says Downing Street","Conservative MPs who broke a three-line whip to reject Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 tiering system will not face sanctions because he respects their decision, Downing Street has said. The prime minister faced the worst parliamentary rebellion of his premiership on Tuesday, with 55 Tory MPs voting against the new restrictions, which came into force on Wednesday. Many of the rebels were members of the Covid Recovery Group, whose chair, Mark Harper, has questioned the data made available to justify the government’s decision to place 99% of England’s population in tiers two and three.
The prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said Johnson welcomed the fact that the regulations had passed, by 291 to 78, with Labour abstaining. “The prime minister is pleased that he won the vote last night, and indeed that he was able to persuade quite a number of Conservative MPs in the end to not rebel,” she said. “He listened to them, and he gave them over the course of the past few days quite considerable concessions.” Johnson held a series of meetings with anxious MPs and sought to persuade some to change their minds as they entered the voting lobbies on Tuesday night. Stratton pointed to extra help for the hospitality industry and a fresh opportunity for parliament to examine the regime next month. She said the rules were looser than those in place before the four-week shutdown.
Asked whether MPs disobeying the party whip would be disciplined, as would be usual on such a major vote, she said: “There are no consequences. The prime minister respects them. We get that this was a very, very grave decision for lots of Conservative colleagues, and we respect those who have made a different decision.” Johnson expelled 21 Conservative MPs from his party last September after they supported an attempt to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He appears to be pursuing a more emollient approach after the departure of his combative chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was announced. Johnson mocked the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for abstaining on the Covid vote, saying he had gone from being “Captain Hindsight” to “General Indecision”.
Many Conservative MPs have called for a more localised assessment of which tier their areas should be in – rejecting the government’s general approach of applying restrictions on a countrywide or regional basis. Ministers have promised to examine local authorities separately when the first regular review of the restrictions takes place on 16 December, but Johnson has also said the system needs to be simple and easily understood."
2020-12-02T17:00:21Z,politics,Politics,"British exceptionalism undermined pandemic preparedness, MPs told","Britain’s preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic was undermined by scientists believing that such a disease was unlikely to reach UK shores and spread widely, the former chief medical officer for England has told MPs. Prof Dame Sally Davies, who handed over to Prof Chris Whitty last year, said “groupthink” and “British exceptionalism” contributed to advisers underestimating the risk from pathogens that spread from animals to humans, leading them to focus on the threat from pandemic flu. While emergency planning exercises such as Winter Willow in 2007 and Cygnus in 2016 revealed many areas for improvement in the UK’s pandemic readiness, both scenarios assumed that the world would be battling a dangerous influenza virus. “We were in groupthink,” Davies told the committee hearing. “We did not – our infectious disease experts – really believe that another Sars would get to us, and I think it’s a form of British exceptionalism.” The Sars virus sparked an epidemic in 2003 after spreading from China to four other countries, killing about one in 10 of the more than 8,000 people infected. The epidemic was easier to contain than Covid-19 partly because Sars was not spread by asymptomatic people. Davies said weaknesses in national planning exposed by Winter Willow and Cygnus were rectified, leaving Britain well prepared for a flu pandemic. But she said that was different to delivering well on the pandemic at hand. “We should have put more challenges to ourselves: are we looking at all the varieties of disease we might get?” she said. While the planning led to strategies used this year, such as calling retired healthcare workers back to the frontline, the focus on pandemic influenza left substantial gaps in Britain’s preparedness. “When you’re planning for flu, the classic is you don’t bother to test, so we didn’t have a test-and-trace system to stand up,” Davies said. In September, scientists on the government’s Sage committee gave a damning assessment of the NHS test-and-trace system for Covid-19, saying it had had only a “marginal” impact on the outbreak and would become less effective over time if new cases continued to outstrip capacity. Davies said the problem was compounded by a lack of resilience in the NHS, with the UK ranking in the bottom dozen of European nations for numbers of doctors, hospital beds and intensive care units per head of population. “We clearly had a less resilient system,” she said. To prevent the NHS from struggling over the winter months, she called for “an absolute mandate” on wearing masks. Sir Mark Sedwill, who served as cabinet secretary and the government’s national security adviser until September, told the hearing that the UK had “learned the wrong lessons” from recent zoonotic diseases – those that jump from animals into humans. Both Sars and Mers, a related coronavirus, sparked international concern, but did not lead to pandemics. “The assessment by the experts was that the likely level of fatalities was going to be of the same order of magnitude as it had been in Sars or Mers, and not of the same order of magnitude as we’d been anticipating if we’d been hit by a flu pandemic,” Sedwill said. “The missing piece here in the epidemiology was understanding that a zoonotic disease could have flu-level casualties.” Davies said: “We need to open up and get some more challenge into our thinking of what we are planning for. It would be well worth bringing in people from Asia and from Africa to think about that to broaden our experience and the voices in the group.”"
2020-12-02T16:37:58Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU","Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours. In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc’s chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal. The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as “derisory” by Downing Street. On the “level playing field” provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time. Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December. But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute. “Barnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‘What’s the rush?’” said one senior EU diplomat. “Ambassadors for every country bordering the UK – 11 all in all – raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.” The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry. Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats. Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. “The EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,” a source said. Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.
An EU diplomat said: “We are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries. “As we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.” A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe’s coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement. A source said: “Fish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.” David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament’s Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year. He tweeted: “We are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework. “Swift progress is of the essence. An agreement needs to be reached within very few days if council and parliament are to complete their respective procedures before the end of the transition period. Democratic scrutiny is not negotiable.” EU leaders are meeting next Thursday, but Brexit is yet to be put on the agenda, with sources suggesting that a deal or no-deal outcome is likely to be evident ahead of the summit."
2020-12-02T16:08:19Z,politics,Politics,Brexit fishing gamble suggests No 10 forgot its economics homework,"An island nation can be forgiven for a preoccupation with fish. But with less than a month until the UK’s trade with the EU moves to new rules – whether under a deal or no-deal scenario – it is possible that continuing attempts to gain a win for British fishing industry could scupper much larger parts of the UK economy. Fishing is a politically charged issue on both sides of the Channel. Boris Johnson has talked of the UK becoming “an independent coastal state” and exploiting the “recapture of our spectacular natural marine wealth”, while Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has warned the UK against using fish as a “bargaining chip” (apparently not a pun on Britain’s national dish). Meanwhile, far bigger industries in the UK economy are left waiting.
The UK’s entire automotive industry was worth £49bn in 2019, of which £16bn was manufacturing, according to the Office for National Statistics. In the same year, fishing and aquaculture was worth £446m, less than 3% of the size of the under-threat car manufacturing sector alone. Even if No 10 succeeds in its ambition of taking 60% of catches in British waters back from EU vessels, gains for the country’s fishing industry could never come close to matching potential losses from the UK’s economic leviathans. Output from financial and insurance activities – a large proportion of which is carried out in London – was £125bn last year. Yet the government quickly gave up on the City’s hopes for special access to the European market, and there are still questions about whether Brussels will view UK firms as equivalent to their EU rivals in a regulatory sense after 1 January. Bankers have been the subject of public and political ire since the global financial crisis of 2007-08, but it is clear that the focus on fishing risks neglecting the basic functioning of much weightier parts of the economy. Lord Liddle, a veteran of European trade negotiations who advised Peter Mandelson when the latter was the EU’s trade commissioner, said Brussels’ negotiators will have organised their strategy around offensive and defensive interests. That approach does not seem to have been mirrored on the UK side, with the British government giving up on securing favourable rules of origin – which decide whether cars made with imported parts will attract tariffs – while holding firm on fishing. “To have ended up with this great row about fishing suggests to me they haven’t made those calculations,” he said.
Liddle said the UK got a poor deal on fishing in the 1970s when joining the European Economic Community, but added that Johnson’s promises of a renaissance for the British fishing industry seemed overly optimistic. Even if the number doubled from the 12,000 fishers the government says there are now, the industry would still be a minnow compared with the 864,000 people working in the UK car industry, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders. There is an irony in the fact that the automotive and finance were two of the industries most assiduously courted by Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s. Now they face an overnight transition to World Trade Organization terms on 1 January – a disaster in their eyes – under another Conservative prime minister. Yet the collapse of Brexit negotiations is unlikely to benefit much of the UK fishing industry in the short term. Many of the fish favoured by Britons are imported, while the species native to UK waters are more popular in overseas markets. Tariffs would overnight change the terms of trade, potentially making some exports unprofitable. That could mean a glut of cheaper fish in the UK, a possible boon for consumers – as long as British people can learn to love mackerel once more – but falling prices would be unlikely to revive fishing regions. The dynamic is mirrored on the other side of the Channel, where the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is keen to be seen as fighting for France’s relatively poorer northern coastal communities before elections in 2022. Yet across the entire EU and UK the fishing industry employed only 180,000 people in 2017. The brutal realities of the trade-offs in the negotiations are becoming clear. The car and finance industries would never say it aloud, but there is exasperation among executives and unions that their fortunes, and the fate of other sectors, are reliant on the government’s efforts to expand a much smaller industry. However, bigger sectors are wary of being seen to criticise a smaller counterpart. One industry insider said: “We would never go: ‘Frankly, we should give up cod for car parts.’”"
2020-12-02T13:13:47Z,politics,Politics,"Don't get hopes up about rapid Covid vaccine rollout, Boris Johnson tells UK","Boris Johnson has warned people not to “get their hopes up” about a very rapid rollout of a newly approved coronavirus vaccine across large parts of the population, urging the public to observe restrictions in the interim. In a prime minister’s questions dominated by the announcement on Wednesday that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority, Johnson began by ruling out compelling people to be vaccinated.
“I strongly urge people to take up the vaccine, but it is no part of our culture or our ambition in this country to make vaccines mandatory. That’s not how we do things,” he said. Under close questioning from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, about vaccination efforts, Johnson was unable to say how long it might take for this to happen for the top priority groups named by the government: older care home residents and their carers; people aged 80 or over and frontline health and care staff.
“At this stage it is very, very important that people do not get their hopes up too soon about the speed with which we will be able to roll out this vaccine,” the prime minister said. As well as an initial 800,000 doses of the approved vaccine, the government expected to get “several million” more before the end of the year, Johnson said, adding: “We will then be rolling it out as fast as we possibly can.” After the Commons passed the new regional tier system of Covid restrictions on Wednesday night, even with 55 Conservative MPs voting against it, Johnson stressed the continued importance of these measures.
The vaccine approval was, he said, “very, very good news”. “But it is by no means the end of the story, it is not the end of our national struggle against coronavirus. And that is why it’s very important that the package of moderate but tough measures that the house voted for last night, the tiering system, is followed across the country.” Starmer also questioned Johnson on public confidence in vaccines, which he called “a real cause for concern”. He said: “It’s really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines.” Starmer asked Johnson if he would cooperate on emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online. Johnson avoided the question, saying only: “We are, of course working to tackle all kinds of disinformation across the internet.”
In a more traditional end to a PMQs, which had up to that point been unusually sober and restrained, Johnson responded to a question about support for staff at the collapsed Debenhams and Arcadia retail chains by mocking Starmer for Labour’s decision to abstain in the vote on Covid tiers. In response, Starmer noted a 2018 incident when Johnson missed a vote on expanding Heathrow airport – which he had pledged to fight – when he was foreign secretary by flying to Afghanistan. “When I abstain, I come to the house and explain,” Starmer said. “When the prime minister abstains, he runs away to Afghanistan and gives the taxpayer a £20,000 bill.”"
2020-12-02T12:25:25Z,politics,Politics,South Kesteven residents: how do you feel about the £100k Thatcher statue unveiling?,"Plans to erect a statue of Margaret Thatcher in her home town of Grantham have been unanimously approved by South Kesteven District Council. The Conservative-led council announced that it will underwrite an unveiling ceremony of the statue to the tune of £100,000. The council agreed to fund the event but said they “fully expected” that the expense will be recouped in donations, while critics have described the cost of the ceremony as an “insult” to struggling local residents. We’d like to hear from local residents in the South Kesteven area how they feel about this proposal.

2020-12-02T10:33:55Z,politics,Politics,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,"Britain’s hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness. Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers. “I’m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,” he said. Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned. Biden told the New York Times: “I want to make sure we’re going to fight like hell by investing in America first.” He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research. The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America’s domestic interests. The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden’s priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators. Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his “goal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China’s abusive practices – that’s stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations” and forcing “tech transfers” from US companies to their Chinese counterparts. He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors. He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. “The best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our – or at least what used to be our – allies on the same page. It’s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.” The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China. Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue. Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal. Biden said: “Look, there’s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.” He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal “with the nuclear programme”. If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. “And the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,” he said. Then, Biden added: “In consultation with our allies and partners, we’re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.” He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal – France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China – to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard. He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew."
