2016-10-01T23:05:32Z,uk-news,UK news,‘He died like a slave’: the tragic death of Mzee Mohammed,"On a sun-bleached street in Mandeville, a cluttered town in the deep velvet of Jamaica’s green hills, the Sunday-morning silence dissolves slowly. A mixtape of reggae songs begins to play for the large crowd gathering in the heat and Karla Mohammed, a 43-year old British woman, leans into the open boot of a white Escalade, weeping. She has the bewildered look of someone unsure how she came to be in this bauxite boom-town in Jamaica, burying her 18-year-old boy. Ever since Mzee Mohammed died on 13 July in Liverpool, in circumstances that remain mysterious, she has navigated plans for two funerals – one in Liverpool and a second in Jamaica – an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation, an inquest, and the puzzling bureaucracy of reclaiming a child’s body from the state. It hasn’t been easy, far from it, and even now, as family members gather around the hearse, there is talk of the smell from the corpse.
“First they killed him, and then they gave the family a rotting body to bring back here. It’s just very unfortunate,” mutters Karen Williams, a cousin of Mzee’s who has travelled from Philadelphia. “Even after he was dying, Mzee was still not being treated as if he was human. He died in July, they were doing different tests, taking his body in and out, it wasn’t handled well. People can be so cruel.” It’s one of many grievances shared by the family – a large Jamaican clan who have gathered in Mandeville, their ancestral town, from diaspora homes in Toronto, London, Liverpool, New York, Philadelphia and Orlando. They had to fight to find someone willing to embalm a body already in a state of decay. “In our culture, cremation is not the biblical way,” says Joanna Smith, a cousin of Mzee’s from Washington DC who speaks rapidly and authoritatively. “To get Mzee’s body here to be buried was already a victory.” There is a sense that this is a family that has been plunged into a battle they are only just beginning to comprehend.
It all began on 13 July at 12:30pm when Mzee Mohammed, a sometime college student who loved his food, headed to his father’s house in the hope of some Jamaican cooking, to “pree his pot” in his family’s Liverpool-Jamaican slang. Although Mzee lived with Karla, his half-Kenyan, half-English, Liverpool-born mother, he was closest to his father, Clement “Blacks” Daley.
It was Karla’s bingo night and Mzee promised to be home by 6:30pm to babysit his two younger siblings. Mzee suffered from autism and ADHD, and had avoided crowds since childhood. But after what relatives describe as a racially motivated attack two years earlier had left him hospitalised, he began travelling by taxi. “If he had to buy something in town, he would have to know beforehand what shop, and go straight there,” said his cousin Kalum Wrigley. “He was autistic, but he was functioning. He knew what his limitations were. That’s why it doesn’t make any sense for him to go into town and just be running around.” Yet that’s exactly what Mzee seems to have done. At some point in the afternoon, he’d left his father’s house and gone into a nearby shop in a highly agitated state, claiming he was being chased. The shop owner, who’d known Mzee all his life, called a car to take him home. But instead, Mzee ended up at Liverpool’s main shopping centre, Liverpool One. By coincidence, Wrigley – who works as a supervisor at the Subway fast food outlet inside the centre – began following events in real time, when he heard security guards discussing an incident on the internal comms. “We heard the security saying there was a ‘big black male with dreads running around barefoot with a knife’,” Wrigley said, echoing initial press reports that Mzee had been threatening shoppers with a 12in blade. Those claims have never been confirmed, but Wrigley was concerned enough that he asked his manager whether he should close up the shop until the incident was over.
The family accept that something was wrong. But the nature of the police response, they believe, was disproportionate, and ultimately lethal. “I heard the command for the security guards to call the police, and at that point they already had the person detained,” said Wrigley. “Knowing that, they still sent 18 police officers. So there were eight security guards, 18 police officers, a police dog and a helicopter. All for one lad who was already handcuffed and on the ground.” It’s an image that was broadcast to the world, after an onlooker filmed Mzee, lying face down as officers stood and kneeled around him, his hands bound behind his back. And then an ambulance was called, and at 7:53pm he was pronounced dead. An IPCC investigation was opened shortly after. Mzee’s case was immediately taken up by campaigners concerned about the nature of black deaths following contact with the police. “There is a real issue with the disproportionate number of black people who die following the use of force after contact with the police,” said Deborah Coles of Inquest, which helps families affected by deaths in state custody. “They are the most contentious deaths, they have raised serious public and political disquiet, and concerns about racial profiling and the stereotyping of, in particular, young black men as being ‘big, black and dangerous’.” The extent to which black people are disproportionately represented in deaths at the hands of the state is the subject of scrutiny. Figures from Inquest show that one in seven deaths in custody and one in five deaths after being shot by police involved people from minority backgrounds, who make up one-tenth of the population as a whole. IPCC statistics reveal that over the past decade, 6% of those who died in police custody were black, compared to their 4% representation in the population at large. On the other hand, some caution that the numbers of people dying are too small to draw big, statical conclusions. Although 1,500 have died following police contact since 1990, the frequency of those deaths has fallen over time. Britain is not America.
But because of the figures, and infamous individual cases – such as Sean Rigg, whose death at Brixton police station in 2008 remains a source of protest – and a wider sense of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, Black Lives Matter has been gaining ground in the UK. On 10 July, just three days before Mzee died, it held its first protest in Liverpool. At the time, Mzee asked his mother if she was going, and when she showed little enthusiasm, made fun of her for being more interested in bingo. “We laughed about it,” Karla says, a bewildered expression on her face. “How could we have known that the next Black Lives Matter march in Liverpool would be for him?” The weekend after Mzee’s death, several hundred friends, family members and activists marched through Liverpool demanding answers. In August, a coroner formally opened the inquest, berating the IPCC for the slow pace of its investigation. It’s a claim that the IPCC deny, arguing that they have been working within the relevant timeframe. “The IPCC has prioritised securing relevant CCTV and then has spoken to a large number of witnesses in priority order, in line with our witness strategy,” a spokesperson said. Merseyside Police said they were cooperating fully with the IPCC and wouldn’t comment on any aspects of the case to “preserve the investigation’s independence and integrity”. That is not a message that goes down well in Mandeville, where “Merseyside Police” and “IPCC” are mentioned so often they have become unwelcome guests at the funeral. “Lying Lips is an Abomination,” is the slogan on T-shirts worn by the freckled young men from Liverpool who haul the coffin from the Escalade into the sweaty shade of a large Seventh Day Adventist church. The funeral service is part fire and brimstone – “No one knows what that young man saw when death looked him in the face!” booms the preacher. “Perhaps he asked for forgiveness!” – but it is also protest. One after the other, aunts, uncles, cousins and friends testify to the good of Mzee’s infectious smile, and the wrongness of his death. “You died handcuffed on the floor like a slave,” declares Roxanne Tagoe, a family friend whose poetic tribute to Mzee draws nods of approval during the funeral. “I make you a promise, we will fight to the end. We will find out who killed you, my friend.”
“Over the centuries, our people have been marginalised by systems that have been orchestrated by racism!” another relative reads. “Slavery and racism are demons. How many of us have experienced racism first hand?” It’s a question that resonates. The family trace their lineage back to that era of slavery in Jamaica. “This land where we are burying Mzee was inherited from my great, great grandfather, who had been a slave,” said Mzee’s aunt, Carmen Hutchinson. “When he was freed, he cultivated all these lands: coffee, oranges, pimento, potato and yam.” Two centuries later, traces of slavery permeate all aspects of life. The night before Mzee’s funeral, family and friends gathered for his wake, under a night sky made smokey by the jerk chicken barbecue, a ritual that some call “Nine Night”, a name handed down by African slaves who believed it took nine days for the deceased’s spirit to return home to Africa. Slavery ended in Jamaica in 1833, but its abolition was the start of a poverty that has persisted, prompting Jamaicans to migrate abroad in search of a better life. So many have left that Jamaica’s diaspora is now at least as big as its home population: nearly 2m Jamaicans live in the US; 650,000 in the UK. A greater number of second and third generation descendants are British, American and Canadian citizens. As a result, the question of what happens to Jamaicans when they leave the island is a sensitive one. “Our children leave Jamaica to prosper,” said Hutchinson, two of whose daughters have emigrated to the US. “It’s the best thing to do: the opportunities are there. But the racism… I’m worried about our young men.” Mandeville has become known as a centre for “returnees” – Jamaicans in the diaspora who have decided to return home, disillusioned with life abroad and attracted by the availability of land and a crime rate that’s lower than Kingston and Montego Bay. Mzee was hoping to be among them. In recent years he had become increasingly intent on emigrating to Jamaica. That fact, well known among all who knew him, only deepens the sorrow of those walking alongside his coffin on its last journey, up a steep path behind his 90-year-old grandmother’s house, past the lines of washing and the rainwater pool for watering vegetables. A newly cast white concrete tomb, painfully bright in the midday sun, slowly disappears beneath a crowd of mourners, and the women begin singing spirituals: “No Grave Can Hold My Body Down.” For his mother Karla, the final frontier between her and abject grief falls away. As the coffin is pushed gently into the tomb, her low wailing is the most powerful sound."
2016-10-01T23:22:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Internee 91057: why Iraqi ‘bombmaker’ wants to have his day in a British court,"In February 2007 a strike team from 1 Yorks Regiment raided an Iraqi house believing that it held a Mahdi Army insurgent who was making improvised explosive devices for use against coalition forces. Tensions were running high. The week before, two soldiers from the regiment had been killed and another two seriously injured in IED attacks. According to testimony filed in court by one of the team, which was retracted and then resubmitted, they entered the house and found an “unknown male … messing about with an EFP (explosively formed penetrator) IED.” The unknown male was Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed who alleges that after being assaulted he was bundled into a vehicle by the soldiers who threw an acidic liquid into his eyes and used what felt like “cutter pliers” to “pinch and twist” his skin. The Ministry of Defence contends that the injuries were inflicted by the Mahdi Army before the soldiers had arrived and that Waheed was an insurgent. Now, in a high-profile case that has provoked a furore in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, the armed forces and government and which has come to crystalise the row over ‘ambulance chasing lawyers’ versus British troops, Waheed is seeking compensation from the MoD for alleged mistreatment and unlawful detention. His is one of three test cases filed against the MoD that will help the judge hearing them, Mr Justice Leggatt, determine how to proceed with a further 600 or so similar claims. The MoD has already opted to settle one of the three cases. This is in addition to about 300 or so other claims it has already settled, paying out almost £20m. About a dozen cases have been dropped. According to his closing submission filed into court, many of Waheed’s claims have gone unchallenged by the MoD. He alleges that he was subject to sensory deprivation, held in solitary confinement and denied adequate shelter, bedding, food and water. The MoD, which declined to call as a witness the Royal Military Police captain assigned to investigate Waheed’s injuries, is resisting his claim for compensation. “Opportunistic claims arising from operations overseas are costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,” a spokeswoman for the MoD explained. “The MOD will continue to vigorously defend these claims whenever possible.” Records show that shortly after Waheed was captured, a Dr Moy emailed a Major Hazelton of the Royal Military Police. “I have concerns regarding the handling of Internee 91057 [Waheed]. He has arrived at the DTDF [divisional temporary detainment facility] with extensive bruising over his upper back and arms. This bruising is linear, and suggestive of being struck repeatedly with an implement. I suggest that it is unlikely these injuries were sustained during a struggle; he appears to have been deliberately beaten.” Within hours of Waheed being picked up, investigators with the army’s joint forward intelligence team (JFIT) expressed doubts about their captive. “It is now possible that 91057 is, in fact, not involved in the manufacture of IEDs,” one JFIT email states. “However, we have yet to reliably establish the full extent of his involvement.” A few days later another email noted: “The subject can provide no more information on Ali Jaleel [a suspected bombmaker and the chief target of the raid] and that he has not been involved in any militant activities.” An email on 24 February 2007 – almost a fortnight after Waheed was seized – concluded: “There is a dearth of exploitable information regarding this subject, and it does appear to the JFIT that this is a case of ‘wrong place, wrong time’. He has shown his willingness to provide ... any information required.” In March a decision was taken to release Waheed. But what of the soldier’s testimony that Waheed was found with an IED? Documents show that after he was seized, a swab taken from him was run through a particle detector to identify trace residues. The detector showed a one-bar reading, which means, according to the forensic specialist who ran the test, that “he was far away from an explosive”. Establishing what happened during the raid - where it is accepted that bombs were discovered - would benefit from photographs or video footage of Waheed’s capture. Guidance on strike operations makes clear such recordings should be taken, but much of the footage, and that of many of Waheed’s interrogation sessions, is missing. The case comes at a combustible time. The Iraq historic allegations team (Ihat), set up by the Labour government to investigate allegations of abuse by British forces, stands accused of hounding former soldiers through the courts. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has complained that they are “victims of a witch hunt”. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said she is determined to protect the armed forces against “vexatious complaints” and will use this week’s Tory party conference to announce a crackdown on no-win, no-fee lawyers. Yesterday the former head of the armed forces, Lord Dannatt, called for Ihat to be wound down. “This is a battle between the armed forces, politicians and lawyers, and there is a feeling that lawyers should butt out,” said John Cooper, QC, who has represented the families of armed forces personnel in many cases against the MoD. “Lawyers expect to be given as much as we give out, but when politicians start wading in and almost supporting the undermining of legal firms and lawyers for taking cases which, after all, is their job, it becomes very worrying indeed.” About 100 of the 600 or so civil claims – including that of Waheed – being brought against the MoD by the law firm Leigh Day have been referred to Ihat, which is now investigating almost 1,500 alleged incidents. Nevertheless, the two discrete legal processes have become conflated in many people’s minds. This is partly due to the fallout from the Al-Sweady Inquiry, the £31m investigation into the alleged abuse of Iraqi detainees, which found that claims of murder and torture against British troops were the result of “deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”. Public Interest Lawyers, one of the firms that brought the claims, was closed down after questions were raised about the evidence it presented to the inquiry. Leigh Day meanwhile has been referred by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) to answer allegations about the way it handled some of the cases. The firm denies the allegations and says that the referral to the SRA by the MoD was “political”. Cooper also believes that the backlash against the lawyers confronting the MoD has a political context, taking place as it does amid calls for troops in combat conditions to be exempted from the Human Rights Act: “I’m not saying that when you are in hand -to-hand combat you’ve got to start thinking, does this breach the law? But it should apply in cases where there have been substantiated allegations of torturing people in custody.” That detainees have suffered at the hands of British troops is accepted. Even the Al-Sweady inquiry concluded that some detainees had been mistreated, though not deliberately. Last month three British soldiers who forced an Iraqi teenager into a canal – a practice known as “wetting” – which resulted in him drowning were condemned by a judge. The Baha Mousa inquiry concluded that the hotel worker’s death in British army custody was caused by “factors including lack of food and water, heat, exhaustion, fear, previous injuries and the hooding and stress positions used by British troops – and a final struggle with his guards”. The inquiry heard that Mousa suffered at least 93 injuries prior to his death in September 2003 and that several practices he was subjected to were banned by UK law and the Geneva convention. Whatever the truth of Waheed’s claims against the MoD, his case, like that of many other detainees bringing actions, highlights the army’s abject failure to anticipate what to do with them once it became an occupying force, a failure identified from the outset by Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Mercer, the army’s chief legal adviser in Iraq. Mercer told the Baha Mousa inquiry: “I was acutely aware of the complete lack of planning for detainees and internees … and raised this repeatedly through the chain of command.” But in postwar Iraq detainees were not a priority. Among the documents forming part of the Waheed case is the joint forward intelligence team operational directive issued to his interrogators. It urges: “Manipulate each internee as you see fit to suit your own ends. Do not worry about upsetting them.” Legal claims against British troops Baha Mousa Inquiry Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist, died in custody in 2003. An inquiry chaired by Sir William Gage found that he had been beaten by large numbers of British soldiers, and subject to sleep deprivation, banned stress positions and hooding. Corporal Donald Payne was convicted of inhuman treatment and jailed for a year. Al-Sweady Inquiry It was alleged that British troops killed 20 unarmed civilians and abused others detained after a battle with Shia insurgents in 2004. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Thayne Forbes, concluded that all the dead had been killed in battle and . the allegations were “without merit”. Ihat Established in March 2010, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team was set up by the MoD to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct and abuse of Iraqi civilians by the British armed forces. Ihat has a remit to refer allegations with sufficient evidence to the Service Prosecutions Authority and dispose of those it judges to be baseless. As of March, Ihat was investigating 1,374 cases involving more than 1,500 victims. Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day In April, amid concerns about its use of the evidence, PIL, the law firm behind many of the claims investigated by the Al-Sweady inquiry, was referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and wound up soon after. The MoD has also referred another law firm involved in the Al-Sweady inquiry, Leigh Day, to the SRA. The firm says it intends to contest claims against it."
2016-10-01T23:30:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Leisure firm Flamingo Land sets its sights on the banks of Loch Lomond,"On the banks of Loch Lomond, a battle for cultural supremacy has been joined as intense as the Jacobite skirmishes that sanctified this soil 300 years ago. The largest inland expanse of water in Great Britain has been at the heart of Scottish culture and commerce for thousands of years. At its most northerly it announces the Scottish Highlands, while the most southerly point is barely half an hour’s drive from Glasgow. Now, a southerly stretch of its bonnie banks is in ferment once more. A corridor of parkland bounded by trees near the village of Balloch is at the centre of a planning row which has evoked deep feelings about Loch Lomond sparked by a million childhood memories. Flamingo Land, a leisure company that owns a theme park in Yorkshire, has been given preferred bidder status to develop 44 acres into a holiday complex. The announcement sparked a furious online response from all over the world. It seemed unthinkable that a portion of Scotland’s history could be given to a firm whose name evokes something from a 1980s George Michael pop video. The company’s prospectus mentions the ubiquitous hotel, lodges and “glamping pods” as well as retail opportunities and adventure activity. They stress that, though they operate a theme park with adventure rides, their plans for Loch Lomond will bear no comparison. “It will not be a theme park,” a company spokesman said. To date, more than 30,000 signatures have been gathered by 38 Degrees, the petitions website. A cursory glance at the reasons for objection offers an indication of what many people instinctively felt when the development was announced. Curiously though, the Scottish Campaign for National Parks which seeks to protect some of Scotland’s wild and open spaces by having national park status conferred upon them is relaxed about the development – for the moment. James Fraser is a director of the SCNP and is also chair of the influential Friends of Loch Lomond. Few other people know this area as well as he does. “Let’s face it,” he said, “there are unfortunate connotations with the name Flamingo Land. If they had been called something like ‘Forest Trail’ this wouldn’t have elicited anything like the heat. “I completely understand why so many people have been alarmed at what’s being proposed. But I think that many people have reacted without being aware of the history of this site. It comprises three parcels of land which had previously been in industrial use and which had only itself been re-generated recently to create a small park and trees beside the water.” Scottish Enterprise, Scotland’s national economic development agency, which named Flamingo Land as the preferred bidders, has been painted as the villain. Yet it only stepped in to buy the land after a local campaign had prevented it becoming a building site for new houses. The land was always designated for economic development so long as it was in keeping with the surrounding environment. The local community has also been broadly supportive. Residents and retailers in Balloch recently held a meeting to discuss ways of rejuvenating a beautiful but economically fading neighbourhood. The village stands at the end of a corridor of water that links it to the larger loch. The village wants to gain better access to the loch and, if the Flamingo Land plans are approved, it could provide the jobs and attractions that will attract visitors who want to stay in the area for more than just a day. Michael Wright, of Scottish Enterprise, is not duly concerned about what is being proposed and feels that it will provide an economic opportunity in an area that had been neglected. “This land was always going to be redeveloped. The first stage was the development of Loch Lomond Shores which had formerly been used as a gravel pit. This is the second stage and, though it will involve the felling of some trees, some of these were felt to have obscured desirable views of the greater loch.” Loch Lomond’s global status does not rest simply on its beauty and the grandeur of the peaks that surround it. When Glasgow was at the height of its industrial powers, factory workers would arrive here by their trainloads to camp, swim and fish. The loch occupies a special place in the affections of urban, working-class families who grew up beguiled by sights and smells never encountered in their normal lives. Fraser is adamant that he and the Friends of Loch Lomond would “strenuously oppose” any development that was not faithful to the beauty of Loch Lomond or to the memories of generations of Lowland Scottish families. “This part of Dunbartonshire is an unemployment blackspot and, so long as the development is carried out properly and sensitively, there’s no reason why the local community shouldn’t want to derive some economic benefits from it.” There are others, though, who oppose the idea of any development in an area of such unspoilt beauty. In recent years, popular feeling prevented a windfarm development at Loch Ness and every step of a major housing development in Aviemore is currently being disputed On Thursday morning through driving rain and leaden skies it was still possible once more to behold the unique splendour of this place. The site of the proposed development is several hundred yards back from the loch itself, the views of which are obscured by trees. In the final analysis, Loch Lomond’s worldwide appeal will probably ensure that the development, when it happens, is as pristine, sustainable and sympathetic to the surrounding environment as anything containing “glamping pods” ever could be. A free consultation would tell them that the name Flamingo Land must not be seen in the vicinity of this place. DEFENDING THE LAND A controversial windfarm development above Loch Ness by energy company E.ON was scrapped in June, delighting locals at Fort Augustus as well as protesters, who claimed the scheme threatened the area’s fragile ecosystem. In 2015 the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park authority was accused of a “cover-up” over the resignation of one of its leading members for failing to declare shares in a gold mining company. Protesters say the goldmine, near Tyndrum, poses a danger to the surrounding flora and fauna. Plans for quarrying near the New Lanark Unesco world heritage site 30 miles south of Glasgow at the famous Falls of Clyde caused an uproar in 2013. The proposal was ditched by the Scottish government after a petition signed by 10,000 people. This article was amended on 5 October 2016. The first paragraph originally said Loch Lomond was the largest inland expanse of water in the United Kingdom. It is the largest in Great Britain: Loch Neagh in Northern Ireland is the largest waterway in the UK."
2016-10-02T16:04:41Z,uk-news,UK news,"More than half of Unite's female officers bullied or harassed, study finds","More than half the female officers in Britain’s biggest union claim to have been bullied or sexually harassed by fellow officials or members in their workplaces, a leaked internal study has found. The report about the treatment and working conditions of female representatives at Unite also concluded that a quarter of employed officers believe allegations of bullying were not handled well by the union when they were reported. Titled Women Officers in Unite, the report cited an official who said she felt increasingly isolated at work because of male officials talking among themselves. “I have to sit among colleagues who refer to our secretaries as the girls … [They] think it is correct to refer to black people as coloured, talk about chairmen, refer to women as a piece of skirt,” one female officer said. One woman told interviewers she was “sexually assaulted by a senior officer in the past”. The report did not go into any further details of her case and did not explain whether the woman reported the assault to police or the union. However it is understood that incident took place in 2007 before Unite was formed through the amalgamation of three unions. Some of the worst examples of intimidation came from members in external workplaces. One woman reported she had been told in a meeting that she needed “a good ****”. Another respondent blamed the union’s senior management for failing to commit to inclusivity. The report quoted her as saying: “The old-boys network is alive and kicking unfortunately in Unite, where it is who you know and where they come from that matters.” The findings are contained in the 39-page internal report about the working lives of the union’s 74 female officers, who support the union’s members and elected shop stewards on shop floors and in offices. It was commissioned by Unite’s officers national committee (ONC) in February and presented to senior management in May. Unite’s executive is considering the four-month-old findings. Howard Beckett, Unite’s executive director for legal services, said the union had not received any complaint of assault and would have reported any such incident to the police. He pointed out that members are not union employees. “If an officer has a complaint about a member, we are restricted to consideration of the suitability of the member to be in the union. “The union, of course, encouraged the ONC to consult female officers about their experience in the workplaces where our members work. Len McCluskey [Unite’s general secretary] has actively promoted gender balance in the officer core and women now occupy the most senior positions within the union … as such any allegation of an ‘old-boy network’ is simply untrue,” he said. The report concluded, however, that a majority of female officers agree that Unite colleagues and reps are supportive and interested in what they do – although nearly 40% believe that talking about working concerns with the union and colleagues is seen as a weakness.
The leaked report emerges almost a week after Unite failed to overturn a ruling that it was responsible for the sexual harassment and bullying of a female former official. Sally Nailard, who was forced to leave her job as Unite’s regional officer at Heathrow, claimed she had been subjected to a two-year campaign including lewd and aggressive comments from shop stewards who wanted her to leave her job. When she appealed to the union’s senior figures for help, she claimed they helped force her out. An employment appeals tribunal on Tuesday upheld a previous judgement that Unite was responsible for sexual harassment she suffered at the hands of shop stewards and that her dismissal was an act of sexual discrimination. Sources close to the case believe it could set a legal precedent of making unions responsible for sexism by shop stewards in the workplace in certain circumstances and open the way for other women to seek redress. Nailard, 51, who has not worked since leaving Unite two years ago, said: “I am very pleased that the responsibility of the trade union Unite for the actions of its shop stewards has finally been established. I sincerely hope that the [tribunal’s] decision will benefit all of my female former colleague officers who work for Unite as well as for female colleague officers who work in other trade unions.” Beckett said the lay representatives were employed by Heathrow Airport Ltd and not by Unite. “We dispute that any representative is acting as the union’s agent in circumstances where they are abusive to an officer. Lay representatives’ sole role is to represent their fellow workers in their workplace and they have no authority to be a union ‘agent’. “Unite will be appealing this element of the judgment,” he said. Nailard had been a union officer for a year when, she claimed, a number of union members began to orchestrate a campaign of bullying and harassment against her. She alleged that, during one branch meeting in early 2013, she was “verbally attacked, abused and threatened” by a union member to such an extent that “she felt physically unsafe”. On 1 July last year, an employment tribunal had ruled that Unite was liable for the bullying and sexual harassment of Nailard by two male elected officials of the union. She resigned and the tribunal said this amounted to unfair constructive dismissal. There was no finding that any employee of Unite had acted in a discriminatory manner."
2016-10-03T06:00:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Leeds homelessness protesters fight legal bid to evict tent city,"The organisers of a homelessness protest, in which around 50 rough sleepers have pitched tents in Leeds city centre, are due to appear in court to fight a bid to disperse them. The “tent city” was set up on 21 September to protest against a perceived lack of action by the council to tackle homelessness in Leeds. Leeds Homeless Action Group has called on the council to provide rough sleepers with a safe space to sleep, but the council has argued there is accommodation available for every person sleeping on the streets if they want it. Continuously staffed by volunteers, who distribute donated clothing, food and hot drinks to homeless people sleeping in the tents, the project was first pitched outside the city’s art gallery before it was ordered to move last week to make way for Yorkshire’s Olympics celebrations. Now on its second site in Park Square, which is home to many of the city’s law firms, the protest faces having to move again as the council has issued a claim for possession of the square. The council is also asking for an injunction to stop the organisers setting up the project at other sites across the city centre. The case will be heard at Leeds county court on Monday. Haydn Jessop, one of the protest’s organisers, said that gathering lots of the city’s rough sleepers in one place gives them “a bigger voice”. “When you get off the bus in the morning to go to work you might see one or two rough sleepers, but the total number of rough sleepers doesn’t go into people’s minds,” he said. He argued that bringing rough sleepers together makes the scale of the problem clear. “And we’re only touching the iceberg with this,” said Jessop. “There are hundreds in Leeds, all in different areas.” Leeds’s tent city is one of many such communities of homeless people to emerge in towns across the country, inspired by similar projects in Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Many of the tents and sleeping bags were salvaged after being abandoned at Leeds festival this summer. Jessop, who was once homeless himself, wants the council to provide a permanent, secure space for the project. He said police told the group privately that crime has fallen in the area since the start of the protest because the rough sleepers are being properly provided for. Michael Eric Bleasby, who has been homeless for four years and has been sleeping at the tent city since it started, said he has witnessed provision for homeless people decline in the city. “I used to walk around Leeds and there used to be loads of hostels, but all the hostels have shut down. They’ve all been turned into studio flats for the students and I don’t recognise it anymore,” he said. Helen Hayton, a volunteer with the project, said rough sleepers live in constant fear of being beaten up, but that the tent city provides a safe environment. When she was volunteering at the protest’s last site late at night, she had to stop people urinating on the tents in which people were sleeping. “[The rough sleepers] are looking a lot more well because they’re getting a proper night’s sleep now,” she said. A statement on behalf of Leeds city council, West Yorkshire police and Leeds BID (business improvement district) said helping the homeless remained an absolute priority for them. “There is a strong collaborative approach with businesses and third sector organisations to offer access to a wide range of support services and a bed for the night to ensure that no one has to sleep on the streets,” they said. “We have asked the Leeds Homeless Action Group to become part of this collaborative approach so they can make a positive contribution and work on practical solutions to help those in genuine need. This offer still stands despite the fact that the Leeds Homeless Action Group is not an official or registered homeless support group or charitable organisation.”
The camp’s organisers have complained that figures by the Department for Communities and Local Government – which suggest 13 people were sleeping rough in Leeds in Autumn 2015, down from 15 the previous year – massively underestimate the scale of the problem. “Despite their good intentions, unfortunately the Leeds Homeless Action Group have made a number of inaccurate claims,” the statement from the authorities reads. “The head count which they refer to relates to the number of rough sleepers in the city and not the number of homeless people. These issues are extremely complex, and the circumstances of beggars, rough sleepers and the homeless are not always interlinked or the same. “Accommodation is available in the city and offers are made to rough sleepers on a daily basis but for a variety of complex reasons some will refuse a place to stay,” they said. “As well as working with rough sleepers, the council and partners work with homeless people and people who beg on a daily basis to provide much needed support. Offers of accommodation will always be made to anyone who is without accommodation and if we are contacted or made aware of an individuals’ situation. “While the issue of accommodation is extremely important, this does distract sometimes from other complex issues such as how we can engage people often with complex mental health needs and addictions in the support that is available.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2016. An earlier version said Office for National Statistics figures suggested 13 people were sleeping rough in Leeds in autumn 2015. That figure was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government."
2016-10-03T09:06:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Needham search police in talks to demolish Kos farmhouse,"Police searching for missing toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos are negotiating to knock down part of a farmhouse on the search site. Nineteen South Yorkshire police officers, forensic specialists and an archaeologist have been scouring an arid stretch of farmland where the 21-month-old toddler went missing in 1991 as part of a new line of inquiry. DI Jon Cousins said he was trying to persuade a family who own a farmhouse at the site to let him demolish part of the structure. “There is reason for me to consider removing a small part of this farmhouse so that I can be sure that I have not missed any opportunity to find the answers that I need to.” Cousins said a 1991 press photograph showed that part of the building was not there when Ben went missing but added that negotiations were difficult as many members of the family that owned the building had grown up there. “I fully understand the concern that the family have,” he said. The officer also said the operation was back on schedule after an issue last week when a suspected ancient burial site was discovered. Ben’s sister, Leighanna Needham, meanwhile, described her family’s pain as they waited for news. “None of us want to believe that we were going to find something there because that’s 25 years of fighting and pain and hurt that could have been ended 25 years ago,” she told Good Morning Britain. “We’re a family that’s lived in hope. And what do you do when that hope’s all gone? How do you continue when there’s nothing left?” The Kos excavation began after reports that the Sheffield toddler may have been killed and buried there, yards from where he vanished while his grandfather was renovating a property. Police are investigating claims that the toddler might have been killed by a digger driver working on the 2.5-acre site. Konstantinos Barkas was clearing land near where Ben was playing on the day he vanished and may have accidentally killed him, a friend of the builder reportedly told police following a TV appeal in May. The driver died of stomach cancer last year. His widow, Varvara, strongly dismissed any suggestions her late husband had killed Ben. There have been several theories over the toddler’s fate and reported sightings since his disappearance. But his mother, Kerry Needham, was recently told to “prepare for the worst”. Last week, she told the Daily Mirror: “Not even in my worst nightmares has Ben ever been dead … until now. I’ve been waking up and finding my pillow wet with tears.” She added that she was angry when police told her about the tip-off and she now lives in fear that each day will bring the “worst news possible”."
2016-10-03T09:18:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Corrie McKeague: police play down fears missing serviceman was abducted,"Police searching for a missing RAF serviceman have played down his mother’s fears that he may have been abducted. Corrie McKeague, 23, was last seen in the early hours of 24 September when CCTV footage showed him with a takeaway meal meandering through the streets of Bury St Edmunds, 11 miles from his base at RAF Honington. His mother, Nicola Urquhart, said she was worried that he might have been kidnapped, and said this had been mentioned as a possibility by the police. She has also pleaded for anyone who may have seen him to come forward. She said: “My son has disappeared, so if anyone knows anything, get in touch with Suffolk police. We would like him to come home soon so please get in touch.” She said her son would “never, never” be out of contact with his family for so long. He had spoken to his brother four times the day before he went missing. “This is not Corrie, he would not do this out of choice,” she added. Her appeal comes after Urquhart told the Sunday Times: “It’s looking more and more suspicious as time goes on that they’re not actually finding him. It [kidnapping] is something that they’re thinking of.” The paper cited the attempted kidnap in July of a serviceman jogging near his base at RAF Marham, 30 miles north of Bury St Edmunds. But a spokesman for Suffolk police said the two incidents were different, and the possibility that McKeague had been kidnapped “has never been a main line of inquiry”. He said the force was concerned about McKeague’s welfare, but there was no evidence of foul play. “The most likely scenario is that he has been for a night out, he’s had a bit to drink and he’s attempted to walk back [to the base]. That is the working theory – obviously we keep an open mind to every possibility.” The spokesman added: “The incident in RAF Marham where [the serviceman] was out jogging in the vicinity of the base was a totally different circumstance.”
On Sunday police said they had widened the search area after carrying out extensive checks along the A134 between Bury St Edmunds and the Honington base. Search and rescue teams and police helicopters have been combing the area. GPS data from McKeague’s mobile phone suggests it moved to the Barton Mills area, 22 miles to the north-west of Bury St Edmunds and near two other airbases, RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath. Police have not recovered the phone, but they believe it may have been lost or discarded as the timings of the movements match a bin lorry run from Bury to Barton Mills. A bin lorry is being searched. Police do not believe McKeague himself was picked up by the bin lorry, as the weight of the load was recorded as under 15kg (2st 5lbs). Police have been working with staff at RAF Honington since McKeague was first reported missing. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that an RAF serviceman from RAF Honington is currently missing; our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time. “The civilian police have primacy in this matter and we understand that the investigation is ongoing. It would not be appropriate for the MoD to comment or speculate on the case at this time.” Police have released photographs of the type of clothing McKeague is believed to have been wearing when he disappeared. They show a pink Ralph Lauren shirt and brown suede Timberland boots.
McKeague is described as white, 1.78 metres (5ft 10ins), of medium build, with short light brown hair. Ch Insp Steve Denham said: “This behaviour is totally out of character for Corrie and we are very concerned for his welfare. We are still examining CCTV in Bury St Edmunds town centre and urging any friends or members of the public who may have seen or spoken to Corrie over the course of the evening of Friday 23 September and the early hours of Saturday 24 September in Bury St Edmunds to come forward. “We are also appealing for people or drivers in the local area or further afield who may have seen him after our last confirmed sighting of him on Brentgovel Street at 3.20am to contact us.” Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2016-10-03T10:54:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Met chief expected to avoid personal criticism in Operation Midland review,"The Metropolitan police commissioner is expected to escape personal and substantive criticism over his force’s collapsed investigation into claims that powerful members of the establishment abused and murdered children. An inquiry by the retired judge Sir Richard Henriques into the conduct of Operation Midland, which investigated senior military and political figures, is expected to be completed this month and will criticise decisions made by officers. Some involved believe Henriques has been less than sympathetic to the challenges officers faced when presented with claims of abuse dating back to 1975. The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said last week his decision to retire early was not linked to the Henriques inquiry, which he commissioned in February. The £2m Operation Midland ended in March having found insufficient evidence to arrest anyone let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge. A complainant known as Nick claimed politicians and military figures abused children in London and the home counties between 1975 and 1984, when he was aged between seven and 16. Detectives found indirect support for some of Nick’s account, such as locations of places and descriptions of interiors, which they believed could only have come from him having been in those places. His accounts could not be disproved, and police policy at the time was that a victim’s account should be treated as true unless it could be shown to be wrong. “You can’t look at that [account] and discount it,” said one source. Nick’s claims led to allegations against public figures including Lords Bramall and Brittan and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. All denied the allegations against them. Scotland Yard will face trouble if Henriques rules against it on the question of whether it was right to investigate. Police have been criticised in some quarters for the length of time they took to make their inquiries. An earlier review by Dorset police found the Met was right to investigate an allegation of rape against Brittan. Brittan died in January 2015 not knowing that police had four months previously concluded he had no case to answer. The Met has said concerns raised by Brittan’s widow and by Bramall would be considered by the Henriques review. Hogan-Howe has met both of them in private to express “regret about the distress felt”. The Met has faced claims it covered up abuse in the past, which has led to 32 investigations overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Henriques examined whether a policy that “the victim should always be believed” should be dropped. Hogan-Howe claimed it was recommended in 2014 by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. But the head of HMIC, Sir Tom Winsor, said Hogan-Howe had misunderstood its advice. Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary, said the watchdog had ordered in 2014 that victims should be automatically believed only for the purposes of recording a crime in official statistics. The watchdog had said nothing about how claims should be investigated, and it was wrong to mix up the two, he said. Operation Midland concluded with no dates of alleged attacks having been established, nor any direct evidence of murder uncovered. The Henriques report will not be published in full, but its recommendations will be. One area it may consider is how much information complainants should be given about investigations into their claims. The Met has said it did not give details to the media that could lead to suspects being identified, but details given to complainants may have been passed to the media."
2016-10-03T11:11:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Revolt at the Reform Club after changes brought in by new chief,"It is one of London’s grandest clubs, founded 180 years ago by a group of Whig and Radical MPs. Past members include prime ministers (Winston Churchill, Lloyd George), novelists (EM Forster and Henry James) and writers of detective fiction (Arthur Conan Doyle). Current members are diplomats, peers, academics, lawyers. Plus the bloke next door: the Prince of Wales. But the Reform Club in Pall Mall – once synonymous with enlightened causes – is now at the centre of a bitter internal row. It follows the election of a new chairman, Hitesh Tailor, who – ironically enough – has tried to reform the way the club is run. Tailor’s choice of candidate for the job of club secretary has triggered a huge revolt. A group of members led by the Tory peer Richard Balfe is seeking to have the selection process rerun. They are calling for an extraordinary general meeting. They have circulated a letter to members asking for support. “We believe the process has been inadequate and inappropriate,” Balfe writes, describing the Reform as “our great club”. Meanwhile, several staff who keep the Grade I-listed building going have recently quit. One has blamed “egotistical management” and a clash over whether it is more important to carry out planned repairs or to hang paintings in the gents’ toilets. The club’s ruling body – the general committee or GC – is itself bitterly divided. The GC is made up of 15 members elected every year by popular ballot. The row began in January when members voted in Tailor as GC chairman. Tailor was elected against the convention that a chairman serves two years in the job, with his predecessor Richard Lewis voted out. Tailor’s critics claim he is an aloof and abrasive leader. His supporters say he has merely tried to improve corporate governance practices. Those who do not like his management style are a small and vexatious bunch of “chronic complainers”, they add. Nevertheless, in August the Reform’s facilities manager, Alan Hinton, became the latest staff member to quit. Hinton had overseen a huge restoration of the club’s Italianate palazzo clubhouse, with the sumptuous saloon and library repainted at a cost of £4m.
In a blistering letter of resignation, seen by the Guardian, Hinton said he was “unhappy and disillusioned”. He said he could no longer work in an environment he claimed had an “overpowering, self-destructive and egotistical management structure”. “There is a ‘hardcore’ number of members of staff who love the Reform Club, the building, the traditions and values it represents. I am not eloquent enough to put into words the pain and frustration we feel when we see petty politics tearing the club apart,” he wrote. According to Hinton, staff morale was “at an all-time low”. He said he was sad to witness “the slow, painful and totally avoidable decline” of an institution to which he had dedicated six years of his life now in the hands of a “ruling junta”. His colleagues were “frustrated and scared”, he said. Hinton declined to comment. Paul Austin, from the club’s general office, said: “As a private members’ club it’s our policy never to discuss our internal matters with the media.” This week’s letter by Balfe claims the club has ended up paying “around half a million pounds” after the two previous club secretaries resigned. The last one, a former Falklands helicopter pilot, left last year on the grounds of ill health. The controversy concerns the selection of a replacement. An executive search company run by Richard Evans – a GC member and Tailor ally – drew up a shortlist of five candidates. An internal panel then offered the job to a retired naval officer, Lt Cmdr Rodney Craig. Balfe and other GC members say the process lacked transparency. They want it rerun. Others say it was perfectly fair. Evans declined to comment, emailing: “We never discuss our internal matters with the media.” Meanwhile, Tailor’s name appears in the Panama Papers in connection with an offshore company, Polyver Inc, set up in 2008. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing and Tailor says he has no connection with any Panama company and no idea why he features in the leaked database. The company – set up by a friend of Tailor’s who works as a Swiss lawyer – was struck off in 2012. The lawyer said he had no recollection of involving Tailor in his company at any time. It is not illegal to own offshore companies.
The Reform Club was founded in 1836 and became the HQ of the new Liberal party. In keeping with its progressive traditions, in 1981 it became one of the first gentleman’s clubs to admit women. These days it is not associated with any political party. Its 2,600 members pay fees of about £1,500 a year. Critics claim the club’s finances have been poorly managed. According to one estimate, it has lost £865,000 on catering over the past five years. Others point out the Reform is in “surplus” overall, and say the critics cannot read a balance sheet properly. They add that the dinners held in a splendid mahogany room offer good value for money. “The food has got better,” one noted. This is not the first time the Reform has found itself engulfed by civil war. In 2012 a previous chairman Hugh Colver, a former Tory party spin doctor, fell out with the club secretary Michael McKerchar. McKerchar left after a six-figure payout. This war, however, appears to be particularly bitter. An anonymous letter sent to the Guardian last week, and signed “a sad and angry member”, alleged that the club had long suffered from a culture of bullying. A few members bullied the club’s 100-strong staff, the letter claimed. This had created a “toxic atmosphere below stairs”.
“While the bullying culture remains rampant ‘above stairs’ and the chairman and committee refuses to tackle it, the club is a pretty grim place to be,” the letter alleged. “It is ironic that a place which was founded in the spirit of Reform, promotes equality and makes a new members pledge to ‘uphold the principles of Reform” is sadly lacking in reforming zeal when it comes to handling workplace relations. “Pall Mall is back in the dark ages!” News of the Reform’s woes were “now spreading through Clubland”, the letter claimed. The management’s priorities were “entertaining celebrity guests, organising balls and dinners” and “spending the members’ money on buying quasi-historic artefacts”, it said. Supporters of the current management have rubbished the letter’s claims. They say Tailor has brought in a new rule allowing staff to complain about members. Previously, this was deemed unnecessary on the grounds that all members were gentlemen. Other members, however, said they were unaware of any disputes inside the club. One said he had joined because of the Reform’s “excellent library” and for the chance to mingle with fellow professionals. The Reform is home to ex-politicians including Roy Hattersley, Betty Boothroyd and the former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell. The club was trying hard to attract younger people, the member said. The price of wine had gone up after members “drank the old stock”, he said. Overall, he added, the Reform offered a positive experience in “one of the most splendid buildings” of any West End club. Another longstanding member said: “The Reform is not an old gentleman’s club where you have a bottle of claret at lunch and fall asleep in the afternoon under a copy of the Times. Despite the current difficulties and backbiting, it has a hugely impressive list of social events and societies.”"
2016-10-03T12:08:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail says it will sack conductors unless deal over role is reached,"Southern rail has issued an ultimatum to the RMT union that it will sack conductors unless a deal is reached by Thursday. The franchise, run by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), has faced months of disruption, cancellations and strikes, as well as the emergence of commuter activism, while the company battled with the union. The company wants to change the role of conductors to “on board supervisors”, but the RMT says the proposed changes put passenger safety at risk. GTR’s chief executive, Charles Horton, wrote to Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, on Monday, calling the dispute “pointless” and putting a deadline on an eight-point offer first issued by the company in August. Horton has offered all conductors on the franchise a £2,000 bonus if the changes to their role are agreed, but warned that the company could claw this back if the union continued to strike. If the deal is not accepted by midday on Thursday, GTR said it would press on with changes “including the issuing of notice later this week to those conductors moving to the OBS [on board supervisor] role”. Cash said the RMT would not be “caving in” to Southern’s demands. “RMT is making it clear this morning that jobs, safety and access on Southern rail services are not for sale for £2,000,” he said. “This dispute has never been about money; it is about guaranteeing that there is a second, safety critical member of staff on board the current Southern rail services.” A similar dispute with Scottish rail operator ScotRail had been solved by a deal guaranteeing a second staff member on all services, he said. “The union is ready for talks and has been throughout ... Despite the Southern spin, this dispute is not solely about the doors, it is about giving passengers that safety guarantee that goes with the second member of staff on the train,” Cash said. Horton’s letter was released as Southern faced a backlash following a PR offensive that attempted to harness the social media pressure of frustrated commuters against the union. The company bought newspaper adverts with the slogan “Southern strikes back”, urging passengers to tweet the RMT with their feelings about the standoff. But many took the opportunity to register their support for the union and anger at Southern.
A Southern spokesman said: “Our aim was to get the debate going and to let people know exactly what our very fair and comprehensive offer is, and how we are trying to modernise the train service for our passengers, which the RMT leadership is trying to block.“Thousands of passengers are demanding to know what we are doing to bring this dispute to an end. We felt there was a need to let them know.” Emily Yates, a campaign coordinator for the Association of British Commuters, which was set up in response to the delays and cancellations faced by Southern users, said the PR campaign was “a pretty insane move” and a “staggering misjudgment of what’s going on. It’s deeply dishonest in terms of attributing the cause of the crisis to the RMT”. Cash said of the PR campaign: “This is a pathetic attempt by the basket case Southern franchise to once again try and blame their frontline staff for their own managerial incompetence.”"
2016-10-03T13:25:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Suspected drug smuggler 'plunged to death as yacht was searched',"A suspected drug smuggler plunged to his death from the mast of a yacht as it was being searched by border force officers in the Isles of Scilly, an inquest has heard. Christiaan Woestenburg, whose boat had been towed into harbour by lifeboat charity the RNLI, told officers he was going to fetch some equipment to open a locked hatch on the yacht, Windrose. But Dutch-born Woestenburg, 62, climbed up the 12-metre-high (40ft) mast of the yacht before apparently jumping onto the granite quay of St Mary’s harbour. An inquest jury in Plymouth in Devon was told the 11-metre (36ft) Windrose was in the Atlantic heading to Holland when it suffered problems with its rigging and mast 16 miles off Scilly. Woestenburg called out the St Mary’s lifeboat on Sunday 16 June 2013 after three days without sleep. When the border force heard where the vessel was they sent a cutter to St Mary’s and boarded the yacht searching for hidden drugs. Woestenburg’s younger brother, Otto, said his sibling was an experienced sailor who had made several transatlantic voyages. He said he had bought the yacht in Turkey in 2009 and had sailed to South America and the Dutch Caribbean several times. He said he had seen reports that a “very large” amount of drugs was found on the boat, but he said: “I cannot believe that he would have tried to smuggle drugs. His friends are in shock and disbelief. He was, in fact, anti-drugs.” He said Woestenburg lived frugally and gave generously to charity. St Mary’s assistant harbour master, Alan Hartwell, told the jury the skipper had been at sea for 15 days and away from home for four years. Hartwell said: “He looked completely shattered. He said it was the worst trip he had.” Home Office forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said Woestenburg had been sailing from Portugal and was believed to be heading to Holland. He said: “He was towed to the Isles of Scilly by the RNLI. The boat was tied to a mooring in the harbour. Border Force received some intelligence and the boat was boarded and searched.” Delaney said there was a secured hatch down below and the yachtsman passed officers to go to the deck to fetch hydraulic equipment to open it. Once on deck he climbed the mast. “He then jumped off the top and landed on the solid granite harbourside,” said Delaney. The pathologist said he landed on the quayside. An off-duty paramedic came to his aid and he was airlifted to Truro on the mainland where he was declared dead. Delaney said his postmortem revealed the yachtsman died from head, chest and pelvic injuries that were consistent with a fall from height. He added: “He was immediately unconscious and unaware of what happened. The head injury was unsurviveable.” There was no evidence he had been forcefully restrained. Blood tests showed Woestenburg was slightly over the drink-drive limit and the pathologist said this may have “affected his decision-making but he was not incapacitated by it”. The jurors were told that a “large quantity of class A drugs” was found on board. They were shown police photos of scores of tightly packed packages of drugs hidden in a water tank under a bolted lid. PC Matt Collier, who was on duty that evening, said Woestenburg “dived” onto the quay. The inquest continues."

2016-10-03T14:10:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Police community support officer guilty of raping two young girls,"A former police community support officer has been jailed for 24 years for raping two young girls after one of the children had a flashback when another officer made a routine school visit. Peter Bunyan, 43, from Penzance in Cornwall, was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting the girls when they were aged between three and six. One of the girls remembers him wearing at least some of his police uniform when he attacked her. Bunyan, formerly a PCSO in Camborne and Redruth, was previously jailed for having sex while on duty and for using police computers to collect data about vulnerable women. A jury at Truro crown court found Bunyan guilty on Monday of three counts of rape and one of sexual assault between 2005 and 2009. He was found not guilty of one charge of rape against one of the girls. Bunyan had denied the allegations. The jury heard it was only when one of the girls had a police officer visit her school that her memory was triggered and she began to piece together what happened before confiding in family members and school staff. Medical examinations carried out following the allegations suggested both the girls had suffered injuries that suggested they had been sexually abused. Sentencing Bunyan, judge Simon Carr said: “You assaulted them in a way that they would stay quiet .... Both of the victims have since spoken of the pain they were in during and after the ordeal. “Both of the girls are struggling to come to terms with what happened to them and the utter devastation caused by your actions. The victims have also since self-harmed as a way of coming to terms with it all.” An NSPCC spokesman said: “Bunyan is a sexual predator who is now thankfully behind bars. His appalling crimes robbed his defenceless victims of their childhood and could have a lasting impact well into their adult years. “No child should ever have to experience what the victims went through. It is vital anyone affected can get the support they need rather than suffer in silence, as sadly so many do.” In 2013 at Taunton crown court, Bunyan was found guilty of misconduct in a public office. He had neglected his duties by turning his police radio down on shifts before having sex with women and treated police computers “as a dating agency” by using them to perform background checks on women."
2016-10-03T15:29:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Bradford boy found dead at home 'was reluctant to attend new school',"An 11-year-old boy who was found dead in his bedroom had been reluctant to attend his new secondary school, an inquest has been told. The body of Asad Khan, described as a sweet and innocent child, was found by his mother in his bedroom after he returned home following lessons last Wednesday. Asad’s relatives have said he may have been bullied at Beckfoot Upper Heaton school, which he joined in September. Coroner’s officer Simone Holmes told an inquest on Monday: “He was a fit, healthy, sociable and chatty boy. Recently he’d started a new school; he was reluctant to attend that school.” Martin Fleming, the Bradford coroner, said the death had happened in “heartbreaking circumstances”, before he adjourned the inquest to a provisional date of 24 January. Detectives said on Monday that they had discounted a witness who reportedly saw Asad being beaten up in the school playground hours before his death. DI Paula Bickerdike, of Bradford district police, said: “We have spoken to someone who was reported to have witnessed Asad being assaulted at his school just hours before his death. We have now established that this person did not witness such an incident. “We are continuing to investigate what was happening in his life prior to his death on behalf of the coroner and are appealing for anyone with information which may assist this inquiry to come forward.” Asad is said to have told his mother, Farheen Jan, that he wanted to change schools when he returned home on Wednesday. She found him unresponsive in his bedroom shortly after 4pm. Asama Javed, a governor of Iqra primary school, which Asad attended until July, had earlier said her nephew, also a pupil at Beckfoot Upper Heaton, had seen the boy being bullied on the day of his death. She said: “My nephew said he saw some sixth formers hitting Asad in the playground at lunchtime. He told a teacher, who said they would be dealt with on Friday.” It was not clear whether this was the incident reported to police. After meeting Asad’s parents on Wednesday night, the Bradford West MP, Naz Shah, said he may have been bullied and killed himself. Shah wrote on Facebook: “This evening 11-year-old Asad took his own life. Asad had just started his new school recently and bullying is something that has been mentioned.” Simon Wade, headteacher at Beckfoot Upper Heaton, said in a statement on the school’s website: “It is with great sadness that we learnt of the death of Asad Khan, one of the school’s newest students. “The school is united in its grief at this sad time. The school community is working together as students, parents and staff come to terms with these events. All our thoughts are with Asad’s family at this terribly difficult time.”"
2016-10-03T16:56:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Christopher Halliwell investigation defended by Wiltshire chief constable,"A chief constable has hit back at criticism of his force over its handling of the investigation into the suspected serial killer Christopher Halliwell. Mike Veale, the chief constable of Wiltshire police, denied that his officers had failed to work with other forces over Halliwell, who has been given a whole life term for the murders of the Swindon women Sian O’Callaghan and Becky Godden. Veale also criticised the media for naming other possible victims of Halliwell, a taxi driver, claiming that speculation had traumatised the families of the identified women. He defended the way the force managed former Det Supt Steve Fulcher, who caught Halliwell but faced disciplinary proceedings over how he had interviewed the killer and subsequently left the force.
Following Halliwell’s conviction last month for the murder of Godden, Wiltshire police made it clear they strongly believed he may have killed others. Fulcher is among those who have criticised his former force for its apparent lack of action in investigating Halliwell in the five years since he was captured in 2011 and the four since he admitted killing O’Callaghan. He told the Guardian last week that as soon as Halliwell was caught it was clear to him that he was a serial killer, but he claimed little had been done to check for other cases Halliwell could be connected to. Veale said it was not true that Wiltshire police had not liaised with other forces to identify potential links to Halliwell. He said: “At the time of Halliwell’s arrest all forces were notified of the circumstances of both murders and the facts that were known at the time. This is in line with good investigative practice.” Veale said the force had also engaged with the National Crime Agency and its serious-case analysis section. “The national database ensures that all similar offences are shared,” he said.
But Veale added: “At this time Wiltshire police has not uncovered any links between Halliwell and any other murders across the country.” The chief constable expressed concern that other possible victims had been named. He said: “There has been much speculation in the press in relation to other women who may or may not have been a victim of Halliwell. This speculation is not helpful and is very distressing to the families involved. “This was reinforced to me when I spoke to the mothers of some of those named during the coverage of this case, who told me they had been traumatised and distressed by this unfounded speculation involving their loved ones.” Fulcher was disciplined after it emerged that he had not followed rules laid down in Pace – the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 – on how to question suspects when Halliwell was arrested. In his interview with the Guardian, Fulcher argued that in the situation he was in, the rights of a victim – he incorrectly believed at the time O’Callaghan was still alive – outweighed those of a suspect. Writing in his monthly newsletter, Veale said Pace was brought in to protect the human rights of people who come into contact with the police and replaced rules that led to “unethical behaviour” and “miscarriages of justice”. “This is something we should never forget and should protect against at all costs,” he said. “Pace has been in now for approximately 30 years … it maintains ethical and lawful police investigative actions which in turn safeguards the rights of individuals.” He said that officers who were “lawfully audacious” would be backed by the force. Addressing his own officers, he said: “Be lawfully audacious and I will support you. Do the right thing and I will support you. Remain ethical in your endeavours and I will support you. Follow the values and I will support you. Protect the public as best as you are able and I will support you. Why? Because it is the right thing to do and we are in this together.”"
2016-10-03T19:44:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Earls Court regeneration: reviews and uncertainties,"Nine years after its ingredients first began to be combined, the future of one of London’s largest and most contested redevelopment schemes looks as clear as mud soup. The Earls Court Project, guided by architect Sir Terry Farrell’s 2010 masterplan, foresaw the closure and destruction of the Earls Court exhibition centre, the relocation of London Underground’s Lillie Bridge maintenance depot and the demolition of 760 homes on two council estates. In their place, and also covering the nearby exhibition centre car park, would rise clusters of mostly very expensive flats together with a new high street to help form and connect four “villages”. Today, some of the masterplan has been partly put into effect but much of it is mired in uncertainty. During the mayoral election campaign, Sadiq Khan disparaged the project for the low number of additional “affordable” homes it proposed. Of the 7,500 that principal developer Capital and Counties (Capco) has permission to build, 760 would be replacements for those knocked down on the two estates and only 740 of the remaining 6,740 would be “affordable”, all of them of the “intermediate” variety aimed at middle income households. That represents a net “affordable” gain of just 11% of the new housing across the entire project area in a major transformation that’s also been opposed on economic, cultural, architectural and environmental grounds. Khan promised to review the scheme if he won. The question now is what can and should be done to change it to make it more to the liking of the new mayor and to other critics, most notably campaigners opposed to the demolition of the two estates and Labour-run Hammersmith and Fulham council (H&F). As Khan has pointed out in a written answer to a question from Liberal Democrat AM Caroline Pidgeon, he has no power to revoke the borough planning consents currently covering the entire development area that were granted by H&F when it was under Tory control and by its Tory neighbour Kensington and Chelsea, all of them waved through by his predecessor Boris Johnson. However, he has also underlined to Pidgeon that “should a new masterplan be submitted” he would assess it “against the policies set out in the London Plan”, the legally-binding planning framework for the whole of Greater London. Khan intends to change the London Plan and, in the meantime, will soon be publishing supplementary planning guidance reflecting how he will seek to pursue his goals in the context of a document that currently enshrines Johnson’s. Khan’s election is not the only important new factor in the Earls Court Project story. Market conditions were already changing and have been further affected by Brexit. An oversupply of expensive properties in “prime” central London led to a collapse in Capco’s share price early this year. Rumours of a takeover persist. However, in July, the company’s chief executive told the Telegraph he had suggested to the Greater London Authority (GLA) that it would be possible to increase the grand total of Earls Court Project dwellings from 7,500 to 10,000. Capco says it will be making formal representations to the GLA about Earls Court as Khan’s revision of the London Plan gets underway, adding that “no decision has been reached on whether any [new] planning application will result from this process”. Meanwhile, Khan has said his officers are “working closely” with H&F, which is committed to securing a better deal for the estates’ residents. An answer from him to Pidgeon relating specifically to the Lillie Bridge depot, which also lies within H&F, serves as a reminder that changes can be made to existing planning consents. It seems that all interested parties are in some sense reviewing the state of the scheme, which has vividly illustrated the perils and discontents of major regeneration projects that involve expunging character-defining local institutions, knocking down large numbers of peoples’ homes and are heavily dependent on the vagaries of global property investment. Some parts of this one cannot now be undone, but much remains in flux. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s happening on the project area’s four principal sites. Lillie Square This site on Seagrave Road is what used to be the exhibition centre car park. With a 50/50 joint venture between a Capco subsidiary and what Capco describes as “entities in which certain members of the Kwok family are interested” - the Kwoks are well-known in Hong Kong real estate - has advanced more quickly than the other three due to being fully self-contained - separated from the others by Lillie Road - and having nothing large on it that needed levelling. Real buildings have been springing from the ground next to West Brompton station, just up the road from the Stamford Bridge ground of Chelsea FC. If completed as planned, Lillie Square, forming the heart of a theoretical West Brompton village, will eventually contain 808 residential units, including 200 of the 760 replacements for those just down the road that would be lost, though these would be hived off from the luxury apartments and their plush communal facilities. Sales of the market-priced properties have been slow, with one estate agent telling the Financial Times that at this rate it would take Capco 150 years to sell all 6,000 of the market-priced homes it has permission to build across the project area in total. Will they drop their prices? What would be the implications for the rest of the masterplan, including the delivery of the 740 additional “affordable” homes, if they did? Earls Court Village An expanse of flat brownfield now fills the space where the exhibition centre stood, awaiting the construction of 1,300 residential units bisected by a linear park. The land is owned by Transport for London (TfL), which has formed a joint venture company - Earls Court Partnership Ltd - with Capco to do the developing and make money to spend on London’s transport networks. None of the putative homes, which have yet to be marketed for “off plan” sale, are intended to be “affordable”. Capco has anticipated “luxury retail, dining in the park, culture, leisure and services for the modern day city-dweller” being provided for residents of medium and high-rise blocks arranged round “courtyard squares”. Lillie Bridge Depot This part of the project map has not yet been altered at all and may not be for several years - London Underground will have to relocate the depot’s facilities to Acton before anything else can be built there, which will take time. The depot land belongs to TfL, which means the mayor will want at least 50% of the housing it may eventually contain to be shared ownership “affordable” homes for long-term renting first-time buyers. If and when that happens, who will TfL partner with to build the homes and how many will there be? Will that quantity contribute to the final number of additional affordable homes in the entire project area being greater than the mere 740 originally planned? That may partly depend on what happens to... The West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates The most complexity surrounds the 760 homes of these adjoining post-war estates, bordered at the western end of the project area by North End Road. Under the existing masterplan permissions, they are to be demolished in phases as and when replacements have been built. The slow progress on Lillie Square suggests nothing will get knocked down any time soon. But there remains a legal agreement made between Capco and the now former Conservative H&F administration to sell Capco the estates land for redevelopment as and when replacement homes are completed. The Tories’ Labour successors have said that, regretfully, this deal cannot be undone. Meanwhile, the estates’ tenants and residents’ associations are hoping the communities secretary will enable them to take ownership of the estates through a community-led housing association and enhance the existing stock in line with their “peoples’ plan”. The council is against this, and Mayor Khan, while suggesting that his housing deputy James Murray visits the campaigners to listen to their ideas, wrote in June that he thinks the “best regeneration outcome” for residents is more likely to be achieved if the council remains their landlord. He’s said that GLA officers have been “working closely” with those of H&F to that end. Conclusions? What will emerge from all this is hard to predict. A fundamental issue is the extent to which the different parts of the project have been interconnected in planning and financial terms, with the extra “affordable” homes plus improvements to transport capacity, public realm and a new school all dependent on the sale of the expensive flats. Is the original masterplan still credible? The possibility of a new one being drawn up seems to exist. Where will Capco end up standing on all this? Where might TfL and the mayor want them to? There have been discussions between H&F and Capco about making the development even bigger and grander in return for getting the estates residents a better deal out of demolition. They ran into the sand, but maybe Capco’s “up to 10,000” suggestion means that type of outcome is possible after all. But it wouldn’t suit everyone. Even if the estate residents were satisfied with it, other locals might object on aesthetic and quality of life grounds. The one sure thing remains that this story is still a long way from its end."
2016-10-04T06:17:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Plan for UK military to opt out of European convention on human rights,"Controversial plans for the military to opt out from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) during future conflicts will be introduced by ministers, to see off what the prime minister described as an “industry of vexatious claims” against soldiers. The long-mooted idea will be announced on Tuesday at the Conservative party conference by Theresa May and the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, although it was immediately criticised by human rights groups who said it was based on a false narrative of spurious lawsuits. May said the change would “put an end to the industry of vexatious claims that has pursued those who served in previous conflicts”. It would be implemented by introducing a “presumption to derogate” from the ECHR in warfare. Fallon, in comments released ahead of his conference speech, said: “Our legal system has been abused to level false charges against our troops on an industrial scale.” He added: “It has caused significant distress to people who risked their lives to protect us, it has cost the taxpayer millions and there is a real risk it will stop our armed forces doing their job.”
The military and some right-leaning thinktanks have long pushed for the move, arguing that a series of court cases focused on the actions of UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan has cost the Ministry of Defence (MoD) huge sums. The government says the litigation has cost the MoD more than £100m since 2004. Ministers say this has happened because the jurisdiction of the ECHR has been extended to conflict zones, in part due to the efforts of a handful of law firms. Derogating from the ECHR in times of war or public emergency is permitted under the rules of the Council of Europe, which oversees the Strasbourg-based institution. Certain key convention rights – such as the prohibition against torture – nonetheless remain in place even if the secretary general of the Council of Europe has been informed in advance of a temporary derogation. The UK is not the first nation to take this step. Ukraine gave notice of a derogation in June 2015, in relation to the fighting on its border with Russia. France signalled it would derogate in the immediate aftermath of the jihadist massacres at the Bataclan nightclub in Paris last November. Turkey lodged a similar notice following the failed military coup in July. The UK has also previously notified the Council of Europe of a succession of temporary derogations in relation to the Troubles in Northern Ireland during the 1970s. The government has already lodged complaints with the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) against two law firms, Leigh Day and Public Interest Lawyers, for the way in which they pursued actions against the MoD and soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, argued that the majority of rights claims against the military were not vexatious, and were connected to protections which could not be derogated, such as prohibition of torture. “The MoD has been forced to settle hundreds of cases of abuse, which speaks to mistreatment on the battlefield that we should be trying to eradicate, not permit,” she said.
Derogation could only happen during war or public emergencies that threaten the life of the nation, Spurrier said, adding: “There is a dark irony in our government proposing derogation in wars of its choosing, even though many of those conflicts, like in Iraq and Afghanistan, are fought ostensibly in the name of human rights.“The truth is that derogation will protect no one except those at the MoD with something to hide. It will make us hypocrites on the international stage and embolden our enemies to capitalise on our double standards. “If ministers held our troops in the high regard they claim, they would not do them the disrespect of implying they can’t abide by human rights standards. For a supposedly civilised nation, this is a pernicious and retrograde step.” Writing in the Guardian on Monday, Rev Nicholas Mercer, formerly a lieutenant colonel and senior legal military adviser to the 1st Armoured Division during the Iraq war, attacked the government for inventing an “orchestrated narrative”. “The idea that the claims are largely spurious is nonsense,” he wrote. “The Ministry of Defence has already paid out £20m in compensation to victims of abuse in Iraq. This is for a total of 326 cases, which by anyone’s reckoning is a lot of money and a shocking amount of abuse. Anyone who has been involved in litigation with the MoD knows that it will pay up only if a case is overwhelming or the ministry wants to cover something up.” The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, has also accused the government of attempting to undermine the rule of law by intimidating solicitors who pursue legitimate cases. Its president, Robert Bourns, said last month: “Lawyers must not be hindered or intimidated in carrying out their professional duties and acting in the best interests of their clients within the law. They should not be identified with their clients or clients’ cases. This principle is set out in the United Nations basic principles on the role of lawyers.”"
2016-10-04T08:31:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester police up street patrols after two women raped in 12 days,"Police have increased patrols in Manchester city centre after two young women were raped within 12 days. A 24-year-old woman was sexually assaulted just before midnight on Sunday in the second attack in two weeks. It came 12 days after an 18-year-old was raped and robbed by a man helped by two women on a secluded pathway in the city centre. Detectives are not linking the attacks but have increased patrols as they hunt for the four suspects. DI John Mulvihill of Greater Manchester police’s major incident team said: “I understand that an incident like this will cause concern and I want to assure the community that we have increased patrols in response. “We are very much in the early stages of our investigation and we are treating this as an isolated incident. We are also working to provide the victim with support from specially trained officers. “This happened in the city centre, just off a busy road when people would have been around and seen something. I would urge anybody who has information that can help our investigation to contact the police. Everyone has the right to go about their daily lives without being attacked and we will not tolerate this.” The latest attack happened on a quiet side street near the John Rylands library, off Deansgate, one of the busiest shopping streets in the city. Police said the woman ran off across Deansgate seeking help and was discovered in nearby Bootle Street at about midnight on Sunday. The teenage victim of last month’s city centre rape was reportedly out with her family when she was attacked on 21 September. DI Dave Moores said the 18-year-old had been left “extremely traumatised” after she was pinned down and raped by a man who was helped by two women. She had been wandering alone in Manchester city for about an hour, visiting Burger King on Piccadilly Gardens, before being attacked at 2.50am. She was approached by a man who threw her to the ground with help from a female accomplice while a second woman robbed the teenager. The police are trawling through hours of CCTV footage in a bid to catch the trio who took part in an attack detectives described as “horrendous”."

The schoolboy was injured close to South Elmsall on Monday evening. The British Transport police said officers and paramedics were called after reports of a person on the tracks just before 6.15pm. Officers are believed to be investigating claims that a group of children were playing on a bridge before one fell on to the tracks. A spokesman for the British Transport police said an investigation had been launched into how the boy came to be on the line. The force said: “We attended alongside paramedics and a 12-year-old boy was treated by paramedics for serious electrical burns. He was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition.” Rail passengers experienced long delays to the busy rush-hour service between Leeds and Sheffield. Anyone with any information is asked to contact the British Transport police by sending a text to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 and quoting 412 of 03/10/2016.
2016-10-04T10:39:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Thomas Mair refuses to enter plea to Jo Cox murder charge,"The man accused of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox refused to enter a plea when he appeared at the Old Bailey. A plea of not guilty was entered on behalf of Thomas Mair when he remained silent when asked whether he admitted or denied the offence. Appearing by video link from Belmarsh prison in south London on Tuesday, Mair sat with arms crossed and remained silent when the murder charge and three other counts were put to him. After asking Mair to confirm that he could hear the charges that were being put to him, the judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, directed that not guilty pleas be entered on his behalf.
Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, West Yorkshire, will stand trial next month accused of the murder of Cox, possession of a firearm and a dagger with intent to cause an offence, and grievous bodily harm to a passerby, Bernard Kenny. A provisional four-week trial date has already been fixed for November 14. The judge adjourned the case for a further hearing on October 28. Cox, 41, a mother of two children, was stabbed and shot on 16 June as she arrived at a surgery in Birstall, part of her Batley and Spen constituency. A byelection is to be held on 20 October. Members of Mrs Cox’s family gathered at the Old Bailey to see Mair in court. At the time of her death, she was described by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as “one of our very best”. She left a husband, Brendan, and two young children."
2016-10-04T12:33:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans jury warned not to research rape case,"Jurors hearing the retrial of the international footballer Ched Evans on a charge of rape have been warned not to carry out their own research on the case. The prosecution is due to begin its case against the 27-year-old former Manchester City striker at Cardiff crown court on Tuesday afternoon. Evans denies rape. Ahead of the prosecution opening, the judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, told the jury of six men and six women: “This case has history.” She said Evans and a second man had been tried for rape at Caernarfon crown court in north Wales. The second man was acquitted and Evans successfully appealed against his conviction. The court of appeal had ordered this retrial. The judge said there had been previous reporting of the case but the jurors had to ignore anything they had heard or read. “You are to try the case on the evidence you will hear in this court during this trial, nothing else,” she told the panel. She also instructed the jurors not to research the case on the internet and to stay clear of anything on social media, including Twitter and Facebook, relating to it. The judge warned the jurors they could be jailed if they ignored her instructions. Welsh international Evans, who now plays for League One side Chesterfield, breathed deeply as the names of the jurors were read out to him. Simon Medland QC, prosecuting, told the court that the case related to an incident at a Premier Inn in north Wales in May 2011. He read a list of 40 names of people who may be called as witnesses or mentioned during the proceedings and asked the jurors to raise a hand if they had heard of any of them. Nobody did. Earlier, Evans arrived hand in hand at court with his fiancee, Natasha Massey."
2016-10-04T14:32:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Amber Rudd announces crackdown on overseas students and work visas,"Amber Rudd has announced major new restrictions on overseas students, including two-tier visa rules affecting poorer quality universities and courses, a crackdown on work visas and the introduction of a £140m “controlling migration fund”. In her speech the home secretary warned businesses that foreign workers should not be able to “take jobs that British people should do”. Later it was made clear that the consultation paper will include an option to require companies to publish their proportion of international staff they employ. Rudd’s announcement, coupled with the pledge to boost the proportion of British doctors in the NHS, came as ministers tried to demonstrate that they would not wait for Brexit to deliver cuts to the near-record level of net migration to Britain. The new drive to reduce the flow of overseas students from outside Europe – who account for 167,000 of the 600,000 new migrants each year – is to focus on linking student immigration rules to the quality of colleges and courses for the first time. Rudd said the Home Office would shortly consult on the new student immigration system and on tightening the resident labour market test that companies have to pass before recruiting employees from overseas, as part of the drive to reduce net migration – which currently stands at 327,000 – to “sustainable levels”.
“The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do,” she said. She also announced that mandatory immigration status checks under this year’s legislation, including on those who apply for licences to drive taxis, would come into effect this December. She made it clear that leaving the EU was just one element in the campaign to reduce immigration. The home secretary denied that she was pulling up the drawbridge in her speech to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham but said the consultation on overseas student migration would look at whether the student immigration rules should be tailored to the quality of the course and the quality of an educational institution. She raised the prospect of a multi-tiered student visa system, under which rights to bring in families and their right to work, to go on to post-study jobs or to come without passing an English language test, would be tied to the quality of the course and the university involved. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s chief of staff, has in the past floated the idea of restricting the right to work in Britain after graduation to those who attend Oxbridge and the Russell Group of universities. Rudd said the current system allowed favourable employment prospects to all students, irrespective of their talents and the university’s quality,when they stopped studying. She said that while an international student was studying in Britain, their family members could do any form of work. “And foreign students, even those studying English language degrees, don’t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one-size-fits-all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities providing thousands of different courses across the country. And we need to look at whether this generous offer for all universities is really adding value to our economy,” said the home secretary. “I’m passionately committed to making sure our world-leading institutions can attract the brightest and the best. But a student immigration system that treats every student and university as equal only punishes those we should want to help. So our consultation will ask what more can we do to support our best universities – and those that stick to the rules – to attract the best talent … while looking at tougher rules for students on lower quality courses.” The plans were condemned as “spectacularly ill-informed” and “an act of madness” by Paul Blomfield, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international students. Responding to Rudd’s conference speech, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said: “I’m shocked by the home secretary’s comments, which are spectacularly ill-informed. “She doesn’t seem to know how many universities we have in the UK or understand the current rules for which she is responsible, let alone appreciate the enormous contribution international students make to the universities and cities where they study. “International students bring £8bn a year to the UK economy, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the economy. Education is one of our most successful export industries. The only people cheering today’s announcement will be our competitors.” The University and College Union (UCU), which represents university staff, also criticised Rudd’s proposals. Sally Hunt, its general secretary, said: “International students make an enormous contribution to UK higher education, both educationally and economically. As highly skilled people, they make an invaluable contribution to our economy.
“This proposal to limit overseas students to particular universities and courses equates to pulling up the drawbridge and sending a message that the UK is closed for business. Ministers need to take a very different approach and support universities by removing international students from the net migration target altogether.” Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK responded to Rudd’s proposed changes by stressing the quality and diversity of British university courses and saying that the overwhelming majority of overseas students went home at the end of their studies. “The diversity of institutions and the range of high-quality courses offered is one of the many strengths of our university sector. Any criteria must reflect that diversity. The criteria must also support the critical role that many universities play in their regions, where the impact of international students directly supports regional economies, supplies high level graduate skills and ensures the sustainability of many courses at regional level,” she said. “Polling has shown that the British public does not see international students as long-term migrants, but as valuable, temporary visitors. International students come to the UK, study for a period, and then the overwhelming majority go home after their studies,” she added, disputing their inclusion in the net migration target. Rudd said the process of bringing skilled workers to Britain from outside Europe had become a box-ticking exercise, allowing some firms to get away with not training local people. “We won’t win in the world if we don’t do more to upskill our own workforce. It’s not fair on companies doing the right thing. So I want us to look again at whether our immigration system provides the right incentives for businesses to invest in British workers,” she said. The review is likely to look again at the resident market labour test and ensure that job vacancies are advertised locally in Britain and not just abroad among potential migrant staff. Rudd said the “controlling migration fund” would be designed specifically to ease the pressure on public services in areas of high migration. It replaces a Labour migration impact fund, which was scrapped in 2010 as ineffective. The fund would also be used in the government’s stated drive to “create a hostile environment for illegal immigrants”, she said. Labour’s fund had spent money on translation services rather than English lessons, the home secretary said, and councils were given money to promote recycling rather than the support they needed to ease housing pressures. Labour’s fund was financed by a £50-a-head levy on visas. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Labour’sthe party’s new proposal – an impact fund of £50m over two years – would also be financed by a levy on citizenship applications. Rudd did not spell out where the £140m would come from. The Home Office said the £140m fund would be spent over the remaining three-and-a-half years of the current parliament. English local authorities would shortly be invited to bid for £100m of the fund to manage a range of issues associated with sudden and high levels of migration such as securing community cohesion, providing English language teaching or tackling overcrowded properties. The remaining £40m would be set aside to fund immigration enforcement activity in areas of high migration, including targeting and removing illegal immigrants living in overcrowded accommodation or sleeping rough who are resistant to finding proper accommodation or returning home. The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said it sounded as if the prime minister had had a heavy hand in drafting Rudd’s speech. He said: “We’ve heard these conference promises on net migration and child migrants before and they haven’t come to anything – people will take them with a pinch of salt. On Theresa May’s watch, net migration reached record levels.
“Amber Rudd is right to introduce a scheme to help communities address the pressures of migration, as Jeremy Corbyn called for last week. But she had depressingly little to say about the largest humanitarian crisis since the second world war and failed to repeat the commitment to taking a share of adult refugees.” The Institute of Directors also expressed disappointment at Rudd’s announcement. “There are different ways to control immigration and we should see Brexit as a chance to design a system which addresses local concerns, without damaging business or universities,” said Seamus Nevin, the institute’s head of employment and skills. “Staying on the current course will end up satisfying no one. Net immigration will likely stay above 100,000, while firms and the public sector struggle to fill skills gaps, making it harder for them to navigate the uncertainty of the coming Brexit negotiations.” Addressing a fringe event, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, hinted that employers might be obliged in any future work permit system to seek a British national to fill a job before they could employ someone from overseas. “My job is not to write immigration policy,” Davis said in answer to a question on the worries among businesses about finding sufficient unskilled labour. “My job is to get the powers back here so we can decide. That is the first thing to understand. Once you do that, the government will make its decision on how it runs its immigration policy.” Davis said that any solution would not be immediate and would be up to May and Rudd. He said: “If they go down a route of having work permits for example, typically the way work permits work in other countries is you get to say, try to get a British citizen first and, if you haven’t, then you have got to do that first. There will be tests like that. “But the other side of this is we have to make sure that our own population are ready and equipped to work, whether it is low-skilled work – and that is about motivation and about commitment to work. If it is higher skilled it is about education, which is why the other part of Theresa’s concerns about society are very important in this context. But at the end of the day nobody is going to have an off switch.”"
2016-10-04T15:08:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail commuters to launch legal action against DfT,"A group of commuters who have faced strikes, cancellations and delays on Southern rail have raised more than £24,000 to launch legal action against the Department for Transport. The Association of British Commuters, a pressure group formed in the wake of months of disruption on the service, set up a website to crowdfund a challenge of the government’s handling of the crisis. The campaign set an initial target of £10,000 to scope out legal action. It cleared this target within days and is set to reach its “stretch” target of £25,000 before a deadline of 5am on Wednesday 5 October. Almost 1,200 people have donated to the campaign, which received a “really strong boost” after Southern tried to blame the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) for the ongoing disruption. The widely ridiculed publicity drive was the latest episode in a long-running row between Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and the RMT over the role of conductors. Emily Yates, the group’s co-founder, said the campaign had brought together people from across the political spectrum, adding: “We have enough to go forward … it’s quite clear we have to work together to get out of this situation. “There is such a sense of goodwill – [it] is probably the only positive thing to come out of the whole thing.” The crowdfunding drive comes to an end as passengers prepare for a new wave of strikes planned for next week. The industrial action looks set to go ahead after the union rejected an ultimatum from GTR and described the company as “hell-bent on confrontation”. GTR wants trains to be driver-operated only, which would leave some services without a second staff member. The RMT says this would put passenger safety at risk. The service has also been hit by staff shortages and disruption caused by the renovation of London Bridge station.
On Monday 3 October, the operator gave the RMT until Thursday to accept a deal that included a £2,000 payment to staff whose roles were to change. However, Mick Cash, the union’s general secretary, rejected the offer, and accused the company of refusing to participate in talks with the mediation service Acas ahead of a new wave of strikes. Cash told AP: “The rejection of unconditional Acas talks by Southern confirms that they have no interest in a settlement and are hell-bent on confrontation.” A spokesman for GTR said on Tuesday: “As we spelled out in our letter to the RMT yesterday, we are already implementing our proposals and any discussions can now only relate to the detail of our offer. The timescales that we are working to and subsequent consequences have been clearly laid out and we therefore hope the union will finally engage with us on this basis to avoid any further unnecessary disruption and distress to our customers and staff.” Meanwhile, the Association of British Commuters has hired Devonshires Solicitors and barristers Rhodri Thompson QC and Jamas Hodivala for advice on launching a judicial review. Yates said: “It’s become quite clear that the solid line leads to the DfT and we need to be chasing them.” The DfT has refused to release documents showing how Southern has complied with its franchise agreement, including information about the remedial plan agreed with GTR in February. It has also refused to release details of a £20m government fund to address problems with the franchise. Matthew Garbutt of Devonshires Solicitors said the DfT refused to provide the documents voluntarily, instead insisting on treating the requests as freedom of information requests. He said: “I hope that the Department for Transport releases these papers so that the travelling public get the transparency they need at this difficult time.” A DfT spokesman said: “Improving rail services for Southern passengers is a priority for us and the operator. We announced last month that Network Rail would deliver £20m of improvements and appointed a rail industry expert to lead a project board to drive up performance. “We have responded to correspondence from lawyers acting on behalf of the Association of British Commuters.”"
2016-10-04T16:25:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Leeds protesters given permission to relocate rough sleepers' tent city,"A “tent city” of rough sleepers set up to protest against a perceived lack of action by the council to tackle homelessness in Leeds, has been allowed to relocate to the site of the city’s former international swimming pool for six weeks. The group appeared in Leeds county court on Tuesday to fight a bid to disperse them. At the hearing, the council obtained an injunction to stop the organisers setting up the project at other sites across the city centre, but agreed to give the group the use of the car park on the outskirts of the city centre for an interim period.
The group had already moved to a second site in Park Square, which is home to many of the city’s law firms, but the council issued a claim for possession of the square which led to Tuesday’s hearing. “We don’t support the idea of a permanent tented city as is doesn’t resolve the issue or address the challenge of being able to engage with people who have a range of complicated problems that need various support and health services to help them to a better life,” said Debra Coupar, Leeds city council’s executive member for communities. “If, at the end of the six-week period, everyone’s best endeavours haven’t resulted in the group disbanding voluntarily from the site, we’ll look at the legal options available to us as we have to balance the needs of the vulnerable alongside those of other residents and businesses in the city.” The council said it would assess the needs of all those sleeping in the tents on the site by the end of that period, but maintained there was accommodation available for every person sleeping on the streets if they wanted it. The project’s organisers said gathering rough sleepers together in the tent city served to highlight the size of the homelessness problem in Leeds and provide a safer space for them to sleep in. Continuously staffed by volunteers, who distributed donated clothing, food and hot drinks to homeless people sleeping in the tents, the project was first pitched outside the city’s art gallery before it was ordered to move last week to make way for Yorkshire’s Olympics celebrations. Haydn Jessop from Leeds Voice for the Homeless, who was once homeless himself, described the council’s decision as a massive victory. “We went to the council a week ago asking for some land: they refused, but today they conceded,” he said. Simon Rickles, another volunteer with the group, said: “Finally the council are accepting the amount of people in Leeds with no option but to sleep on the streets and are starting to take positive steps to get them into homes. Meanwhile they now have a safe place to stay. I just hope the council will work with us to ensure people receive the help they need sooner in the future.” Coupar said there was accommodation and support available to those who wanted it. “We’d prefer the group to disband voluntarily, however, they clearly wish to continue their protest,” she said. “Continually going to court to move people on is costly and unproductive as there are few, if any, locations in a city as diverse as Leeds where the camp wouldn’t cause some level of disruption to residents and businesses. “Allowing the protesters to temporarily use the international pool site for an interim six-week period is not ideal but is the least worst option. As throughout this protest, we’re committed to engaging with the group so everyone that needs assistance get it. The group have committed to working with agencies to ensure this happens.”"
2016-10-04T17:14:28Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ched Evans raped drunk teenager in hotel room, jury at retrial told","The footballer Ched Evans raped a “heavily intoxicated” waitress in a budget hotel room after a friend called him to say “I’ve got a girl”, a jury has been told. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Norwich, followed his friend and the 19-year-old to the hotel, it is claimed. He raped her before leaving via a fire exit, Cardiff crown court heard on Tuesday. The prosecution alleges the woman, who believes her drinks were spiked, woke up the next morning in pain and bruised, and unaware she had even been in the same room as Evans. Jurors were told that Evans and his friend, Clayton McDonald, have already stood trial. Evans was convicted and McDonald was found not guilty. Evans successfully appealed against his conviction and is being retried. He denies rape. Simon Medland QC, prosecuting, said Evans, who was living in Rhyl, north Wales, at the time of the alleged rape, was a local celebrity. “He was a handsome and fit professional footballer, and as such a wealthy young man,” he said. Medland said the alleged victim met friends in the early hours of Monday 30 May 2011 at a bar called Zu in Rhyl, where she had “several drinks” but not as many as normal. Medland said: “When she looked back on all this, she was much more drunk than she would expect to have been. You will see footage from CCTV of her trying to walk. She is seen to be very unsteady on her feet. One explanation which she gives for this is a feeling – and it can’t ever be more than that – that her drink may have been ‘spiked’.” Medland said there was no evidence that Evans or anyone else did spike her drinks, but added: “Whatever the reason for it, we suggest to you that [the woman] was really heavily intoxicated.” Evans, then 22, was also in the bar with McDonald. Medland said: “They’d been drinking in the bar and socialising with a number of girls. Of course there is nothing remotely unusual about this, or sinister in itself. “Both Clayton McDonald and Ched Evans were young men out on the town. Ched Evans was quite a local celebrity. He was a handsome and fit professional footballer, and as such a wealthy young man.” Evans was living in Rhyl but had paid for a room at a Premier Inn. Shortly before 4am, McDonald and the alleged victim were in a taxi heading towards the hotel. Medland said: “He [McDonald] had managed to hook the intoxicated, stumbling [complainant]. The taxi driver formed the view that she was ‘drunk, very docile and not with it’.” During the taxi ride, Medland claimed, McDonald said something the jury might feel was significant. He said: “He was speaking on the phone, we suggest, to this defendant. He said: ‘I’ve got a girl.’ At least he said something like that, but the taxi driver can’t quite bring to mind what it was – some sort of slang meaning ‘girl’.” Medland asked: “Did she know that she’d been ‘got’ by that stage? Was she in a frame of mind to know? Why was McDonald telling Ched Evans that anyway?” At about 4am the taxi arrived at the hotel. A receptionist said the woman seemed very drunk and “out of it” and was stumbling around with a vacant expression on her face. She and McDonald went together to room 14. About 15 minutes later, Evans arrived in a taxi and also went to that room. The hotel receptionist said he heard people having sex in the room. McDonald left the hotel in a taxi, the court heard, while Evans departed by the fire exit door. The next morning, the alleged victim woke up in the hotel room. Medland said: “She felt some pain in her private parts, which she will describe to you, and undoubtedly has some minor visible injuries. She remembers practically nothing of the events of that night and can only piece together some fragments of it. She remains convinced that her drink must have been spiked by someone.” Medland said Evans had not been in the taxi with the complainant, and she had not gone into the hotel room with him. He said: “There is no room for concluding that [the woman] could have consented to sex with this defendant. We submit that the evidence will show that the only connection between Ched Evans and [her] was once he was in the hotel room with the ‘girl’ which McDonald had ‘got’. “We submit that she was that intoxicated – for whatever reason – that she didn’t really know what on earth was happening and that what the facts of this case show is that she was raped by this young footballer in that room, not that she had consensual sex with him. It is not a proper description, we suggest, to say that he had sex with [her]; it is more accurate perhaps to say to that he ‘did’ sex to her. Sex without consent is rape.” He said the woman would tell the jury she did not consent, adding: “How could she? There is good reason to conclude, we submit, that she didn’t even know Ched Evans was having sex with her. “She had to piece together some fairly fragmentary memories of events later the next morning ... long after this defendant had slipped away into the night through the fire escape door.” The jury was warned by the judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, not to research the case on the internet or using social media. Medland added: “There has been considerable media coverage of this charge and previous proceedings in this case. Much of the comment is not well-informed, some of it is has been malicious; deliberately slanted against one side in the case or the other. “So please put aside any preconceptions about rape, rapists and rape victims and ignore any media commentary or the views of anyone else and concentrate on a cool, calm and objective assessment of the evidence in this trial.” The trial continues."
2016-10-04T17:33:08Z,uk-news,UK news,"Alleged killer of antiques dealer had list of famous targets, jury told","An unemployed man stabbed and beat an antiques dealer to death, after drawing up a list of robbery and kidnap targets that also included Kate Moss, Jeffrey Archer and other prominent business and political figures, a jury has been told. Michael Danaher is accused of attacking and murdering Adrian Greenwood at his home in Oxford on 6 April this year, after plotting for months to rob him of a rare first edition of The Wind in the Willows worth £50,000. Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, told a jury at Oxford crown court that the antiques dealer died in a “brutal” assault that left him with more than 30 stab wounds to the chest and neck and a deep wound in his back, almost certainly sustained while his back was turned. In addition, he had puncture wounds suggesting he may have been tortured, and numerous blunt-force injuries, including one that suggested he had been stamped on, the jury heard. Wounds to his hands suggested Greenwood tried to grab the knife used against him, the blade of which snapped off in the attack, the barrister said. Danaher denies murder, although Saxby told the jury he admits killing Greenwood but will argue that it was an act of self-defence. However, the barrister said that in contrast to Greenwood’s injuries, Danaher had emerged from the violent incident “almost unscathed”. Afterwards he had not called emergency services, but “cool as you like, he helped himself to that first edition of The Wind in the Willows, and Adrian Greenwood’s phone, and his laptop and his wallet”. He said that as Danaher left the house, the defendant had paused to take a selfie showing blood on his beard. The court heard that Greenwood’s name appeared on a list of wealthy targets which Danaher, an unemployed father of two from Peterborough, had researched online and saved in an Excel spreadsheet he called “Enterprises”. Danaher tried to make ends meet by buying and selling on the internet, but was in financial difficulties, Saxby said, “and had been considering unlawful means of solving them for a while”. Alongside their names and addresses, Saxby said, Danaher listed “modus – in other words, how he was going to do what he was going to do”, “why?” and “expected take”. The methods listed included “stun gun” and the words “sister” and “daughter”, alongside the word “ransom”. Analysis of his laptop revealed the accused had also researched and saved the home addresses of celebrities including Simon Cowell, Katie Hopkins, Eamonn Holmes, Gary Lineker and Louise Redknapp, as well as the former Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and Adam Simmonds, a former Conservative police and crime commissioner of Northamptonshire, the court heard. A floorplan of the home of the TV presenter Anthea Turner was recovered from Danaher’s laptop, Saxby said, while he had also researched how to buy samurai swords online. Greenwood, whom the defendant appeared to have targeted after the dealer listed his copy of The Wind in the Willows on eBay in August 2015, was included on the list with the note: “Modus: Any!! Expected take: rare books”, the barrister said. He told the jury the defendant had made repeated internet searches about Greenwood, his business and home, and visited Oxford five times in the months before the killing, making a careful study of his home. Saxby told the jury of four women and eight men that the list of targets “exudes a sense of resentment. It is almost as if these are people who, because of their wealth … deserve to be subjected to what he has planned.” A number of those listed were Conservative party donors, and alongside the names of several, including Archer and the private equity investor Guy Hands, the words “scum Tory” were written, Saxby said. Police later found a stun gun, disguised as an iPhone, at the defendant’s home, he added. The jury heard that on 22 March, about two weeks before Greenwood died, Danaher tried to force his way into the north London home of Adrian Beecroft, a wealthy businessman and Conservative donor who was also on the list, by pretending to have a delivery for the businessman’s daughter. The man’s wife became suspicious and raised the alarm, after which the accused fled, Saxby said. Late into the night before Greenwood died, the court heard, Danaher was searching the internet for topics including how to buy a handgun with a silencer, how to hide a gun in a car, and had researched a document entitled: “Getting away with murder – Britain’s most notorious crimes”. By 10.45am, he was on the road to Oxford, where he was captured arriving at Greenwood’s house at 12.55pm and leaving two hours later. Saxby told the jury that on the evening after Greenwood was killed, Danaher opened the “Enterprises” document on his laptop and deleted the antique dealer’s name from the list, and listed the valuable book for sale on the internet. The same evening he allegedly composed a letter to Beecroft’s wife in which he demanded a sum of 200 bitcoin (about £96,000) in exchange for leaving the family alone. The letter was not sent. “It takes a certain person to have done what the defendant did to Adrian Greenwood,” Saxby said, and “to use his brutality to scare someone he had already terrified … Cool, calculated, controlled. Before, during and after. And underpinning it all? Greed. It was money he was after.” The case continues."
2016-10-04T18:43:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested on Cardiff street to face six terror charges,"A man arrested by police on a Cardiff street has been charged with carrying instructions on guided missiles and a computer storage device disguised as a cufflink in pursuit of Islamic State’s campaign of terrorism. Samata Ullah, 33, who was arrested last month, was charged on Tuesday with six terrorism offences. He was detained in the third operation in a month resulting in an arrest by British police as they seek to disrupt alleged Islamist plotting of violence. Ullah has been charged with directing terrorism, providing training in encryption programs knowing the purpose was for terrorism, and using his blog site to provide such training. His activities are alleged to have “the intention of assisting another or others to commit acts of terrorism”. The Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command said Ullah had been charged with having “in his possession an article, namely one universal serial bus (USB) cufflink, that had an operating system loaded on to it for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism”. Ullah is also charged with having “in his possession articles namely a book about guided missiles and a PDF version of a book about advanced missile guidance and control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism”. The alleged offending occurred between 31 December 2015 and 22 September 2016, the date when he was arrested on the streets of the Welsh capital, one of several recent arrests which UK counter-terrorism officials believe may be significant. In August, police made arrests in Birmingham amid fears of a potential attack, leading to four people being charged, and detectives made arrests in London in September, resulting in charges against one person. Ullah will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday."
2016-10-04T23:01:47Z,uk-news,UK news,MoD withdraws attempt to strike out whistleblower's claim,"The Ministry of Defence has withdrawn its attempt to strike out a whistleblowing claim brought by a doctor who raised concerns about alleged discrepancies in the dispensing of strong painkillers at an army base where he was working. Dr Stephen Frost, a civilian doctor who had worked with the military for 20 years, was dismissed three years ago by text and email while on a family holiday, and since then has sought to find out why and for redress from the MoD. At a hearing in Manchester, the MoD confirmed it had withdrawn its application to have Frost’s claims struck out. John Hendy QC, for Frost, told the tribunal the parties had reached a “degree of agreement”. The hearing was adjourned so that discussions about a possible settlement could take place. No details of why the MoD had changed its approach were given. Frost, who was involved in the campaign for a full inquest on the weapons inspector David Kelly, who died at the height of the Iraq dossier scandal, described the last three years as a “Kafkaesque nightmare”. He said: “This has been a very difficult and sometimes lonely battle. The consequences for me and my family have been catastrophic. “I have lost over three years of my life and I have been told that it may take some time for me to recover. I have learned of the importance to us all of whistleblowers and of laws being in place to protect adequately those whistleblowers.” Frost’s solicitor, Helen Clifford of MW Solicitors, said: “Whistleblowers are modern-day heroes and the law urgently needs to be changed to afford them adequate protection. Dr Frost raised genuine concerns about potential criminality following a very serious dispensing error on a military camp and he believes that he was dismissed for doing so.” In July 2013, Frost was engaged to work as a civilian doctor at Weeton barracks near Blackpool through a private healthcare recruitment group. His contract was due to last until December that year. According to Frost, on 6 August 2013 he became aware of a dispensing discrepancy involving morphine sulphate tablets that occurred almost two weeks before he started working at the camp’s medical centre. He said tablets six times the strength of those that should have been dispensed were involved. Frost expressed his concerns to members of the practice team and later to an internal investigating team, and asked for the police to be informed. On 6 September 2013, while he was on holiday, Frost’s posting was terminated by text and email and he was told not to return to work on the following Monday. He said that no explanation was given. In January 2015, the MoD tried to have Frost’s case struck out, arguing he could not officially be regarded as a “worker” for the ministry despite the fact that he had worked almost exclusively for the armed services for almost 20 years through agencies. The MoD also argued he could not be treated as a whistleblower because he had not originally stipulated this was a basis of his case – despite the word “whistleblower” appearing on his initial claim form. At that point, a judge said a tribunal could take place. Frost has long questioned the official explanation for the death of David Kelly, who was found dead in woods near his Oxfordshire home in 2003, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair’s Labour government had “sexed up” a dossier that helped make the case for war in Iraq. The Hutton report concluded that Kelly, a member of a UN team sent to Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. Frost is among doctors who continue to question that conclusion. The MoD declined to comment. A spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on the details of an ongoing employment tribunal.”"
2016-10-05T07:40:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans trial to hear evidence from alleged rape victim,"A young woman who was allegedly raped by the footballer Ched Evans in a hotel room was due to give evidence at his retrial on Wednesday. Cardiff crown court has heard that a friend of Evans “hooked” the 19-year-old waitress when she was heavily intoxicated and went with her in a taxi to the hotel in the early hours of 30 May 2011. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Norwich, arrived at the hotel soon after and allegedly raped the woman before leaving via a fire exit. She woke up next day bruised and in pain but had been so “out of it” that she did not know she had been in the same room as the footballer, it is alleged. Simon Medland, prosecuting, told jurors they would be shown video of the alleged victim describing what she remembered of the night. She will watch the video at the same time as jurors from another part of the court and will then be brought into the room to answer questions from behind a curtain. In his opening speech on Tuesday, Medland told the jury that the woman believed the drinks she had consumed while in the same bar as Evans earlier that night had been spiked. But he said the prosecution was not suggesting that Evans had spiked her drinks. Medland argued that the woman could not possibly have consented to sex because of her intoxicated state. He said: “We submit that she was that intoxicated – for whatever reason – that she didn’t really know what on earth was happening and that what the facts of this case show is that she was raped by this young footballer in that room, not that she had consensual sex with him. “It is not a proper description, we suggest, to say that he had sex with [her]; it is more accurate perhaps to say to that he ‘did’ sex to her. Sex without consent is rape.” Medland said the woman would tell the jury she did not consent, adding: “How could she? There is good reason to conclude, we submit, that she didn’t even know Ched Evans was having sex with her. She had to piece together some fairly fragmentary memories of events later the next morning … long after this defendant had slipped away into the night through the fire escape door.” Evans, 27, denies rape. On Tuesday, the jury of six men and six women heard how earlier in the evening, Evans, then 22, and a friend, Clayton McDonald, had been in the same bar as the woman in the north Wales seaside town of Rhyl. The woman ended up at a kebab shop, where she fell over, collided with a delivery car, and dropped and left her handbag. She was with McDonald. “He had managed to hook the intoxicated, stumbling [woman]”, said Medland. “They got into a taxi and the taxi driver formed the view that [she] was ‘drunk, very docile and not with it’. From the taxi, McDonald, who made a phone call to someone saying: “I’ve got a girl”. The prosecution alleges he was speaking to Evans. McDonald, the woman and Evans ended up in the same hotel room, where the alleged rape took place. Jurors were told that Evans and McDonald have already stood trial. Evans was convicted and McDonald was found not guilty. Evans successfully appealed against his conviction and is being retried. The jury has been ordered by the judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, not to research the case online or to look at any social media surrounding it."
2016-10-05T09:32:30Z,uk-news,UK news,ScotRail dispute resolved after staff accept deal over guards,"Rail union leaders believe an escalating conflict with Southern could be settled after Scottish rail staff voted heavily to accept a compromise deal in a similar dispute. ScotRail services have been hit by a series of strikes over proposals to introduce driver-only operated electric trains from next year, in a dispute with close parallels to one at Southern Rail. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said on Wednesday its ScotRail members had voted by 10 to one to accept a revised offer from ScotRail Alliance where drivers will open train doors, but conductors will oversee closing them. Southern has threatened to sack its conductors unless the RMT accepts the terms of its eight-point offer by Thursday, which would change the role of conductors to “onboard supervisors”, paying them a £2,000 bonus to accept the change. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT, said he believed the deal with ScotRail Alliance could be a model for a settlement with Southern. On Tuesday, the RMT said Southern had rejected an attempt to start talks on the issue at the conciliation service Acas, and the firm was insisting it would only hold talks on implementing the driver-only operated trains policy. “Our members have backed a deal in a referendum ballot that is a major victory in the fight to stop the compromising of rail safety through the extension of driver-only operation,” Cash said. “This deal, which represents a benchmark for the industry, is exactly what we have proposed as a resolution to the Southern dispute. If it’s good enough for Scotland, it’s good enough for the south of England. “The deal guarantees a guard on every new electrified train and that the conductor will retain their full competency, including rules, track safety and evacuation.” ScotRail had described the revised offer last month as a “win-win” solution. The proposal had been put to the train drivers’ union Aslef and an in-principle deal agreed. ScotRail executives say privately they believe the dispute in Scotland was driven largely by the RMT’s conflict with Southern, where the unions are fighting a series of contentious proposals, including over ticket office closures. Cash made clear he saw the two disputes as linked. “The agreement has been reached after a campaign of industrial action and after intense negotiations and shows what can be achieved when management and unions get down to serious talks. That lesson should be a wake-up call to Southern rail,” he said. ScotRail, meanwhile, is under intense pressure over its own ailing services after the Scottish transport minister, Humza Yousaf, ordered it to improve poor performance figures, including high rates of cancellations."

2016-10-05T10:33:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Man found guilty of murdering Surjit Singh Chhokar after retrial,"A man has been convicted of the murder of Sikh waiter Surjit Singh Chhokar 17 years after he first stood trial for the killing. The victim’s family sobbed and embraced in the public gallery as Ronnie Coulter was found guilty of fatally stabbing the 32-year-old in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, in November 1998, after a row over a £100 cheque. In one of Scotland’s longest-running and most controversial murder cases, Coulter was retried following a change in the double jeopardy law in 2012. The case was officially reopened four years ago after a lengthy campaign for justice by Chhokar’s family, supported by Scotland’s leading human rights lawyer, Aamer Anwar. On Wednesday Anwar described the verdict as “not a cause for celebration but relief that finally justice has been done”. The failure of two prosecution cases in 1999 and 2000 led to a public outcry, and comparisons to the Stephen Lawrence case. Two official inquiries were launched, with one finding the prosecution and police guilty of institutional racism. The then lord advocate, Colin Boyd, admitted that Chhokar’s family had been failed by the system. Following the verdict, Anwar said: “At the end of the second trial in 2000, I stood on the steps of this court accusing our justice system of acting like a gentleman’s colonial club, of being arrogant, unaccountable and institutionally racist. But today the Chhokar family want to thank the prosecutors, Crown Office and Police Scotland for their unwavering commitment to justice. They have shown themselves at their finest.” During the four-week trial at the high court in Glasgow, the jury heard that Coulter, his nephew Andrew and another man, David Montgomery, went to see Chhokar on the night he died following a row over a stolen Giro cheque. The trio confronted the waiter in the street as he returned home from work with a takeaway meal and, after an altercation, the father of two collapsed and died of massive blood loss after being stabbed three times, once straight through his heart. Coulter denied murdering Chhokar, lodging a special defence blaming his nephew and Montgomery for the killing. The court heard that Coulter had been cleared of murder following a trial in 1999, and that Andrew Coulter, who was convicted of stabbing and killing another man in 1999, and Montgomery were also cleared of the murder in 2000. Both men gave evidence during the most recent trial and admitted being present on the night Chhokar died, but denied murder. For the defence, Donald Findlay QC argued that members of his family had conspired to make Ronnie Coulter a “scapegoat” for the murder, claiming that the trial had heard from witnesses who were “determined to say what they wanted to say for their own personal reasons”. But the prosecution dismissed the theory, with Alex Prentice, QC for the crown, urging the jury to ignore the unusual features of the case and describing the two previous trials as “largely irrelevant”. The jury heard Ronnie Coulter’s former sister-in-law describe an alleged confession made when she visited him in Barlinnie prison while he was on remand awaiting the first trial. She was asked by Prentice: “Did Ronnie Coulter ever say anything about the death of Surjit Singh Chhokar?” She replied: “He said ‘I stabbed him. I stabbed the Paki bastard.’” The third trial was attended every day by Chhokar’s 73-year-old mother, his sister and her children. His father, Darshan, died last October. Responding to the verdict, DCS Clark Cuzen acknowledged the “years of uncertainty” the family had endured, and said: “If Darshan Singh Chhokar was alive today, I can only imagine his feelings at seeing justice being served. He added: “It is important to recognise the tireless campaigning for justice over the years by the Chhokar family and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar. I hope they can take some comfort from today’s verdict.” Describing the “complex and challenging” two-year investigation that led to Coulter’s conviction, Cuzen said: “Through the passage of time, people can change allegiances and new evidence can come to light through independent statements. This tireless activity ultimately revealed fresh evidence that pointed the finger firmly at Ronnie Coulter as the man responsible for the violent and calculated attack on Surjit Singh Chhokar.“Whilst we were unable to find evidence of racial motivation at the time of the murder, there was evidence to support the fact that Ronnie Coulter described Surjit using racist terms when confessing to the murder. “Surjit Singh Chhokar was a well-liked member of the community and did not deserve to be the victim of a sustained period of intimidation which ultimately led to his murder.” The judge Lord Matthews told Coulter: “There is only one sentence I can pass of life imprisonment. The only question for me is how long you should serve before being eligible for parole.” Calling for background reports given the relatively minor nature of Coulter’s previous convictions and his mental health issues, he deferred sentence until 31 October."

He witnessed Stephen being brutally attacked and then dying on the side of a road. He too was a victim of the attack and the main witness in the investigation into Stephen’s murder. He suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack. But over a long period of time, the police treated him so badly that they were forced to pay him substantial compensation, coupled with an apology, after he sued them on the grounds that they had treated him like a criminal. (See this and this for more details). Brooks was arrested by the police on eight occasions in the seven years after Stephen’s murder for offences that were either dropped, dismissed by a judge, or overturned on appeal. He made a number of complaints about the police’s conduct. On Monday Brooks is due to appear at a public meeting to talk about how the police spied on him. Also due to speak are Lisa Jones, who discovered that her partner of six years was undercover officer Mark Kennedy, and actor Ricky Tomlinson. Undercover police gathered intelligence on Brooks, a vulnerable witness to the murder, while he was taking legal action against Scotland Yard.
Details of the surveillance - which have received relatively little publicity - were uncovered by QC Mark Ellison who was commissioned by the then home secretary Theresa May to examine a series of allegations concerning undercover policing. In a critical report, Ellison documented how Brooks’s activities were recorded in 18 intelligence reports over a two-year period. (See here from page 277 onwards). The undercover police collected personal and tactical information about the civil case that he had initiated against the police. The reports contained, for instance, information about the advice he had received from his lawyers, and his expectations about settling the case. Brooks was also involved in campaigning for justice in the Stephen Lawrence case, and these activities were recorded by the undercover police in their intelligence reports. The public inquiry led by former judge William Macpherson had found that the Metropolitan police had failed to find Stephen’s killers because of a “combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers.” Macpherson had also criticised police for stereotyping Brooks in a racist way and undermining his credibility as a witness. In his report, Ellison criticised the collection of the intelligence on Brooks saying it should not have been gathered. He found that the Met was motivated partially “to defend its own interests in the fallout of the [Macpherson] public inquiry and it was also vigorously defending liability in the civil proceedings.” Ellison pointed out, for instance, that as a basic proposition of the legal system, someone engaged in legal action should not have their private conversations monitored by their opponents.
He found that the intelligence gathered had “little value” in terms of policing public order - the stated aim of the undercover operations. Ellison does not disclose which undercover officer or officers gathered information on Brooks. However a likely candidate is an undercover officer who is known only by the code-name N81. N81 infiltrated an anti-racist group known as the Movement for Justice, according to a senior Metropolitan police source who has been involved in the management of covert operations. Also scheduled to speak at the public meeting next Monday is Lisa Jones, the woman who exposed Kennedy after he had deceived her for years. Police have apologised and paid compensation to her and other women. Lisa Jones is a pseudonym. Read this powerful account of how she unmasked him - it was the beginning of a series of events that has led to the exposure of the police’s long-running operation to infiltrate hundreds of political groups. Ricky Tomlinson (see here) is pressing for a proper investigation into why police monitored his political activities. Also due to speak is Tamsin Allen, a lawyer at the Bindmans law firm who represents many who were spied on by the police. The meeting - to be held in London - has been organised by the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance (COPS) - further details are here.

2016-10-05T14:07:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Sian Blake murder: Arthur Simpson-Kent gets whole-life sentence,"A cannabis dealer who bludgeoned and stabbed the former EastEnders actor Sian Blake before killing their sons in their sleep has been given a whole life prison sentence. Arthur Simpson-Kent, 49, pleaded guilty to killing Blake, 43, and their sons, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four, at the family home in Erith, south-east London. He repeatedly batter ed Blake and the two boys around the head with a small axe before stabbing them , days after Blake learned she was terminally ill and decided to leave their “unhealthy” relationship and move in with her mother. Following the assault Simpson-Kent wrapped the dead bodies in plastic and buried them in the garden before fleeing to Ghana. Sentencing him at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said Simpson-Kent had abused his position of trust and attacked his victims, who were unable to defend themselves. “I have been left in no doubt that this is one of those exceptional and rare cases where the requirements of punishment mean that a whole life order must be imposed, even after taking into account the mitigating factors,” he said. “The manner in which the defendant killed his victims in this case was truly horrific. Although the murder weapons have never been found, the evidence, including the pathology evidence, is consistent with his having killed each of his victims in turn, first Sian Blake and then each of the boys. It is consistent with his doing so with repeated blows with a blunt instrument, using severe force, and then by using a bladed weapon.” He added: “He sought to lay a false trail by using Sian Blake’s mobile phone. He lied to the police and others about the whereabouts of the family.” The court heard that Simpson-Kent had told Dr Philip Joseph, a psychiatrist, “something just snapped in me”.
He told him: “I felt as if I had just been pushed off a diving board and was falling. “I grabbed hold of a small axe that was kept on a ledge in the kitchen. Sian’s head was bent low down and she was bent over looking at the floor. I approached her from the side and hit her at the back of the head as hard as I could and she fell unconscious at the first blow. After that I hit her repeatedly on the head. My mind was blank and I was focusing on doing and not thinking. It was like I was there but not there.” Joseph said the defendant had no history of depression, but he had features consistent with a narcissistic personality, which include “a grandiose sense of self-importance, requiring excessive admiration” as well as being exploitative, arrogant and lacking in empathy. Simpson-Kent remained impassive as the sentence was given, as Blake’s family cried in the public gallery. Simpson-Kent attacked his victims on the night of 14-15 December 2015. Blake, who played Frankie Pierre in 56 episodes of EastEnders between 1996 and 1997, had been diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease, and was unable to fend off the blows by her partner. Singh said there was evidence Blake and her eldest son had struggled or been restrained, while this was “less marked” with the youngest child. A day before Blake and her sons were murdered, she had gone to her mother, Lindell Blake, and asked if the whole family could move back into her house in Leyton, east London. Told that Simpson-Kent was not welcome, the former actor “appeared to accept” the decision and her family understood that over the Christmas period she would move back to east London with her boys, leaving Simpson Kent behind. That day, 13 December 2015, was the last time her family saw Blake and her sons alive. Learning of the plans the next day, Simpson-Kent attacked his family “with heavy, deliberate, repeated blows”. He then attempted to cover up his crimes by wrapping each of his victims in plastic and sheeting and burying them in the garden. He laid a concrete slab on each and covered them with soil before hurriedly attempting to repaint their bungalow. Simpson-Kent then called a charity to take away all clothes and possessions belonging to Blake and the two boys, and burned some items in the garden. Police went to the bungalow on 16 December, but Simpson-Kent was uncooperative, eventually letting officers into the house and telling them that Blake had been fed up with the tension between him and her family and had taken the children to Cambridge. Blood stains were later discovered in the house, before the bodies were unearthed outside. In “a deliberate attempt to mislead”, Simpson-Kent sent texts to Blake’s family letting them think she was moving away for months and did not want to speak to them, the court heard. In the days following her death, her family received texts from her mobile phone saying she had gone away. One sent to her sister Ava read: “I’m taking time to myself and my children without constant opinions from family and friends […] nobody knows what I am going through and regardless of all the comments, no one can cure me. “I have had enough of appeasing everyone. We are away and I will not be calling or speaking to anyone for a few months.” As police launched a missing persons investigation into Blake and her children, Simpson-Kent booked a flight from Glasgow to Accra via Amsterdam. In a message to a friend, he said: “I can’t go into details about what I have done but I only have two choices. Go to Ghana one way or die.” In the Ghanaian town of Busua, Simpson-Kent told a local man he “had killed his girlfriend first and then he had killed the two children afterwards”, the court was told. He was seen “really partying” on New Year’s Eve and was spotted taking two young women to a cafe the following morning.
Two days later he was caught by local police. In desperation he told them he had killed his partner and children as part of an agreed murder-suicide pact because of Blake’s terminal illness and his poor relationship with her family. The prosecution argued there was no evidence to support this. Malcolm McHaffie, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said Simpson-Kent had committed “brutal, cold-blooded murders of his partner and children, whose trust he grossly breached”. He said the defendant had denied Blake’s family precious time with their much-loved sister, daughter, mother as well as wiping out “a future generation of the family”. Simpson-Kent had gone to great lengths to conceal his crimes, misleading friends, family and the police about what he had done, McHaffie added. “Even more callously, he suggested that Sian and he had entered into a pact to end all of their lives because of her condition. This was not true. In fact, Sian had been making inquiries about schools for the children and had been considering moving to live with her family without him.” In a statement read outside the Old Bailey, Blake’s family said Simpson-Kent was a “monster” who had attacked their loved ones in their home, “where they should have felt safe and secure”. “Arthur has robbed us of our dreams and aspirations, everything we wished for Sian and our precious boys,” they said. “He stood in the dock with a smirk on his face and showed no remorse.”
DCI Graeme Gwyn, from Scotland Yard’s homicide and major crime command, said: “I hope that the sentence passed today gives Sian’s family some small amount of comfort at this very difficult time. I would also like to thank the Ghanaian authorities for their assistance in relation to the arrest and extradition of Simpson-Kent.” In a statement read to the court on Tuesday, Blake’s mother said: “It’s difficult to put into words how much we have suffered as a result of their murder and how we will continue to suffer for the rest of our lives. We are all living a life sentence, we are all living a nightmare. I would give my life for another moment with my daughter.” She said Blake had lived for her sons. “She was besotted with Zachary and Amon. They completed her.” The family now had to live knowing that Blake and her children would have been “scared, terrified, before this monster slaughtered them in their home”, she said. “Time is supposed to be a great healer but our wounds are open and bare for everyone to see. We have scars where Arthur has taken what was not his to take.” In a victim impact statement read to the court, Blake’s cousin Cheryl Golding said: “I have nightmares, visions of how I suppose they were murdered – the terror in their eyes, the look that would have been on Sian’s face. “Sian, in life, would want the best in people – could never quite comprehend that sometimes people do evil things. She would simply say: ‘Why do people want to do that?’ “I suffer each day and night with these thoughts going through my head. Why did they have to die? They could have been left alone.”"
2016-10-05T14:40:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Prosecutors to re-examine vicarage death of newborn baby,"The death of a newborn baby at a vicarage that resulted in a murder investigation will be re-examined by prosecutors after an inquest heard the boy could have survived. A vicar and his daughter did not resuscitate the newborn baby and left it in the house alone for up to two hours after it was born following a concealed pregnancy, an inquest heard. Baby Jonathan Percival was born alive at the Holy Trinity vicarage in Freckleton, Lancashire, and took a breath but was not given any medical attention and died shortly afterwards. His mother, Ruth, allegedly told midwives soon after giving birth in November 2014 that she did not want the baby and asked them to dispose of him. The Rev James Percival went on to tell the police the child appeared “sallow and lifeless” and he thought it was “obviously deceased” but Blackpool coroner’s court was told the baby could have survived up to 15 minutes after delivery. The inquest heard Jonathan was born between 3.30pm and 4pm on 25 November 2014 but was not seen by a medical professional until about 5.35pm when the reverend let paramedics into the family home at Sunnyside Close. Ruth Percival, who was 28 at the time, and her father were arrested and questioned on suspicion of murder shortly after the baby’s death. In April this year, the pair were told they would face no charges – but the case could now be re-opened and may go before a criminal court. Coroner Alan Wilson dramatically adjourned the inquest at Blackpool town hall after three medical professionals giving evidence agreed that the baby had been born alive and suggested he could have survived had he been given the correct medical attention. Wilson said he would have to pass the case on to the director of public prosecutions as evidence given during the inquest “strengthened previously existing suspicions” a criminal offence may have taken place. The evidence suggested that the baby had an 80% chance of survival had he been given correct medical attention within 20 minutes of being born. The coroner singled out the evidence of Dr Ruth Gottstein, a consultant neonatologist, who told the court. “If resuscitation had been initiated, I think the baby would survived. Mouth-to-mouth would have done a good job.” He said: “This is a rare occurrence and not one that I take lightly but given the evidence I have heard it strengthens the previously existing suspicions that a criminal offence may have taken place to cause or allow the death of a child. “In court Dr Gottstein clearly stated that if a resuscitation attempt had been made she could see no reason why this child would not have survived.” The inquest was told that at the time of the birth, which was a full-term pregnancy, Ruth Percival, now 30, was living at the vicarage with her mother Susan, 66, and her father, who had been vicar at the church for 11 years. She was said to have hidden the pregnancy from her parents. The court heard that Ruth Percival, an office cleaner, had contacted her GP to try and terminate her pregnancy, but then “buried her head in the sand” after being told by staff at the Marie Stopes centre in Manchester that she was “too far gone”. On 25 November, 2014, she was sent home from work suffering from stomach pains. She was in the house with the reverend when he heard her in pain in the downstairs bathroom of the vicarage. He opened the bathroom to find the his daughter on the floor covered in blood holding a baby wrapped in a towel. The court heard he took the baby from her who was described as being “sallow and lifeless” and put him on the floor before moving him to the sofa. The pair then did not contact the emergency services, with the vicar instead cleaning the bathroom while his daughter went upstairs to change her clothes. They then left the baby in the house alone and went to a previously arranged GP appointment. It was only once they arrived at the GP surgery that emergency crews were alerted. Ruth Percival told her GP about the birth and that the child had been left alone in the vicarage. Wilson said: “They left the child wrapped in a towel on the sofa. When the GP took an account from Ruth and then went out to the car to get her father and an ambulance would be called for Ruth and paramedics would be sent to the house and he was told to go home.” But the inquest heard that the reverend did not go home immediately and instead went to pick up his wife from Dobbies Garden centre before dropping her off at the GP surgery. He finally went home and let paramedics in at just after 5.30pm – almost two hours after the baby had been born. Wilson said the vicar then allegedly told paramedics that he saw his daughter “put the baby in a bin”. But both he and his daughter subsequently denied putting the child in a bin. However, they admitted that the baby had been taken out of the house after being shown photographs of Jonathan with a leaf stuck to his left thigh. The baby was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital where he was pronounced dead. Midwives found that the baby had the cord wrapped around his neck. Whilst at the hospital the coroner said Ruth Percival allegedly told midwives: “My dad said the baby died because the cord was wrapped around the neck. I wanted nothing to do with the baby. I want the nurse to dispose of it.” During the two-hour inquest the vicar and his daughter sat at opposite ends of the courtroom as three medical professionals including two pathologists gave evidence. The father of the child, Brian Hanlon, had been invited to attend the proceedings as an interested party but had not responded to correspondence from the coroner. The inquest heard that owing to the baby being born in a concealed environment and with the mother being in denial it was particularly vulnerable. Pathologists could not ascertain the cause of death, but the inquest heard there was a possibility asphyxiation could have been a contributory factor. It was also heard that because the baby did not receive any medical attention after being born its chances of survival were significantly reduced."
2016-10-05T15:07:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail and RMT to hold talks in bid to avert series of strikes,"Southern rail and union officials will hold talks on Thursday in an eleventh-hour bid to avert a series of strikes due to begin next week. The rail franchise’s owner, Govia Thameslink, has fought a bitter battle with the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union over proposed changes to the role of conductors and had set a deadline of Thursday for acceptance of its proposals. Before agreeing to new talks, Govia had said that if the deal was not accepted by midday on Thursday it would press on with changes “including the issuing of notice later this week to those conductors moving to the [on board supervisor] role”. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, had earlier written to Govia rejecting the company’s final offer but said he would still attend the talks. “Additionally, my union shares our members’ concerns over your company’s obvious briefings to the media over the past few days that you will be sacking them this week,” he said in the letter. “This really is a disgraceful way to treat hard-working people - your staff - and cannot be left without complaint. “To find out from the media that my members are in danger of losing their jobs is no way for a 21st century employer to treat its workforce or handle a lawful dispute.” A separate accord agreed between the RMT and the Scottish franchise ScotRail on Wednesday raised hopes that the dispute at Southern would finally be resolved. ScotRail services have been hit by a series of strikes over proposals to introduce driver-only electric trains from next year, in a dispute with close parallels to the row at Southern. The RMT said its ScotRail members had voted by 10 to one to accept a revised offer from ScotRail Alliance where drivers will open train doors, but conductors will oversee closing them. The last-ditch talks between RMT and Southern come as a row continues over the firm’s attempts to win commuters’ support through an advertising campaign. In the latest chapter of the dispute, Southern ordered managers to destroy “offensive” posters urging customers to “strike back” against the RMT after the campaign backfired. An internal email sent to managers reads: “Due to the extremely negative public sentiment around the brand it has been decided to cancel this poster campaign. Could you please ensure all copies of the below posters are removed from display and destroyed immediately.” The posters encouraged commuters to send tweets to the RMT to oppose its strike plans, but the PR offensive backfired when angry commuters hijacked the campaign’s Twitter hashtag to criticise Southern for poor service and condemn its relations with staff. The union said it had forced Southern to withdraw the posters “after a huge public backlash”, and that some staff had been “abused and assaulted as a result of the company actions”. Cash, said: “This is a despicable and nasty campaign designed by Southern to set their workforce up for abuse and assault. It is incitement pure and simple and we are now seeing the consequences. “Encouraging abuse of staff, who are doing nothing other than standing up for passenger safety, is a measure of this basket case outfit running Britain’s biggest rail franchise. We see today new advertisements in the newspapers, regardless of the massive cost involved. “It is estimated the campaign budget is around £500,000, money that could have been spent on keeping the guards and resolving the dispute.”
Govia Thameslink said although it was withdrawing the posters it was not ashamed of their message. “We continue to run the campaign as can be clearly seen by the press ads that are running all week. Feelings were running high after day one of the campaign and we decided, having taken on board comments from some passengers, not to display the posters at stations,” it said. “But we make no apologies for this campaignOur aim was to get the debate going and let people know the truth that our plans to modernise the railway will guarantee jobs, pay and safety and keep a second member of staff on board all the trains where we currently have conductors.” The industrial dispute arose after Govia Thameslink announced plans to change the role of conductors to “on board supervisors”, which the RMT said would put passenger safety at risk.
The franchise has been hit by months of disruption, cancellations and strikes, as well as the emergence of commuter activism, while the company battled with the union. Govia’s chief executive, Charles Horton, wrote to Cash on Monday, calling the dispute pointless and putting a deadline on an eight-point offer tabled in August. Horton had offered all conductors on the franchise a £2,000 bonus if the changes to their role were agreed, but said the company could claw back the sum if the union continued to strike.

2016-10-05T15:31:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland: VIP child abuse report will not be published in full,"Scotland Yard has said it will not publish the full report on its heavily criticised investigation of child sexual abuse allegations against VIPs because it contains “confidential and sensitive information”. It is believed this refers to information about and from exonerated suspects and their accusers. A report by the retired judge Sir Richard Henriques on the conduct of Operation Midland, which investigated senior military and political figures, is expected to criticise decisions made by officers. Scotland Yard said on Wednesday that there was no timetable for the publication of the report, but confirmed it would receive a draft version this week. It said it would release key findings and recommendations.
A leaked letter has also shown the report will only be released once the Metropolitan police have decided whether they agree with its findings, sparking accusations that the force is attempting to manipulate it. Written by the assistant commissioner Helen King to people falsely accused of child abuse, the letter says she strongly expects that it will be impossible to publish the whole report because it “will contain material that is confidential and affects the rights of third parties”. She said the force would need to consider very carefully not only “what can and cannot be published from it, but also the extent to which the Metropolitan police agrees or otherwise with all of its findings and recommendations”. “It will clearly take time to work through the detail of it before we will be in a position to decide what may be suitable for sharing with you and a number of others with a similar interest,” King writes. The £2m Operation Midland ended in March after it was concluded there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge. The Met and its soon-to-be-retired chief, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, are expected to face strong criticism for relying on the testimony of a single alleged abuse victim named as “Nick”, who claimed politicians and military figures abused children in London and the home counties between 1975 and 1984. Nick’s claims led to allegations against public figures including Edwin Bramall and Leon Brittan and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. All denied the allegations against them. Proctor has accused the police of orchestrating a cover-up. “Not content with appointing their own judge, setting their own terms of reference, excluding evidential matters and ensuring Henriques reports to Hogan-Howe directly, now the MPS are ensuring it is not and cannot be independent by tampering with their own report once written.,” he said. “Their cover-up continues. They are going to ‘doctor’ their own private investigation. It bears all the hallmarks of a secret police state.” He demanded the report be released in full and said that the Met was trying to hide its role as well as that of politicians. Lady Brittan, Lord Brittan’s widow, declined to comment. The Met said on Wednesday: “The MPS made clear when Sir Richard was commissioned to look at the issues that key findings and recommendations from his independent review would be published but the full review would remain private as it would contain confidential and sensitive information. “We will not comment further on Sir Richard Henriques’ work as the process continues.” The Guardian first reported that Henriques’s findings would not be published in full in February. The Met then said the report would be regarded as private for Hogan-Howe. Scotland Yard will face trouble if Henriques rules against it on the question of whether it was right to investigate. Police have been criticised in some quarters for the length of time they took to make their inquiries. An earlier review by Dorset police found the Met was right to investigate an allegation of rape against Brittan. The former home secretary died in January 2015 not knowing that police had concluded four months previously that he had no case to answer. The Met has said the Henriques review would consider concerns raised by Lady Brittan widow and Bramall. Hogan-Howe has met both of them in private to express “regret about the distress felt”. Henriques examined whether a policy that “the victim should always be believed” should be dropped. Hogan-Howe claimed Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary had recommended such a move in 2014, but the HMIC’s head, Sir Tom Winsor, said Hogan-Howe had misunderstood its advice. Hogan-Howe said last week his decision to retire early was not linked to the inquiry. He is not expected to be the target of substantive and direct criticism in the report. Detectives found indirect support for some of Nick’s account, such as locations of places and descriptions of interiors, which they believed could only have come from him having been in those places. His accounts could not be disproved, and police policy at the time was that a victim’s account should be treated as true unless it could be shown to be wrong."
2016-10-05T19:11:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish government calls for end to work programme sanctions,"The Scottish government is pressing Westminster to ensure that people taking part in voluntary work programmes in the country’s newly devolved social security system do not have to face stigmatising sanctions. Addressing Holyrood on Wednesday afternoon, the employability minister, Jamie Hepburn, called on the UK government to urgently clarify its position after formally asking the UK secretary of state for work and pensions to confirm that Scots taking part in the programmes will be exempt from having their benefits stopped or reduced. The newly devolved powers, which were agreed under the Scotland Act, allow Scottish ministers to design their own employment services for disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment for the first time from April 2017, and will account for around £2.7bn or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill. These transitional arrangements will be made before a full Scottish programme of employment support begins in April 2018. But sanctions will remain reserved to Westminster. According to research by the Scottish Greens, 80,000 sanctions have been issued to people on employment programmes in Scotland since 2010. An initial response from the DWP to Hepburn’s request lodged last month was received the day before the debate. The employability minister deemed it “inconclusive” because, while it accepted that it was for Scottish ministers to decide how conditionality would apply to devolved employment programmes, it fell short of confirming that sanctions would not apply to people taking part in these programmes. Meeting a group of single parents at the Edinburgh offices of One Parent Families Scotland earlier on Wednesday, Hepburn emphasised that his government “doesn’t want to facilitate the UK government’s sanctions regime”. Instead, it was planning work programmes that were voluntary and took into account the complexity of individual circumstances, Hepburn explained, after hearing the parents describe sleepless nights under threat of sanction and the practical difficulties of finding even entry-level jobs that were possible in tandem with childcare. Satwat Rehman, director at One Parent Families Scotland, welcomed the proposed voluntary regime, explaining: “The vast majority of single parents want to work but feel they are made to choose between being a parent or a worker, and forced into low-paid work with no career progression that isn’t going to get them out of poverty. “We are fundamentally opposed to the use of forced destitution as a policy instrument. This offers the opportunity to develop a more effective approach to the UK government’s very damaging ‘work-first’ conditionality regime.”
Speaking later in the chamber debate, Hepburn told MSPs: “While we won’t have the powers to prevent people from being sanctioned, we want to do what we can to protect people from this unnecessary stress and harm, and to give people taking part in our new voluntary programmes the assurance that they will not be sanctioned.“I will continue to urge [the DWP] to respect our desire that no JobCentre Plus client is forced to take part in our programmes and is under threat of sanction,” and that he would press UK ministers at a meeting in London next week. Hepburn also referred to the drastic cut in funding from the DWP for the devolved employability programmes from £53m to £7m next year. The Scottish cabinet has since offered an additional £20m annually, up to the end of the current parliament. Earlier on Wednesday, Scotland’s communities secretary, Angela Constance, announced a new socio-economic duty, legally obliging all public bodies across Scotland – including councils and Holyrood – to consider how policy and strategy decisions contribute to tackling poverty. Part of the Fairer Scotland Action Plan, introducing the duty was a recommendation of the Scottish government’s poverty tsar, Naomi Eisenstadt. A similar duty in the UK government’s Equality Act 2010 was blocked by Theresa May when she was home secretary."
2016-10-05T23:01:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Young people with knives who film victims for social media face harsher punishments,"Young people carrying knives who film the humiliation of their victims for social media could face more severe punishments under draft sentencing guidelines published for England and Wales on Thursday. Other “aggravating factors” for judges and magistrates to take into account when considering defendants convicted of possessing a bladed article or offensive weapon in public include being in a group or gang. Those attempting to conceal their identity by wearing a hood or balaclava and anyone targeting the vulnerable or victims working in the public sector are also likely to receive tougher sentences. The new draft guidelines are published by the sentencing council in order to take into account changes in the law and recent court judgments. The latest proposals do not cover offences where a knife or other weapon is actually used to harm a victim, nor the use or possession of firearms. The aggravating factors for youth offenders include the proposal that “deliberate humiliation of victims, including but not limited to filming of the offence, deliberately committing the offence before a group of peers with the intent of causing additional distress or circulating details/photos/videos etc of the offence on social media or within peer groups”. The council said it was included because it is “aware that through the use of social media, the recording and sharing of photographs and video footage has become increasingly common”, adding: “This sort of behaviour is often used to embarrass or humiliate the victim.” Such circumstances could also be taken into consideration in cases involving adults. Courts deal with large numbers of offensive weapon cases, the consultation document said, with approximately 7,800 adult offenders sentenced for the offences in 2015. Last year the government introduced a new “two strikes” regime meaning adults caught with a blade more than once face a minimum custodial sentence of six months. Courts should impose the minimum punishment unless there are particular circumstances that make doing so unjust. Figures released last month showed that nearly half of repeat offenders avoided jail in nearly a year after the change took effect. Overall, the proportion of knife possession offenders sentenced to immediate custody is rising, while average prison terms have also gone up. The council said the introduction of the guidelines, which would cover England and Wales, may therefore lead to some increases in sentence levels – most likely in relation to adults convicted of possession offences. In cases involving youths, courts will be encouraged to look in greater detail at their age and maturity, background and circumstances. District judge Richard Williams, who is a member of the sentencing council member said: “If people carry knives, there is always the risk that they will be used, and with tragic consequences. “As the court of appeal has stated, too many people are carrying knives and it only takes a moment of anger or drunkenness for one to be pulled out with fatal results or serious injury. “Through these guidelines, we want to provide courts with comprehensive, up to date guidance to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of offending.”"
2016-10-06T06:46:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged serial killer Stephen Port 'had appetite for sex with unconscious men',"An alleged serial killer drugged and murdered four men he met on gay networking sites in his pursuit of his “fetish” for sexual intercourse with young males while they were unconscious, a court heard. Stephen Port, 41, invited his alleged victims to his one-bedroom flat, and either spiked their drinks with the “date-rape” drug GHB or injected them with it to sate his “appetite for penetrating drugged young men”, an Old Bailey jury was told. Port then allegedly dragged the bodies out of his flat, propping three of them up against a churchyard wall near his home in Barking, east London, having planted bottles containing GHB on some of them and a fake suicide note on one, the court heard. Port, a chef, is accused of 29 charges against 12 young men, including four murders, seven rapes, four indecent assaults and of administering a substance with intent over a three-and-a-half-year period. Port denies the charges. The alleged victims who died were Anthony Walgate, 23, from Hull, Gabriel Kovari, 22, from Lewisham, south London, Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend, Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham, east London. Prosecuting, Jonathan Rees QC said Port met the men through websites such as Grindr. He told the jury of 10 women and two men that the case would feature fairly graphic evidence of a sexual nature which they should approach in “a cool, dispassionate and analytical manner”. “The prosecution say this is a case about a man – the defendant – who, in the pursuit of nothing more than his own sexual gratification, variously drugged, sexually assaulted and in four cases killed young gay men he had invited back to his flat,” Rees said. He said Port described himself as “70% more gay than straight” with a preference for young, smaller, boyish-type men “often referred to as ‘twinks’”. His “appetite for penetrating drugged young men” was reflected in the “drug-rape” pornography he watched, and he occasionally filmed himself having sexual intercourse with unconscious males, Rees said. He had the propensity “to render young gay men unconscious with drugs without their consent so he could have sex with them in that state. That was his particular inclination, his particular fetish, and what turned him on,” said Rees. The jury heard that Port used a range of drugs: poppers or bottles of amyl nitrite; viagra; M – also referred to as Meow Meow; T or Tina, a name for crystal meth; and G, either GHB or GBL in its liquid form. “GHB is of particular significance in this case. The postmortem examinations on the four young men who died revealed that each had died from a drug overdose featuring high levels of GHB,” said Rees. The circumstances of each of the deaths were “strikingly similar”. Each alleged victim was between 21 and 25 and had died within a short time of meeting Port. Port had engaged in sexual activity with them, they had died of drugs toxicity, and in three cases were found with a bottle of GBL/GHB in circumstances consistent with being planted, the prosecution claim. Each was found in an outside location close to Port’s address; three in a churchyard and one in his street. Three were propped up in a similar position, said Rees. Port was the common factor, and he had lied to police about his involvement with the victims, said Rees. After the first death – that of Anthony Walgate – Port was convicted of perverting the course of justice after making a false statement. He had falsely denied ever having met Kovari and Taylor, and had denied writing the suicide note found on Whitworth, jurors heard. Rees said Port had acted as a male escort, according to one former partner, who described him having a big sexual appetite and who particularly liked men in their late teens. The defendant allegedly met with Walgate, a fashion student working as a male escort, through the website Sleepyboys, offering him £800 for an “overnight” and picking him up from Barking station at 10pm on 17 June 2014, using the name Jo Dean, the court heard. Walgate had texted a friend giving the details of who he was meeting, joking: “In case I get killed.” Around 30 hours later, at 4am on 19 June 2014, Port called the emergency services reporting that a young boy was “collapsed or had had a seizure or was drunk” on the street outside his flat. He did not give his name, and claimed he was just driving by. Police and ambulance attended. A doctor pronounced Walgate dead shortly before 8am, although it was clear he had been dead for some hours. A holdall next to the body contained a bottle containing GHB, and a postmortem revealed high levels of GHB in his blood and urine “within the range at which deaths from GHB intoxication have been reported”, said Rees. Port was discovered by police, who had rung him back, asleep in bed. He then told officers that he had found the male lying unconscious and had propped him up against the wall as he thought the boy had had a seizure, and then entered his flat and had fallen asleep. Rees told jurors there were similarities in these circumstances with the case of another man who, three weeks earlier, had been seen with Port at Barking station “in a state of distress”, and “unsteady on his feet, incoherent and vomiting”. Port had told station, ambulance and police he had found the 23-year-old “under the influence” outside his home. The prosecution allege Port had drugged him at his flat after the two met through the website Fitlads, giving him a clear liquid, which he thought was water, and which caused him to fall unconscious. The man had woken to find himself naked and lying on the floor before Port took him to the station. He was deliberately drugged “so the defendant could engage in sexual activity with him while he was unconscious”, the prosecution alleged. The court heard that Port’s first alleged victim was a 19-year-old whom he met in February 2012 through Grindr and invited to his flat. The man passed out and woke to find Port having sex with him which he had not consented to. The victim later told friends and a counsellor he believed his drink had been spiked, and that he had been “date-raped”. Of the eight alleged victims who are alive, the prosecution allege five were raped after being drugged, and one was the victim of some other sexual activity. Of the four men who died, the prosecution said: “It offends common sense to suggest that it was just an unfortunate coincidence that all of these men happened to die from an overdose featuring high levels of GHB shortly after meeting the defendant.” The case continues."
2016-10-06T10:23:08Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hard Brexit could cost Scotland Â£2,000 a head and 80,000 jobs","The Scottish economy would suffer a severe shock if the UK has a “hard Brexit”, losing up to 80,000 jobs and seeing wages fall by £2,000 a head per year, an economics thinktank has warned.
The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) has told the Scottish parliament that entirely leaving the EU single market – known as a hard Brexit – would see the Scottish economy decline by 5% overall, or by £8bn within a decade. The prospects of the UK government pursuing a hard Brexit, basing trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation tariffs and bilateral deals, appears to have jumped following the hardline rhetoric at this week’s Conservative conference in Birmingham. With some ministers openly talking of heavily cutting the UK’s foreign workforce, Theresa May, the prime minister, hinted at a hard Brexit by saying she would prioritise tight controls on immigration and ending the European Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in the UK. Those moves would appear to preclude membership of the single market, which requires freedom of movement and standardised rules for business. But May insisted she would still seek “to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market”. The report’s stark warnings are likely to redouble demands from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, that keeping single market membership should be the UK’s main priority after the June referendum’s narrow vote to leave. The FAI’s study for Holyrood’s Europe committee forecasts that even in a best-case scenario, where the UK adopts Norwegian-style membership of the single market but remains outside the EU, the Scottish economy would lose up to £5bn in value over 10 years. The institute, part of the University of Strathclyde, said its modelling suggested that up to 30,000 people in Scotland could lose their jobs while wages for those still in work would fall by about 3-4% or £800 to £1,200 a year. Professor Graeme Roy, the thinktank’s director, said its forecasts suggested the UK’s economy would be even harder hit by Brexit because a far higher volume of its exports went into the EU, suggesting higher job losses and deeper cuts to GDP. Scotland’s economy was weaker and more sluggish than the UK’s as a whole before the referendum, with public spending running a substantial £15bn annual deficit, increasing its vulnerability. As Scotland’s largest market remains the rest of the UK, with EU trade worth £11.5bn versus £48.5bn from the rest of the UK, a recession south of the border would add to the pressure on Scottish businesses. And unlike the 2008 banking crash, this impact would be long-term. Roy added that there were complex forces at play. Some industries with greater reliance on EU trade, such as transport and services, would be hit hardest. Under a hard Brexit scenario, 25,000 jobs would be lost from wholesale and retail, transport and warehousing sectors alone. Ministers could now start looking at strategies for supporting the most vulnerable sectors. But others with a wider global market may not be so hard hit. The Scotch whisky industry, which generates up to £5bn a year in exports but supports relatively few jobs, could benefit from a lower pound and see sales grow in non-EU markets. Joan McAlpine MSP, the convener of the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee which commissioned the report, said it“paints a grim picture”.If the UK government leads us into a hard Brexit the evidence presented in this report indicates that there could be disastrous consequences for jobs, exports and production,” she added. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s economy spokeswoman, said: “This report shows the cost of the Tories’ reckless Brexit gamble and how vital it is that Scotland, and indeed the whole UK, retains access to the single market. When Theresa May hinted at a hard Brexit earlier this week, sterling crashed to a 31-year low. Even the most blinkered of Brexiteers cannot ignore the huge risk this poses to our economy.” A UK government spokeswoman said May and David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, had already made clear they were seeking a bespoke deal with the EU, to get the best outcome possible. “As the report itself recognises, we have not begun negotiating our exit from the EU, so it seems very premature to draw conclusions from some highly speculative models,” she said."

2016-10-06T12:40:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Sofa factory boss 'disappointed' by Amber Rudd's staffing criticism,"The boss of a sofa factory that the home secretary has claimed recruited “almost exclusively” from Romania and Poland has said 75% of his workforce is British. Matt O’Flynn, the managing director of Collins and Hayes in the home secretary’s Hastings constituency, said he was “very disappointed” when Amber Rudd cited his firm on Wednesday as an example of a company that relied too heavily on overseas staff and “didn’t even consider training locally”. Rudd has faced a strong backlash from business after she confirmed that the Home Office was considering requiring companies to declare the proportion of international staff in their workforce. Ministers were said to want to see lists of companies published and those employers with the highest proportions of foreign staff “named and shamed” for not employing British people when they could.
The home secretary cited the unnamed sofa company to highlight her case, saying: “I went and visited a factory quite recently where they recruit almost exclusively from Romania and Poland, where they have people who have experience in factories building these sofas that they have. They didn’t even consider training locally – there was a college they could have worked with, but they choose to recruit outside the UK.” O’Flynn told the BBC Today programme on Thursday that Rudd had visited his factory in 2015 but said he was “very disappointed” with her claim, saying he had invited her as his local MP to discuss how they could recruit more sewing machinists. “We are very committed to working with the local community to bring in as much local talent as we possible can,” he said. “I would say 75% of our employees are British. Whenever we have an increase in demand we have to bring in some skilled workers. In one of our departments we have a higher degree of foreign nationals than we do elsewhere in the business; that is the only area that I can think of where Amber may be getting her figures from,” he said.
He said it was commonplace in the furniture industry to hire staff from abroad when there was a surge in demand. Collins and Hayes, which supplies John Lewis and Furniture Village, has been making furniture for 140 years. Some of the problems involved in requiring companies to declare the proportion of non-British staff on their books was highlighted by a recent Commons written answer in which the Home Office admitted it could not provide the information about its own employees. Asked by Labour’s Chuka Umunna how many citizens of other EU countries were employed by the Home Office, the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, told him that while they did carry out proper checks on potential recruits, “the Home Office does not record the nationality of employees on our IT systems and is unable to provide this information.” The embarrassment for the home secretary comes as the government has had to try to reassure parents that a request to schools to collect data on the nationality of pupils would not be passed on to immigration officials. The Department for Education said: “Collecting this data will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language, perform in terms of their broader education, and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector. “Data on pupils’ country of birth, nationality and level of English proficiency is collected through the school census in line with the national population census. “These data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal DfE use for analysis, statistics and research,” it adds. The Department for Education asked schools in June to send out requests from this month to parents for details of their children’s place of birth and nationality to help manage the impact of migration on schools. The June guidance made clear that it should be done on a voluntary basis and parents could opt out. But an investigation by Schools Week showed that some schools have misinterpreted the data-collection rules and asking pupils for copies of passports and if they were asylum seekers. A coalition of human rights groups has also called for a boycott of the extra census details amid fears that the information could be handed over to Home Office immigration enforcement officers. They say that there have already been cases of such “data sharing” with the Home Office as part of a drive to create a “hostile environment for illegal immigrants”. “Such measures deter vulnerable children and families from accessing essential services, exercising their human rights, and participating on an equal basis in our communities,” the campaigners said in a letter to the education secretary, Justine Greening, asking her to axe the plans. On Tuesday the home secretary said in her Tory party conference speech that private landlords could face imprisonment from December if they rented homes to illegal immigrants under new public-sector legislation that includes requiring health bodies and banks to make immigration checks."
2016-10-06T13:19:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans trial: friends describe alleged victim's distress the next day,"Friends of a young woman allegedly raped by the footballer Ched Evans described her distress the morning after as she desperately tried to piece together what had happened, a jury has heard. The woman, who was 19 at the time, has told the jury she woke up naked in a hotel room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. On day three of Evans’ re-trial at Cardiff crown court, statements made by close friends of the woman and her mother were read by the prosecution. One friend said the alleged victim arrived at her home and banged loudly on the door. “When I opened the door she was crying hysterically. She was sobbing, trying to catch her breath and I gave her a hug to calm her down,” the friend said. “When she calmed down, she told me that she had woken up in the Premier Inn naked and had no idea how she had got there.” Another friend said in her statement: “She was in a state on the phone. She was difficult to understand. She said she had woken up at the Premier Inn naked. Her phone and bag had gone. She did not understand why she was naked and thought her drink may have been spiked. I told her someone must have been with her and paid for the room.” In her statement, the alleged victim’s mother described her as “sensible”. The mother was not worried when she did not return home that night as she often stayed out with friends. She said her daughter called and asked her to pick her up from the hotel. “She got into the car and said: ‘I haven’t got a clue what happened last night,’” said the mother. “She said she just couldn’t remember how she got to the Premier Inn. She was frustrated, upset and getting more and more upset.” The jury at Cardiff crown court has been told that Evans’ friend, Clayton McDonald, “hooked” the teenager when she was heavily intoxicated following a night out in the seaside town of Rhyl in north Wales and went with her in a taxi to the hotel in the early hours of 30 May 2011. Evans, 27, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Norwich, arrived at the hotel soon afterwards and allegedly raped the woman before leaving via a fire exit. He denies the offence, claiming that both he and McDonald had consensual sex with the woman. The prosecution argues she was so heavily intoxicated she could not have consented. The jury has been shown CCTV footage of the woman in a kebab shop before getting into the taxi with McDonald. The kebab shop owner, Sohail Aslam, said in a statement that the woman had been “really drunk”. “She fell,” he said. “She was helped up by people in the shop.” Giving evidence via video-link from north Wales, Lee Jones, the taxi driver who took McDonald and the woman to the hotel, also said he thought she was drunk. He said during the 10-minute trip the woman sat in the front eating a pizza, while McDonald was in the back on his phone. Simon Medland QC, prosecuting counsel, asked Jones whether he had heard McDonald say anything while on the phone. Jones replied: “I think he said he was with a girl and that he was going back to the Premier Inn.” The taxi driver agreed that in his original police statement he told officers that McDonald had used a “slang” word to the person on the phone, which he understood to mean “girl”. The night receptionist at the hotel, Gavin Burrough, described the woman as “very drunk” when she arrived at about 4.10am. “She was unsteady on her feet. Her eyes were glazed over, she had a vacant expression. She didn’t seem to know I was even there. She seemed to look straight through me. I did ask her if she was OK. There was no reply whatsoever.” Soon afterwards, Evans arrived with his brother and another man. He had booked and paid for the room earlier in McDonald’s name but after showing ID was given the key. When he patrolled the hotel soon after, Burrough heard a woman “squealing” and a man’s voice coming from room 14. He also said he saw the two men who had arrived with Evans outside the hotel appearing to look into the room. Under cross-examination, Burrough said the alleged victim and McDonald had seemed like a “normal couple” and agreed that the woman had only glanced at him as she walked through reception. He also agreed that he told officers the woman had said to McDonald when entering the hotel: “You are not going to leave me here, are you?” The trial continues."
2016-10-06T16:03:02Z,uk-news,UK news,"Stephen Port trial: police took fake suicide note at face value, court told","Police took at face value a fake suicide note found clutched in the hand of one of four young male victims of alleged serial murderer Stephen Port, the Old Bailey has heard. Port, 41, who allegedly had a fetish for sex with young unconscious males whom he drugged by spiking their drinks with the “date-rape” drug GHB, wrote the note as part of a “wicked” attempt to frame his third victim for killing his second victim, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC claimed. The note was found on the body of Daniel Whitworth, 21, a chef, whose propped up body was discovered by a dog walker at a churchyard near Port’s flat in Barking, east London. He was found to have died from an overdose of GHB – or G – and a sedative drug. It referred to the death of Gabriel Kovari, 22, whose body, “extraordinarily” said Rees, had been found by the same dog walker in the same position and location three weeks earlier, and who also had suffered an overdose of GHB. In the note, Whitworth appeared to confess that he had injected Kovari with GHB during sex, and had not noticed he was not breathing, and was now taking his own life in remorse. The note added: “BTW please do not blame the guy I was with last night, we only had sex and then I left, he knows nothing of what I have done.” Rees said: “The note was written to give the impression that Daniel Whitworth had deliberately taken an overdose of G, together with sleeping pills, to kill himself because he blamed himself for giving a fatal dose to Gabriel Kovari.” The prosecution said a “cruel and manipulative” Port had written the note. Port had had sex with Whitworth, and was “clearly referring to himself”. Rees said: “The police at that stage accepted the apparent suicide note at face value and did not investigate further. In particular, Daniel’s movements prior to his death were not checked and no attempt was made to trace the person referred to in the note as ‘the guy I was with last night’.” Port, a former male escort, denies 29 offences against 12 men, including four murders, seven rapes, four sexual assaults and administering a substance with intent. The court has heard he was “turned on” by having sex with unconscious young boyish-type men who were drugged, and watched drug-rape pornography. The first young man to die was Anthony Walgate, 23, a fashion student and male escort, whom Port allegedly offered £800 for an “overnight” at his one-bedroom flat in June 2014. His body was found propped up in front of the communal entrance to Port’s flat. The cause of death was given as GHB intoxication. Two months after Walgate’s death and five days after meeting Port, Kovari was found dead, the court heard. Kovari, who was originally from Slovakia, was looking for accommodation and told friends he had found a room in Barking, which was in the defendant’s flat, it was claimed. Port described Kovari to friends as his “new Slovakian twink flatmate” saying he was “22, quite cute, tall and skinny”. Three days after Kovari moved in, Port told friends he had moved out and “gone to stay with another local guy … some soldier guy he had been chatting to online”. Kovari’s body was found propped up in St Margaret’s churchyard – 500 metres from Port’s flat – by the dog walker on 28 August 2014, the court heard. His death was treated as “non-suspicious but unexplained” and caused by GHB intoxication. Whitworth’s body was found on 20 September 2014. As in other cases a small bottle, containing liquid GHB was found, planted, said the prosecution, by Port. Jurors were told that shortly before Kovari’s body was found, Port had told his sister there was a body in his bed. Rees said he told her they had been taking drugs and that he could not wake the other man and realised he was dead. His sister told him to go to police, and he later claimed to her he had done so and been held for 20 hours before being bailed, which was not true, said Rees. The prosecution alleges Port knew the dangers of being in a drug-induced coma. “The death of Walgate must have brought that home to him – and yet, if the prosecution allegation is correct, he took that risk again with Mr Kovari’s life for his own sexual gratification.” After police discovered Port had hired Walgate as an escort, he gave conflicting witness statements over the events before the death, said Rees. He was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice and released on an electronic tag in June 2015, having served half his sentence, jurors were told. The fourth and last man to die was Jack Taylor, 25, whose body was found by a refuse collector on 14 September 2015, propped up against a wall in the same churchyard as two earlier alleged victims in 2014. “Despite this being the third body of a young male found in the same location, the death of Jack Taylor was initially treated as non-suspicious based on the fact that there were no obvious marks or wounds on the body. The body was in full view of the public and there were signs of possible drug abuse,” said Rees. After making contact on Grindr, Taylor had gone to Port’s flat in the early hours of 13 September 2015, jurors were told. The prosecution claims he died shortly afterwards because four-and-a-half hours later Port blocked Taylor on Grindr, thus wiping out the communication string between them. A routine postmortem examination concluded Taylor, a forklift driver, had died from a mixed drug and alcohol overdose and had high levels of GHB as well as other drugs in his system. As in the other cases, said Rees, a small bottle containing GHB had been “planted” near his body and his mobile phone was missing. The bottle bore Port’s DNA, the lawyer said. Port was arrested on 15 October 2015 after he was identified on CCTV meeting Taylor at Barking station shortly before his death. He was arrested on suspicion of causing the deaths of the four men by administering poison. Explaining why Port was facing murder and manslaughter charges in relation to the four deaths, Rees said in order to prove murder the prosecution had to prove the men were unlawfully killed and that at the time Port did the act that killed them he intended to do them “some really serious bodily harm” or kill them. Rees said the prosecution did not allege Port intended to kill Walgate, “but we do contend that he intended to cause him some really serious bodily harm by putting him in a drug-induced coma – a deep state of unconsciousness” . If the prosecution failed to prove Port intended really serious bodily harm, they could convict on manslaughter if it were proved that Walgate was killed by an unlawful and dangerous act. The case continues on Monday."
2016-10-06T16:42:51Z,uk-news,UK news,UK theatres call for urgent help for child refugees in Calais,"Twenty-one UK theatre companies are urging the government to act more quickly on the issue of refugee children with a legal right to enter the UK, and have offered free tickets as a gesture to welcome them. The theatres include the West Yorkshire Playhouse, the National Theatre, the Royal Exchange Manchester, Bristol Old Vic, Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, Chichester Festival Theatre, Bristol Old Vic and the Young Vic. They have written to the immigration minister Robert Goodwill urging him to speed up the process by which young people living in the refugee camp in Calais who are legally entitled to join their families in the UK can do so. The letter says: “We understand that there are currently 1,022 unaccompanied young children living alone in the ‘Jungle’ refugee and migrant camp in Calais. Around half of these children have the legal right to be reunited with their families in the UK under the terms of the Immigration Act 2016. “As the authorities prepare for the camp’s demolition in the next three weeks, we urge the British government to honour the legal commitment it has made to protect these children, to speed up the legal process in view of the impending eviction, and to do everything it can to ensure the protection of all unaccompanied children living in Calais before the demolition begins.” The letter concedes that a trip to the theatre will not be the most urgent priority when the children arrive in the UK. “Nonetheless, we will all be delighted to welcome them and their families into our theatres across the country and to offer them seats to a show free of charge, in the belief that this is one small expression of the desire of millions of UK citizens to do whatever they can to welcome these vulnerable young people in a generous and open-hearted way,” the letter says. The other theatres taking part are Battersea Arts Centre, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Bush Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Nuffield Southampton, the Old Vic, Playground Entertainment, the Royal Court Theatre, the Royal Opera House, Sadler’s Wells, Soho Theatre, Sonia Friedman Productions, Theatre Royal Stratford East and Unicorn Theatre. Many theatres work closely with refugee groups. In 2014 the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds became the first “Theatre of Sanctuary”, issuing a public statement enforcing its commitment to being a place of safety, hospitality and support for refugees and asylum seekers."
2016-10-06T17:03:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans told police: 'We could have had any girl we wanted',"The footballer Ched Evans told detectives interviewing him over the suspected rape of a 19-year-old waitress that he could have had his pick of any woman in the club he had been in that night. Evans told officers: “We could have had any girl we wanted. When we go out it’s not uncommon to pick up girls. We’re footballers. Footballers are rich and they have money. That is what girls like.” Evans, 27, claims he and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald had consensual sex with the teenager in a hotel following a night out in the seaside town of Rhyl, north Wales. The woman has told the jury at Evan’s retrial that she woke up naked in the room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. The prosecution alleges she could not possibly have consented to sex as she was too intoxicated. Evans denies rape. On day three of the trial, transcripts of a series of police interviews given by Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Norwich, were read out. Evans said he had grown up with McDonald and the pair had had a “threesome” once before after he broke into the first team of the club he was then with. He said: “The girls they like it. They’ve got two footballers there. Wherever we go we attract girls.” The defendant told the officers his own girlfriend did not like that aspect of his life. “The girls do throw themselves at you. That’s part and parcel of being a footballer.” On the night of the incident in May 2011 Evans told officers he had been in a bar with McDonald and other friends. He said there were “lovely birds” in the bar. Later McDonald texted him from a taxi telling him: “I’ve got a bird,” said Evans. Evans, who was 22 at the time, assumed his friend was taking her back to a room he had booked and paid for at a Premier Inn. Evans told officers he decided to go with his brother and another man to the hotel to look in through the window at McDonald and the woman “for a laugh”. The curtains were closed so Evans went to the reception, obtained a keycard and let himself into the room. Evans said McDonald was having sex with the woman. He said his friend asked the woman: “Can my mate join in?” She replied: “Yeah,” he told officers. Evans said McDonald opened the curtains of the room and there was laughing and giggling from outside. He texted his brother to suggest he leave. The footballer told the officers he had sex with the woman. McDonald left and he followed him quickly. “I’ve got a girlfriend. I didn’t want to stay in case my girlfriend rang me,” he said. Evans said the woman appeared to go to sleep as he departed via a fire exit. Asked if he was happy the woman had consented to sex, Evans said: “[She] was getting herself in different positions. She looked to me like she had capacity.” Quizzed about how drunk the woman was, Evans said: “I would say she was fine. She was talking.” He added: “I couldn’t say how drunk she was or how drunk she wasn’t. She wasn’t acting drunk. She wasn’t slurring her words. She was moving around herself.” Evans said he did not know the woman. He told officers: “I can’t remember her face.” Earlier on Thursday the court heard statements from friends of the alleged victim about her distress the morning after the incident. One friend said she arrived at her home and banged loudly on the door. “When I opened the door she was crying hysterically. She was sobbing, trying to catch her breath and I gave her a hug to calm her down,” the friend said. “When she calmed down, she told me that she had woken up in the Premier Inn naked and had no idea how she had got there.” In her statement, the woman’s mother said her daughter called and asked her to pick her up from the hotel. “She got into the car and said: ‘I haven’t got a clue what happened last night,’” said the mother. “She said she just couldn’t remember how she got to the Premier Inn.

2016-10-06T18:17:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Gordon Anglesea trial: defendant denies claims of child sex offences,"A retired senior police officer who is accused of child sex offences carried out during the 1980s told a jury that he had never behaved inappropriately towards boys. Gordon Anglesea, 79, a former police superintendent, also denied involvement with men involved in a paedophile ring in north Wales. Anglesea said he had “lived a nightmare” since his name was linked to child sexual abuse in a 1991 newspaper article. He won damages for libel but more than 20 years later was arrested and accused of four charges of sexual assault between 1982 and 1987 against two boys aged 14 or 15. He denies the charges. During his trial at Mold crown court, in north Wales, one of the alleged victims claimed he was assaulted by Anglesea in the showers and changing room at an young offenders’ attendance centre in Wrexham. The second person claims he was handed around “like a handbag” by a convicted paedophile known as John Allen, who owned a children’s home in Wrexham. Anglesea, a former North Wales officer, told the jury he was “intensely angry” after a report headlined New Child Abuse Scandal appeared in a newspaper in 1991, which accused him of “retiring suddenly without explanation” and being a “frequent visitor” to care homes where children were sexually attacked. Sitting in the witness box to give evidence, Anglesea told the court he had successfully sued the paper for libel and won £375,000 in damages. “I was appalled when I read that article. Intensely angry. It upset my wife as well.” He said life was “never the same again” and that his “nightmare” continued. In the 1980s Anglesea ran a Home Office attendance centre where troubled teenagers would be given a military-style regime of physical exercise, drill parades, and woodwork classes on Saturday afternoons. It is alleged he made the youngsters do naked sit-ups and squat thrusts, and that he loitered around the showers “with a smirk on his face”. Three of the alleged sex assaults took place at the attendance centre against one complainant. His other alleged victim told the court he was first sexually assaulted by Allen, while in care and living at the Bryn Alyn children’s home in Wrexham. But on one occasion, at a house in Mold, the defendant, he alleged, “grabbed him by the hair” and forced him to perform oral sex on him, calling him “scum” and telling the boy he had the “power to send him away”. The prosecution alleged there was a “connection” between Allen, now serving life for child sex offences, who ran the children’s homes (Bryn Estyn and Bryn Alyn) and the defendant. From the witness box, Anglesea denied being a “frequent visitor” to the children’s homes, saying he only ever went there on official business to give police cautions to boys for thieving and petty crime, and that he was always accompanied by other staff. He also denied seeking out the job involving working with teenage boys, telling the jury he took the role because someone else dropped out and his boss persuaded him. He said he ran the attendance centre on “military” lines under orders from the Home Office, and no differently from other similar institutions for young offenders. Anglesea, of Colwyn Bay, north Wales, also denied being involved with Allen or other men linked to a paedophile ring in north Wales involving children’s homes. Tania Griffiths QC, defending, asked: “You have heard these allegations made against you. Have you ever behaved inappropriately to any boys?” The defendant, who retired after serving 34 years in the police, replied: “None whatsoever, to any child.” The trial continues."
2016-10-06T18:25:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow launches PR drive for third runway pegged to Brexit,"Heathrow is hoping an 11th-hour push pegged to Brexit will secure approval to build a third runway, with a final verdict from the government expected within a fortnight. A government committee chaired by the prime minister, Theresa May, is understood to be on the verge of deciding whether new runway capacity will be added at Gatwick or Heathrow, and industry insiders expect a verdict on 18 October. Heathrow has latched on to issues related to Brexit, and the struggling UK steel industry, in an attempt to give its £18.6bn plan a last-minute shot in the arm.
It has pledged to use 370,000 tonnes of British steel in the construction of the new runway and a sixth terminal, a plan it says could save 700 jobs in the UK’s beleaguered steel industry. It also says it would prioritise new “Brexit boost” air routes to provide more connections to regional airports and non-EU countries. The plan would see Heathrow sacrifice more lucrative transatlantic routes in an effort to show it is ready to help the government forge global trade links for life outside the EU. Its Brexit boost plan would add 25,000 take-offs and landings a year before the runway is built, assuming it is chosen. If Gatwick wins, the plan would not go ahead. Heathrow says the extra flights would give the UK economy a £1.5bn boost between 2021 and 2025, the date it expects the new runway to be completed assuming there are no major planning delays. Not all of the new routes would be to non-EU countries, but the airport has said it would reserve slots for destinations such as Wuhan in China, Kochi in India, Quito in Ecuador and Osaka in Japan. Its proposal would also involve setting up new connections for regional airports such as Dundee, Humberside, Liverpool and Newquay. Regional networks would also benefit from a 10-year extension to a £10 discount on flights to regional airports. The plan is designed to appeal to the government’s post-EU referendum plans, as it seeks to ensure trade does not suffer after Brexit. As part of a concerted drive to sway May’s committee, Heathrow pointed to research on the economic benefits of expansion compared with Gatwick if its Brexit boost plan goes ahead. The study by Frontier Economics estimates that Heathrow would deliver £60bn of benefit to the economy by 2035, compared with £5bn for Gatwick. Gatwick’s boss, Stewart Wingate, lashed out at Heathrow’s promise to increase capacity before its new runway is complete. “Cabinet ministers who have opposed expansion in the past won’t be fooled by this desperate back of an envelope plan,” he said. “Heathrow is undeliverable. The sooner we recognise that and get going with Gatwick, the sooner Britain can benefit.” Heathrow’s hopes for a positive decision were tempered by a green group questioning an independent study that suggested Heathrow could expand without a large increase in emissions. A University of Cambridge study suggests a new runway could be built without breaching EU pollution laws. It measured nitrogen dioxide levels around the airport and predicted a marginal increase in emissions if more cars were visiting it, according to the BBC. The Aviation Environment Federation challenged the study’s findings, which it said were speculative because they were based on assumptions about greater use of electric cars and cleaner engines. “There is no guarantee that these improvements will materialise, and the government should not support a runway unless it has the policies in place to ensure emissions are reduced,” said the AEF’s deputy director, Cait Hewitt. “If the government gives the green light to Heathrow based on hopes about the take-up of cleaner vehicles without policies in place to deliver them, they’d better be ready for being back in court.” If May does give Heathrow the green light, the project will still require approval by parliament. Heathrow is believed to be confident that it has the backing of the overwhelming majority of MPs."
2016-10-06T19:09:02Z,uk-news,UK news,NCA investigating six people over £1bn sale of Irish property portfolio,"The National Crime Agency has confirmed that six people are under criminal investigation over the controversial sale of a £1bn property portfolio in Northern Ireland “owned” by the Irish state’s so-called bad bank. The properties belonging to the National Assets Management Agency (Nama) – the state body in the Irish Republic that bought homes, business premises and flat complexes when their owners became bankrupt after the 2008 global financial crash – were in Northern Ireland. Allegations have been made in the Irish parliament, the Dáil, that the sale of the Nama properties, which were mainly in Belfast, was aided by a series of bribes. The NCA said on Thursday that 40 witnesses have been interviewed, with six people now under investigation. Two men have been arrested, according to the NCA.
Lynne Owens, the NCA’s director general, told the BBC on Thursday evening: “If we think a law has been broken, we will provide that information to the prosecutors. “We are investigating laws under bribery legislation, under corruption legislation and under fraud legislation; those are the sort of offences we are currently considering.” Owens said she could not rule out further arrests in connection with the Nama sale, which was also known as Operation Eagle. The Irish parliamentarian Mick Wallace alleged last year that “fixers’ fees” were paid to help the sale of the debt-ridden properties. Wallace originally claimed in the Dáil that £7m was set aside in an Isle of Man bank account for a Northern Irish politician to help smooth the passage of the sale. This prompted the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the NCA to open an inquiry into claims of corruption surrounding Project Eagle."
2016-10-06T23:01:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"Immigration crackdown could lead to staff shortages, say recruiters","Fresh evidence of skills shortages has fanned fears about British companies’ long-term prospects if the government follows through on talk of an immigration crackdown. A monthly check on the recruitment market published on Friday added to signs that employers have rebounded from the initial shock of the Brexit vote at least for now. Permanent hiring rose for the second month running in September, after declining in June and July. But the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) also found the availability of permanent and temporary staff continued to fall in September. At the same time demand for staff continued to rise and there was solid growth in starting salaries for people placed in permanent jobs. The trade body said that based on its poll of 400 recruitment consultancies, those jobs suffering skills shortages included accountants, HGV drivers, architects, care workers, scientists and toolmakers. For temporary jobs there were shortages of electricians, call centre staff and bricklayers. Theresa May hinted at a tougher line on immigration in her speech to the Conservative party conference this week and home secretary Amber Rudd incited a backlash from business leaders over proposals to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ. REC policy director Tom Hadley said the government must be mindful that many UK employers were already facing talent shortages. “Despite some of the rhetoric at this week’s Conservative party conference, we will continue to need workers from overseas in a range of sectors from engineering to healthcare,” he said. “The business community must have a role in developing an immigration model that strikes the right balance.” The report, compiled for REC by data company IHS Markit, showed that as demand for staff rose and skills shortages continued to be felt, successful job candidates were able to secure higher starting salaries last month. Companies’ apparent willingness to continue hiring despite worries over Brexit chimes with other recent indicators suggesting business activity and confidence has rebounded. UK business confidence recovered to be almost at pre-referendum levels during September driven by large increases in organisations’ optimism for both the UK economy and their own prospects over the coming year, according to a poll from YouGov released on Friday. For first time since the referendum, more than half of businesses were optimistic about their prospects in the next year, according to YouGov’s report, which was compiled with the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) using responses from 500 business people. The report’s main business confidence index rose to 112.4 last month, not far off June’s reading of 112.6 and May’s 112.5. “It is now clear that business confidence took a short-term stumble in the wake of the EU vote instead of a long-term fall,” said Scott Corfe, director at the CEBR. “However, it should be noted that this research was carried out before the Conservative party conference and all the talk of ‘hard Brexit’ implying that the UK would prioritise immigration restrictions over access to the European single market. Once the shape of our economic relationship with the EU becomes clearer, these figures could shift notably.”"
2016-10-07T05:00:04Z,uk-news,UK news,French train firm unveils plans for £20m plant in north-west England,"The French train company Alstom is to build a new multimillion-pound plant in the north-west of England, delivering a major boost to the region during a time of uncertainty about Britain’s exit from the European Union. Alstom will spend an initial £20m on a new site at Widnes, Cheshire, creating about 600 jobs. The facility will modernise the Pendolino trains on the west coast mainline and contain a training academy, but it could eventually manufacture new rolling stock if Alstom wins a contract to produce trains for London Underground or HS2. The Paris-based company is making the investment in Britain despite concerns about the cost of importing and exporting products after the country leaves the EU and doubts about the future of the HS2 rail project. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned last week that Brexit threatens Britain’s vehicle manufacturing industry and he would look for compensation from the government before committing to new investments. However, Nick Crossfield, the managing director of Alstom for UK and Ireland, said the French company is “fundamentally committed” to the UK market. He also described HS2 as an “incredibly important and transformational investment” for the UK. Crossfield said the investment in Widnes represented a “step change” for Alstom’s approach to the UK. It also highlights the revival in Britain’s train manufacturing industry. A decade ago Britain was left with only one train manufacturer – Bombardier in Derby – after a string of closures. However, Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate, opened a plant in County Durham last year and Alstom’s announcement is another boost. “It is a step change in terms of the type and nature of investment that we have made in the UK,” Crossfield said. “ It is a fundamental step in a direction that sees us delivering a much broader capability in the UK market. The UK market is one of the most high profile and important for Alstom worldwide.” The 30-acre site is due to open next year. The facility will grow “according to the opportunities that we win”, Crossfield added, and is a “foothold that provides us with a base to expand even further”.
The Alstom boss said the company had not reconsidered the project despite Britain’s vote to leave the European Union:“One of the major issues with UK rail right now is capacity, and that is underpinning all of the investment that is going in. “While the EU question is important for the country as a whole, people still need to get on trains to get from A to B and we see no reason why that investment will change. “We are fundamentally committed to the UK market. Its strategic importance, its size and its dynamics were not impacted by [Brexit],” he added. “Other than some of the very limited foreign exchange volatility, we have not seen any major impact to our business. For us, it is business as usual. We are in a business that is based on long-term fundamentals like population growth and industrial development and that continues as before.” Alstom has confirmed it will bid to build the trains for HS2 and unveiled plans for double-decker carriages. It is also bidding for the New Tube for London contract, which is worth up to £2.5bn and involves designing and building 250 next-generation trains for the Piccadilly, Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City lines in London. Crossfield said that even if the government scrapped HS2, which is estimated to cost more than £40bn, it “would not change the investment perspective for us here in the UK because there is a very significant and healthy domestic rolling stock market”. Nonetheless, Crossfield said HS2 is a “very significant opportunity” for Alstom, with the company eyeing up the contracts to build rolling stock and infrastructure for the network. He said it was “too early to say” whether the trains would be built in the UK if Alstom won the contract, but some work is likely to be conducted in Widnes. The company employs 32,000 people around the world, including 3,200 at 12 UK sites. Theresa May confirmed at the Conservative party conference that the government will “press ahead” with HS2, and Alstom has welcomed the government’s comments. “It is a very crucial and important infrastructure project that should go ahead,” Crossfield said. “I was at the Conservative party conference over the last couple of days speaking at a couple of fringe events and the government remains committed to HS2 in a very vital way. I think it is an incredibly important and transformational investment for the country. “There were very specific comments made in the last 48 hours of the conference in regard to continued support for HS2 and when you look and talk to the people involved in that project within government it is clear there is significant momentum. There is no dilution in commitment to that project at all.” Alstom remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over corruption allegations regarding overseas contracts. Seven individuals have been charged as part of the investigation, which relate to consultancy agreements signed in 2001, 2002 and 2004. One of the individuals who has been charged is Terence Watson, who stepped down as president of Alstom UK earlier this year and was replaced by Crossfield – who was promoted from his role as managing director of train control. Watson is contesting the charges. Crossfield said the investigation “does not effect or impact what we are doing”, adding: “It’s not on my day-to-day agenda in terms of how I run the business.”"
2016-10-07T12:02:14Z,uk-news,UK news,London residents table rival plans for Mount Pleasant development,"A group of Londoners upset by plans for almost 700 mostly luxury homes in their neighbourhood have requested approval for a rival design, in the largest application of its kind under legislation intended to give power back to local people. Residents near the Royal Mail’s Mount Pleasant sorting office site in Clerkenwell have submitted initial designs for 125 homes, up to half of which could be affordable, in a planning application that decries the Royal Mail’s “brutal, fortress-like proposals and their tokenist attitude to public participation”. The Royal Mail is expected to sell the site next year for a sum that could reach £300m. Following public consultation, the company has already secured planning consent for 681 homes in a series of blocks rising to 15 storeys. Many apartments are expected to fetch more than £1m, while 24% would be classed affordable.
The Mount Pleasant Association, made up of local residents and campaigners, has secured backing from Legal & General and a development company, U and I Group, to mount its own bid to buy the site. It has submitted a “community right to build” application for part of the site to the London borough of Camden, to be followed by other applications for the rest of the site if its bid is successful. The group intends to provide 40 more affordable homes than the existing scheme. Prior to his election as London mayor, Sadiq Khan praised the locals’ initiative as “a great example of how big developments should work – working with local communities to design real neighbourhoods that work for the existing community”. The Greater London Authority provided the group with a £150,000 grant to draw up the scheme. “This process has brought the community together and everyone has been involved in understanding the neighbourhood and what is needed,” said Edward Denison, a university lecturer and part of the group. “It is very different to the design we were presented with. This shows there is an alternative way to go about big development instead of the top-down process.” The design team behind their rival scheme includes Francis Terry, a leading traditionalist architect, and the work is being steered by Create Streets, an organisation that campaigns against tower block architecture in favour of a return to more streets and squares where residents gather informally and interact.
The application states: “The strategy sought to re-invoke the sense of urban space as a shared communal resource, a public good that builds and supports a sense of community … It is a way of being in the city that is commonly inhibited by the design and layout of prevailing broad-brush, highly capitalised developments epitomised by the Royal Mail Group scheme.” It would be built around a central “circus” with brick-finished apartment blocks to “reflect the local Georgian and Victorian vernacular”, according to the application. In a statement, Royal Mail Group said: “Royal Mail obtained planning permission in March 2015 for the redevelopment of parts of our Mount Pleasant site that are surplus to our operations, as previously announced. We are currently working to prepare the site for marketing.”"
2016-10-07T15:34:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police braces for criticism as judge delivers child abuse report,"The report by a retired judge into the handling of historic claims of child abuse and murder by prominent figures of the establishment has been delivered to Scotland Yard. The inquiry into Operation Midland by Sir Richard Henriques is expected to criticise the force. Police chiefs will study the report before deciding what will be published and what will remain secret. The review examined how police forces can maintain the confidence of victims, while avoiding the appearance of believing any story they are told. The Metropolitan police describes the version they have received as a “draft” and will now also decide which of Henriques’s findings they agree with. The force says there is “no timetable” for the publication of the limited excerpts they will publish, but has said it will not publish the full report because it contains confidential and sensitive information. It is believed this refers to information about and from exonerated suspects and their accusers. A Met police spokesman said: “We have received the draft report. Sir Richard Henriques will finalise the report in the coming weeks.” The £2m Operation Midland ended in March after it was concluded there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone or ask prosecutors to consider a charge. The Met and its soon-to-be-retired chief, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, are expected to face strong criticism for relying on the testimony of a single alleged abuse victim named as “Nick”, who claimed politicians and military figures abused children in London and the home counties between 1975 and 1984. Nick’s claims led to allegations against public figures including Edwin Bramall and Leon Brittan and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor. All denied the allegations against them. Launching the review in February, the Met said: “The key findings of the review and the recommendations will be published later this year, but the full review will contain confidential and sensitive information and will be a private report for the commissioner.” The Met believes scores more victims of sexual abuse will come forward, leading to more cases like those of Brittan and Bramall in which prominent figures face allegations. He adds that despite improvements to police practice “many more women” who suffer rapes “still don’t come forward”. Hogan-Howe has supported a new law banning news organisations from naming suspects in sexual abuse cases until they are charged. Hogan-Howe will retire as commissioner in February 2017."
2016-10-07T15:35:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Rumbled in the Tory conference Blue Room for bored businessmen,"Monday The theme of the Tory party conference was “Brexit is going to be amazing”. Speaker after speaker got up to tell enthusiastic audiences they would be “wanting it, loving it and getting it”. Although the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has little to do for the next two and a half years until the exact details of Britain’s new relationship with the EU are finalised, his department has been wasting no time in drumming up business for Britain PLC. Over the course of the last week, its Twitter feed has been bigging up business opportunities. “A Norwegian importer & distributor is looking for British suppliers of organic crisps”; “in Spain, a well-established importer is looking for cool new giftware gadgets”; “from scampi to scallops – Spanish importer is looking for a variety of frozen seafood”; “a Japanese importer is looking for UK seaweed powder”; “France needs high-quality, innovative British jams & marmalades”. All with the hashtag #ExportingisGREAT. Who could doubt Britain’s future is in good hands? Tuesday One of the most sacrosanct areas of the Tory party conference is the Blue Room, a hermetically sealed safe space where donors can hand over large cheques to grovelling cabinet ministers away from prying eyes. The room is protected by G4S security guards to make sure the riff-raff are kept out. Well, not quite all. Just by chance I found myself standing near the door when a number of people were being ushered inside and I managed to slip in unnoticed. It’s hard to describe the disappointment. I was expecting lavish divans and a large array of corporate freebies. What I got was a narrow corridor adorned with a lot of advertising for Fujitsu, a mangy buffet offering bread and biscuits, and a long row of bored businessmen waiting to be blessed by personal appearances from Ruth Davidson, David Davis, Sajid Javid, Phillip Hammond and Damian Green. That’s the kind of company most people would pay money to avoid. After five minutes I was eventually rumbled and escorted off the premises. My main feeling was of relief. Wednesday Only a year ago, Eurosceptic politicians such as David Davis, Liam Fox, Bernard Jenkin and Peter Bone were regarded as the awkward squad and would only be found at the dingiest of fringe meetings at party conference. Now they have become the mainstream, acceptable face of Conservative politics, and it is the pro-EU MPs who have been consigned to the outer edges. The waters have now so completely closed over since the referendum in June that almost every MP who backed the remain argument – including Theresa May – has now managed to convince themselves they actually supported Vote Leave. Only two MPs, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, were prepared to stick their necks out and hold on to their core beliefs by challenging the government over its Brexit plans. At one fringe event, Morgan picked out two government whips who had been sent to keep an eye on her to make sure she didn’t stray too far off message. Dissent is not welcome in the new world order. Thursday My favourite story of the week: scientists have discovered that cod may have their own regional dialects, which helps to explain why fish stocks are low. Either a female Cornish cod can’t understand the chat-up lines of a Liverpool cod, or she finds their accent unattractive. I’ve often wondered if the same applies to other animals. My dog was born in Essex – near Barking, as it happens – but moved to Streatham when he was about two months old. For the last five years, almost all of his social canine interactions have taken place round this area of London, so it would make perfect sense if he were to have a south London bark. And what assumptions do other dogs make about him because of his accent? A friend of mine, who talks perfect Radio 4 in English, taught himself to speak Spanish when he moved to the Sierra de Aracena. Whenever he goes to Madrid, the Spaniards treat him like an idiot because he talks like an Andalusian peasant. Friday Oh no he isn’t. Oh yes he is. Nigel Farage is back in charge of Ukip for at least the third, if not the fourth time, following the surprise resignation of Diane “I only signed the forms under duress” James after less than a month in charge. Nigel has insisted he will only be an interim leader, but he’s made similar noises before, and the other candidates seem to be falling over themselves to disqualify themselves before the next election campaign has even started. Steven Woolfe, the only candidate yet to nominate himself, ended up in hospital following a fight with fellow Ukip MEP, Mike Hookem, in the European parliament. Hookem was thought to have gone on the run following the incident but has since spoken to the BBC, claiming it was all just handbags at dawn and that he never laid a finger on him. Meanwhile a former Ukip and now Conservative MEP, David Campbell Bannerman, said Ukip had always been a maverick party with strong views, and some members were liable to get violent and aggressive. It takes a lot to make Nigel look like a statesman. But Ukip somehow manage it. Digested week, digested: Brexit means breakfast."
2016-10-07T15:37:18Z,uk-news,UK news,A night on the frontline with Michael Fallon's school cadet corps,"“Bang. Bang. Bang. Rapid fire!” Eight children dressed in full army gear shout in unison as they crawl across a dark field on a Merseyside housing estate, acting out a mock battle scene. What looks like a game of soldiers could soon become a regular sight across the country’s state schools. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, announced plans for 150 new army cadet units – similar to this one in Wallasey in Wirral – for comprehensives at the Conservative party conference. The Wallasey unit is run in the community rather than a school, but it would be a template for the Cadet Expansion Programme (CEP). On a chilly Thursday night, the children, as young as 12, line up in a courtyard behind the unit headquarters, sandwiched between a housing estate. They begin to march in formation before standing to attention as their uniforms are inspected by a clipboard-wielding instructor who gives them marks out of 10 for smartness. As this exercise takes place, the company commander, Jenny Gillison, 37, who has been with the unit for 22 years, barks “don’t fidget” when one of the cadets moves slightly. The best-dressed cadet gets an award at the end of the month – usually a much-coveted badge. Claire Edgerton, a former cadet who has been involved in the programme for 14 years, enthusiastically says: “Kids love badges. They aren’t too interested in certificates, just in the badges.”
Then it’s collection time: the children hand over their piggy bank savings for the “camp bank”. They are encouraged to save at least £1 a week towards a 10-day camping trip with their unit later in the year. The cadets are then split into groups and the lessons begin. We are taken into a classroom to meet the “crème de la crème” of the unit – the children mooted to become the next instructors. A whiteboard in front of him, SSgt Phillip Curphey takes the children through a battle plan. They listen intently, furiously taking notes on how to conduct a “sweep” – the practice of taking over an area before they would “return fire”. They are also taught how to read intelligence into the places they are planning to attack; about enemy strength, weapons and the best route of approach. Back outside eight children move across a small field, making weapon signs with their hands and pretending to shoot. Every now and again they fall to the floor and begin to crawl to “evade enemy fire”. Edgerton explains: “What will appear in the school syllabus will be a basic version of this. These children do get to handle real weapons. It gives them a sense of responsibility, teaches them precision and helps them to work as a team. It’s not dangerous; they are not using live weapons.” The Ministry of Defence is keen to point out that the programme in schools will be a watered down version of the traditional cadet units. But it is clear that the essential elements would be the same, with similar battle plan lessons, weapons training as well as outdoor activities, parades and camping trips.
There are about 300 school cadet units across the UK, but fewer than 100 are in the state sector, with the rest in private schools. The CEP was initially launched in June 2012 as part of the government’s aim to promote “military ethos in schools; to instil values in young people that will help them get the most out of their lives, and to contribute to their communities and country”. And while the first 100 were led by demand, the initial selection process for the next ones will prioritise schools in less affluent areas. Gillison says: “The children who come to us go away with leadership and discipline skills and they come from all walks of life. Some of them would never experience anything like this at home. “Coming here helps them to understand the importance of teamwork and they begin to feel protective of each other, like a family. It is especially good for those children who normally spent all their time on the couch or in front of a computer. It gets them out doing exciting activities.” The NHS IT manager, who runs the unit in her spare time, adds: “We provide opportunities for them to experience life in a different way and learn new skills and take part in adventures.” This week Mike Fairclough, headteacher at a school in Surrey, said he believed exposing children to risk built their confidence and improved educational performance, behaviour and attitudes.
Fairclough thinks children are being failed because they are being protected from anything that might cause harm instead of being taught how to handle danger. But for some the plans for military drills and weapons training are controversial. Anti-gun campaigners say that teaching teenagers to shoot would exacerbate the growing problem of gun crime among youngsters. Amanda Everitt, chairwoman of Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, which campaigns against street violence, said plans to encourage the use of firearms in state schools were alarming. She said: “We should be doing everything to discourage the use of weapons in any setting. We should instead be teaching children about the dangers of using guns and knives. “If young people want to be in the military then they can make the choice, but I don’t think it something that should be forced on them in our state schools.”"
2016-10-07T16:21:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Polish man knocked unconscious in 'serious and unprovoked attack',"A Polish man who was attacked and knocked unconscious while talking on the phone to his wife may have been targeted because of his nationality, police in Lancaster have said. The 37-year-old from Morecambe had been fishing with a relative on a canal towpath near Lancaster when he suffered the “serious and unprovoked attack” around 12.35pm on Sunday. He was taken to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary where he was treated for a neck injury. Officers from Lancaster CID expressed concern that the man had not reported the attack for several days, suggesting there may be a lack of confidence in the police among the Polish community. Appealing for witnesses to the incident, DC Trevor Walker said while he could not be certain that the man was deliberately targeted because he is Polish, “it is something we will consider throughout the investigation”. “This incident was not initially reported to us by the victim,” he said, “and this has made us slightly concerned that there may be a lack of public confidence within the Polish community in reporting incidents to the police. Perhaps it is simply due to a language barrier. “I would like to reassure those people that if you have been or become a victim of crime in the future, please do come forward and make contact with us. We will find a way to get the details from you and you will be supported the same as anyone else who makes a report.” Lancaster and Morecambe district, he added, was “one of the finest, safest and most welcoming areas in the country and we will work to keep it that way”. The attack follows a number of high-profile attacks on Poles. In August, Arkadiusz Jóźwik died after being assaulted in Harlow, Essex, while another Polish man required hospital treatment in Leeds following an attack on 9 September. The prime minister, Theresa May, has contacted her Polish counterpart to express “deep regret” at attacks on Poles. Poland’s foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, said last month that Britain’s Polish communities had not experienced any problems “over dozens of years” but linked a number of incidents to the Brexit referendum. Waszczykowski said: “The Polish community in Great Britain integrates very well with the British society. They are a hard-working group, they pay taxes and they deserve to be respected and secured.”"
2016-10-07T17:25:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Jubilee line joins London's busier than expected night tube,"London Underground’s Jubilee line is set to open its night tube services in the next stage of Transport for London’s expansion of 24-hour weekend tubes across the city. The new services will begin on Friday evening. An additional six Jubilee line trains an hour will run through central London between 12.30am and 5.30am, which is expected to cut night-time journeys by an average of 20 minutes. London Underground’s managing director, Mark Wild, said: “The launch of the night tube on the Central and Victoria lines has been a huge success, with the demand for the service exceeding our projections.” The expanded tube service has proved hugely popular, with on average 100,000 people using night tubes each week during the first seven weeks of its launch. Unsurprisingly, the busiest station has been Oxford Circus – the intersection of the two lines open so far – with Liverpool Street, Brixton, Stratford and Tottenham Court Road also being among the most popular.
Despite fears about the safety of night-time travel, fewer than 30 crimes have so far been recorded on the night tube network by British Transport police.
Supt Chris Horton, TfL sub-divisional commander, said: “This success confirms what we already knew and what we expected to see: crime on the underground is low and evidence from 24-hour metros around the world suggest crime levels at night are no greater than during the day. “However, we are not complacent and we will continue to work closely with Transport for London and our other partners to ensure a safe and secure night tube as it extends to the Jubilee line on Friday.” Users of the new services have had different experiences of the impact it has made on them. Diane, a social worker from West Sussex, told the Guardian that the night tube was “an absolute delight. The trains are prompt and clean, the staff are friendly and there is a peaceful, happy vibe among the travellers. Best of all, it is not crowded at all. It has opened up the possibility or having a night life in London more often; I feel safer on the tube than getting in a cab. Obviously it’s much cheaper too.”
Aiah, an 18-year-old student from East Ham, told us: “It’s really convenient because I don’t have to worry about cutting a night out short because I have to run for the last train. I can happily enjoy myself. When I was out for a friend’s birthday or a family event I didn’t have to stress myself out with ordering an Uber or finding a local cab number because I knew I could catch a train, saving a lot of money.” Not all Londoners are impressed, however. The gradual introduction of the night tube services still reflects an inequality of underground provision between north and south London. An anonymous contributor who lives in Brockley told us: “Since l live in south-east London, where public transport still lags behind other areas of London, the introduction of the night tube has had very little impact on me. I would greatly like to benefit from the extension of tube services, but at present, would still have to get a minimum of two night buses and tube to get home from central London. For me, London is not yet accessible late at night.”
In addition to the underground services, TfL has also made a 10 bus routes in the capital run 24 hours a day at the weekend in order to provide better connections to the tube. Buses 34, 114, 123, 145, 158, 183, 296, E1, W3 and W7 now run 24 hours on Fridays and Saturday. As well as the convenience of shorter journey times, the night tube has had some unexpected sightseeing benefits. Joe Elsworth, who lives in Mile End, said of the changes to the Central line: “I fell asleep and woke up in Leytonstone, which made a nice change from waking up on a bus in Ilford. It has afforded me the opportunity to wake up in new and dull places in east London.”"
2016-10-07T18:12:44Z,uk-news,UK news,HMRC investigates BBC presenters over tax avoidance allegations,"About 100 current and former BBC presenters, and stars from other broadcasters, are being investigated by HMRC over claims of tax avoidance. The inquiries centre on allegations that the presenters falsely declared themselves self-employed to minimise their tax and national insurance bills. The revelation emerged in a BBC submission to a tax tribunal considering the case of the BBC presenters Joanna Gosling and Tim Willcox. They are appealing against an HMRC ruling that they did not pay enough tax while claiming not to be employed directly by the BBC. “HMRC have indicated to the BBC that there are around 100 additional cases under consideration involving current or former BBC presenters,” the broadcaster said. According to court documents, the BBC said it understood HMRC also intended to look into the affairs of “presenters who are engaged by other broadcasting organisations”. It said: “The appeals are therefore extremely important not only to the individuals in question, but also to the BBC and to the broadcasting industry as a whole.” The investigators are looking into whether “IR35” rules, which govern the tax paid by those who work for clients through an intermediary, have been followed. “The appeals are likely to be the first cases to test the freelance model in the broadcasting industry against the IR35 legislation,” said Jennifer Henderson, the BBC’s head of global mobility and employment tax, in the broadcaster’s submission. The hearing before the first tier tax tribunal at the Royal Courts of Justice took place in July and was first reported on the website Contractor Calculator on Friday. The BBC stressed that the case would touch upon the whole broadcasting industry, saying that the practice of paying presenters through personal service companies was standard. “As the judgment says, this is an industry-wide issue and affects those who have been engaged in this way for a number of different organisations,” a spokesperson said. In 2012, a report from Deloitte found that the BBC had offered presenters the option of signing staff contracts or using personal service companies, but had not advocated one over the other. The BBC changed its policy that year after it was criticised for letting presenters be paid through service companies. “It is up to individuals to ensure they pay the right tax and, since 2013, the BBC has adopted a new employment status test that provides a clear and consistent approach to the employment status of journalists and presenters,” the BBC’s spokesperson said. Joanna Gosling and Tim Wilcox declined to comment. An HMRC spokesperson said: “Employment status is never a matter of personal choice and is always dictated by the specific facts. When the employment relationship does not accurately reflect the underlying reality of the relationship, the wrong tax is paid then we intervene to ensure the rules apply as parliament intended. “While there can be many legitimate business reasons for workers being employed through their own companies, there are rules in place enabling HMRC to make sure people who provide their services in this way pay the right tax and national insurance.”"
2016-10-08T08:00:37Z,uk-news,UK news,'Why didn't she confess?': the killing of John Sabine,"On a cold winter’s morning last November, Michelle James bent over a bulky grey package on her patio. Wrapped in plastic, it lay lengthways on the ground beneath a wooden plant holder. She was with her friend Rhian, and they were about to find out what was inside. A month earlier, James’s friend and upstairs neighbour, Lee Sabine, had died at the age of 74. In the late stages of cancer, Sabine told James about an old medical skeleton she kept in the house: wouldn’t it be funny, Sabine said, if James got it out after she’d gone and put it up in the attic, to scare the people who moved in after her? Armed with kitchen knives, James and Rhian set about cutting through the thick layers of plastic, 41 in all, thinking about the laugh they would have when they sat the skeleton on the couch; the two women wanted to play a joke on their friend, Gareth. But as the final layer gave way, James began to scream. There was an unmistakable stench of decay; this was no student prop, but something much more sinister. James ran inside, telling Rhian to call the police. *** The former mining village of Beddau sits in the Rhondda valley, surrounded by lush hills in every shade of green. On a warm late summer evening, children gather in its many playing fields, flying kites and kicking balls between discarded clothes doubling as goalposts; doors are left ajar to let in a breath of air. In its industrial heyday, Beddau was dominated by social housing estates, built to support the colliery and coking plant; more recently, tiers of new estates with smarter cars parked outside have sprung up to accommodate the Cardiff commuters, attracted by low house prices and the proximity to the M4. Newcomers have loosened the stitches of this tight-knit community, where a third of the children attend a Welsh-speaking primary school. Even so, it is a place where generations of families have grown up together, where neighbours still look out for each other and secrets are hard to keep.
When the police arrived at James’s flat in the Trem-y-Cwm block on 24 November 2015, they found human remains on the patio she had shared with Sabine; although partially decomposed, the skull had been well-preserved. A pathologist identified evidence of foul play – a blow to the back of the head – and a murder inquiry was launched. That a body had been found in their midst came as a shock to the villagers: there is little serious crime in Beddau. South Wales police had no recent missing persons reports, no assaults, no 999 calls. Initially, they considered the possibility that the corpse had been dumped on the patio by someone who had travelled there from outside the area; but the patio was accessible only via the flats, putting the spotlight on its residents. James was the first to find herself under suspicion. Within hours of calling the police, she was arrested and taken into custody. But as the police looked into James’s account of her neighbour, Lee Sabine, they discovered that a John Sabine – an accountant and a veteran of the Korean war – had once been registered at the same address. No one remembered seeing him, and there was no record of his death. The couple had signed a joint tenancy agreement in February 1997; it turned out that John had registered with the local GP that year, and ordered a repeat prescription in April – but it was never picked up. The body was still clothed in pyjamas with a St Michael label, last used by Marks & Spencer in the year 2000. Detectives identified dental records and a hip replacement serial number, and set about trying to match them with local surgeries or hospitals. They found nothing useful. After 48 hours in custody, James was released. Finally, on 11 December, three weeks after the body was discovered, police got the breakthrough they were looking for. A relative of John Sabine came forward to provide them with a DNA sample: it matched the remains found at Trem-y-Cwm. A postmortem confirmed that Sabine had died as a result of “blunt trauma” to the head. His wife, Lee, was named as the main suspect. The friends who had gathered at Lee’s funeral just a month earlier were stunned. How could the woman they knew, a former nightclub singer and Beddau resident for 18 years, be a murderer? How could her neighbours, who had enjoyed Sabine’s summer barbecues, her tarot card readings and invitations to tea (which often turned into something stronger), not have noticed anything was amiss? With her bleached blond hair and theatrical antipodean accent (she had come to Wales from New Zealand), Sabine could hardly be accused of keeping a low profile. But the more they thought about it, the more they realised the clues had been staring them in the face.
Mary Gardner, a former foster carer who lives in a bungalow with her partner, Ralph, and their teacup Yorkshire terriers Coco and Trixie, still laughs at the memory of the first time she met Lee. “She was bent over in the street, looking at the ground. I thought she’d lost something, so I went over.” Mimicking Lee’s accent, Gardner continues: “She said, ‘Oh I’m all right, darling, I’m just looking for pretty stones.’ I said to her: ‘You’re not going to find them there.’ She laughed and said: ‘Take no notice of me, I like to do mysterious things.’ “She was a bit of an eccentric. I would always say she was as mad as a box of frogs. But she said it with a smile, and she was always fizzy and bubbly. We hit it off. She made me laugh.” Back then, Gardner lived in a house next to Sabine’s flats; it has since been demolished. Over the years, the pair would often sit together in Sabine’s garden and talk. Sabine, who was 56 when they met, would tell her what she got up to with her male admirers, and Gardner, half scandalised, half intrigued, would never know whether to believe her or not.
“She used to wear this wide leather belt and leather gloves,” says Gardner. Standing up, she swishes her arms around in imitation of Sabine’s flamboyant gestures. “She was always, darling this, darling that. She liked male attention – any attention. Her bedroom was all silks and satins, with a silk canopy on the ceiling. There were different coloured drapes and cushions over the bed, and the headboard was all gold. I told her her bedroom was like a tart’s boudoir. I’d never seen anything like it. But I liked her: she was a character.” Even so, Gardner had a nagging suspicion that her friend was not all she seemed. She felt Sabine was familiar from somewhere, but couldn’t put her finger on where. And while she liked to talk, Sabine could be mysterious about her own past, retreating from anyone who got too close. Her house was devoid of any photographs, save one black and white shot of her during her days as a nightclub singer in Australia. “I always thought: ‘Lee, what are you hiding?’ I’d say: ‘Haven’t you got someone?’ She’d say, ‘No, I’m better off on my own.’ I asked about kids and she said, ‘God, no.’ I always thought I had met her previously, but she would say, ‘No, I’m from New Zealand.’”
Once, after Gardner’s only daughter, Adele, died in 2006, Sabine told her she had a grandson, who she said had killed himself. Gardner was stunned. “I said: ‘I thought you didn’t have kids?’ She said, ‘Oh no, he’s not mine, I just refer to him like that. We were close.’” The truth was, the stories Sabine told about her past depended on her audience. She told some people she had been married a long time ago, and that her husband had been violent and unfaithful; she had left him in New Zealand before emigrating to Wales, where she was rehoused by a women’s charity. But she told others that he had left her. *** Lynne Williams, a 54-year-old, gently spoken mother of two from Pontyclun, 10 minutes from Beddau, met a frailer, softer version of Sabine. Sitting in her freshly decorated living room, with a new wooden floor and sparkly silver wallpaper, Williams recalls meeting Sabine at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in Talbot Green; Williams was visiting a relative, and Sabine was then a patient. Over cups of tea made by her daughter, Williams smiles as she recalls the summer of last year. Her heart went out to Sabine, she says, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer after a fall. She had no visitors, and there was nothing on her bedside table to suggest anyone who cared for her. “It was pitiful, really, she had no one,” she says, her Welsh lilt pausing over the consonants. “She was suffering, she had ulcers all over her legs. But she was a bubbly person and hid her pain so as not to worry anyone. And that’s what I would do.” Williams, who runs her own cleaning business, took Sabine under her wing, visiting her daily along with the relative she already cared for. She was touched by the older woman’s gratitude. “I would take her out for a fag. It was little things that meant a lot to her. I’m not the most well off, but I’d take her a packet of cigarettes, or I’d make her a hot meal. She would go, ‘Oh, why did you do that?’”
They became close, which was when Williams started to notice that not everything added up. “There was always a sticky silence when she talked about the past. But she opened up a bit about her children.” Sabine told her she had five children, three girls and two boys, all of whom she and her then husband had abandoned in New Zealand, when she was 28. If Williams probed further, she changed the subject. “She said they didn’t want to know her, but her stories were changing all the time. I could see there was a hell of a dark side there.” Pulling her curtains against the low evening sun, Williams takes out her phone to pull up pictures of Sabine in the last months of her life. Dressed in a crushed velvet dressing gown, she is frail, although smiling, and her makeup is immaculate. It always was, William says, even at the end. Several times in those final weeks, Sabine seemed ready to open up, she adds. “She once said: ‘I’ve got a secret’ but then changed the subject.” Later, she asked Williams for her address, saying she wanted to write her a letter. But after she died, no letter was found. One night, after Sabine had been allowed home from hospital, Williams and Michelle James were sitting at her kitchen table, when she asked her friends for help. “Her words were, ‘I need you to do me a favour,’” Williams says. “‘There’s a skeleton in the shed and I need you to move it to the attic to scare the people who move in.’ “I turned around and said: ‘I hope it’s not a bloody real one.’ She pointed her finger at me with those big orange nails – she always painted her nails orange – and said, ‘You never know.’”
By that point, Sabine knew she was dying. To this day, Williams isn’t sure whether she meant them to open the package before or after her death.Had she not been so busy with her cleaning business, she would have moved the package up to the attic, she says. It could have been her, not James, who found John Sabine. After Lee died, Williams cleared out her cluttered two-bedroomed flat, along with other friends and neighbours. She was disturbed by what she describes as a number of “nasty” letters she found, written by Sabine to people in Beddau. They were unkind, full of bile, and seemed at odds with the community-loving woman she knew. Then came James’s macabre discovery on 24 November. “For a long time I couldn’t sleep,” Williams says. “Why didn’t she say something? She knew she was going to die – why didn’t she tell us? Sometimes I would say that I was used. Other times, I remember the way she thanked me every night before she went to sleep. I am a good dealer with things. I can’t be bitter.” It was a mystery to her, and to the police: how had Sabine managed to conceal her husband’s body for so long? Apart from the attic, there was simply no room: a double divan took up most of the space in one bedroom, and there was a single bed in the other. “One of the drawers was half the length of the divan,” Williams remembers. “You couldn’t put a body in it.” She is convinced that the fall Sabine suffered just before her cancer diagnosis came as she was moving the heavy body down from the attic. (As for how a frail 74-year-old woman managed to do this alone, nobody can say, but the police are not looking for an accomplice.) Williams wondered why, as soon as Sabine got home from hospital, she was so keen to get her carpets professionally cleaned. “They didn’t even look dirty,” she remembers. “The machine broke down and she demanded they come the following day to finish it.” *** By mistake or design, in her dying days Sabine let her guard down, although she never went as far as a confession. As the police investigated, they found she had gone further in the past, and on more than one occasion. In early 2000, while carrying out a tarot card reading, she blurted out a confession to Bernadette Adamiec, a Beddau hairdresser. Adamiec, who did not take her seriously, told police that Sabine had told her she was going to be “famous... because of the body in the bag”. The police still consider this evidence vital, but Adamiec tells me she thinks that as a confession it has become overblown; she no longer wants to talk to journalists. Sabine was hiding in plain sight: a relative newcomer in a Welsh village where she could construct whatever version of herself she wanted. As for her husband, no one missed him, because no one had ever met him. But, as the murder investigation progressed, it turned out that little in Sabine’s carefully constructed story, or series of stories, was true. Detective chief inspector Gareth Morgan of South Wales police led the inquiry. His team traced the Sabines back to the 50s, when they first met in London, where Lee was training as a nurse. The couple had four children together in Britain, before emigrating to New Zealand where they had a fifth. Then, in 1969, they abandoned their children in an Auckland nursery: two boys, Steve and Martin, and three girls, Susan, Jane and Lee-Ann, aged between two and 11 years old.
“That was an incredible story in itself,” Morgan says. “We made contact with the children, and the whole story started unravelling.” The couple had fled to Perth in Western Australia, where they went by the names Lee and John Martin, and where Lee tried to build a career as a singer. In 1984, they returned to New Zealand and made contact with their children in an apparent change of heart. But after their daughters brought a TV reporter to the house, the couple quickly disappeared again. During the investigation, heartbreaking film footage emerged from New Zealand, of Jane and Lee-Ann, then teenagers, confronting the parents who had abandoned them. As more details emerged, Sabine’s neighbours were forced to adjust their memories of her. Gardner learned that the “grandson” Sabine had referred to was in fact her son, Martin, who killed himself in 2000. She was not from New Zealand, as she had claimed, but the daughter of a Welsh miner and a mother who abandoned her when she was a toddler. She was born 11 miles from Beddau, in the village of Gelli. “You know, like her, I was in and out of care,” Gardner says. “So it’s possible we had met before. She was a Rhondda girl. We saw a Lee and it wasn’t a Lee.” Her real name was Ann. *** It wasn’t until a BBC news report screened footage of that family confrontation in New Zealand that Morgan found the final piece of the jigsaw: the murder weapon. A friend who had known the couple when they lived in Reading in the 90s came forward and told the detective about a call she received from Sabine, “out of the blue”, in 1997. Valerie Chalkley asked her friend, who had just moved to Beddau, whether she was still with John, joking that she thought they might have killed each other by now. Sabine said: “I have killed him. I hit him over the head with a stone frog.” Chalkley laughed it off as a typical exaggeration, but was rattled enough to call her back a couple of days later to ask how John was. “Oh, he’s all right, just the same,” came the reply. It was as if the previous conversation hadn’t happened, but it stayed with Chalkley. Morgan remembered Michelle James telling him that Lee had told her to take what she wanted from the flat after she died. He asked her: “I don’t suppose you have a stone frog?” She had, stored in a shoebox alongside other items she had yet to sort through; Sabine had kept the frog by the side of her bed. When pathologists matched it against the cluster of injuries and skull fractures on John Sabine’s head, they found the distinctive shape of its leg and eye fitted exactly. On the wall of Morgan’s office at Bridgend police station is a picture of his prime suspect, taken from an interview about her garden in a local magazine – his trophy of a two decade old murder that has now been solved. “I do really love living in Beddau and feel part of the community,” Sabine says in the article. “It’s a special place.”
Morgan believes Lee may have killed her husband during one of their heated arguments, and that she kept her husband hidden in the flat for 18 years; but he has found no evidence of the attack site, and no clue as to where the body was stored. “We did meticulous forensic work,” he says, “but nothing. It was an immaculate house. She had steam cleaners in over the years.” Morgan believes she wrapped the body intermittently over the years, using Tesco bags, plastic sheeting and bungee cords. “When it started to smell, she would add another layer.” (Ironically, it was this process, wrapping the body so tightly it was effectively mummified, that preserved the evidence; had she not been so careful, James might have uncovered something that looked like a medical skeleton – as Sabine must have expected.) With every year that passed, Sabine had grown bolder. She removed John’s name from the tenancy in 1998, enabling her to have a single occupancy council tax discount and improve her benefits. She continued to receive his army pension. In August 2005, when he would have been 75 and eligible for a free TV licence, she transferred it to his name. If she ever felt remorse for her crime, Sabine never expressed it. But in her final months, there were signs that, even as a staunch atheist, she had begun to dwell on whether she might be judged after her death. *** Mary West, a street pastor who became the executor of Sabine’s will, recalls an intelligent woman, an avid Radio 4 fan who loved to argue and discuss issues, including God. Sabine would look in on West’s sick mother, who lived in a downstairs flat at Trem-y-Cwm. “I remember her coming down one day and saying, ‘There’s so much love here,’” West says. “I think she began to reflect on what she’d given up.” If she did, it did not extend to contact with the children she had left behind. When it became clear Sabine did not have long to live, West got in touch with her neighbour’s children on Facebook. Her youngest daughter, Lee-Ann, called West. “The first thing she asked me was, ‘How’s my father?’ I said I didn’t know. I asked Lee and she said: ‘Darling, he left me.’ Lee-Ann was in straitened circumstances herself, but said she was prepared to come over and see her.” West recalls Sabine’s reaction: “Lee was horrified. She was losing her voice then and she said: ‘I don’t want them to see me in this state.’” Then, presumably referring to the reunion that had gone so badly wrong in 1984, she worried that her daughter would bring the press with her.
West still struggles with Sabine’s abandonment of her children when they were so young. “I can’t get my head round that. I asked her about it and she said: ‘Well, I had a singing contract in Australia. I left them in the care of social services.’ “Towards the end, she said to me: ‘You know, don’t you?’ I said, ‘I know you have cancer.’ She said to me: ‘You are close to God. He sent you.’” With hindsight, West believes this was the closest Sabine got to expressing some kind of remorse. In the eulogy she gave at Sabine’s funeral, at Glyntaff crematorium on 10 November 2015, West told the 40-strong congregation, all of whom seemed to know a different side of her: “The only person who knows the true story of Lee’s life was Lee.” She paid tribute to the caring side that many in Beddau had seen. She told the gathering of friends and neighbours: “We do not know the difficulties she had in her life – only she and God know that. But we do know that she was an immensely loving person.” While West and, to a lesser extent, Williams have come to terms with the lies and half-truths Sabine told them, others have found her betrayal harder to deal with. As West explains, “The sad thing is, it touched a community, a caring community. There is a level of hurt still there.” James, 45, remains haunted by her ordeal. A mother of three and grandmother of five, she suffered the trauma not only of finding the body, but then being arrested and put in custody. She was taunted by locals who called her a murderer, and subsequently rehoused by the council; she now feels isolated and misses her old friends in the village. Already fragile, she has recently been diagnosed with PTSD as a consequence of what happened that November morning last year. “She has messed me up,” she says of Sabine. “I can’t sleep properly. When I close my eyes, it’s all there. That poor man, left out there. I can’t look after my grandchildren. I can’t watch the programmes I used to watch. When I was at the police station, I thought I would never see my kids or grandkids ever again. I was terrified I was going to prison for a crime someone else committed. They were saying to me ‘Who is it?’ and I said, ‘I promise, I don’t know.’ “I used to go around almost every day and help her,” she continues, wiping away tears. “Why didn’t she confess? She knew she was dying. She knew what she was doing to me. She is still doing it to me. Why?” On the other side of the world, Sabine’s children have struggled to come to terms with the revelations of the past year, too. A year before their mother died, her daughter Jane – prompted by her own daughter, Nicole – decided to write Sabine a letter. The response was a card bearing an image of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Inside was a note, handwritten and in capitals: “Like the phoenix, I will arise from the ashes and sleep will obey me and visit thee never. For my eyes are upon thee, forever and ever. I have served my life sentence of shame and blame. Now it is your turn to do the same.” She signed it: “Your nemesis, Ann Lee Sabine.” It was the last contact they had. Since their mother’s death, amid the resurfacing of painful memories, the children have discovered something else: family members they did not know existed. They had no idea they had two half-siblings (their father’s two children from a previous relationship), and that their mother had a cousin who still lives in Wales. Jane, now 50, says these new connections have given them a glimmer of hope. Next year, she says, talking to me on Facebook, she plans to travel to the UK with her sister, to meet the family she never thought she’d see."
2016-10-08T23:05:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Wildcats, foxes, squirrels or bats? Britain asked to vote for its favourite mammal","Britons have been asked to name their favourite mammal. A Royal Society of Biology (RSB) poll, launched on Sunday, will seek to pinpoint which non-domestic creature – found within our shores and coastal waters – is closest to the nation’s heart. Candidates include the water vole, highland wildcat, fox, bottlenose dolphin, red squirrel and soprano pipistrelle bat. The poll, set up as part of Biology Week, which began on Saturday, is aimed at finding out what British people value most in the environment. “People act on what they care about, so it’s not just fun to explore their preferences and preconceptions, it’s useful too,” said Professor David Macdonald, director of Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. “We already know that the global favourites are big cats, and that knowledge can mobilise conservation campaigns – so let’s find out which UK mammal people most want to champion.” Last year a similar competition organised by the RSB saw the buff-tailed bumblebee being named the nation’s favourite insect.
Britain is home to 101 species of mammal. Some are recent arrivals, others have had their homes here since the last ice age. All are eligible for consideration in the poll. “The grey squirrel arrived about 150 years ago and the American mink appeared in the 1920s,” said Macdonald. “By contrast, rabbits go back to Roman times and the fallow deer to pre-Norman times. As far as I am concerned, if it has fur and four legs and you see it in a local field, then it’s a British mammal.” Most animals on the list are land animals with only a few exceptions. The tiny soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) – one of 18 species of bat found in the UK – is widespread and can consume more than 3,000 insects in a night. In addition, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is found in several different parts of the country, including the sea off Wales and Scotland. Many of Britain’s mammals are now endangered as natural habitats disappear and farming intensifies. The water vole, often confused with brown rats (Ratty of The Wind in the Willows was actually a water vole), is now one of the nation’s fastest disappearing mammals. Once found in almost every waterway in England, Wales and Scotland, Arvicola amphibius has disappeared from 90% of its former sites. The hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has suffered from a drastic decline for the same reason: loss of habitat. The hedgehog population is estimated to number less than 1 million, down from more than 30 million in the 1950s. One third of this loss is thought to have taken place in the past 10 years. By contrast, the highland wildcat has suffered catastrophic decline for a very different reason. Felis silvestris can breed with the domestic cat and is losing its genetic integrity as a result. Surveys suggest pure-bred wildcat numbers are now lower than 400. “Whichever mammal you choose, it’ll be bumping up against some inconvenient aspect of the 21st century and will need society’s support to prosper,” Macdonald said. “For a nation that widely encourages others to protect wildlife in their communities, let us practise what we preach by nurturing the wildlife in our own backyards.”
Not every favourite candidate on the mammal poll list is doing badly. After the ban on otter hunting in 1978, along with a general improvement in water quality in rivers, numbers of otters (Lutra lutra) have slowly risen. The beaver (Castor fiber) has rebounded after becoming extinct, due to intense hunting, in the 16th century. Small numbers were reintroduced and the beaver is now a re-established UK resident – and a poll candidate. Finally there is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) which has also thrived in recent years, spreading into urban areas and settling in large numbers. The animal is considered a pest in many areas, both in the country and the city. Nevertheless it is Macdonald’s personal favourite to win the favourite mammal accolade for Britain. “They are beautiful, adaptable opportunists. Yes, they can be pests, but when you see one and catch the amber sparkle of their eyes, I defy anyone to find any animal in this country that is more lovely.” Register the vote at: rsb.org.uk/UKMammalPoll"
2016-10-09T06:00:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"‘National Trust duped us’, claim eviction family","The National Trust has been accused of manipulating a family of “exemplary” tenants so it could evict them following an administrative muddle that left the charity potentially liable to pay compensation. Tam Hockey says she was “duped” after a coordinated campaign by trust employees to accept a refund of her security deposit. Hockey was told that giving back the deposit would help build “mutual trust and understanding”. In fact, internal emails show staff were secretly planning to evict the family, yet were unable to because the National Trust had not acted on a change in the law that affected about 1,900 of its tenants and leaves it potentially liable for compensation claims of up to £5.7m. Four months after she cashed the cheque, Hockey, her partner Louis O’Sullivan and their four children received an eviction notice ordering them to move out of their modest cottage on the Newark Park estate in Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire. The National Trust’s local property manager said that the family had to leave their home of 11 years because it was needed for storage, Hockey said. “I was duped into accepting back our deposit so that [our property manager] could issue a Section 21 [eviction notice],” she said. After she began fighting the eviction, Hockey obtained internal National Trust emails that showed it was concerned that it might breach the Deregulation Act 2015 if it tried to evict her. The act closed a loophole that enabled landlords to avoid protecting tenants’ security deposits for tenancies that began before 2007. According to the housing charity Shelter, any tenant whose deposit is not protected cannot be evicted, and tenants can claim penalty compensation of up to three times the amount of the deposit. The National Trust, which lets out about 4,500 domestic properties, had previously insisted on holding the money itself. Instead of protecting the deposits of about 1,900 tenants, it took the unusual step of returning the money – about £1.9m – but many letters and cheques were not sent out until after the act came into force on 23 June 2015. The trust refused to say how many deposits were returned by the deadline, or whether it had set aside money to meet potential penalty award claims from tenants that could add up to about £5.7m. The Tenants Association of the National Trust said it had “expressed deep concern at the highest levels of the National Trust” over the decision to return the deposits. “It is disappointing to be involved in a case where the National Trust appears to have manipulated a reluctant tenant into cashing a deposit cheque in order for them to be able to serve a valid Section 21 notice,” Joanna Leighton, its co-chair, said.
The National Trust has gone to extraordinary lengths to return some deposits. “The trust returned the deposit in an envelope stuffed with cash through our cat flap in the hours of darkness,” said Robin Kisby, who is fighting eviction with his wife from their cottage in Cotehele in Cornwall.Hockey wanted to keep the money aside, but received several phone calls from the trust’s finance department instructing her to cash the cheque. She was told to put the money into premium bonds, and that the cheque would expire after three months. The trust said it did not comment on individual tenancies but that it “has made a policy decision not to continue to either hold or request deposits from current or new residential tenants”. “In the face of the growing complexity and administrative burden placed on the charity in handling them [the deposits], we decided to focus instead on continuing to develop strong relationships with tenants locally,” said the trust. The charity added that only a very small number of tenants had not cashed in their deposits."
2016-10-09T10:08:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Needham case: 'items of interest' found at Kos excavation site,"Police have found 60 “items of interest” while excavating a site on the Greek island of Kos in the search for Ben Needham, who went missing as a toddler 25 years ago. Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared while on holiday with his mother and grandparents on 24 July 1991. Last month, police told his family to prepare for the worst after new evidence suggested Ben could have been crushed to death by a digger. Detectives launched digs at two sites on the island, close to where Ben was last seen near his grandparents’ holiday home. DI Jon Cousins told the Mirror the items would be taken back to the UK for further analysis and that, while they were not of major interest, they needed to be examined further.
In January last year, the Home Office agreed to give special grant funding to a team of British detectives to help search for Ben following a number of possible sightings and theories about what might have happened to him. Following a subsequent appeal for information on Greek TV, a friend of local man Konstantinos Barkas told police that the builder, who died of stomach cancer last year, had been clearing land with an excavator close to where Ben was playing on the day he vanished and may have been responsible for the boy’s death. The 19-strong team of South Yorkshire and Greek police officers and forensic specialists is expected to continue digging on the 2.5-acre site until the end of the week. Needham’s mother, Kerry, who was working at a hotel on the island at the time of her son’s disappearance, has never given up hope that he could still be alive. Last week, Ben’s grandfather, Eddie Needham, visited the excavation site, telling the media that he hoped to find out what had happened to his grandson before he dies. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “To be honest, I nearly did turn around and not come. I was going to cancel because I felt shocking, my stomach was churning. I didn’t know what I was going to be met with, or what they’d found.” The dig was put on hold in late September when an ancient burial ground was discovered at the site. British police had to seek permission from the Greek authorities to proceed with the excavation when what are believed to be Roman tombs were uncovered. Cousins said: “As soon as we came across the top of what it is we put a stop to things straight away. We realised what we have and [the Greek archeological society] are managing that site now.”"
2016-10-09T12:56:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Rising sea levels could reduce several UK mountains to hills,"Rising sea levels could topple the proud status of some British mountains, reducing them to the status of mere hills. Those in greatest danger of demotion include a peak in the Yorkshire Dales that was only reclassified as a mountain a few weeks ago. The Ordnance Survey (OS) uses mean sea level as the starting point for measuring the absolute height of mountains, which must be a at least 609.6 metres (2,000ft) above sea level – but several peaks in England, Scotland and Wales are only a few centimetres taller than that. Mean sea level, the halfway mark between high and low tides, is measured by a gauge at Newlyn in Cornwall. But the point used by the OS was established almost a century ago, and since then sea levels have risen and are continuing to rise at an accelerating rate, mainly through climate change. “We have to measure from a fixed point, and there are no immediate proposals for a change, but rising sea levels could obviously be a factor if there is a change in the future,” an OS spokesman said. “Clearly if the fixed point was taken from a higher level, the heights measured would drop by the same amount, and that certainly could affect many hills and mountains.”
Calf Top in the Yorkshire Dales only achieved mountain status in September, after the OS determined its true height is a few centimetres taller than was concluded when it was last measured in 2010, putting it just over the required height for a mountain. Any change in the base point would knock it back down again. Myrddyn Phillips is an amateur surveyor who worked on Calf Top with Hill Data and Mountain Surveys, one of several amateur groups whose hours of unpaid work, out on the slopes in all weathers, has produced new data that has been accepted by the authorities. Thack Moor in Cumbria also recently became a mountain through Phillips’s work with John Barnard and Graham Jackson, of G&J Surveys. Their measurements, repeated at the request of the OS, confirmed its true height was just 2cm over the 609.6-metre qualifier. Phillips was enthusiastic about the possibility of change: “That would be fantastic, on the whole I like change. “It will be incredibly interesting if Ordnance Survey change their datum point as this will affect all known heights throughout Britain, and even if this change equates to only 40-45cm it will affect a multitude of hill and mountain classifications,” he said.
A change could affect the status of many sites cherished by walkers who like to tackle all the mountains in a group, including the Munros in Scotland, which are all over 914 metres (3,000ft), the slightly less challenging 762-metre (2,500ft) Corbetts, and the Hewitts, Nuttalls and Deweys in England and Wales. “In a general sense it does not matter whether a peak is classified as a hill, mountain, Munro or a Pedwar [a hill in Wales between 400-499 metres], but we do seem to have an inner need to categorise and this is as applicable to hills as any other form of commodity,” Phillips said. “Certainly for the hill bagging community it is essential to get hill classifications correct, and it is also justifiable to say this in relation to the wider hill walking community as there are upwards of 6,000 people who have now completed the Munros and probably twice as many working their way through this list, and all of these people will want to know that they have completed each and every Munro that should be listed.” He acknowledged that many people would be upset if their cherished mountain view was downgraded but insisted it would be an exciting process. “As I am a person who is open to change this would also cause a lot of fun as there would be a Munro reclassified to Corbett status, a Corbett reclassified to Graham status, Simms would disappear, Hewitts and Nuttals would become Deweys, a Dewey would become a Pedwar and a number of Pedwarau would become 300m Twmpau hills.”"
2016-10-09T13:50:36Z,uk-news,UK news,BBC presenter Jacqui Oatley forced to call police over online threat,"The sports presenter Jacqui Oatley has told how she was forced to call the police after receiving violent threats online. Speaking to the Guardian, Oatley, who in 2007 became the first female commentator on BBC1’s Match of the Day, said a man threatened to come to her house and “cut” her, among other “unmentionable” things.
The presenter said she had to alert authorities a second time after receiving an abusive tweet from a referee who was still at school. “I decided that, instead of ignoring it, I’d write to his school and speak to someone in the refereeing department at the FA,” Oatley said. “I just wanted him to be made aware of his social media actions and how they could impact on his future career, rather than see him punished.” She said police tracked down the sender of the threatening messages to a particular house but could not be sure which household member it was. They said the sixth-form student claimed that his Twitter account must have been hacked and apologised to Oatley. The presenter was opening up about the online abuse experienced by women working in the sports industry at the end of Women’s Sport Week, which aims to highlight the issue and get more women and girls playing sport. “When they tell me to get back in the kitchen, I tell them to get back to 1936,” she said. “Ideally, in 10 years’ time, we won’t have Women’s Sports Week and the results will just be incorporated into other coverage. But of course, Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Earlier this year, while in France covering the European championships, Oatley hit back at a Twitter user who suggested that she should be “at home cooking tea rather than presenting football,” by saying she was a “bit busy doing my dream job”. Since making her debut as a TV presenter at the end of 2010, Oatley has been a regular member of the BBC’s football coverage team, working for Radio 5 Live and the corporation’s TV channels. Last year, she signed up with ITV to report on football and darts. Her efforts to champion the role of women working in football earned her an MBE in the 2016 New Year honours list. Oatley said she did not want to put young girls off from pursuing a career in sport by speaking out about the abuse she had received online, and she just wanted to point out that the abuse “does exist and is not acceptable”. She said she was keen that young girls focused on the positive aspects of the job."
2016-10-09T15:16:45Z,uk-news,UK news,School cleaners enter week six of strike over wage cuts,"Three primary school cleaners in the West Yorkshire village of Kinsley are entering the sixth week of a strike over claims their wages and conditions have been cut since a private company took over the contract. Like thousands of school support staff around the country, Lesley Leake, Marice Hall and Karen McGee found that when their school was turned into an academy last year the cleaning was outsourced to a private firm. The women, who between them have more than 28 years’ experience cleaning Kinsley primary school in the former coalmining village, said that once the contract switched from Wakefield council to C&D Cleaning in April, they had their wages cut from £7.85 an hour to £7.20, the minimum wage. Leake, who has two adult children and a second job, said their pensions, sick pay and holiday entitlement had also been hit. “The first month when we got our payslips we just thought it could be a few teething problems but the second month it was the same, and it just went on and on.” The women said that as they struggled to make ends meet they tried to raise the issues with C&D Cleaning but were “fobbed off”. “They didn’t want to know. Sometimes they would just put the phone down as we were talking,” said Leake. “It was pretty devastating because we’d always been happy and we all depended on the money to make ends meet, pay the mortgage and bills.” In the end the three, who all come from former mining families, got in touch with their union, Unison, but regional officer Robin Symonds said C&D Cleaning, based in nearby Barnsley, was reluctant to discuss the women’s cases. In one email seen by the Guardian, the company’s head of human resources, Nick Thorpe, replied to Unison: “We do not recognise you or your organisation and subsequently we will not be entering into any form of dialogue with you in relation to our employees.” In another, he added: “I understand … the impact for you as an organisation when members realise that we are no longer living in the 1980s and they question the actual value of union membership when you have no say, power or influence over their employer.” The three women, believing they had no other option, decided to go on strike, staging their first picket outside the school at the beginning of September. “It was as bit scary at first because none of us have ever done anything like this but we didn’t know what else we could do,” said Leake, who lives with her husband, a former miner turned caretaker, in Kinsley. “It wasn’t just the money we were losing, it was the stress that was affecting us and our families as well. “I would go home crying because it just felt we were being treated so unfairly and I didn’t know how I was going to pay the mortgage or the bills.” Experts say that tens of billions of pounds’ worth of contracts are outsourced each year and trade unions warn that too often this process results in worse wages and conditions for the workers involved. Last week workers who provide mental health support for vulnerable people in nearby Bradford went on strike over what they said were unfair imposed changes to their working hours. And last month the Guardian reported on the case of teaching assistants in Durham who were fighting dramatic changes to their contracts. Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, said that for years public services “had been on sale to the lowest bidder”. “When a service gets taken over by a private company, employees often lose out in the race to the bottom, ending up on lower pay, zero-hours contracts and working longer days.” Unison is taking the three women’s case to an employment tribunal, claiming the company may have broken rules meant to ensure workers’ terms and conditions are maintained when contracts change hands. C&D Cleaning refused to comment on the case when contacted by the Guardian, referring queries to Crooks Commercial Solicitors in Wakefield. Nick Wilson from Crooks said the firm would not be commenting on the case while an employment tribunal was under way. Helen Grantham, the assistant chief executive of Wakefield council, said it was “committed to protecting staff and ensuring they have fair working conditions”, adding: “We are in discussions with those involved to try and resolve the issues.” Known locally and on social media as the Kinsley Cleaners, the women have been supported by their local MP, Jon Trickett, who has been in touch with the company and the school in an effort to find a solution. “These women are devoted to the school and the children there. They are showing real courage and principles to do this because it is not easy but they felt they had no option,” said Trickett. He said their working lives had been turned upside down through no fault of their own. “This is part of a much bigger problem of people living in precarious jobs with employers who don’t seem to have high regard for the staff that work for them and I think it is completely unacceptable.” The three say they have been overwhelmed with support from the local community, which was at the heart of the 1984-85 miners’ strike. But as they enter the sixth week of their strike McGee said all they want is their old lives and jobs back. “I have never been on strike and I did not want to go on strike. This is all new to all of us, but we had no choice and now we are 100% determined to see it through.” • Update added on 2 November 2016. After publication C&D Cleaning Services contacted us to say that they were not provided with updated information on the local living wage by Wakefield council before the transfer, and the council acknowledged an oversight. C&D Cleaning Services say that now the information has been provided they have taken the necessary steps to ensure that any monies owed to the cleaners have been paid to them. Wakefield council issued this statement on 2 November 2016: “The council recognises that there was an oversight in providing C&D Cleaning Services Ltd with the updated and accurate employee liability information on the local living wage. It had previously informed C&D Cleaning Services Ltd of a collective agreement between Unison and the council for 2015/16 in February 2016. Unfortunately the council did not then confirm, prior to the actual point of transfer, that the agreement would continue into 2016/17. As soon as this was identified the council made significant efforts to rectify the situation by providing details of the most recent agreement to C&D Cleaning Services Ltd so that any issues arising regarding the local living wage could be addressed. We apologise for this oversight and recognise that this, among other issues outside the council’s control, has caused difficulty for all parties.”"
2016-10-09T15:32:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Keir Starmer calls for immigration to be reduced,"Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit minister, has said immigration is too high and called for it to be reduced as Britain leaves the EU, despite Jeremy Corbyn ruling out any cap on arrivals. In his first interview since being recruited to the shadow cabinet on Friday, the former director of public prosecutions appeared to disclose a different approach to migration controls to that proposed by the Labour leader in recent weeks. The MP for Holborn and St Pancras, who has been touted as a future Labour leader, said the number of migrants should be reduced by tackling a skills shortage. “There has been a huge amount of immigration over the last 10 years and people are understandably concerned about it,” he told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. “I think it should be reduced and it should be reduced by making sure we have the skills in this country that are needed for the jobs that need to be done.” Asked if he accepted that limits on immigration would mean an end to free movement and therefore a departure from the EU’s tariff-free single market, Starmer said: “We have to be open to adjustments of the freedom of movement rules and how they apply to this country. We have to be shrewd and careful.” His views seemingly contradict those of Corbyn, who last month appeared to rule out a reduction in immigration. The Labour leader told delegates at the annual party conference: “A Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear. We will instead tackle the real issues of immigration – and make the changes that are needed.” Corbyn’s spokesman went further, saying later: “He is not concerned about numbers.” Rather than seeking controls on immigration, his spokesman said, Labour would seek to mitigate its effects on low-paid workers by reintroducing a “migrant impact fund”. Sources close to Corbyn said he believes in trying to reduce the number of migrant workers in the UK, but doing so by ending the undercutting of pay through the exploitation of migrant labour. It is understood that the words attributed to Corbyn’s spokesman, about a lack of concern over numbers, gave a misleading impression, which did not reflect the Labour leader’s view. In the interview, Starmer made clear that he accepted the vote in June to leave the EU, but would challenge Theresa May’s plans not to put the terms for Brexit to parliament. “The referendum is clear and has to be accepted. We can’t have a rerun of the questions put to the country earlier this year, but there has to be democratic grip of the process. At the moment, the PM is trying to manoeuvre without any scrutiny. That is why the terms on which we are going to negotiate absolutely have to be put to a vote in the house,” he said. He made his comments after it was revealed that the former Labour leader Ed Miliband had held discussions with pro-EU Tory MPs on Saturday and was said to be considering tabling an urgent question in the Commons, demanding that May appear before parliament to explain its future role in Brexit decisions, when MPs return on Monday. The SNP and the pro-EU Conservative MPs Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry were also considering tabling questions, while the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, now the party’s Brexit spokesman, said it would be “appalling” if MPs did not vote on the detailed terms of Brexit, including the UK’s future relations with the single market.
Speaking to the Observer, Miliband said: “Having claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain, it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament. “There is no mandate for hard Brexit, and I don’t believe there is a majority in parliament for [it] either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy … it has to be a matter for MPs.” Starmer challenged the language used by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, when she proposed that companies should list the numbers of foreign workers they employ, but said the proposals themselves were neither xenophobic nor silly. “What we shouldn’t do is fan the flames of division. I am sure you and many people watching this were appalled by the sort of language as ministers advocate a list of foreign workers,” he said."

A statement released by the Injured Jockeys Fund said the 25-year-old had been taken to Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle following the fall on Saturday and was in a stable condition overnight. “He is in an induced coma to assist him with his breathing and his condition this morning remains stable,” the statement read. “His family would like to thank everyone for their support and well wishes.” Brooke appeared to be struck on the helmet by the hoof of another horse when his horse, Old Storm, fell at the second fence of the two-and-a-half-mile handicap chase. Racing was delayed for nearly two hours while Brooke was treated on the track. Fellow jockey Bryan Cooper also suffered a suspected broken arm in the fall. On Saturday evening, Brooke’s mother, Julia, said her son had broken his collarbone and had been put in an induced coma prior to being airlifted to hospital because of a problem with his lung. “I think he must have a collapsed lung as they had to put a tube in, which is why it took so long for them to get him to Newcastle, I think,” she said. On Sunday, the jockey’s agent, Richard Hale, told the Racing Post: “I heard last night they were leaving him in his coma. They’d obviously induced it but they were going to leave him there overnight but I haven’t heard anything more this morning. “I think he had fluid on his lung and they had been draining that off but that’s the last I heard. They induced him just before they took him away from the track.” Brooke competed in the last four Grand National races and led the field on the first circuit of this year’s race. He was the winner of the 2012 British Conditional Jockeys Championship."
2016-10-09T20:00:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Police say they are becoming emergency mental health services,"Police say they are being relied on as an emergency mental health service and that cuts in psychiatric provision are probably to blame, the Guardian has learned. Officers point to an increase of more than 50% in a decade in the use of powers to detain people under section 136 of the Mental Health Act. It allows police to remove someone from a public place and take them to a place of safety. On Monday police chiefs begin new initiatives to help officers cope with the mental health crisis being played out on Britain’s streets. Alex Marshall, head of the College of Policing, said: “There is a real risk the high number of cases that frontline police deal with is because the police are stepping in where other agencies would have provided the support.”
Police suspect a dramatic increase in their use of emergency powers to deal with people suffering a mental health crisis is because of cuts to community psychiatric care. The number of instances of section 136 powers being used increased to 28,271 last year, up from 17,417 in 2005-06. Marshall said: “This is a real live issue in all parts of the country. People in a mental health crisis should receive support, whatever time of day or night, from a properly trained mental health professional.” Section 136 is used, for instance, in cases where officers have talked someone down from jumping from a bridge or on to a train line, or have found someone who is distressed or agitated in the street. The lead on mental health issues for the College of Policing, Insp Michael Brown, told the Guardian: “Police are relied on as an emergency crisis service more now than previously. The police are using the power more. This may be attributable to some areas not having enough availability to care for people in the community, as opposed to in mental health hospitals and units.” Support for the police view came from a study last week (pdf) from the university of Manchester showing that suicide rates were higher for those being cared for in the community than in mental health units. In the last year 200 people took their lives while being cared for in the community and experts say community mental health crisis teams are under too much pressure. Brown said some of the apparent increase in use of the emergency mental health powers could be because of better reporting but the majority is because of an increase in demand: “For lots of other reasons, a 10,000 increase in a decade [of section 136 use] is almost certainly because of a greater number of incidents police are attending,” he said. On Monday the College of Policing launches guidelines aimed at getting police to avoid using force when having to deal with those they believe may be suffering from acute mental health problems. Some cases have ended in deaths, with families left grieving and police under investigation. Marshall said: “The officer dealing with an emergency very rarely knows the history of the person standing in front of them.” Police will get a minimum of two days of training on mental health issues, with some officers getting more. The college’s new guidance urges officers to avoid using force. “Failure to listen and actively engage in dialogue to draw out an explanation for apparently aggressive or odd behaviour represents a missed opportunity to de-escalate and resolve a situation informally before arrest and restraint may be necessary. An individual who is frightened, confused or injured may appear to be experiencing mental illness, but this should not be assumed before the subject has had a good opportunity to explain what is going on.” The increased use of section 136 powers by police has happened despite several forces sharply reducing their use of the power because of street triage schemes, in which mental health experts go to patients and assess them, thus avoiding police having to detain them. As well as government funding, police have put greater effort towards reducing the number of mentally ill people being held in cells because health services do not have beds for them. That initiative has been successful, although there are sharp local variations, probably due to local health service capacity. In the Avon and Somerset force area one in six people detained because of concerns about their mental health spend time in a cell. In Merseyside the figure is zero. Last week it emerged that a police chief is threatening to take legal action over his force having to cover the gaps in mental health services. Shaun Sawyer, the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, threatened to sue his local NHS trusts over a lack of mental health beds. He said he would no longer tolerate a practice he regards as unlawful. In one case a mentally ill victim of sexual assault had to be held in a police cell as no bed was available in a hospital, the Exeter Express and Echo reported. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14."
2016-10-09T23:01:24Z,uk-news,UK news,"Investment fraud targets are men in their 60s in urban areas, say police","Men aged 65 living in metropolitan areas, who have more than £30,000 in savings, are the chief target for investment fraudsters, according to detailed profiling by the City of London police. Most victims are duped by “boiler rooms”, which use high-pressure tactics to sell shares to people who are persuaded that they are about to soar in value. Only later does the victim find that the shares are worthless and the sellers have disappeared. Figures released by Action Fraud and the City of London police show that 77% of people reporting investment fraud are men, with an average age of 65. The average loss is more than £32,000 and most victims live in metropolitan areas. Boiler room operators usually set up sophisticated websites and often rent office space in well-known locations in the City. Servcorp UK and Regus, two serviced office providers, were prosecuted last year, under the 2007 London Local Authorities Act, for allowing suspected boiler room fraudsters to operate on their watch. The police force has raided about 100 offices in the City and Canary Wharf since the start of Operation Broadway, a clampdown on investment fraud. But despite the raids, the problem continues to grow, with reports to Action Fraud rising by 9.5% last year. Many boiler rooms also operate in Spanish coastal resorts, using young English expats to smooth talk people into parting with their money. Some victims have commited suicide after discovering they have lost their life savings. In June, Martin Rhys-Jones from Cardiff admitted ripping off 250 investors in a £2m fraud operating from Barcelona between 2006 and 2009. Twelve people were arrested: four Britons, seven Americans and a Kuwaiti. Rhys-Jones, who ran a series of boiler rooms, was extradited to the US, where he was sentenced to six years in prison. DCI Dave Manley, who leads Operation Broadway, said: “Investment fraud continues to be a major threat to individuals in this country and statistics show that those who are over 60 are particularly vulnerable to this type of crime. “Unfortunately, once a victim is sucked in by a fraudster, they often end up parting with a significant amount of money and this can have devastating effects on both the individual and their families.” This week, the City of London police, alongside Trading Standards, will launch a series of videos highlighting the impact of investment fraud, with advice on how people can protect themselves. A specialist role is being created to help local authorities across the country take on bogus investment companies operating from serviced offices and using mail forwarding services. Jon Averns, the City of London Corporation’s head of trading standards, said: “We are creating a hostile environment for fraudsters, who are duping people with the promise of high returns on false investments. “Our message is simple: don’t send your money to someone you don’t know, for a product you haven’t seen.”"

In a libel claim lodged in the High Court, Gordon Mills, who worked for five years in the unit, has accused the GMB of defaming him and is claiming up to £10,000 in damages. His legal action is being defended by the GMB which said it had been acting in the public interest. The union said there was “credible evidence” suggesting that Mills, while he was a police officer, shared information with construction firms which were funding a clandestine blacklist of workers. In 2006, Mills joined the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit which gave advice to companies, universities and other organisations that were the objects of protests. He said that after he retired in 2011 after 30 years in the police, he wanted to pursue a career in academia, based on his work in the Metropolitan and Cambridgeshire forces. He became a part-time lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University. The dispute revolves around four statements that were released to the media by the GMB last year, to publicise demonstrations that they were organising across the country against blacklisting. In the statements, the GMB had said they were mounting the demonstrations “to shame 63 construction industry managers named as blacklisters who have yet to come clean and apologise for their actions.” One of the demonstrations was held at Anglia Ruskin University as the GMB had said it wanted to “shame Gordon Mills, an ex-Cambridgeshire policeman linked to blacklisting of 3,213 construction workers.” The GMB had said Mills gave a presentation in November 2008 to the Consulting Association, a secret organisation funded by Britain’s largest construction firms.
The Consulting Association was shut down in 2009 by the Information Commissioner who discovered it had unlawfully compiled a confidential database on the political and employment activities of 3,213 workers. The construction firms checked the names of workers applying for jobs through the database and those seemed to be troublesome were refused employment. Some workers had raised health and safety issues on construction sites. In his claim, Mills says the GMB’s accusations had seriously damaged his reputation, had caused him “serious distress and injury”, and in particular, had harmed his chances of advancing his academic career. He says the accusations had wrongly portrayed him as “a former senior police officer who had been involved in the unlawful and disgraceful practice of blacklisting, colluding with construction firms covertly to blacklist construction workers for being union or health and safety activists.” He says the accusations had also depicted him as refusing to “apologise and come clean about his involvement in the systematic, covert blacklisting of 3,213 workers and as a result, he deserved to be publicly shamed and humiliated.” In its defence submitted at the high court earlier this year, the GMB denies that its statements to the media had caused serious harm to his reputation, or that they could be interpreted in the way Mills had alleged. The union claims that it had a reasonable belief that during or after the 2008 meeting, Mills “had suggested a two-way information exchange and that following the meeting there had been a two-way information exchange between NETCU and the Consulting Association … which, it might properly be inferred, had contributed to blacklisting.” The GMB cites what it says are notes written by Ian Kerr, while he ran the Consulting Association on behalf of the construction firms. These notes, according to the GMB, recorded that Mills, Kerr and a number of construction executives had been at the 2008 meeting and that the purpose of the meeting was “to liaise with industry and explain NETCU’s role.” The GMB claims: “Kerr’s notes record that much of the meeting was concerned with [Mills] giving the attendees an overview of NETCU’s work on environmental and animal rights activists. Mr Kerr’s notes record DI Mills as saying ‘Cos [companies] need to have strong vetting procedures in place’.”
In its defence, the GMB also says that, according to the notes and a media interview given by Kerr, “in the weeks that followed there was further contact and/or information exchange” between Mills and those at the meeting. The GMB claims that it included Mills in the demonstrations as it wanted to raise the public profile of allegations that police had been covertly colluding with blacklisters. No date has been fixed for a trial. This year the construction firms brought to an end a long-running legal action when they apologised and agreed to pay about £75m in compensation to 771 workers for placing them on the illegal blacklist. Payouts to individuals ranged from £25,000 to £200,000."
2016-10-10T07:02:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Amber Rudd's plan to force firms to reveal foreign staff numbers abandoned,"The government has abandoned plans to force businesses to reveal how many foreign staff they employ, following widespread condemnation and accusations that the policy was akin to tattooing workers “with numbers on their forearms”. Justine Greening, the education secretary, announced on Sunday that companies will not be made to publish the data as suggested by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, during the Conservative party conference. She said the information would be confidential and instead used by the government to identify skills shortages, rather than to “name and shame” businesses that rely on foreign employees.
Last week, Rudd unveiled plans to force companies to reveal how many foreign staff they employ, to a chorus of disapproval. She said foreign workers should not be able to “take the jobs that British people should do” and announced proposals to make companies publish the proportion of “international staff on their books”. However, in an apparent U-turn on the policy, Greening told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “This is not data that will be published. There will be absolutely no naming and shaming. “This is about informing policy so that we understand which areas and parts of the country there are skills shortages, evidenced by the fact that employers are not taking local workers as much as they might do. It then enables us really to tailor policy in those areas so we can respond to that.” David Cameron’s former communications director Craig Oliver, speaking on the same programme, described the announcement that the data will no longer be made public as a “managed retreat”. Greening’s comments were echoed by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who told BBC Radio 5 Live he could “absolutely rule out” asking companies to list, name, publish or identify in any way the number of foreign workers they have. It came after Steve Hilton, a former adviser to Cameron, had suggested that ministers might as well announce that “foreign workers will be tattooed with numbers on their forearms”. Writing in the Sunday Times, he condemned the policy as repugnant and divisive. The former education secretary Nicky Morgan agreed with Hilton’s description of the plan. “I was very surprised that Amber had put forward that proposal about the listing of foreign workers, because that’s not the Amber Rudd I know and I’ve worked alongside ... The trouble with these sorts of policies is they send out a message about the party,” she told Sky News’ Murnaghan programme. The government had announced a planned consultation that would require employers to “set out the steps they have taken to foster a pool of local candidates, set out the impact on the local labour force of their foreign recruitment and be clear about the proportion of their workforce which is international, as is the case in the US”.
The plans to publish foreign worker numbers will not be included in the consultation. Defending her speech and the proposals last week, Rudd did not explicitly say the information would not be published. “I am very aware about the language and when I looked at the speech and thought how I would present it,” she said. “We should be able to have a conversation about the skills we need. I don’t think we should have a situation where we can’t talk about immigration. We must not ignore the fact that people want to talk about immigration, and if we do talk about immigration, don’t call me a racist.” Reacting to the change in policy, Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary since Thursday, said: “The Tories are in disarray following Amber Rudd’s worrying statement last week, contradicting each other as their policy falls apart at the seams. “The Tories’ anti-foreigner agenda is a distraction from their own complete failures of policy, and against the best interests of society. Many sectors risk collapse if the Tories press ahead with these plans on overseas workers: the city, farmers, the NHS, construction. “We need answers from the Tories on how they will protect our economy, but they have no plan other than a risky hard Brexit which would threaten our prosperity.”"
2016-10-10T11:44:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Creepy clown sightings spread to Britain,"It has been three decades since Stephen King unleashed Pennywise, his malevolent clown character in the novel It. No one is quite sure why there have been dozens of sightings across the US in recent weeks, but one thing is certain: the scary clown craze has crossed the Atlantic.
People around the UK have reported a series of sightings of people dressed as clowns frightening children, with six separate reports of “clown incidents” reported by Northumbria police in the past week. One of the most dramatic occured on Friday morning when a masked man carrying a knife jumped out in front of a group of 11 and 12 year-olds and followed them to school in County Durham. The pupils were left distressed but unhurt by the clown, who was wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, red shoes and a multicoloured top. Neighbourhood sergeant Mel Sutherland said: “The children arrived at school understandably upset and distressed by this incident and we are currently trying to locate this man. “We believe this to be part of a much larger prank which is currently sweeping across the USA and parts of the UK. It is very alarming [the man] was carrying a knife – however, we do not think he intended to harm the children and as far as we are aware, this is part of the prank.
“There are currently several social media accounts dedicated to this ‘killer clown’ craze and we are also looking into those and who is using them.” He appealed directly to those carrying out the pranks to consider the distress they are causing to young children. Police in Northumbria have been on high visibility patrol in Newcastle in response to the clown sightings. While no one has been directly attacked or injured, incidents have included clowns jumping out from behind bushes and chasing pedestrians down the street. The force previously issued a warning to a 13-year-old boy from Blakelaw in connection with a clown incident, and a spokesman said the teenager had been carrying a knife as part of the costume.
Other sightings have taken place in Liverpool, where there were reports of a man dressed as a clown driving a Ford Transit van through the city centre, as well as in Caernarfon, north Wales, where a schoolboy filmed a clown standing near a children’s play centre late at night. Clown sightings have also been reported near to schools in Ayr, Scotland, where parents have expressed anger after their children shared fears about supposed “killer clowns” after rumours.
Supt David Duncan of Police Scotland said the force had received “a few sporadic reports of individuals dressed as clowns in some areas”. He reiterated that many incidents reported on social media had been confirmed as hoaxes and emanate from overseas. In Clacton, Essex, two schoolgirls were approached by a pair of clowns who asked if they wanted to go to a birthday party. The incident, which happened in Oxford Road at about 9am on Tuesday, prompted Clacton county high school to ban pupils from leaving the premises at lunchtime. Acting Ch Insp Darren Deex of Essex constabulary said the force was aware of a number of reports from concerned residents across the county “relating to people dressed as clowns, specifically near to schools during opening times”.
He said it appeared those dressed as clowns wanted to scare members of the public – there have been no reports of physical threats of harm or violence. “These incidents follow on from a ‘craze’ originating in the US whereby people dressed as clowns have been photographed or filmed carrying out various acts with the intention of scaring or causing fear,” Deex said. “There has been huge public interest in these photographs and videos, particularly on social media networking sites which more often than not do not represent accurate reporting. This inaccurate reporting is further fuelling the craze and creating a perception of fear in the community.” Deex also warned those thinking of being actively involved in the pranks that “in doing so they may commit offences under the Public Order Act 1986”.
Numerous victims have told of their terrifying encounters with the clowns. Megan Bell, a 17-year-old student with a lifelong fear of clowns, was chased by one as she walked along Queensway in Newcastle on Tuesday evening. Bell told the Guardian: “I was walking home and saw a figure walking towards me; it was dark so I didn’t think about it. When the person got closer I noticed he was in a clown costume head to toe, and had a mask on. Being terrified of clowns I turned around and ran for what I thought was my life. I was screaming and shouting for help but no one was around, I was chased for about 20-30 seconds.”
In Brotton, Emma Smith, 39, said she was “frightened to death” after she and her daughter spotted a clown lurking in the darkness. “Me and my 18-year-old daughter Morgan Lee were walking just along Sycamore Road when we heard a strange noise behind us,” Smith told the Gazette. “My daughter turned round, then grabbed my arm saying ‘Oh my god mam it’s a clown’. “I turned round to see a person in a clown mask wearing dark clothes and he was just stood staring, in a stance with his knees and arms bent out. I told my daughter to just ignore it and keep walking – secretly I was frightened to death as I have nightmares about clowns. They’re one of my biggest fears and we were both scared at the time.” The Brotton encounter took place last Saturday night and was believed to have been caused by teenagers playing pranks. But Cleveland police are now involved following another sighting on Thursday by a girl who reported seeing one clown possibly carrying a blade.
A force spokeswoman said: “Police were contacted after a young girl had reportedly seen a person wearing a clown mask and possibly in possession of a small knife standing in bushes at Byron Court, Brotton, in a park known locally as Mushroom Park, at around 6.10pm last night, Thursday 6 October. “The girl was not followed or physically harmed in any way and officers are continuing to make enquiries into the report today.” There have been a number of arrests in America after reports of men dressed up as clowns trying to lure children into woods, as well as running around with knives and guns. On Thursdsay, horror novelist King told America it was “time to cool the clown hysteria”. The clown trend has also spread to Australia, where police warned about people “parading in the public wearing clown masks”. In the UK, anyone with information is asked to contact the police on 101."
2016-10-10T11:59:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Kerry Needham: confirmation of Ben's death would give closure,"The mother of Ben Needham, who went missing as a toddler, has said confirmation that her son was dead would mean “closure” after 25 years of searching for him. Kerry Needham said her family was preparing to accept that Ben was dead and could no longer bear to live without knowing what had happened to him on the Greek island of Kos in July 1991. In a tearful television interview on Monday, Needham said she and her family were “tired and distressed”. She spoke as police entered their third week of searches on Kos after new information that Ben, who was 21 months old when he disappeared, may have been accidentally killed by a digger driver. She told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I think it really now is a case of finding him not alive. We can’t live another 25 years like this, my parents can’t and I can’t. It’s not the best solution but it will eventually lay it to rest for us, we’re all extremely tired and distressed.“Twenty-five years living and not knowing where your child is, is torment. I don’t like to say it but then at least we would know and it would be closure and he can be laid to rest and we can remember him as he was.” Needham said her family was trying to remain calm but every day was an “agonising wait” for news from the police. “They are in constant contact with us and updating us on everything, but every time the phone rings you think: is this going to be the one with the bad news?’’ she said. “It’s stressful, it’s frustrating, it’s painful, but we’re trying to stay as strong as we possibly can.” Officers from South Yorkshire police and Greek volunteers have been working for a fortnight near the farmhouse where Ben was last seen. Last weekend, officers said they would extend their stay after discovering a layer of spoil material that had been deposited at the site within the past 30 years. The current operation was prompted by information that a digger driver, Konstantinos Barkas, also known as Dino, may have been responsible for the toddler’s death. Barkas, who died of stomach cancer last year, was clearing land with an excavator near where the boy, from Sheffield, was playing on the day he vanished. Needham, who has been warned to “prepare for the worst”, thanked the public, the police and the British media for their support. “We wouldn’t have got this far without South Yorkshire police – they’ve been fantastic and they’ve tried to do this as painlessly as possible,” she said. “They have tried to find those answers for us and we need those answers good or bad. Unfortunately it looks like it’s going to be a bad outcome, but we’ll just try to get on with everything.”"
2016-10-10T12:19:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"Taking in 300 children from Calais camp would be good result, says Amber Rudd","It would be “a really good result” if Britain ends up taking only 300 lone child refugees from the camp in Calais, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd’s comments before the expected demolition of the Calais refugee camp next week are likely to disappoint campaigners fighting for the future of 387 children who have a legal right to come to the UK and whose details have been passed to the Home Office. Rudd, who is meeting the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, on Monday to discuss dismantling the camp, told the Daily Mail: “We have about 100 in train who we hope to bring over in the next few weeks but on top of that I’ve made it clear that we will take children from the Dubs agreement.” The government committed to relocate a number of lone child migrants to the UK “as soon as possible” under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act, which gave support to unaccompanied children across Europe. No figure was specified in the legislation, but it was understood that homes would be found for thousands. Rudd said official estimates of unaccompanied children in the Calais camp ranged between 600 and 900, adding: “If we ended up taking half of that lesser number that would be a really good result.” The demolition of the Calais refugee camp could go ahead as early as 17 October if an agreement is reached between Rudd and Cazeneuve at the meeting in London on Monday. The camp’s population of up to 10,000 asylum seekers is to be dispersed within the next few weeks. Cazeneuve is expected to press Rudd to speed up the processing of asylum applications made on behalf of hundreds of unaccompanied children in the Calais camp.
“We cannot imagine the UK, with its traditions of human rights, will refuse to admit unaccompanied minors into the UK. The main objective is to ensure that these minors have a better life in the UK where they have family or friends living in the country,” said a member of Cazeneuve’s staff. “At present, the time it is taking for the British authorities to process these children is far too long. It needs to be cut to a matter of days. We need an agreement on this very urgently.” Stella Creasy, the Labour MP and child refugee campaigner, said that 300 would not be enough. “Bringing here every child who has a legal right to be in the United Kingdom would be ‘a really good result,” she said. She said that the Home Office was given the paperwork for 117 children in the Calais camp in July and by 2 September had the details of 387 lone children with a legal right to come to Britain.
“Within a few weeks they will be dispersed to the four corners of France if we do not act now. There is no excuse not to process the paperwork before then. Let’s be clear some of these children are only eight years old,” said Creasy. There are thought to be at least 1,000 unaccompanied minors in Calais, of which possibly as many as 400 have a direct family connection with the UK. More would qualify under the terms of the Dubs amendment, which was accepted by the British government in March. France and Britain have each blamed each other for failing to register the child refugees properly. Cazeneuve’s spokesman refused to discuss the precise date the camp would be dismantled, saying discretion was necessary to prevent disruption or attracting large numbers to the camp in its final days or weeks. Citizens UK backed by the Labour peer Lord Dubs passed on the names and details of the 387 lone child refugees who they believe have the legal right to come to the UK four weeks ago. They included 178 who have the right to come to the UK on the grounds that they have close family ties. A further 209 were said to qualify under the terms of the Dubs amendment. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, has thrown her weight behind the calls for the UK to speed up the processing of minors in the camp. “I asked the French authorities to determine which children from the emergency Calais refugee camp are eligible to come to the UK to ensure their safety and process them immediately,” she said at the weekend. “It is unacceptable that some must currently wait up to nine months to see if they can come or not.”"
2016-10-10T12:58:25Z,uk-news,UK news,London housing: improving the theory and practice of densifying estates,"The recent decision by communities secretary Sajid Javid to block Southwark Council’s compulsory purchase (CPO) of part of the huge Aylesbury estate in order to completely redevelop it addressed one of the keenest grievances that arise from such “regeneration” schemes . In accepting a public inquiry inspector’s recommendation not to confirm the CPO, Javid gave particular weight to the interests of resident leaseholders on the estate. A group of them argued that they have been offered far too little financial compensation for having their homes knocked down – nothing like enough to buy a comparable property in the same area, meaning they’d have to move far from their home neighbourhood to somewhere much cheaper and maybe out of London altogether if they want to remain homeowners. The final implications of Javid’s actions are not yet clear. Southwark intends to appeal and this legal commentary on an unexpected decision says it falls short of establishing any absolute right of residents in general to remain within a community affected by a CPO. However, the commentary concludes that it does seem to increase “the weight given to residents’ expectations that they will be able to remain in their community”. Whatever happens next, Javid’s actions have highlighted the specific and recurring issue of resident leaseholders’ treatment when estates face the wrecking ball and also the wider question of the impact being compulsorily rehoused can have on residents in general, in terms of dislocating family life, disrupting children’s education and disproportionately affecting valued cultural ties. Javid was also persuaded that the council had failed to make a sufficiently compelling case that the CPO was in the public interest. This is the aspect of the case for regenerating, renewing or rebuilding - pick your own term, according to taste - council estates that doesn’t always get sufficient weight. Arguments for demolition often contend that “failed” or “sink” examples of past municipal house building have ended up perpetuating the very social ills they were supposed to help cure. The problem there is that unemployment, illness and deprivation can end up being blamed on buildings when their true causes lie elsewhere. In the process, the importance of family and friendship networks and other local connections among estate residents - the very stuff of social cohesion and “resilience” - can easily be overlooked or underplayed when decisions about the future of estates are made. This is part of the unfair and inaccurate denigration of council estates and other forms of social housing as blocks of self-perpetuating want. Recent research for the Peabody housing association by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that over a third of Londoners living in social housing work in the emergency services and over 30% hold down jobs as carers, security staff, cleaners, kitchen assists and other occupations vital to the capital’s economy. At the same time, London has a chronic housing shortage, especially of the types of homes Londoners on low and middle incomes can afford. It has been argued that a grand scale expunging of estates and their replacement by new “city villages” on borough-owned public land would enable a transformative net increase in the number of London homes, with no loss of social rented stock, along with wider neighbourhood improvements. But such a radical approach could cause many more problems than it solved. And do its numbers add up in the first place? Let’s take the second question first. A new report published by the Centre For London thinktank focuses on the scope for increasing the amount of housing on London council-owned estates’ land - the extent to which they can be “densified”, whether by “incremental infill” of spare or adaptable space or by some degree of demolition and rebuilding. Mindful that many of the larger Inner London estates have already been made over in some way, the researchers, who include distinguished social housing policy practitioner Pete Redman, analysed large estates in four boroughs: Lewisham, Barking and Dagenham, Hounslow and Waltham Forest. After looking at the space available and the complex financial arithmetic involved, they concluded that, in theory, estate densification across the capital could generate between 4,000 and 8,000 new homes a year – up to 20% of the annual increase London requires. With public investment, which the authors are not alone in regarding as insufficient at present, this figure could include an increase in sub-market priced housing. That leaves the vital issue of how densification, especially if it involves a lot of demolition, can be undertaken with the support of estate residents. Better compensation for those who lose their existing homes, often against their wishes, is very much part of the picture. Minimum levels for leaseholders and tenants are set by national government - something else for Sajid Javid to think about if he wants to square his Aylesbury decision with the government’s wish to increase housing supply. Then there’s the broader and more complex question of resident involvement in boroughs’ decisions to densify estates and the way such schemes progress. Unsurprisingly, people can be far more receptive to them if they have a genuine say in the form they take and if they are confident that they and their families will benefit. There is plenty of thinking about that going on. For example, Just Space, an informal alliance of community groups and campaigners, has lately published proposals and ideas for a “community-led” approach to planning policy, drawn up with Sadiq Khan’s future upgrade of the London Plan in mind. From another part of the forest, Create Streets continues to make its case that more traditional, lower-rise forms of London housing can replace many post-war blocks at equal or higher densities in line with existing residents’ wishes and advocates a “direct planning revolution”. Later this autumn the mayor himself will publish his own best practice guide to how estate regeneration should be conducted. This is expected to stress the central importance of winning residents’ support to getting such projects right from the beginning and carried through with their consent. Khan’s manifesto signalled a fairly flexible approach, no doubt reflecting the wishes of Labour boroughs, but his deputy mayor for housing, James Murray, was no champion of demolition when he led on housing at Islington. More on this before too long."
2016-10-10T13:27:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow third runway expansion wins backing of Scottish government,"Plans for a third runway at Heathrow have received a significant boost after the Scottish government announced its backing for the scheme, which it claimed would create up to 16,000 jobs across Scotland. Holyrood made the announcement amid mounting speculation that the Westminster government is to back a third runway in the coming weeks, ending years of arguments over airport expansion.
Environmental campaigners and Green politicians decried the move as “a disaster for climate change”, and questioned whether the promised jobs stimulus would come to pass. The cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work, Keith Brown, called on Theresa May’s government to follow Scotland’s lead. “It’s now time for the UK government to end its costly prevarication on airport expansion and support Heathrow’s plans to ensure Scotland, and the United Kingdom as a whole, can begin to reap the rewards on offer,” he said. A series of commitments, including on jobs, investigating the use of Glasgow Prestwick airport as a potential site for a logistics hub for building the third runway, and a reduction of £10 per passenger on landing charges paid by airlines operating services from Heathrow to Scotland, will be included in a memorandum of understanding signed between London Heathrow airport and the SNP government on Monday. Announcing the memorandum, Brown said the Scottish government had engaged extensively with Gatwick and Heathrow’s expansion proposals, and the latter’s offered the best deal for Scotland. “We have been clear from the start of this process that we wanted the best deal for Scotland and building a third runway at Heathrow provides the most significant benefits to the country’s economy and connectivity,” he said. “Growing the number of direct international air routes to and from Scotland remains a priority for this government, but the proposals from Heathrow offer all our airports a range of benefits that will help them grow passenger numbers and continue to build on their successes.”
John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow, said the partnership demonstrated how the expansion could work “for every region and nation of the UK”. He said an expanded Heathrow would create up to 16,000 jobs in Scotland. “It would facilitate more airlines flying routes to Scottish airports, meaning more flights, more competition and choice for families and businesses across the nation. That also means more visitors to Scotland, more destinations for Scottish tourists and more opportunity for Scottish businesses to reach new export markets,” Holland-Kaye said. Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, questioned the job creation figure, saying: “Every time there is discussion about airport expansion of any kind, it is accompanied by ridiculous jobs figures, but it is difficult to see how 16,000 new jobs could materialise with just a bit more direct traffic.” Dixon said it was self-evident that any increase in flights would equally take people and money out of Scotland: “If it is easier to fly somewhere else then people will do their business elsewhere so that takes business out of Scotland too, and balances out any increase.” He said his biggest concern was the impact on the environment. “The biggest disappointment is that the Scottish government talks a good game about climate change and here they are backing the expansion of one of our biggest airports, which will result in 70% more traffic and emissions. If we’re concerned about climate change we can’t possibly expand aviation even more.” Throughout the Scottish National party’s conference, which begins in Glasgow on Thursday, Heathrow will operate a “private, airport-style lounge” with a free bar to promote the benefits of the expansion to Scotland, as it did at last year’s event in Aberdeen. There have been complaints that the SNP has priced non-corporate campaigners out of the event, with the cost of the cheapest, single stall for a charity this year rising to nearly £3,000. An alternative fringe, to run concurrently with the SNP conference at a nearby – and more affordable – venue, will include Friends of the Earth Scotland.
The Scottish Greens’ transport spokesman criticised the SNP’s “flawed thinking”. John Finnie said: “Expansion of hugely polluting aviation can only be a disaster for the climate, not to mention the impact on local communities. The Scottish government are flawed in thinking that more of everything is somehow sustainable. “Maintaining air links between cities as far apart as Inverness and London makes sense, but at the same time we must invest in improvements to our rail network and make it easy to use technology to do business from anywhere in Scotland. That’s where the Scottish government’s efforts should be focused. The growth of airports is a last-century idea and that’s where it should stay.” May is believed to favour expansion at Heathrow, despite opposition from members of her cabinet including Boris Johnson and Justine Greening. Las week Zac Goldsmith, a longstanding opponent of the Heathrow plan, reiterated that he would quit as an MP if the government gave the green light to a third runway."
2016-10-10T13:55:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Controversial snooping technology 'used by at least seven police forces',"Controversial surveillance technology that indiscriminately harvests information from mobile phones is being used by at least seven police forces across the country, a far larger number than previously known, according to police documents. The hardware, known as an IMSI catcher, tricks mobile phone handsets across an area of several miles into connecting to them by impersonating cellphone towers, and can be used to pinpoint phone owners’ locations or intercept phone calls and text messages. The Metropolitan police were previously known to have purchased IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) technology. However, documents obtained by the Bristol Cable, a citizen’s media cooperative, indicate that at least six other police forces have bought the same hardware, also referred to as CCDC (covert communications data capture). Police refuse to acknowledge their acquisition of this technology or discuss how they use it, claiming that any disclosures could assist criminals and terrorists. As well as the Met, other forces understood to be using it include West Mercia, Warwickshire, West Midlands, Staffordshire, Avon and Somerset, and South Yorkshire. Matthew Rice, an advocacy officer at the campaign group Privacy International, said: “IMSI catchers, by their very nature, operate indiscriminately, gathering information from all individuals in the particular operating area. This collateral intrusion into the private lives of many innocent individuals is deeply concerning in any context let alone one that is, almost deliberately, opaque.” Civil liberties campaigners have criticised the lack of accountability surrounding IMSI catcher use by police. Rice said the continued secrecy “shuts down debate in the worst way. Policing by consent requires that these evolving techniques be discussed openly and robustly in society, otherwise there is no way of giving true and informed consent”. The technology works by exploiting the fact that mobile phones constantly seek the strongest possible signal in order to make and receive calls and data. IMSI catchers present themselves as the strongest signal in the area, prompting all nearby mobile phones to connect to them. The technology then routes the signal to a normal mobile mast, allowing the phones to continue to function, albeit with all the data potentially being scrutinised by whoever is controlling the IMSI catcher. The use of the controversial hardware emerged after the Bristol Cable noticed that South Yorkshire police’s budget had allocated £144,000 for “IMSI covert communications” in 2014 and “CCDC” in the same document. When asked, a press officer for the force said they were the same item, but refused to disclose any further information for operational reasons. A Metropolitan police transparency document listing all contracts with suppliers agreed between October and December 2015 shows £1,037,223 allocated for “CCDC” to telecommunications firm Cellxion. A similar document for Avon and Somerset police shows a £169,575 payment to the same company for “CCDC equipment”. Marketing documents published by Privacy International show Cellxion has previously touted an IMSI catcher as “a comprehensive set of tools to combat the growing use of mobile phone communications technology in crime and terrorism”. Meanwhile, the minutes of a meeting between the police and crime commissioners of West Mercia and Warwickshire police reveal their approval of a plan to purchase a replacement for their current CCDC deployment, in part on the grounds that neighbouring forces were also using the technology. “Within the West Midlands region both West Midlands and Staffordshire police have recently purchased and operated 4G-compatible CCDC equipment,” the minutes state. “The purchase [of replacement CCDC units for West Mercia and Warwickshire forces] would allow the use of the equipment in support of regional operation, but more frequently in support of local high-risk investigations, reducing the impact of demand across the region for the same equipment being used in West Midlands and Staffordshire.” The West Mercia police and crime commissioner, John Campion, said: “I have seen real-life examples of the difference this technology can make in protecting extremely vulnerable people in our society. It is absolutely appropriate that the police can make use of this technology in order to keep people safe. “It is very important to me that civil liberties are upheld and respected. I am reassured on behalf of our local communities that the safeguards and processes in place will ensure this technology will be used appropriately and proportionately.” Matthew Ellis, the police and crime commissioner for Staffordshire, said: “It is right that police have the tools to tackle the complex nature of crime in the 21st century. Some tactics police use to keep people safe and bring criminals to justice can be intrusive and it is crucial that there are robust safeguards, framed by legislation, around this work, and there are.” A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said they “cannot comment on any specific surveillance methods or technology deployed to ensure the safety and security of Londoners. We will only use any surveillance methods or technology within the parameters of the legislation and associated governance and oversight regimes.” The Warwickshire police and West Mercia police temporary assistant chief constable, Stephen Cullen, said: “Our main priority is to protect the public from harm and we achieve this by utilising a number of techniques, some of them covert in nature. To retain their effectiveness we are not able to openly discuss these methods.”"
2016-10-10T14:33:32Z,uk-news,UK news,'My life stopped': widow of academic killed in random attack speaks of loss,"Eleven days after becoming a father, Jeroen Ensink stepped out of his London flat to post cards to friends, proudly announcing the birth of his daughter, Fleur. “He left at 1.45pm. He was dead at 1.50pm,” said his widow, Nadja Ensink-Teich, 37. “And from that moment, my life stopped.” Ensink, 41, an internationally renowned water engineer and academic, was killed on his Islington doorstep in a random attack by a stranger, Timchang Nandap, who was known to police and had a mental illness. On Monday, Nandap was given an indefinite hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of suffering a mental abnormality. The 23-year-old student stabbed Ensink repeatedly in the chest and back until an off-duty special constable intervened. Nandap, who was suffering psychosis at the time of the killing, had been arrested seven months previously for allegedly possessing a knife and assaulting a police officer. Those charges were dropped six days before Ensink, an acclaimed researcher and senior lecturer in public health engineering at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was killed. Ensink-Teich, who was in court for the sentencing, is now calling for a full independent investigation into the circumstances that led to her husband’s death, believing the tragedy highlights failures in the health and judicial system. “How could this even happen? That is my biggest question,” she told the Guardian. “Knowing that it might have been prevented is a hard fact to live with.” Speaking publicly for the first time, she added: “Knowing those charges were dropped six days before. That is very hard. That is unbearable.” When he was killed, Ensink, who had travelled the world to improve clean water access and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan African and Asian communities, was moments from their front door. Ensink-Teich, an events manager, was inside, caring for their newborn. She knew nothing of what happened outside as she could not see the street from the flat. At 2pm, a friend who was due to visit called to say the road was cordoned off. Wondering where her husband was and believing him to have been caught up by the cordon, she went down with Fleur to ask police if she could look for him. She remembers noticing a tent just to the left. Officers asked for a description of her husband. “Tall and good looking,” she replied. “I felt silly the moment I said that.” The officers told her she should return to her flat and that they would keep her updated. She recalled: “Not long afterwards, there was a knock at the door. And there were three police officers. And I just knew. It is like the floor opens, and you just fall and fall and fall. I knew the instant I opened the door. I didn’t know exactly what, but I knew it was the worst thing ever.” Now, almost 10 months since Ensink’s death, the flat is sold because she could not stop looking at the spot where he died, and Ensink-Teich has moved back to the Netherlands, where both were originally from, to live with her parents. Referring to a photograph showing the couple on holiday last year on a deserted beach in the Netherlands, she said: “I was five months pregnant. And I think we both look so happy, and at ease. We were happy with what our life was. We were looking forward to what was to come.”
In a victim impact statement read to the court on Monday, she spelled out her personal loss. She said: “I miss the life that I was supposed to have. I miss the anniversaries that I will never have with him. I miss the children we will never have. I miss the inside jokes. I miss hearing about his day at work. I miss the twinkle of his eyes. I miss his touch and the sound of his voice when he’d tell me he loved me.” The Old Bailey heard that Nandap, a Nigerian-born student who lived in Woolwich, south London, had heard voices urging him to “sacrifice” a man. Nandap, who also uses the name Femi, believed he was “the chosen one” or the “black Messiah”. On the day of the killing, he was visiting his sister, who lived in the same road as Ensink and his family. Ensink was chased around a car by Nandap before stumbling and falling to the ground. He was heard shouting for help while Nandap knifed him repeatedly. The attack only stopped when an off-duty special constable intervened. As she administered CPR, Nandap shouted: “Leave him, he’s dead.” He tried to clean the knife before entering his sister’s house. Described as an intelligent young man who did well at school, Nandap became mentally unwell while studying accountancy in Boston, US, in 2012, where he started to use cannabis heavily. Nandap told psychiatrists after the killing: “That morning a new voice came … it was a very scary male asking me to kill someone … telling me that I was the Messiah. I was told it was some form of sacrifice, it was part of my job.” Ensink, originally from the city of Zwolle, lived and worked in countries including Pakistan, India, Tanzania and Malawi, driven by what he saw as a fundamental injustice that people lacked access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. At the time of his death he was working on a large study into improving water supplies in urban areas in Democratic Republic of the Congo. More than 400 people, travelling from more than 40 countries, attended a memorial service in London in February, which Ensink-Teich organised with meticulous attention to detail. Oliver Cumming, assistant professor at London School of Health and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), a close friend and professional colleague, said Ensink had a rare quality. “There are few people who manage to build up credibility and to be influential in so many parts of the world. What was so impressive about Jeroen was that in all the places he worked, in a very modest fashion, he built a very strong reputation on the quality of his work and the integrity of his character.” An obituary in the Lancet said: “Indirectly, his death is also a loss to a large proportion of the world’s poor.” Last year, Ensink participated in a Guardian debate on achieving sustainable development in water and sanitation.
The Jeroen Ensink Memorial Fund, set up to support MSc scholarships to the LSHTM for students from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to become future leaders in public health, has so far reached £80,000. It is a fantastic way to carry on his legacy, said Ensink-Teich, who has been supported by the Hundred Families charity, helping people whose loved ones were killed by people with mental illness. After the sentencing, the CPS said earlier charges against Nandap had been dropped due to insufficient evidence. A spokesman said: “Even if the case had proceeded, the bail conditions he was subject to until his trial would not have prevented him being at the location of the attack on Ensink on 29 December.” Ensink-Teich is determined to avoid negative thoughts about her husband’s killer. “I know that if I am holding hate, anger, resentment, bitterness in me, I can’t be the mother I want to be. If I am holding those negative thoughts, I am not harming him. I am harming myself and my daughter.” She added: “He has taken Jeroen’s life. He is not taking our lives. He is not going to stop me being the mother I always wanted to be. “I believe in the goodness of the world. I don’t know how, but I still do. And I want to show the beauty of the world to my daughter.”"
2016-10-10T16:21:30Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK close to deal to transfer child refugees from Calais, says Rudd","British and French ministers are close to a deal to safeguard or bring to the UK hundreds of unaccompanied refugee children within the next fortnight as France prepares to close the Calais camp, the home secretary told MPs. Amber Rudd said after a two-hour meeting on Monday with her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, that the official effort would prioritise safeguarding children aged under 12 – while after her announcement Labour MPs pressed her to clarify how many of the 1,000 unaccompanied children in Calais the UK would take.
In a statement to the Commons, the home secretary said: “We are expecting to reach agreement. When the camp clearances take place in the next few weeks we will be working very closely with the French.” Rudd told MPs that the French authorities had agreed to verify by the end of this week a list of 387 child refugees with a legal right to come to the UK drawn up by the campaign group Citizens UK. “Once we have that official list we will move quickly within days and remove very quickly those children,” she said. Rudd said that as many children as possible with direct family links in Britain would be brought to the UK under the Dublin convention before the Calais camp was closed, while the rest would be transferred during the rest of the operation. “I emphasised to Monsieur Cazeneuve that we should transfer as many minors as possible from the camp eligible under the Dublin regulation before clearance commences, with the remainder coming over within the next few days of operation,” Rudd told the Commons. “I also outlined my views that those children eligible under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act 2016, must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered.” Rudd added that Britain was prepared to help fund the accommodation. MPs on all sides welcomed the home secretary’s apparent new sense of urgency on the issue. The chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, Yvette Cooper, said the home secretary’s commitment to take all the Calais child refugees with family in the UK “within the next two weeks” was important and welcome. “Clearance of the Calais camp is due to start next week but there still aren’t proper safe places for the hundreds of unaccompanied children to go – putting them at even greater risk of trafficking and abuse,” said Cooper. “The commitment for the first time to take additional children from Calais under the Dubs amendment is also an important one – but we need to know how many and how fast, and what will happen to them when the camp is cleared next week.” Rudd promised that bureaucracy would no longer hamper the government’s determination to help the lone child refugees in the camp. A second Home Office asylum expert is to be sent to France and an official-level contact group has been set up between the two governments to deal with the situation. In London a dedicated Home Office team has been set up within its “Dublin unit” to process the transfers. Rudd refused to put a figure on the number of child refugees who were likely to be brought to Britain as a result of the expected deal or give a likely timetable, saying it would only help the people traffickers. She did however tell the Daily Mail in an interview published on Monday that if 300 child refugees came to the UK that would be “a really good result”. The French have also refused to name a specific date on their planned clearance of the refugee camp in Calais but it is expected that its closure will rapidly follow the agreement between the French and British over the fate of the near 1,000 unaccompanied child asylum seekers believed to be in the camp. The deal is not expected to cover the estimated 9,000 adult asylum seekers in the Calais camp who will instead be dispersed to other centres around France when the camp closes. Those adults with close family ties to Britain will have their claims to be transferred to the UK considered under the lengthy Dublin relocation process. Officials from the main French children’s charity working in Calais started a census of all the children currently based in the camp on Monday. The registration of all children was expected to take two days and will be used to verify the original list of 387 children with a legal right to go to the UK provided to the Home Office on 2 September. The Calais prefecture asked the organisation France Terre d’Asile to conduct a census of all minors, collecting names and ages of all the children currently living in the camp. Although Citizens UK and the local charity L’Auberge des Migrants have previously counted and made unofficial registers of the children, the population is very fluid, with some children leaving and new children arriving every day. A spokesperson from France Terre d’Asile said it would not comment on its findings until the census was complete. Mary Jones, who runs the Kids’ Cafe in the camp, where approximately 200 unaccompanied children receive free food daily, said she had been told to expect representatives from the charity on Monday to begin making a list of minors. “If they are focused on under-12s, there are very few of them. The youngest, an eight-year-old, made his way to the UK at the weekend,” she said. The campaigner and actor Juliet Stevenson, representing Citizens UK’s Safe Passage project in Calais, said she welcomed the government’s announcement that it was willing to take in some of the unaccompanied children from the camp in Calais. “However, they need to do it much faster. Much faster,” she said. “Every night unaccompanied children are risking their lives trying to reach the UK, and the imminent threat of the demolition of the camp is only making them more desperate.”"
2016-10-10T16:45:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Migrants plan day of action to highlight contribution to Britain,"Migrant workers and their supporters are planning a day of action to highlight their role in the UK in what is being billed as a celebration of the contribution they make to British society.Plans for the event, called One Day Without Us, include a labour boycott to show how important migrants are to the UK workforce. Organiser Matt Carr, a writer and commentator, has urged migrants and their supporters to join in the day of action on 20 February 2017. He said the trigger for the event was profound concern about worsening attitudes to migrants in the UK. Carr said he believed that those who voted against Brexit, and also many of those who voted in favour of it, were alarmed at the levels of racism and xenophobia that had manifested before and after the referendum vote. “We want to make this an inclusive event,’’ Carr said. “We realise that because of the legal constraints on striking, many workers will not be able to take formal strike action. However, they can choose to support this event simply by taking the day off work.” He said he was surprised how quickly the event had gathered momentum. Despite discussions taking place in a closed Facebook group over a few days, Carr said there were now about 6,000 people involved in the conversation about A Day Without Us. The aim of the day of action is to emphasise the variety of work migrants undertake to help keep the UK afloat – from NHS doctors to those who staff the hospitality sector. The organisers say a day without migrant labour will demonstrate how much the economy would struggle without their contribution. The day of action, scheduled to coincide with the UN’s World Day of Social Justice, is based on similar events in the US in 2006 and in Italy in 2010. Carr plans to approach religious and community organisations as well as political parties and trade unions to support the idea and to ensure it takes place across the country and is rooted in local communities. Carr said he was hopeful that employers who relied on migrant labour would support the strike and shut their businesses for the day. “Since Brexit we have seen levels of xenophobia and racism that have been increasingly legitimised. We want to make a bold and powerful statement and give migrants an opportunity to express themselves,” he said."
2016-10-10T17:31:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans tells rape retrial that woman consented to sex,"The international footballer Ched Evans has told the jury at his retrial that a teenager he is accused of raping consented to sex with him. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Wales, claimed the 19-year-old woman enjoyed having sex with him and rejected the allegation she was too intoxicated to consent. He also denied that it was “sinister” to have left the hotel where the alleged rape took place via a fire door. He claimed it was a convenient short cut to the main road from the hotel, located in the seaside town of Rhyl in north Wales. The woman had told the jury that she woke up naked in the room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. The prosecution alleges she could not possibly have consented to sex as she was too intoxicated. Evans denies rape. In the witness box at Cardiff crown court, Evans was asked by his barrister, Judy Khan QC: “During sex was she consenting?” He replied: “Yes.” “How did you know that?” the barrister asked. “From how she was acting, what she said to me,” Evans replied. Khan asked: “Is there any doubt in your mind that she was consenting?” Evans replied: “No.” “How did she seem to you?” the barrister asked. “She seemed like she was having sex and enjoying herself,” Evans said. The QC continued: “Did she appear too drunk to consent?” “No”. “Did she appear to know what was going on around her?” “Yes.” “If she had been too drunk to consent, would you have had sex with her?” “No.” Khan concluded her examination by asking: “Did you rape [the woman]?” Evans replied: “No.” Evans claims that he and another footballer, Clayton McDonald, had consensual sex with the teenager. The jury has been told that McDonald “hooked” the teenager when she was heavily intoxicated following a night out in the early hours of 30 May 2011. Evans was convicted of rape in April 2012 but his appeal was allowed. The jury has been told that in 2013 a website offered a £50,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal. That was removed from the website in October 2015 when the case was referred to the appeal court, the court heard. McDonald was cleared of rape. At the start of his testimony on day four of his trial, Evans told the jury he signed for Manchester City when he was 13 and transferred to Sheffield United in 2009. He was capped for Wales 13 times. He said at the time of the alleged rape that he had a girlfriend called Natasha Massey and that they were still together. They had a son and planned to have more children and marry, he said. On the night of the alleged rape, Evans was in Rhyl with two friends he knew from his Manchester City days including McDonald. He told the jury he had booked a hotel room for his friend, who lived in Cheshire. He said his friends went out on the town. “I was drunk but I was in control of myself,” Evans told the jury. He became separated from McDonald and received a text message from him. It said “something along the lines I’ve got a bird or I’ve met a bird”, Evans said. The footballer said he decided to go to the hotel. Asked why he said: “To see if I knew her. I was being juvenile, having a laugh, just being childish.” Evans said he let himself into the hotel room without knocking. McDonald and the woman were having sex, he said. “The door slammed behind me. They both looked at me. Clay looked at her and said: ‘Can my mate join in?’ She looked at me and said: ‘Yes.’” Evans said his younger brother and another man, who had accompanied him to the hotel, were outside at the window giggling. He told the jury the woman asked him to perform a sex act on her and then they had full sex. “She was making noises like she was enjoying herself,” he said. Evans claimed the woman took the lead and used explicit language. McDonald left and Evans said he pulled away from the woman. “The situation I was in became real. I was cheating my girlfriend,” he said. During cross-examination by prosecutor Simon Medland QC, Evans conceded he did not know the woman’s name; he did not say goodbye; he did not thank her or kiss her as he left. Evans said: “On reflection I shouldn’t have behaved that way.” Medland told him: “You left the room and disappeared into the night.” Evans said it was daylight when he left. The prosecutor suggested his decision to leave via the fire door was “sinister” and he was covering his tracks. Evans replied: “No.” He insisted there was no plan between him and McDonald. Evans was asked about CCTV footage from earlier that night in which the woman was seen falling over in a kebab shop. Evans said: “In the room she was not all over the place.” Medland suggested the woman did not even know she was having sex with Evans at all. “She knew I was having sex with her. She looked at me as I came into the room,” he said. The trial continues."
2016-10-11T06:00:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"Clown sightings: sinister craze is putting our livelihood at risk, say professionals","Professional clowns have condemned the craze for dressing in clown outfits to scare bystanders, saying it threatens their livelihood and their own safety, and risks permanently damaging the reputation of the artform. Police forces were called to dozens of incidents over the weekend, as the “killer clown” trend, which originated in recent weeks in the US, swept the UK, fuelled by social media. Now the world’s oldest clowns’ club has also hit back, saying the craze is “just not funny”.
“This is nothing to do with clowning, it’s to do with people hijacking a costume and for some sinister reason trying to scare people,” said Rob Bowker, spokesman for the UK-based Clowns International. “These idiots are undoubtedly affecting people’s awareness of clowns and undoing a lot of good,” said Bowker, who is based in the Midlands and performs as Bibbledy Bob. “My fear is that hospitals will say, ‘Oh, we can’t have clowns in because the children are getting scared,’ or stuff like that. And then all that work that’s been done over the years will be undone.” The chair of the organisation, Noeleen Breem, AKA Clown Silly Tilly, said she “absolutely” feared for the livelihoods of its members. “We are concerned about the impact on our reputation, the suggestion that clowns are something to be feared.” Many members, she said, spend a lot of time with elderly people or sick children, and “everything is so gentle, so patient”. The craze for terrorising people, she said, “is the exact opposite of what clowning is. The clown is very vulnerable. The reason we find them funny is because we see their vulnerability. These people are turning that exactly the opposite away around, and behaving in a really abhorrent way that is really quite frightening.” Officers in Thames Valley, Norfolk, Suffolk, south Wales, Cumbria, Gloucestershire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Northumbria and elsewhere have dealt with multiple incidents of the intimidating prank, as members of the public have reported being chased or threatened by people wearing clown costumes, and in some cases wielding weapons, too.
Ch Supt Andy Boyd of Thames Valley police, which received 14 reports of clown incidents in 24 hours, warned that the craze was wasting police resources and could lead to arrest for public order offences. Breem said she was aware of at least two recent incidents in which professional clowns had been booked for performances in derelict buildings, putting their own safety at risk. In addition, she said: “The last thing we want is to be having any concerns about repercussions on us if we are travelling in our costumes to and from shows.” The current craze has gathered momentum in the US over the past month, apparently influenced by Stephen King’s horror story It, the villain of which is a clown called Pennywise. King tweeted earlier this week saying: “Hey guys, time to cool the clown hysteria, most of em are good, cheer up the kiddies, make people laugh.” However, it has not stopped the craze from spreading as far as Australia and New Zealand.
Incidents reported to police in the UK have included four children from Durham aged 11 or 12 being followed to school on Friday by a man in a clown outfit who was armed with a knife. In Norwich, a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of public order offences after allegedly jumping out at a woman in a park on Sunday, screaming and then chasing her. On Sunday, a dog walker from Kent reported seeing a man dressed as a clown and holding what appeared to be a machete and a severed head, who ran towards him “laughing maniacally” before running away. Bowker said his 10-year-old daughter had asked him to walk her to school on Monday because she was afraid of “scary clowns popping out”. “I have been a clown since before she was born,’’ he said. “Still, she vocalised that she was really scared about it, and it’s all the talk of the playground. It’s really tragic. Look at the harm they are doing.” Circus Clown Rico, AKA Croydon-based Ricardo Caruana, who has performed as a clown for more than 20 years, said he had already modified his act owing to the changing reputation of traditional clowns. “I used to wear the full makeup, and I was very much in demand, but I hardly go out as the full clown any more,’’ he said. “I haven’t worn any slap for years, because people find it a bit too scary.” While he still wears a colourful costume, he said: “I don’t wear the big shoes any more and I haven’t put a red nose on for years.” He added that he would not accept a booking for a street performance if full makeup was requested. “It’s just become … ‘Let’s have a go at the clown, hit the clown, pinch his nose, step on his shoes.’ It just lost its respectfulness,’’ he said. “I don’t think there’s any respect for clowns out there any more.”"
2016-10-11T09:11:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Newcastle and Gateshead to host Great Exhibition of the North,"Newcastle and Gateshead have been chosen to host the Great Exhibition of the North, a huge exhibition showcasing art, design and innovation in the north of England. The £5m, two-month exhibition will be staged in the summer of 2018. Plans were first announced by the then chancellor, George Osborne, last November as part of his “northern powerhouse” initiative.
The Newcastle area was chosen from a shortlist of four – which included Sheffield, Bradford and Blackpool – to host the event, inspired by the 1851 Great Exhibition, which sought to showcase the best of technology and culture from Britain and its empire. The government is contributing £5m towards the exhibition and a further £15m into a legacy fund, which will be open to cultural organisations across the north. Announcing the winner, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said the exhibition would “showcase the dynamic arts, cultural and design scenes in the city and across the whole of the north”. She said: “It’s so important that, regardless of where you’re from in the country, everyone is able to enjoy and access great culture. This cultural investment will bring enormous benefits to the region, including regeneration, increased tourism and cultural engagement.” Newcastle and Gateshead’s bid said: “Inspired by the trailblazers of the north, the exhibition will have several cross-cutting themes for all to respond to, showing how the north’s fires of invention continue to transform our world. “Crucially, we will connect artists with scientists and inventors to work closely together, to create new artworks and respond to the great innovations of our time. Arts will meet industry in powerful and memorable ways.” Plans for the event include three walking circuits around Tyneside focusing on arts, design and innovation; an exhibition hub at Great North Museum: Hancock and an extensive programme of new artistic commissions. Carol Bell, the director of culture and major events at the marketing agency NewcastleGateshead Initiative, which led the development of the bid, said it was looking forward to working with partners across the north “to shine a spotlight on our collective cultural assets and strengths”. “Together we will develop and stage an event that the whole of the north can be proud of and which we hope will have far-reaching benefits for culture, communities, tourism and businesses in 2018 and beyond,” she said."

Gail Purcell, 58, from St Albans, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. It is alleged that on 25 February 2014 in Regent Street, central London, she drove a vehicle, a black Nissan Juke, without due care and attention, thereby causing the death of Michael Mason. The prosecution is being funded by the Cyclists’ Defence Fund, the court was told. The case is set for trial on 3 April. Purcell was granted unconditional bail. Mason, a teacher, died 19 days after the collision having never regained consciousness. The prosecution is being crowd-funded through donations."
2016-10-11T11:29:36Z,uk-news,UK news,"Taxpayers could lose Â£20m if London garden bridge is cancelled, says report","Ministers have repeatedly given more public money to London’s planned garden bridge, despite official advice against doing so, and risk losing more than £20m if the controversial project is cancelled, according to a report from the National Audit Office (NAO). Civil servants were so worried about the scale of public underwriting of the scheme that they sought rare formal direction from ministers instructing them to commit extra funds to it, prompting David Cameron and George Osborne to express their frustration at delays to funding for the project. The NAO, the independent government spending watchdog, noted a “pattern of behaviour” in which the Garden Bridge Trust, the charity behind the Thomas Heatherwick-designed project, repeatedly asked the government for more money when it encountered any challenges, which was then granted. The findings cast additional doubt on the heavily delayed scheme, which faces severe difficulties. Last month, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, set up an inquiry into the use of a combined £60m of public money, much of which has been spent before construction has begun. The initial decision to support the project came in 2013, when the then chancellor Osborne agreed to channel £30m through the Department for Transport (DfT). This happened, the NAO report found, despite questionable transport or tourism benefits from the footbridge across the Thames, between Temple and the South Bank. Ministers initially set an £8.2m limit on how much of the £30m could be spent on pre-construction work for the tree and plant-filled bridge. However, this limit was then raised twice, to £9.95m in June 2015 and by another £3.5m the following year. The report said: “Officials from the department advised ministers against increasing the department’s exposure for the second and third increases.” There was particular worry among civil servants earlier this year, when the DfT also agreed to guarantee £15m in other costs if the project were cancelled. They warned that the department was “at the very limit of what he [the DfT’s accounting officer] regarded as proportionate or prudent financial exposure”. It was at this point that officials sought ministerial direction from the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, prompting annoyance from the then prime minister and chancellor in a memo to the department. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, likened the pattern of repeated requests for more public money to the collapse of charity Kids Company. “It worries me that whenever the Garden Bridge Trust runs into financial trouble, the Department for Transport releases more taxpayers’ money before construction has even started,” she said. “If the project collapses, taxpayers stand to lose £22.5m.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the bridge was “a vanity project” for Boris Johnson, who had championed the scheme as mayor, and that it was up to Khan to quash it. “It is an unnecessary expenditure and will have little benefit to Londoners,” he said. While the cancellation guarantee was later reduced from £15m to £9m, the NAO found that the government’s liabilities towards the scheme stand at £22.5m if the bridge is not built, which the report says is possible. “There remains a significant risk that the project will not go ahead,” it said. The Garden Bridge Trust has yet to secure the necessary sub-lease on the area of the South Bank where the bridge will land, the report notes, while the main contractor has been put on standby and construction has been delayed for at least 18 months.The DfT receives written monthly updates from the Garden Bridge Trust on the project, but these do not contain “standard project performance information,” such as progress against schedule and budget, or details of the trust’s progress against fundraising targets, the NAO noted. Public investment accounts for £60m of the scheme’s projected £185m cost, of which Transport for London provided £30m, with £20m of this later turned into a long-term loan. The remainder is still being raised from private donors.In a statement, the Garden Bridge Trust said it was creating “a visionary project” and welcomed proper scrutiny. The £60m of public money was “always intended to kickstart private investment,” the trust said, arguing that the total cost to the taxpayer would be no more than the pedestrian Millennium Bridge. “The trust has not [asked] and is not asking for additional funding,” it said. “We are grateful for the support of the government and the mayor of London as we embark on raising the final private funding.” The junior DfT minister Tariq Ahmad said the department would “consider the NAO’s findings carefully”. “The government remains supportive of the garden bridge project and ministers took into account a wide range of factors before deciding whether or not to make funding available,” he said. “The taxpayer, however, must not be exposed to any further risks and it is now for the trust to find private sector backers to invest in the delivery of this project.”"
2016-10-11T11:41:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans admits not asking if he could have unprotected sex with woman,"The footballer Ched Evans has admitted to the jury at his retrial that he lied to get a keycard for a hotel room where he allegedly raped a 19-year-old woman. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Wales, also conceded that he did not ask the alleged victim whether he could have unprotected sex with her. But he insisted the woman consented to sex and appeared to enjoy it. “I wouldn’t hurt a girl,” he told the jury at Cardiff crown court. “I wouldn’t do anything to harm a girl.” In cross-examination on Tuesday, Evans said he did not believe footballers were “entitled”. He was asked by the prosecutor about remarks he made to the police following his arrest that footballers were rich, which he said was what women liked. Evans, 27, said the statement was “cringeworthy”. “I wasn’t expecting it to be read out in court,” he said. “I don’t think footballers are entitled to anything.” The prosecutor Simon Medland QC said to Evans: “I suggest … you felt entitled to behave like that to that 19-year-old waitress.” Evans replied: “No, that’s wrong. I wouldn’t treat a girl like that.” The woman has told the jury that she woke up naked in the room in Rhyl, north Wales, with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. The prosecution alleges she could not possibly have consented to sex in the incident in May 2011 as she was too intoxicated. Evans denies rape. Evans, who began giving evidence in his defence on Monday, said the woman had consented and he would not have had sex with her if she had been too drunk to consent. The footballer told the jury that he let himself into the hotel room without knocking. His friend Clayton McDonald and the woman were having sex, he said. “The door slammed behind me. They both looked at me. Clay looked at her and said: ‘Can my mate join in?’ She looked at me and said: ‘Yes.’” Medland asked Evans if it would have been a “good idea” if he had asked if she minded having unprotected sex. Evans replied: “I didn’t ask the question … It wasn’t the right moment to ask the question.” He accepted he had lied to the hotel receptionist that McDonald no longer needed the room – when he was already in it – to get the key. He denied tucking his head down to avoid his face being caught on a CCTV camera as he left via a fire exit, or walking home rather than catching a taxi to avoid detection even though he had an ankle injury. The jury was told that Evans’s brother, Ryan Roberts, then 18, and another man were outside the hotel room peering in and filming with a mobile phone. Giving evidence, Roberts, now a 23-year-old maths teacher, said he saw McDonald having sex with the woman. “It appeared to me the woman was enjoying it judging by her reactions.” Asked if she seemed incapacitated, he replied: “She was fully participating.” He said his brother sent him a text telling him: “You can go home, I’ll follow you.” Asked how he felt about what he did that night, Roberts said: “It makes me cringe. At the time I thought it was funny. Looking back it was immature and silly.” Evans was found guilty of rape in April 2012 but his appeal against the conviction was allowed. McDonald was cleared of rape. The trial continues."
2016-10-11T15:19:25Z,uk-news,UK news,'Killer clown' sightings in UK trigger police warning,"The craze for dressing as clowns to frighten people is likely to get worse in the run-up to Halloween, say police, as a teenager became one of the first “killer clowns” to be fined for public order offences. The Metropolitan police warned people dressing as clowns that they could be committing an offence, saying that the prank “can leave people feeling scared, anxious and intimidated”. “While we do not want to stop people from enjoying themselves, it is important that while having fun they remember to act in a responsible manner and understand that they could be prosecuted if a criminal offence is committed,” Cdr Julian Bennett said. The warning came as police forces across Britain said they had received multiple reports of clown sightings by frightened members of the public, after the fancy dress craze, which has snowballed in the US over the past month, spread to the UK. An 18-year-old from South Wales was arrested and fined £90 for a public order offence after dressing as a clown and jumping out at pupils as they left school. Connor Jones admitted scaring children outside St Cenydd comprehensive and neighbouring Hendre infants school on Friday, forcing staff to alert students via a messaging app.
Ch Insp Paul Staniforth said: “Gwent police will not tolerate such behaviour and anyone seeking to cause distress and potential harm to anyone will be dealt with. In this case, not only is this man out of pocket, he will now have a criminal record which will impact his future, including any job opportunities.” West Midlands police said they had arrested a 13-year-old schoolboy after he allegedly assaulted another teenager while wearing a clown mask. The boy is accused of grabbing his 14-year-old victim in West Bromwich on Saturday. He was arrested shortly afterwards on suspicion of assault and bailed pending further inquiries. A man walking home alone in Bournemouth was grabbed and dragged along the street by an assailant wearing a clown costume. Dorset police has appealed for witnesses to the incident, which occurred at about 11pm on Friday. In Southampton, a 13-year-old boy dressed in a clown mask sustained minor injuries after being hit by a car on Monday evening"
2016-10-11T15:44:49Z,uk-news,UK news,London housing: Mayor Biggs builds a new strategy for Tower Hamlets,"A year and a bit have passed since John Biggs became mayor of Tower Hamlets, and he’s been keeping busy. He’s been particularly busy with housing policy, as he was keen to demonstrate to an audience of fellow politicians, housing professionals and the odd stray journalist in an East End community centre on Monday. It was next to the once notorious but now award-winning Ocean estate in Stepney, whose total rebuilding is approaching completion after a process lasting close to 20 years. Biggs used to represent this area as a councillor. He sees the Ocean’s transformation, begun under the auspices of Tony Blair, as the culmination of what a huge collective effort can achieve. Tower Hamlets needs a lot more homes. Its population is growing faster than anywhere else in the land, with newcomers and newborns bumping the numbers up by about 11,000 every year - it’s almost doubled in the past 30 to a good 290,000. There are around 20,000 people on the council’s waiting list and a lot in overcrowded conditions. But the issue isn’t limited to volume. “Housing isn’t about big numbers, it’s about people,” Biggs said. He offered good news and bad. Delivering the good involved poking his predecessor Lutfur Rahman and former London Mayor Boris Johnson in the eye. Biggs feels both were too concerned with maximising output and too little with sensitivity to whether the new homes they gave the go-ahead to, especially on the Isle of Dogs, were suitable for those who needed them. Also, densities had been too great for infrastructure to keep up with, Biggs believed: the school places, shops, leisure space, job and training opportunities, transport capacity and health care facilities essential to successful communities. Those past failings, Biggs said, are being addressed. For one thing, he has displaced Rahman. For another, Sadiq Khan has replaced Johnson. Other problems remain acute. There are over 2000 homeless Tower Hamlets households in temporary accommodation, around half of them outside the borough. But Biggs was able to proudly say that 238 families who’d been living for longer than the legal limit of six weeks in bed and breakfast places when he took office have now been rehoused: “We have shown that although these problems are hard, it’s not impossible to fix them, if you’ve got the will,” he said. The bad news, argued the Labour man, was Conservative national policy. An affordability commission he set up had confirmed that “affordable rent” homes – officially a form of social housing, but with often far higher rents – brought in by the coalition, did not work for Tower Hamlets. He called the Housing and Planning Act, aspects of which even some Tories consider mad, “punitive” and bound to make addressing housing problems in his borough even harder. Starter homes, costing up to £450,000 in London, would not be recognized round his way as “affordable”. The “pay-to-stay” proposals for social housing tenants on lower middle incomes – a paramedic and a nurse bringing in £45,000 on London starter salaries, for instance – would be hit for hundreds of pounds a year. “Unless the government’s policy is to intentionally price lower and middle income families out of the East End, something is very wrong,” Biggs concluded. There are glimmers of hope that new housing minister Gavin Barwell, a London MP, has recognised that national policy needs adjustment and that London’s circumstances require flexibility to be built in the new Act’s regulations, when they are at last produced. Khan’s forthcoming supplementary planning guidance, now expected next month, his London Living Rent and other policies will, Biggs hopes, be helpful too. The mayor and colleagues are now drawing up a new housing strategy with a view to meeting commitments that include building over 1,000 new council homes at social rents and over 2,000 social and other “genuinely affordable” rented homes in partnership with commercial developers and housing associations, tackling overcrowding and securing a fairer deal for private renters. Biggs spoke lyrically about the East End, something he does often and well: “The East End’s a conundrum of a place. You might see it as being full of challenge and poverty. But when you actually look at the lives of people who come here, you see it is a place of magical potential where they can achieve their dreams. And we want that to happen more often.”"
2016-10-11T16:47:06Z,uk-news,UK news,"Give teachers more powers to search for knives, Bailey Gwynne report says","Teachers should be given more powers to search pupils they suspect of carrying knives, according to an independent report on the death of the Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne, which goes on to recommend that the Scottish government explore tighter controls on buying weapons online. The multi-agency review of the circumstances leading up to the killing of the 16-year-old, who was fatally stabbed at Cults Academy, one of Scotland’s highest performing state schools, on 28 October 2015, also concluded that his death could have been avoided had those who knew that his killer carried weapons in school reported this to staff.
In March a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was cleared of Bailey’s murder but found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide after a five-day trial at the high court in Aberdeen. He was sentenced to nine years in detention. Immediately after the trial, a Guardian investigation found that Amazon was selling age-restricted folding knives, similar to one used by the Bailey’s killer, without checking they were safely delivered to adults. The review report’s author, Andrew Lowe, told the Guardian he had conducted his own online searches and was shocked to discover how easy it was to buy weapons on Amazon in particular, and that there didn’t seem to be “any reliable age restrictions”. “Of course in the internet age it is difficult to impose resilient controls, but it should be possible to get together with these companies to agree particulars to protect young people,” he said. The report includes two recommendations for the Scottish government: that it should “explore the further legislative controls that can be brought to bear on the purchase of weapons online” and that it “give consideration to amending the law in relation to searching pupils”. Pupils can only be searched by senior staff if they consent to it, although schools can contact parents or police for assistance if the child refuses. Since 2007, headteachers in England have had the power to search pupils suspected of carrying weapons. The report also recommends that a “specific search and confiscation protocol” should be developed by Aberdeen city council and Police Scotland. On Tuesday morning, Police Scotland confirmed that 15 knives had been recovered from schools in Aberdeen in the period from Bailey’s death up until the end of August. An investigation for STV in August found that around 700 pupils had been excluded from Scottish schools for attacking pupils and teachers with weapons, including knives, over the past five years. The trial in March included testimony from four teenage witnesses who described how a disagreement over a biscuit swiftly escalated into a physical confrontation that resulted in Bailey being fatally stabbed. The jury heard that the killer had told police officers interviewing him the day after Bailey died that he regularly carried a knife to appear “cool”. The review was commissioned by Aberdeen city council, Police Scotland and NHS Grampian following the court case to establish whether there were “wider issues for the whole of Scotland”. It was led by Lowe, the independent chair of child and adult protection for Renfrewshire and a former director of social work, with a track record of involvement in high-profile investigations across the UK.
Lowe, who also had to establish the relationship between Bailey and his killer prior to the stabbing, concluded that their altercation had been “an unplanned, spontaneous conflict that emerged rapidly out of an unexceptional banter. It is not considered that it could have been predicted or averted on the day.” However, Lowe added: “The course of the conflict was fatally altered by the possession of a bladed weapon by one of the boys. This was potentially predictable and avoidable if those who knew Child A carried weapons in school had reported this to staff.” Referring to media reports after the trial that Bailey’s killer had been involved in a previous incident in which he had allegedly thrown rocks at and injured a fellow pupil while at primary school, Lowe described this as having “marginal significance”. “It did not reveal a violent child, but a child under very significant and continual pressure from his brother,” said the report, before acknowledging that a complaint by the parents of the child injured at primary school had not been dealt with satisfactorily. The report includes a number of suggestions for how schools in Aberdeen can strengthen their policy on knives, including age-appropriate information for children as young as primary seven (aged between 10 and 12), notifying Police Scotland of “each and every” weapon-related incident and carrying out individual risk assessments on all young people known or suspected to carry offensive weapons. Based on one-to-one interviews with more than 40 people, the inquiry said the immediate aftermath of the stabbing “was well managed by all agencies”. Launching the report in Aberdeen on Tuesday morning, Lowe began by paying tribute to the dead boy’s family. The Aberdeen Chief Officers Group, which commissioned the report, confirmed that it would begin work on implementing all recommendations relating to them immediately, and likewise highlighted “the extraordinary dignity and fortitude” shown by Bailey’s family. Scotland’s justice minister, Michael Matheson, said the government would look at the conclusions of the review and report back in due course."
2016-10-11T17:21:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish ministers under pressure to protect free tuition for EU students,"Scottish ministers are under pressure from university and student leaders to guarantee that students from other EU countries will get free places at Scottish universities next year. Nicola Sturgeon’s government has been accused by universities of dragging its feet over the status of up to 13,500 EU students who could apply for Scottish courses in 2017, by failing to confirm they would still get free tuition. The first minister has won plaudits for taking a welcoming stance to EU citizens after June’s surprise referendum vote to leave, including protecting places for those EU students who started at Scottish universities this autumn. But the UK government has moved faster to confirm that grants and loans for EU students taking places at English universities from autumn 2017 would be protected beyond the point the UK leaves the EU, now expected in summer 2019.
Jo Johnson, the UK universities minister, said on Tuesday the current grant structure would continue, and said the measure would also reassure universities about their future funding. The issue for Scottish ministers is complicated by the fact that unlike in the rest of the UK, EU students do not have to pay fees. Because of a loophole in EU laws, they are entitled to claim the same free tuition which is given to Scottish residents. With 13,450 EU students at Scottish universities last year, the policy is estimated to cost Scottish taxpayers more than £75m in tuition fee subsidies. Scotland’s free tuition policy also heavily caps the freedom of Scottish universities to increase income from fees. Some Scottish universities may already be affected by the delay in a tuition fees announcement, said Universities Scotland, the sector’s umbrella group, with applications to some highly sought after courses closing this month. The deadline for 2017 applications to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the music and drama school in Glasgow ranked sixth in the world, ends this month, while applications for medicine, veterinary medicine and dentistry degree courses close on 15 October. With backing from the National Union of Students Scotland and the university and college lecturers’ union UCU, Alastair Sim, the director of Universities Scotland, said the sector needed the same certainties that Johnson had given English universities. University finances were already so stretched, and the delay was adding to their anxieties, he said. “Scotland’s universities and EU applicants applying here really need certainty from the Scottish government on the fee status for courses starting in 2017. Universities are already receiving thousands of applications and they need to start making offers now,” he said. “It is very difficult to ask EU applicants to make decisions about the next four years of their life without knowing if they are entitled to fee-free higher education or not. “Universities, already facing funding pressures, are in the extremely difficult situation of deciding whether to make offers to students without knowing if or where the funding for their education will come from.” A spokeswoman for the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which currently has 97 EU students among its 1,000 undergraduates, said it was important that new applicants from the EU knew what their fee status would be. “As Scotland’s national conservatoire we’re outward-looking and passionately international in our community and ethos, and we are keen to ensure EU students continue to feel welcome to study at RCS and in Scotland,” she said. A Scottish government spokesman said: “We are currently considering the position of students applying for the 2017-18 academic year. “We want all EU staff and students in Scotland to feel settled and secure, and we continue to urge the UK government to urgently provide assurances that the immigration status and rights of EU nationals living in Scotland will not change in the future.”"
2016-10-11T17:28:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Witness in Ched Evans retrial accused of lying to earn Â£50,000 reward","A defence witness in the retrial of Ched Evans has been accused of lying in court to secure a £50,000 reward for information leading to the footballer’s acquittal. The witness, who gave evidence about a sexual encounter he had with Evans’s alleged victim, insisted he had not received any money. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Wales, denies raping a 19-year-old waitress after a drunken night out in the seaside town of Rhyl, north Wales, in 2011. The woman had told the jury she woke up naked in a hotel room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. The prosecution argues she could not have consented to sex because she was too intoxicated. Evans was convicted in 2012 but his conviction was quashed by the court of appeal and his retrial is taking place at Cardiff crown court. The footballer, 27, has told the jury the woman consented to sex and he has said she took the lead and told him to “fuck me harder”. On day five of the retrial, a man, who cannot be identified, told the jury he had sex with the woman two weeks after the alleged rape. He said they went back to his home after a night out. He claimed she “directed” the sex and used the same phrase Evans said she used with him. Prosecuting counsel Simon Medland QC said the witness made three statements on the case, the first shortly after Evans’s conviction in May 2012. Medland said the witness had not mentioned the phrase at that point. It was not until September 2013, when giving a statement to a private investigator, that the man said the alleged victim had used the phrase with him. The man confirmed he knew of a website set up to try to clear Evans’ name and that a reward of £50,000 was on offer. Medland said: “I’m going to ask you a straight question. Have you received any money?” The witness replied: “No.” “Has any money been offered to you?” “No.” The prosecutor said the man had been unemployed in 2015 and asked: “Would you agree with me that £50,000 is a lot of money?” The man answered: “Yes.” Medland then said: “You’ve invented that phrase in light of a desire to help Ched Evans.” The man replied: “No.” The barrister continued: “[The alleged victim] didn’t say that.” “She did,” replied the witness. Medland concluded: “I’m going to suggest you have made that up deliberately to help the defendant.” The man denied the statement. Questioned by Evans’s barrister, Judy Khan QC, the witness said the focus of the first statement he gave had been on whether the victim struggled to remember sexual encounters the morning after. He said if he had been asked the detail of what was said during sex he would have given it. The witness said he could remember the words she had used clearly. Khan told the witness it was being suggested he had lied on oath and asked if he had any criminal convictions. He replied: “No.” Earlier on Tuesday Evans concluded his evidence. He insisted the woman had consented to sex. “I wouldn’t hurt a girl,” he said. During cross-examination he said he did not believe footballers were entitled to act as he had that night. He was asked by the prosecutor about remarks he made to the police that footballers were rich and that this was what women liked. Evans said the statement was cringeworthy. “I wasn’t expecting it to be read out in court,” he said. “I don’t think footballers are entitled to anything.” The footballer has told the jury that he let himself into the hotel room without knocking. His friend and fellow footballer, Clay McDonald, and the woman were having sex, he said. “They both looked at me. Clay looked at her and said: ‘Can my mate join in?’ She looked at me and said: ‘Yes.’” During the cross-examination, Medland asked him if it would have been a “good idea” if he asked if she minded having unprotected sex. Evans replied: “ I didn’t ask the question ... It wasn’t the right moment to ask the question.” He conceded he had not spoken to the woman at all during the encounter. The trial continues."
2016-10-11T17:28:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Ten Rotherham men in court accused of fight with far-right group,"Ten men have appeared in court charged with violent disorder following a clash with a far-right group in Rotherham. Most of the men were attending an anti-fascist demonstration in the town centre on 5 September 2015, a month after the murder of an 81-year-old Muslim man. On the same day, a far-right group, Britain First, staged a protest in the town and more than 800 police officers were deployed from across the UK to keep the two groups apart. A jury at Sheffield crown court heard that it had been one of a long line of far-right demonstrations held in Rotherham in the aftermath of the child sex abuse scandals uncovered in the town in 2012. The men – Asif Zaman, Mohammed Saleem, Arshad Khan, Abrar Javid, Imran Iqbal, Nasrum Rashid, Moshin Mahmood, Sadaqat Ali, Shaban Ditta and Akaash Nazir – claim they were acting in self-defence. Zaman is also charged with a second count of carrying a knife, which he denies, and two other men – Haseeb Alam and Mahroof Sultan – have already pleaded guilty to violent disorder. The jury was played various pieces of CCTV footage that showed two groups fighting in the street outside the William Fry pub in the South Yorkshire town before the police arrived. Paul O’Shea, prosecuting, said the far-right group was shouting “vile racist abuse” at the men, using language like “Paki bastards”. “Not exactly original but certainly offensive,” said O’Shea. But, the prosecution said, the far-right group “got rather more than they bargained for” when they started a fight with the men on their way home from the counter-protest, finding themselves very quickly outnumbered. “Having started the trouble, as often happens in these sorts of circumstances, they found themselves in serious trouble themselves and on the receiving end of something they started,” he said. The prosecution said there was no doubt that “the other side” in the clash – who will be prosecuted at a later date – acted first but that the actions of the defendants could not be justified as self-defence. “The defendants were part of a large group that involved themselves in serious public disorder in Rotherham town centre … as the various marches dispersed,” he said. “There is no doubt that a large-scale public disorder took place and it amounted to, say the prosecution, violent disorder … You will not find the crown arguing anything other than the other side started it, but the crown say that what these accused did in response was a very long way short of self-defence.” An investigation by the Times newspaper in 2012 alleged that gang rape and trafficking were widespread in Rotherham. A report in 2014 by Prof Alexis Jay, a former chief inspector of social work, concluded that failures of political and police leadership contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children by Asian men in the town over 16 years. “Anyone who lives and works in the South Yorkshire area or, frankly, anyone living anywhere in this country will know about the child sexual exploitation issues that have dominated the news and media coverage for many months,” O’Shea told the jury. He said that while the people of Rotherham did not like the regular far-right marches that occurred following the scandal, “they did not involve themselves in substantial numbers in any counter-protests or marches” until the murder of Mushin Ahmed on 10 August 2015 as he made his way to the local mosque for morning prayers. “It is in the context of that incident, which you can well appreciate caused shock and outrage in the local community, that on 5 September when yet another march was planned, the local community did involve itself in the counter-protest.” The case continues."
2016-10-11T18:08:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Edinburgh Woollen Mill in court over 'pure cashmere' mislabelling,"Edinburgh Woollen Mill is facing a court case in Scotland over mislabelling of scarves as pure cashmere. The chain denies falsely claiming scarves were 100% cashmere on two occasions in 2014 and is challenging the testing process used by the local trading standards team. The alleged offences, brought under the Textile Products (Labelling and Fibre Composition) Regulations 2012, are said to have taken place at the company’s store in Church Place, Dumfries, which is one of its 265 high street shops. A trial began at Dumfries sheriff court on 15 September but reporting restrictions prevented publicity until Tuesday. A lawyer for the retailer argued that reporting of the case could be “prejudicial to the legitimate interests” of the firm. “Now is the busiest time of year for the purchase of cashmere,” argued Susan Duff QC, acting for Edinburgh Woollen Mill. But Sheriff George Jamieson agreed to revoke the interim order he had previously made, after arguments by the BBC and ITV. The case is being brought after a trading standards officer purchased a blue tartan scarf in February 2014, and a red one four months later. Both scarves were reduced to £30 from £60 and were labelled as 100% Lochmere cashmere, the court heard. Alison Irving, a trading standards officer at Dumfries and Galloway council, told the court that she cut the scarves into pieces, bagged and sealed them, and sent them off to be analysed at two different test labs – SGS UK and Intertek UK. It emerged she was acting on information from the Cashmere and Camel Hair Manufacturers Institute. On receiving reports from the test labs, Irving notified Edinburgh Woollen Mill that one scarf had been found to contain 84.4% cashmere, while the other was found to have 61.6% cashmere, with the remainder made up of other wool fibres. Under cross-examination Irving said it was “odd” that the results received back from each of the labs had been different from each other. She said: “They were different from each other but neither said they were 100%.” The witness confirmed that after sending Edinburgh Woollen Mill a sample, the company sent back results from another test lab showing that both scarves were found to be 100% cashmere. Textile analyst Liqin Zhang gave evidence saying she identified wool and yak in the scarf samples. Duff told Zhang that Edinburgh Woollen Mill had sent a DNA-tested 100% cashmere sample for her to analyse in August 2016. The lawyer said the fabric had been subject to the same processes and dyed the same colour as the red scarf sample previously tested. Duff told Zhang: “You identified that 100% cashmere sample as 85% cashmere and 15% unidentifiable fibres. “The issue is with your identification and not with the product, isn’t it?” Zhang replied: “If the fibre structure is damaged I have to report it as unidentifiable, I can’t just guess.” Duff continued: “You couldn’t identify fibres that were 100% cashmere, that’s down to your ability?” Zhang replied: “That’s my decision on what my observation is. I’m not saying I’m perfect.” The case continues."
2016-10-11T19:31:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Phone-hacking victims win House of Lords support over legal costs,"Peers voted by a majority of 102 to bring into force legislation requiring newspapers and media organisation to pay the costs of any claims made against them by phone-hacking victims. A cross-party coalition of peers voted by 282 to 180 for the implementation of a key recommendation of the Leveson inquiry that the victims of hacking by newspapers and other media should be protected from paying the costs of bringing their claims in the civil courts. The scale of the government defeat – by a majority of more than 100 – on an issue that is so contentious among MPs and peers may make it difficult for ministers to overturn in the Commons, where the Conservatives only have a majority of 12. Peers had been debating the report stage of the “snooper’s charter” legislation – the investigatory powers bill, when an amendment was put following complaints that the provision had been put on the statute book three years ago but had not been implemented by John Whittingdale when he was culture secretary.
The Lords’ vote reprises the prospect of a “Leveson-lite” regime for press regulation. The 2013 Crime and Courts Act proposes that the government can force publishers who aren’t signed up to a regulatory regime recognised by the royal charter-backed press recognition panel to pay both sides’ costs even if they win any libel and privacy cases brought to it.
No newspaper is signed up to a royal charter-backed regulator. Ipso, which handles complaints for the Daily Mail, the Times, the Sun and the Daily Telegraph said it had no intention of doing so. The Guardian has its own readers’ editor and is not a member of Ipso. Lord Prescott, the former Labour deputy prime minister, told the House of Lords that Whittingdale had “cheered up the press” when he announced last October at a Society of Editors dinner that he did not intend to introduce the costs measure despite the fact it had been passed by parliament in the Crime and Courts Act in 2013. One Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Strasburger, said after the vote:
Ministers had tried to resist a vote on the issue with the leader of the Lords, Earl Howe, appealing to peers not to press the issue, arguing that the Leveson vote was unrelated to the main thrust of a bill on surveillance by the security services. The minister said he understood peers’ frustration with the lack of progress in implementing the Leveson inquiry report and the government continued to look at the issue closely and was “actively considering” it. He argued it wasn’t “unreasonable for new ministers to take time to understand the issues at play”. But crossbench peer Baroness Hollins pressed the issue to a vote arguing that it would be an injustice to the victims of phone hacking to pass up the opportunity to make the change. Hollins said the protection for victims proposed was equivalent to that which would have existed if the government had put into effect section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013. She complained there had been no explanation why ministers had announced last year that they were not minded to implement the section – a change of policy which broke the cross-party agreement and “betrays promises made to both houses and to press abuse victims”. Independent crossbencher Baroness O’Neill of Bengarve said protecting journalistic sources was a profoundly important liberal purpose: “But the misuse of those sources whether by invention or by illegal interception of private communication or by forms of blackmail and the like is not a good liberal cause.”
She said additional protection for journalistic sources needed to be balanced with additional protection for those “abused” by journalists. Prescott also supported the move, insisting the Lords did not want to change government policy but implement legislation already agreed. He said it would ensure justice for “people who cannot afford to get justice in a case in which they have been offended against by phone hacking”. They were backed by former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The royal charter proposal infuriated the newspaper industry, leading the Telegraph’s editorial director, Guy Black, to warn it would create “probably the harshest press regime anywhere in the free world, and much of the developing world”. When Whittingdale announced the delay in implementation in October 2015 he told newspaper executives: “Given the changes under way within the industry, the introduction of the new exemplary damages provisions, and the pressures on the industry, I question whether this additional step, now, will be positive and will lead to the changes I want to see.” No press regulator has yet won the backing of the press regulation panel so the threat to any newspaper groups with outstanding phone-hacking claims could be only theoretical as the costs measure will not apply until a body is first recognised as an approved regulator. • This article was amended on 12 October 2016.

2016-10-11T23:01:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"Government likely to miss £9 minimum wage target, thinktank warns","Brexit means the government will miss its target of a £9 per hour minimum wage by 2020, a leading labour market thinktank has warned. Low-paid workers are set to lose about 40p per hour from their pay packets as a result of the projected slowdown in economic growth, according to the Resolution Foundation. The reduction in the planned rise in the national living wage is likely to be seen as soon as next month, when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announces the increase from April 2017. The government had intended the wage floor for workers aged 25 and over to rise from £7.20 to £7.60 per hour, but it is now on course to rise only to £7.50, Resolution said. George Osborne promised parliament in his 2015 budget speech that the national living wage, or NLW, would reach £9 per hour by 2020, while the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said last month that a Labour government would increase it to above £10.
The economic headwinds holding back the pay floor are likely to result in lower than expected earnings across the workforce, against which minimum wage levels are set. Average earnings are likely to be £850 lower in 2020 than had been expected in June, before Britain voted to leave the European Union, Resolution has predicted. It also found that in 2015, nearly one in five employees – or 5.7 million people – were low paid. The median wage in April 2015 was £528 per week before tax, although there were wide regional variations. Those working in north-east Derbyshire had the lowest weekly wages of £389, compared with £921 in the City of London. “Most economists agree that wage growth in the next few years is likely to be weaker than expected prior to the referendum,” said Conor D’Arcy, a policy analyst at Resolution. “That means we’re unlikely to see the £9 national living wage that George Osborne talked about in parliament.” Changes to minimum wage rates matter to more and more people in Britain. The proportion of workers earning minimum wages has increased dramatically from one in 50 in 1999, when the minimum wage was introduced, to one in 20 in 2014. With the introduction of the higher NLW for workers aged over 24, that is expected to increase to about one in seven in 2020, according to Resolution.
Slower minimum wage growth is likely to be welcomed by some employers. On Tuesday, a leading insolvency firm said there had been a 23% spike in the number of firms paying the NLW that had been classed as in a state of financial distress. Begbies Traynor, the corporate recovery consultancy, said that on 1 October 2016 there were 97,342 businesses experiencing financial distress within the sectors most affected by the NLW. That represents a 23% increase from six months earlier, when the wage floor was introduced. “For growing numbers of low-wage employers in these sectors, the future looks decidedly uncertain,” said Julie Palmer, a partner in the firm. “All eyes will now be firmly fixed on the autumn statement to see whether the new Conservative leadership will stay committed to George Osborne’s original national living wage policy or whether, in a post-Brexit world, the government’s priorities have shifted.” Despite the predicted slower rise, Resolution said the NLW would reduce by 800,000 the number of Britons in low pay between 2015 and 2020. Even a 10p rise next year would mean a pay rise of up to £600 a year for full-time staff aged 25 and over. “It’s clear that the national living wage is set to transform low pay across Britain,” said D’Arcy. “But ambitious policy announcements need equally ambitious implementation plans to make them a success. With over 4 million workers set to be earning the new legal minimum by 2020, ministers need to work closely with employers to ensure they’re not just able to pay the legal minimum, but can offer staff a route out of low pay altogether.” The Resolution Foundation found that by 2022, almost a quarter of workers in central Lincolnshire, which includes Boston, the town that voted most heavily for Brexit, will be in low pay, compared with 8% in London. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The government is committed to building an economy that works for all and the national living wage is doing just that, with more than 1 million workers already benefiting from a pay rise. The independent Low Pay Commission is chiefly responsible for making recommendations for national minimum wage rates, and now has additional responsibilities to help deliver the national living wage.”"
2016-10-11T23:01:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"500,000 Britons a year will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035, study shows","More than half a million Britons a year will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035, making it hard for NHS services to cope with the extra demand for testing and treatment, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has warned. The number of people across the UK found to have cancer every year is expected to rise from 352,000 to an estimated 514,000 in less than 20 years – more than 160,000 extra cases annually – according to research in the British Journal of Cancer.
The vast majority of the expected 162,000 additional cases – 141,000 – will be caused by the ageing and growing population. However, another 12,600 will be the result of a combination of lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol or poor diet, and also improved screening for the disease. In 1993, 127,000 men and 128,000 women were diagnosed with the disease. By 2014, the numbers had risen to 173,000 and 179,000 respectively. This future trends analysis, based on examining cancer data going back to 1979, predicts that 244,000 women and more than 270,000 men will be diagnosed in 2035. Those big rises mean there is an “urgent need to plan for the future of NHS cancer services, which are already stretched to the limit as they struggle to cope with a growing and ageing population”, CRUK said. “The number of people getting cancer in the UK will incerease sharply in the next two decades. This is mostly the result of an ageing and growing population but, for women, lifestyle factors are playing an increasingly important role”, said Dr Rebecca Smittenaar, the study’s lead author and CRUK’s statistics manager.
People’s risk of developing cancer will also rise in actual terms, separate to the growing numbers diagnosed, due to increased life expectancy and population expansion. Cancer incidence rates have risen for both sexes in an almost unbroken way since records began in 1979, though they have recently begun edging downwards for men. Men have always been more likely than women to be diagnosed.
In 1993, 783 f every 100,000 men aged 15 or over were diagnosed with cancer. That rose to 808 per 100,000 in 2014 and is predicted to increase again, albeit slightly, to 812 per 100,000 in 2035. The number of women in that age group who developed cancer rose from 564 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 664 per 100,000 in 2014. It is due to hit 685 by 2035, according to the study. CRUK last year revised its prediction for the number of people who would develop cancer at some point in their lives from one in three to one in two. Sir Harpal Kumar, the charity’s chief executive, said the expected increases in cancer cases were “shocking”. However, four in 10 cancers could be prevented if people drank less, did not smoke, ate a healthy diet and took more exercise, he said."
2016-10-12T10:59:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police not recording most UK slavery cases as crimes, says report","UK police forces are failing victims of modern slavery by not recording what happens to them as crimes, meaning many cases are never investigated, the independent anti-slavery commissioner has said in his first annual report. Kevin Hyland, whose job was created under last year’s Modern Slavery Act, said just over a quarter of the 3,000-plus slavery cases identified in England and Wales last year under the national referral mechanism (NRM) for recording the offence resulted in crimes recorded by police. The situation was similarly bad in Scotland, Hyland noted in his report, although the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) logged every one of the offences referred to it. This meant too many police forces were failing victims, Hyland said. “When NRM referrals are not recorded as crimes, investigations are not launched and victims do not receive the justice and support that they both need and deserve.” The report identified some areas in which anti-slavery procedures had improved but said a series of other areas needed improvement and there were “too many gaps in the system for victims to fall through”, especially once they left supported accommodation. Hyland’s biggest concern was the failure by police to properly record slavery referrals. Among English and Welsh forces, he found, 3,146 NRM referrals brought just 884 recordings of slavery crimes, or 28% of the total. This amounted to “chronic weaknesses” in recording the crime, Hyland said. More than half of the English and Welsh forces had difficulties answering whether any referrals via the NRM had resulted in a crime record, while four could not find their internal records about NRM cases. In Scotland the situation was, if anything, worse, the report found, with police forces having a policy – since changed – that slavery crimes would only be recorded if there were “conclusive grounds” connected to the NRM. In contrast, the PSNI logged 100% of NRM referrals in 2015-16. Matters were not all bad, Hyland said. In the foreword to the report, he wrote: “Evidence I have collected does demonstrate that some UK police forces are taking a proactive approach to combating modern slavery through the development of bespoke units, quality assurance mechanisms and training.” He added: “I am disappointed, however, that many instances of substandard modern slavery crime recording remain.” Hyland said he had raised the issue with the National Crime Agency and the National Police Chiefs’ Council. Shaun Sawyer, who leads on anti-slavery for the NPCC, said police wanted to do more to tackle the “vile crime”. “This complex and cross-border-type offence presents the police with unique challenges,” he said. “However, it does not excuse the gap between national referrals and recorded crime in some areas. We also believe there are many victims of modern slavery who are yet to be identified.” In a statement following the report, Theresa May said the government was committed to tackling the issue. “So let us send out this message,” the prime minister said. “To the victims of modern slavery: we will not ignore your plight. We will not turn away. We will not shut our eyes and pretend your suffering does not exist. “We will work tirelessly, relentlessly pursuing the perpetrators of these appalling crimes so that victims of slavery can go free. And my message to these criminals is simply this: we are coming after you.” According to the report, there are believed to be up to 13,000 victims of modern slavery currently in the UK, including domestic slaves, forced agricultural workers and people exploited in brothels. Hyland said a visit to Italy and Greece this year had uncovered “strong evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable, and that there is a need for urgent action”. Hyland also noted concerns about the potential numbers of women and girls trafficked from Nigeria for sexual slavery. In 2015, more than 5,600 Nigerian women and girls arrived in Italy by sea, almost four times as many as in 2014, the report said. The majority of these came from the Nigerian state of Edo. Hyland also highlighted the issue of homeless people being exploited by traffickers for what is described as work in the informal economy. He said a number of them were “being held in exploitation and slave-like conditions across the UK”. The report warned: “As there is currently no national evidence base or recording mechanisms for this phenomenon, and despite the best efforts of organisations working in this field, the response to date has not been effective.”"
2016-10-12T13:16:34Z,uk-news,UK news,"London population growth rate twice that of UK, official figures show","The population of London grew at twice the rate of the UK as a whole between 2011 and 2015, and could reach almost 10 million by the middle of next decade, official figures show. In mid-2011, the population of the city stood at 8.2 million, but over four years it increased by 469,000 to just under 8.7 million, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The arrival of almost 200,000 people from overseas each year, and an average of 130,000 births a year drove the city’s growth, and offset the high numbers leaving the city for other countries and the rest of the UK. The ONS figures show the population of London increased by 5.7% between mid-2011 and mid-2015, compared with growth of 2.9% for the UK as a whole. Over the same period, the cost of housing in the capital has rocketed – Land Registry figures show that the average price of a property rose by 47% between June and 2011 and June 2015, from £285,906 to £419,474. After Greater London, Bristol was the city that saw the biggest boom in residents, with its population rising by 4.5%, or 49,000, to 1.1 million.
“Differing levels of population growth across different cities and regions are often a reflection of the economic strength of the location, with areas where the economy is performing strongest often experiencing most population growth,” the ONS said. London, with its robust economy, has attracted far more movers from overseas than other parts of the UK, the figures show. Over the four-year period in question, an average of 192,000 people a year moved to London from abroad – including Britons who have returned after a period living overseas – while 95,000 moved in the other direction. Net international migration to Greater London averaged 97,000 a year, out of a figure of 236,000 for the UK as a whole. “London’s attraction to immigrants no doubt reflects its status as a major employment centre and international hub,” said the ONS. “With its high ethnic-minority population it may prove especially attractive to people wishing to join family or others from that cultural background. In addition, for people heading to the UK, London is somewhere they are more likely to have some pre-existing awareness of than other parts of the country – perhaps because of previous visits, but also simply because it has a higher profile as the UK capital.” Because many immigrants are young adults, the comparatively high immigration to Greater London affects all its other population dynamics, the ONS said. Over the period in question, there were an average 130,000 births in the capital each year and just 48,000 deaths. The figures also showed large numbers of people leaving Greater London for other parts of the UK. Each year an average of 63,200 people left the capital, with the 22- to 29-year-old age group the only one where more people moved in. Among 30- to 44-year-olds, 33,600 more people moved out of Greater London than into the city each year, while amongchildren that figure was 31,700. In contrast, Bristol saw more people move in from around the UK, with net internal migration averaging 3,700 a year between mid-2011 and mid-2015. The population of Edinburgh was also boosted by internal migration, with 2,700 more people moving into the Scottish capital than out. House prices in those cities have also increased.
The ONS said that, based on recent trends, the population of Greater London was projected to grow by 12.7% between 2015 and 2025, to 9.8 million people. Across the whole of the UK, the biggest projected increase is among those aged 65 and over, where the population is expected to grow by 21%. In London, this age group is projected to grow by a quarter over the decade. Neal Hudson, UK housing market analyst at property firm Savills, said council tax data suggested the number of homes in London had grown by 3.5% between March 2011 and March 2015. “That highlights some of the pressure on London’s housing stock: more people trying to squeeze in, therefore more overcrowding and more upwards pressure on rents,” he said. Hudson said that the number of people in their late 30s and early 40s who were leaving London was also down on the levels before the recession.
“They were staying put as a result of improving schools, the credit crunch limiting moves, etc, and so there were fewer opportunities for younger people to replace them on the housing ladder,” he said."
2016-10-12T13:29:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"Second Ched Evans defence witness denies £50,000 reward motive","A second defence witness in the retrial of Ched Evans has denied giving a statement to the footballer’s legal team in the hope of securing a £50,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal on a rape charge. The witness, who had a sexual relationship with the woman shortly before Evans allegedly raped her, said he had only just heard there was a reward and insisted he had not lied to the jury in the hope of earning it. Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Wales, denies raping a 19-year-old waitress after a drunken night out in the seaside town of Rhyl, north Wales, in May 2011. The woman had told the jury she woke up naked in a hotel room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. Evans has said he had consensual sex but the prosecution argues the woman could not have consented to sex because she was too intoxicated. Evans was convicted in 2012 but that conviction was quashed by the court of appeal and his retrial is taking place at Cardiff crown court. The footballer, 27, has told the jury that during consensual sex the woman took the lead and told him to “fuck me harder”. On Wednesday, a man, who cannot be identified, told the jury he had sex with the woman five or six times. He said they had sex on the weekend of the alleged rape and that she was drunk. “She started instigating sex. She was coming on to me,” he said. “We began to have sex. She dictated how it went about. It was a bit of a shock to me.” The man said the woman had told him: “Go harder, go harder.” During cross-examination, the prosecutor Simon Medland QC pointed out that in the first statement he made in September 2011 the man had made no mention of that phrase. “I wasn’t asked,” the man replied. Medland asked him why in December 2015, four years and three months later, in a second statement to Evans’s legal team, he did mention the phrase. Asked if the person who took the statement had suggested the phrase to him, he replied: “Not at all.” The prosecutor asked him if he was aware of a reward being offered at the time. He replied: “No.” He said he had only heard about the reward on Monday via Twitter. He said he gave Evans’s mother permission to publish an anonymised version of his first statement on a website set up as part of the fight to clear the footballer’s name. The man also described how he made the first statement after a “local Rhyl lad” told him: “You’ve got to make a statement.” He then contacted a relative who was a friend of Evans. On Tuesday, another man told the jury he had had sex with the woman two weeks after the alleged rape. He said they had gone back to his home after a night out. He claimed she had “directed” the sex and used the same phrase Evans said she used with him. Medland asked him about the reward and said: “I’m going to ask you a straight question. Have you received any money?” The witness replied: “No.” Evans has told the jury that he let himself into the hotel room where the alleged rape took place without knocking. His friend and fellow footballer, Clay McDonald, and the woman were having sex, he said. “They both looked at me. Clay looked at her and said: ‘Can my mate join in?’ She looked at me and said: ‘Yes.’” The jury asked if they could examine McDonald’s statements. The judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, told the jurors they could not as he had not been called to give evidence. The trial continues."

Gayle Newland, 26, was released on bail after her conviction for three counts of sexual assault was quashed by the court of appeal in London. Newland will now face a retrial. The three appeal court judges, Lady Justice Hallett, Mr Justice King and Mr Justice Dove, found that the original conviction was unsafe. Hallett told the court that the summing up by the trial judge, Roger Dutton, had not been properly fair and balanced. Newland, who watched proceedings via video link from HMP Styal in Cheshire, wept as the judges announced their decision. The former marketing manager was said to have disguised herself as a man and persuaded her victim to wear a blindfold at all times when they met. Appearing at Chester crown court in September last year, Newland denied sexual assault, claiming her accuser always knew she was pretending to be a man as they engaged in roleplay while struggling with their sexuality. A jury of eight women and four men later found Newland guilty on three counts of sexual assault by penetration."
2016-10-12T16:02:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Three police officers charged over evidence given into death of student,"Three police officers are to be prosecuted over evidence they gave into the death of a student who had a fatal heart attack after being forcibly detained under the Mental Health Act. The Crown Prosecution Service is to charge three officers with perverting the course of justice and perjury over the death of Kingsley Burrell in 2011. Burrell, 29, had a covering placed over his face and was left handcuffed for hours on a hospital floor while in police custody in Birmingham. In May last year an inquest jury found that the student died as a result of neglect by police officers and ambulance staff, who were accused of restraining him unnecessarily and failing to provide basic medical attention. West Midlands police said the three police constables – Paul Adey, 36, Mark Fannon, 45, and Paul Greenfield, 50 – had been suspended following the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision. They are due to appear at Birmingham magistrates court on 31 October. They were accused by Burrell’s relatives of giving misleading evidence to the inquiry at Birmingham coroner’s court.
In a statement, Burrell’s family said they welcomed the decision to prosecute the three officers “in the belief that they must be publicly held to account for their actions in the circumstances surrounding the death of Kingsley. “This has been a long time coming and the fight for justice for Kingsley continues. At this stage we have no further comment.” Burrell was taken into custody after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun while shopping in the centre of Birmingham. However, CCTV footage showed he was not being followed and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. Burrell suffered a fatal heart attack four days later at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham after a violent struggle with police officers in the back of an ambulance. At the inquest jurors were told that Burrell had wet himself and was left handcuffed on the hospital floor for five or six hours while waiting to be assessed. Following six weeks of evidence, jurors found that prolonged restraint and a failure to provide basic medical attention led to Burrell’s death. The jury said there was a gross failure to provide or procure basic medical attention in response to an obvious need before Burrell died of brain damage following a cardiac arrest on 31 March 2011. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: “Following a referral by the IPCC we have decided there is sufficient evidence to charge three officers from West Midlands police with perverting the course of justice and perjury in connection with the death of Kingsley Burrell in 2011. “The officers and the family of Mr Burrell have been informed. Criminal proceedings involving the three police constables will now be commenced and each has a right to a fair trial. It is important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate to comment further.”"

Ian Stewart, 55, appeared at St Albans crown court, where he also pleaded not guilty to fraud, preventing the lawful and decent burial of a dead body, and perverting the course of justice. He was held on remand until a trial early next year. Stewart, a computer expert, had reported the 51-year-old author missing on 15 April, telling police she had left the home they shared in Royston, Hertfordshire, and not returned. Friends initially said they believed the author might have gone to the couple’s holiday home in Broadstairs, Kent. Then, in July, officers found her body after searching the grounds of the home. Bailey was the author of 22 published books of short stories, picture books and young-adult fiction. She was best known for creating the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport books for teenagers. In more recent years she had developed another audience with Planet Grief, a blog about the complexities of grieving and trying to make sense of the death of her husband, John Sinfield, who drowned during a holiday in Barbados in 2011. She turned the blog into a memoir, When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis."
2016-10-12T17:21:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Opponents of new Liverpool tower block are luddites, says mayor","The mayor of Liverpool has dismissed the concerns of “luddite” campaigners who warned a new development could cost the city its Unesco world heritage status, claiming a “certificate on the wall” did little to boost the area’s prospects. The city has been on a list of “at risk” sites that could have their world heritage status removed by Unesco since 2012, with the organisation citing concerns over a string of new developments in the city’s centre. In July, Unesco recommended the city place a two-year moratorium on new developments within the world heritage site and surrounding areas, but the council said such a move would send out the message that the city had “shut up shop and was closed for business”. On Tuesday, the council caused consternation among conservation campaigners when it approved a 22-storey block of student accommodation to be built on a site next to Liverpool’s Lime Street stationand the Crown Hotel, which are both Grade-II-listed buildings, and near to the Grade I-listed St George’s Hall. Unesco had previously asked that the decision be deferred until a report into how the city could protect its status as a world heritage site was submitted in December, but the council ignored the call. “We are a city that has to continue to grow or be left behind and we have to get that balance right,” said the city’s mayor, Joe Anderson, adding that you could never please people who “just want to leave things as they are”. Of the campaigners, he said: “These were the same people that were the luddites. If they’d had their way then, we wouldn’t have what we have now.” Anderson said that a moratorium on development would be “suicidal” for Liverpool. “It would just put the pause button on the redevelopment of our city and I’m not prepared to do that, and neither are the people of the city,” he said. Henrietta Billings, director of the conservation group Save, said Unesco world heritage status should be treated as a badge of honour, but it was slipping through the council’s fingers because of short-sighted planning decisions. “[The status] puts you on a global stage and it sets you apart from other cities,” she said. Billings said the planning permission decision flew in the face of serious international heritage concerns. “Save is not against development,” she said. “Of course, we welcome economic development in these parts of the city and of course student schemes bring economic benefits.”
“We are saying that the quality of the design and the height impact are really important and word heritage sites and their buffer zones deserve the best possible architecture and design. When international concern is expressed at this level, it’s really time to sit up and take notice.” Anderson said Unesco’s decision was “based on misinformation … I would urge them to come and visit the city and to come and see for themselves. We are protecting more of our heritage than any other city in the UK and I challenge them to test my statement out.” “[Unesco] can’t stop us building on a derelict car park. It can’t stop us providing new facilities, new buildings, new jobs and new revenue coming into the city. They can’t stop us doing that and they won’t stop us.” The city earned the designation from Unesco in 2004 in honour of its historic importance to the growth of the British empire and to European emigration to the US. But the waterfront was placed on a list of endangered world heritage sites in 2012, largely because of proposals to redevelop the city’s docklands. Councillor Steve Radford, leader of the Liberal group on Liverpool city council, moved an amendment to reject planning permission for the student housing project, which would include 74 studio apartments and en-suite bedrooms for 1,085 students. “Unesco’s request for a moratorium was, I think, unhelpful and if anything confrontational, but the council has reacted by saying ‘we’ll do whatever we want’ and neither is very helpful,” he said. “Liverpool has uniquely not suffered from over-development, but that shouldn’t be a reason why we should play catch-up. Would you put a 22-storey building right next to Westminster Central Hall? The answer is no. It wouldn’t even get past the radar.”"
2016-10-12T17:55:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Individual children's details passed to Home Office for immigration purposes,"Details of individual children on the national pupil database in England and Wales were passed to the Home Office for immigration purposes 18 times in four years, the Department for Education has disclosed. The revelation was made in a freedom of information response and comes as the Department for Education is trying to reassure parents in England and Wales that new school census questions asking them to list their children’s nationality and country of birth, sent out in the last few weeks, will not be passed to immigration enforcement teams. The individual details of children’s schools and home addresses were supplied in response to requests from the Home Office’s absconder tracing team looking for parents who had disappeared after being told they faced deportation or trying to find unaccompanied child asylum seekers who have gone missing. Peers and campaigners on Wednesday claimed the FoI disclosure showed the questions on nationality and country of birth gave the wrong impression and should be removed from the national pupil census. But the DfE insisted that, while the Home Office has been given access on a limited number of occasions in the past to individual details on the national pupil database to find missing child asylum seekers or those who abuse immigration control, a fresh agreement means they will not pass over the new details on a pupil’s nationality or place of birth. “This is the first time we are gathering data on pupil’s country of birth, nationality and English proficiency as part of National School Census. It will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language perform in terms of their broader education, and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector,” said a DFE spokeswoman. “This data has not and will not be shared with the Home Office or police and there is an agreement in place to this effect. Where the police or Home Office have clear evidence of illegal activity or fear of harm, limited data including a pupil’s address and school details may be requested.” Gracie Mae Bradley, co-founder of Against Borders for Children, a coalition of parents, teachers, schools and campaigners, said it was a “scandal” that the FoI response had been delayed until the evening after the census was over. She added: “This kind of deception is unacceptable, and allowed the census to go ahead last week under false pretences. It confirms what ABC feared all along: that school administrators are being turned into border guards as part of the government’s attempts to create a hostile environment for migrants. “There is still time to resist this divisive and risky scheme. We are urging all schools who have not yet submitted their autumn census or collected the data for January to put down ‘Not yet obtained’ as the default answer for all children to the country of birth and nationality questions, until they know exactly who will use this data and why.” When ministers were questioned on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Labour peer Baroness McIntosh demanded the new questions be withdrawn, saying regardless of whether or not the information was being used appropriately, the timing was “extremely unfortunate” and gave a “most unfortunate impression”."
2016-10-12T21:19:21Z,uk-news,UK news,"London cycling: pedestrians, congestion and learning from mistakes","As Sadiq Khan and his deputy for transport Val Shawcross assess applicants for the role of cycling and walking commissioner, it is becoming ever more apparent that much must be learned from the failings of the previous mayoral regime. Shawcross herself seems fully alive to this, observing in a recent interview that cycling policy should not only be about servicing the existing (and rather narrow) commuter and otherwise committed cyclist demographic but properly recognising others’ interests too. “The way some of the previous schemes have been consulted on and designed has led to some residents, who don’t see themselves as cyclists, feeling disadvantaged,” she correctly observed. “I think it’s important that everybody sees that the cycling and walking agenda is for all of us”. That pointer to a broad, consensual approach, seeking to harmonise and give equal weight to the needs of cyclists and pedestrians and to introducing new infrastructure with the greatest possible consent, suggests that Khan will appoint a very different sort of person from Boris Johnson’s cycling commissioner, his long-time media champion Andrew Gilligan. There had been rumours that the new mayor would retain Gilligan’s distinctive services, but there was never any chance of that. Shawcross’s measured and mature approach to re-fashioning London’s streets is being welcomed at Transport for London (TfL), where some very senior figures have long held that the implementation of Johnson’s vision for cycling was made more troublesome by a high-handed “Lone Ranger” at City Hall. It is no secret that there were transport professionals at the agency who thought the superhighway programme was railroaded through to detrimental effect. “I think that the generally-held opinion of the speed with which the last tranche of cycle superhighways was delivered is that it was sub-optimal,” was how TfL’s director of road space management Alan Bristow delicately put it to the London Assembly transport committee on Tuesday when contributing to its investigation into congestion. One consequence of the past approach appears to have been making that problem worse, although the policy is meant to help reduce it. Some of this has been temporary, brought about by the lanes’ construction, but a report to the City of London Corporation’s policy and resources committee, which was considered last week, said that “areas of traffic congestion can frequently be found on those roads affected by the [superhighway] scheme” and their “primary alternatives”, and that there is less flexibility for re-routing traffic to cope with road closures for construction and utility works and so on. The report records that some of the information being gathered by TfL as it monitors the impact of the superhighways is shared with City officers “on a daily basis” and largely supports their observations. But it also stresses that these are early days for “definitive conclusions”, and that is surely right. The impact of the schemes needs to continue to be followed carefully. Also for the longer term is the matter of how much they are being used. TfL is encouraged by increased numbers of cyclists on the superhighways during peak hours, but outside of those it is possible to stand for several minutes next to CS2 at Mile End or to look down at the east-west CS from Hungerford footbridge by Embankment station and never have more than one two-wheeled traveller, if that, within view. Will public money turn out to have been spent to best effect on Johnson’s “vision”? Shawcross and the future cycling and walking commissioner should give that question plenty of thought."
2016-10-13T09:36:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ipso's Moses proves, once again, he was a clever choice for the post","Sir Alan Moses is a canny man. In an interview with the Financial Times he accused “newspapers” and/or “the press” of a “nasty edge” to their coverage of the Brexit debate. As chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) he cannot be other than aware that such criticism is aimed at boosting his claim to be a tough and impartial regulator. But, as he conceded, nastiness is outside of Ipso’s remit. It cannot make rulings on matters of tone and taste because it administers the editors’ code of practice, which is silent on such issues. Moses told David Bond, the FT’s media correspondent: “One would like to ask the press to be more responsible. But I have held back from making remarks like that.” His tactics made me smile. Held back no longer then. Editors, and the public, now know what he thinks about press coverage of immigration and, between the lines, they can detect his irritation at not being able to do much about it. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, he has not identified those newspapers he considers to be particularly “nasty”. No naming and shaming, I’m afraid, so we have to guess which titles have upset him. And what about this interesting sentence? “It is frustrating to me as a person with my political views.” Love to know those political views. I’d lay odds they are different from those of the majority of publishers who fund Ipso (not to mention several editors). If so, it proves - yet again - what a clever choice it was to appoint Moses. Ipso’s critics may never be reconciled to him but he has managed to give the body enough credibility, while convincing people of his impartiality, to bed in the organisation. If Moses was an entrant on Strictly Come Dancing, I tend to think he would be awarded maximum marks for his tap-dancing routine! Bond rightly pointed to the next controversy Ipso/Moses will face when it rules on complaints against Sun columnist Kelvin MacKenzie’s comments about Fatima Manji, the Channel 4 News journalist, wearing a hijab to report on the Nice terrorist attacks in July. That decision is likely to emerge within the next 10 days and, whichever way it goes, it is bound to attract criticism. Then Moses will be tested yet again. I note also that Moses was critical of the Guardian for failing to join Ipso, a position I have long supported. But there are moments when I do see the virtues of Ipso and, in a separate posting later today about one particular incident, I will explain why."
2016-10-13T12:13:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who rejected MI5 convicted of terror charge after semi-secret trial,"A Somali-born man who spurned MI5 efforts to recruit him as an informant has been found guilty – following a partially secret trial – of preparing to join Islamic State fighters in Syria. Anas Abdalla was discovered hiding behind canisters in the back of a lorry in Dover as he tried to smuggle himself out of the UK in April 2015. He claimed he was escaping from years of harassment by anti-terrorism officers. His final movements had been closely tracked by an undercover “law enforcement” agent. It is the fourth time the former computer technology student, who holds British citizenship, has been put on trial for the same terrorist offence at the Old Bailey on London. He was convicted after the prosecution shifted from its previous position of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) Abdalla’s allegations of “oppressive treatment” by the security service.
In order to contest details of Abdalla’s dealings with MI5, evidence was given in secret by counter-terrorism officers. The media and the public were excluded from court 10 at the Old Bailey during the in camera sessions – one of a handful of occasions this has happened in a criminal court in England and Wales. The jury, Abdalla and his lawyers remained. The court order authorising the procedure stated that the closed hearing would cover “any evidence which is called by the prosecution which confirms or denies any allegation of contact, or attempted contact, between MI5 and [Abdalla]”, as well as “any allegation ... that [Abdalla] would not be allowed by MI5 to live and progress normal expectations and achievements in life”. As a result, it is not possible to report on all the evidence the prosecution had offered against Abdalla. For a former asylum-seeker to smuggle himself out of the UK is highly unusual. For the Crown Prosecution Service to present MI5-related evidence behind locked, courtroom doors is, however, becoming more common. It was used in the Erol Incedal trial last year. The legal means used to try to secure a conviction are now provoking concern about a lack of open justice and the way in which the media are restricted in reporting terrorism trials. In a judgment on whether the case could be heard in secret, which can now be reported, the judge, Richard Marks QC, said he considered the general problem in such cases. “The knowledge that having cooperated with a state agency, a witness from that agency had given chapter and verse in open court about the dealings they had had, would, in my judgment, be highly likely to act as a serious disincentive to others who might otherwise be contemplating rendering assistance.” Abdalla hung his head as the jury found him guilty by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for 19 hours and 30 minutes. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date. As he was being remanded Abdalla threw a plastic cup at a counter-terrorism officer and said: “One day we will be standing in a bigger court than this.” Abdalla, 26, was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in February 1989. He eventually settled in Birmingham, was granted leave to remain in the UK in 2011 and became a British passport holder but his academic career floundered. At Wolverhampton University, he failed five out of seven modules on an IT course and did not submit written assessments the following year. He was asked to leave in 2010. Short-term jobs followed. He came to the attention of the police when he was stopped carrying a computer belonging to Ahmed Diini, who was later imprisoned in Egypt. The court heard that Abdalla was repeatedly detained at airports and ferry terminals under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, known as a “port stop”; often he was questioned for so long that he missed his flight or ferry. Details of his interviews were passed to MI5. On one occasion Abdalla told officers: “I wish I was in Somalia: better to be killed and know your enemy.” Abdalla came to believe that interference from the security services meant his girlfriend left him, his bank card stopped working and he lost jobs, the court was told. His barrister, Rajiv Menon QC, told the jury: “This is the stuff of nightmares from which there is no escape. This is what happens when you are targeted by the security services and decline to cooperate.” Abdalla denied the charge of preparing acts of terrorism. His lawyer said he had been planning to slip unnoticed out of the UK and move to Bulgaria, where his cousin was studying. He falsified his qualifications in some job applications, Menon said, because he was desperate to work. He had participated in a fraudulent cheque scheme, it was said, in order to raise money to leave the country. A bank spotted that the cheques had been altered. Abdalla, who had fled, was arrested in Germany, returned to the UK on a European extradition warrant, jailed for breaching his bail and convicted of fraud. After being released, he was called into Stechford police station in Birmingham so that his confiscated laptop could be returned in February 2013. It was a set-up, Abdalla said. Counter-terrorism officers escorted him upstairs to a green-carpeted room with cameras and recording devices on the wall. Two men were inside, Abdalla told the court. One, who gave his name as “Phil”, stood up, shook his hand, praised his skills and asked if he would like to work for the security services “gathering intelligence on targets”. Abdalla said he told them he did not want to work for MI5 “unless they could convince me it was a noble cause”. Their debate allegedly degenerated into a row over rendition, kidnap and torture. Phil, Abdalla said, “acknowledged they did certain things wrong … and made mistakes … but that that did not mean everything [MI5] did was wrong … At times he would be very angry. He said: ‘It’s in your best interest to work for us.’” Three days after leaving the station, Abdalla said, Phil called him hoping to arrange another meeting. Abdalla said he rejected the offer and hung up. Over the following 18 months, he claimed, he received hundreds more telephone calls from the same number; sometimes five or 10 calls a day. Abdalla normally ignored them. Once, he said, he answered and a woman said: “Phil wants to speak to you.” Abdalla turned the phone off. During an open session, the prosecution, led by Duncan Atkinson QC, challenged Abdalla’s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and attempted to demonstrate that the difficulties in his life were due to other causes. The court was told that the defendant developed his reason for leaving the country long after his arrest. By 2015, Abdalla, who lived in Acocks Green, Birmingham, was one of the targets being investigated by an undercover officer, codename “Muhamed”, who had infiltrated alleged Isis supporters suspected of planning to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria, the court heard. One of the other men, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism, the same offence under section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 with which Abdalla is charged. Abdalla and Rasmus, the prosecutor alleged, were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey “to join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism”. His final, chaotic search for a lorry to smuggle him overseas was tracked by counter-terrorism officers. When he was detained at Dover, Abdalla held a valid UK passport and, like Rasmus, carried a rucksack containing an iPhone wrapped in foil, a second Nokia mobile, ID cards, £520 and €250 in cash, waterproof clothing, walking boots and a G-Shock watch. One of the other men detained from the lorry was Mahamuud Diini, Ahmed’s brother. The court was told he had also been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, had been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted. Menon pointed out that Abdalla had also been carrying a blazer. “Why take a blazer,” he asked, “if you are heading for the frontline?”"
2016-10-13T13:05:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Ched Evans accused of 'callous indifference' in rape trial closing speech,"The international footballer Ched Evans has been accused of treating a 19-year-old waitress he is alleged to have raped with “a callous, self-centred indifference essentially indistinguishable from utter contempt”. In his closing speech at Evans’ retrial, Simon Medland QC, prosecuting, claimed the wealthy, successful sportsman felt he was entitled to have sex with the woman and did not care what she wanted. Medland told the jury at Cardiff crown court that the woman, who woke up with no memory of what had happened to her, was so intoxicated she did not have the capacity to consent to sex. But Evans’ barrister, Judy Khan QC, said the prosecution was built around a myth – that if the alleged victim could not remember she must have been incapacitated. “That is a myth,” she said. “It’s utterly unrealistic.” She told the jury there could hardly be a more sensitive case than this and asked the panel to put any strong emotions to one side. “You need to keep your feet on the ground,” she said. Khan said Evans had admitted in court to having a “threesome” before the alleged rape and was cheating on his girlfriend that night. “None of that makes him a rapist,” she said. Evans, 27, who has played for Wales, Manchester City and Sheffield United, was convicted in 2012 of raping the woman at a hotel in Rhyl, north Wales, in 2011 but cleared on appeal. During his retrial the jury has been told that the woman went back to a hotel with Evans’ friend and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald. Later Evans lied to get a key card to the room the pair were in and walked in without knocking. Evans claims McDonald asked her: “Can my mate join in?” and she agreed. He had sex with her before leaving by a fire exit. Evans maintains the woman consented to sex and denies rape. Medland told the jury: “Evans said he would never hurt a girl.” But he added: “He treated [her] with a callous, self-centred indifference essentially indistinguishable from utter contempt.” The barrister continued: “At the end of the 19th century, the poet and writer Oscar Wilde was moved to remark that everything in life is about sex apart from sex itself, which is about power.” He conceded Wilde was a “long way removed” from room 14 in the budget hotel where the alleged rape took place. But he said: “You may think considering this case that was one of his more insightful comments.” The prosecutor continued: “We suggest the defendant couldn’t have cared less whether [the complainant] wanted sex with him or not. This wealthy, successful young footballer felt entitled to have her and did so regardless of what she wanted and in doing so we submit to you this was rape and not consensual sex.” He said Evans “blagged his way” into the hotel and “scuttled off” through the fire exit. “Why go to these lengths if he had done nothing wrong?” he asked. Medland said Evans did not ask the woman if she would like to be intimate with him – and in fact had not spoken to her at all. He said she had “no idea at all” what happened to her in the hotel room. “Did she even know that this defendant had even come into that room? Did she know that Ched Evans was having sex with her? “We submit you can be sure that [the woman] did not have the freedom and the capacity to consent to sex with Ched Evans. You can be sure any belief he had in [her] consent was not objectively reasonable.” Khan, for the defence, said Evans was a man of good character, practically a household name. She said it was not the jury’s role to judge whether he had been ungallant or immoral. “He is charged with rape, not acting in an immoral way.” The defence barrister also put a quote to the jury – John F Kennedy’s assertion: “The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie ... but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.” She claimed that “disinhibited through drink”, the woman did consent to sex. She said: “Drunken consent is consent.” The barrister accepted the woman was “clearly intoxicated” earlier that night in a kebab shop but she was still rational. She pushed a man away in the shop and later she sent a coherent and correctly spelled text message to a friend. In the hotel reception she noticed she had lost her handbag. Khan also reminded the jury Evans answered all the questions that police posed to him. It was Evans – not the woman – who told police they had had sex. The trial continues."
2016-10-13T13:53:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Syrian's conviction for using false passport in asylum claim quashed,"A Syrian refugee has successfully appealed against his conviction for using false documents to claim asylum in the UK after spending six months in prison. Roudi Chikho, 30, had his conviction quashed at the court of appeal on Thursday. “At last I can move on with my life,” he said. “I knew I had done nothing wrong but I spent six months in jail and got a criminal record.” Chikho, a Kurd, had been secretly filming atrocities carried out by the government of Bashar al-Assad and publishing his footage via al-Jazeera, YouTube and other media outlets before being forced to flee the country. He crossed the Syrian border into Turkey and a people smuggler then took him to Spain, where he boarded a plane to London. He arrived at Gatwick in December 2012, having travelled on a false Canadian passport. He was arrested, placed before magistrates, convicted of travelling on false documents, stripped of his £2,619 savings and sentenced to a year in Lewes prison, in East Sussex.
“I was with all these criminals, but didn’t think of myself as a criminal,” Chikho said. “There was a lot of fighting and violence in the prison. I saw many terrible things in Syria, but the first time I cried was when I was in Lewes prison. It was horrible to see all the violence there.” Two months into Chikho’s sentence, the Home Office granted him refugee status for five years. But he had to serve another four months of his sentence while waiting to appeal against his conviction. It is a criminal offence for anyone to travel into the UK on false documents, but asylum seekers who are fleeing for their lives and have no other way of travelling to safety have a defence under the 1951 refugee convention. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has expressed concern about the wrongful convictions of refugees and has referred dozens of cases to the court of appeal based on the refugee convention defence. Most of those referred have been overturned. The cases involve refugees from a variety of countries including Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan. The courts have now urged any refugees in Chikho’s position to go directly to the court of appeal so that the CCRC can be freed up to deal with other miscarriages of justice.
Chikho’s solicitor, Nigel Leskin of Birnberg Peirce, welcomed the quashing of his client’s conviction. “Duty criminal defence solicitors in areas where the three main airports are where refugees arrive should be aware of the defence refugees have for travelling on false documents. But more work needs to be done to raise awareness about this,” he said. A spokesman for the CCRC said: “These cases represent multiple failings of the system. The individuals were wrongly advised to plead guilty by their defence lawyers, the decisions to prosecute them were flawed, and the court system failed to spot these cases and put a stop to the proceedings.” Chikho has not only Thursday’s ruling to celebrate. He was also reunited with his wife in May – she escaped from Syria after he did and first arrived in Denmark. A chef by profession, Chikho worked in a top Lebanese restaurant in London’s Edgware Road and has now proudly opened a Middle Eastern restaurant of his own in Kenton, north London. “After all the hard times I have been through, things are finally going well for me,” he said. “After today’s court ruling I am finally a free man. Before my wife came to join me in London I went to visit her regularly in Denmark. I was stopped and questioned at the airport five times when I returned from Denmark to London because of my criminal conviction. Now that my conviction has been quashed I hope that will never happen again.”"
2016-10-13T14:16:21Z,uk-news,UK news,"Stephen Port told his sister of dead body in his bedroom, court hears","The alleged serial killer Stephen Port told his sister he had a dead body in his bedroom around the time the body of his second alleged murder victim was found propped against a wall in a local churchyard, the Old Bailey has heard. Sharon Port, 44, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, telephoned her younger brother in August 2014 to find him “very distressed”. “I asked him to tell me why he was stressed and what was wrong. He didn’t want to tell me at first,” she told jurors on Thursday. “He just said there was a body in his flat. I just told him to go to the police station straight away. It was a bit of a shock.” It is alleged Port, 41, had a “fetish” for sex with young, drugged, unconscious males, and drugged his victims at his flat in Barking, east London, with the “date rape” drug GHB. He denies 29 charges against 12 young men, including four murders, seven rapes, four indecent assaults and administering a substance with intent. The four he allegedly murdered are Anthony Walgate, 23, originally from Hull; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend; and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham, east London. Port smiled in the dock as his sister, who was called as a prosecution witness, entered the court. She told the court the conversation about the body in the flat took place on 27 August 2014, two weeks after she had started a job as a retail assistant for a clothing company. The court has heard that the body of Kovari was found in the grounds of St Margaret’s church, Barking, on 28 August 2014. Judge Mr Justice Openshaw asked Sharon Port if she understood the body her brother was talking about to be dead. “Yes,” she replied. She said she understood “that he had stayed the night with my brother, and when he woke up in the morning he wasn’t moving. They had taken some drugs, but I didn’t know what.” Prosecuting, Jonathan Rees QC asked: “Did your brother give any indication of how long this person had been in this state?” “One day and a night,” she replied. Asked what her brother, a chef at a bus depot in West Ham, east London, had been doing during that time, she replied: “Working.” She understood the body was in her brother’s bedroom. Rees asked: “Did it follow that he [Port] had been in the flat overnight when the body had been there?” She replied: “Yes. I just told him to go to the police station.” Asked to raise her voice so the jury could hear, she replied: “It’s not a nice memory.” She said: “He said he was going to go to the police station. I told him to go the police station straight away. I felt sick. It’s not the sort of things you hear every day. I was worried. I just wanted him to drop everything and to go to the police station and to ring me when he got out to tell me what had happened.” Port’s sister said he later texted her at about 5pm to say he was on his way to the police station. Having failed to reach him by telephone, she and her boyfriend drove over to Port’s flat the following day. On the way he called to say he had been released on police bail, she said. When they got to his flat, she found him to be “fairly stressed, very tired”. His nose was a “little bit crusty” but it could have been hay fever, she said. “I can’t be 100% sure it was because of drugs.” Rees asked her: “Did you learn any more about the body in the flat?” She replied: “Not really. He didn’t really talk a lot. He was very subdued. “He just said he was on bail and that was that, really. He had to go back in a month or two. I assumed it was all sorted. I came home, and that was that really.” Port was jailed in March 2015 for eight months for perverting the course of justice over a police statement he gave when the body of his first alleged victim, Walgate, was found propped up outside the communal entrance to his flat in June 2014. His sister said Port had later told her that the body in his flat was that of someone called Anthony who was Lithuanian. Cross-examined by David Etherington QC for the defence, she said Port had told her in March 2015 that “the conversation in August 2014, there wasn’t a body in the flat, he was talking about Anthony”. She described her brother as quiet and said he had been bullied at school. He was 26 when he came out as gay, and their mother had found it hard, she said. She said she knew nothing of drug use until that telephone conversation. It is alleged that Port trawled social media sites including Grindr and Fitlads to meet young, boyish-looking gay men, invited them to his flat, and either spiked their drinks with GHB or injected it into their backsides to render them unconscious so he could live out his drug-rape fantasies. Barbara Denham, who was walking her dog in Abbey Green, near St Margaret’s church graveyard, found Kovari’s body. Three weeks later, on 20 September 2014, she also found the body of Port’s alleged third murder victim, Whitworth. Describing her discovery of Kovari’s body, Denham told the court: “I was right close to him.” She walked round the body seemingly slumped against the wall. “Because there was no movement, that made me decide to turn back and get his attention. There was no movement. I just touched him slightly on the ankle, but obviously he just felt cold to the touch.” She continued: “He was wearing dark glasses and they were skewiff. That made me think there was something not quite right.” Denham could see one of his eyes, which looked glazed, and confirmed to her was dead, and she called police. She said the body had not been there at 5pm the previous evening when she had also walked her dog along the same route. Describing finding the second body, that of Whitworth, Denham said: “I thought it cannot be the same thing again, in exactly the same place, in exactly the same position. “I was so sad to find out, yes, it was, I’m sorry to say.” She touched him on the stomach, and again there was no obvious sign of him being alive. There was a handwritten note in a plastic sleeve in Whitworth’s hand, which, the court has heard, the police took on “face value” as a suicide note. The prosecution allege Port planted a fake suicide note on the body, in which Whitworth admitted involvement in the “accidental” death of Kovari, to frame his alleged third victim for the death of his alleged second victim. The case continues."
2016-10-13T14:55:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"Most London knife crime no longer gang-related, police say","Most knife crime in London is no longer gang-related, as young people increasingly carry knives for protection, status and safeguarding “criminal interests”, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the capital’s first knife crime conference, which was convened by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, that the trend was changing. He said: “By and large, it used to be gang members, but that’s not the case now. We’ve seen an increase in the number of other young people carrying knives, young people with no links to gangs. So at the moment, some 75% – three quarters – of all knife injuries among the under-25s are not gang-related. The 25% that are – this is around 450 offences in the last year, so about one a day – tend to be more serious, and gang members remain the most dangerous knife carriers, but the changing trend is clearly a concern. “The reasons, so far as we can determine by talking to suspects, are self-protection, status, protecting criminal interests – such as a drugs business – and a culture of fear. This can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, where young people equip themselves with a knife and in doing so significantly up the ante of their chances of becoming a knife victim.” Hogan-Howe said that in London on Wednesday night there had been three knife-related incidents. One was in Greenwich, where a man was stabbed several times and suffered life-threatening injuries. Another was in Westminster, where a man was stabbed in the back as part of a serious assault, and a third was in Hackney, where there was an aggravated burglary. During that incident, a knife was held to someone’s throat and a dog at the address was stabbed. “[The incidents] are quite different,” the Met chief said. “Often the difference between these incidents and murder can be a millimetre, or a very good surgeon. It’s not to do with the intent or the event itself, it can be down to chance.” He urged the public to tell the police, teachers or religious leaders about others who carried knives. “The incidents like the ones I spoke about overnight are often because someone met someone else in an unplanned event. They had an argument on the street, the knife was available, and the fight became a stabbing. Without a knife in the situation it’s not as dangerous an event.” Hogan-Howe’s comments came after an independent report on the death of Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne this week concluded that the 16-year-old’s death could have been avoided had those who knew that his killer carried weapons in school reported this to staff. In London, knife crime has risen by 16% in the past two years, with 13 young people under 25 being killed this year. In the 12 months to August 2016 there were 3,877 victims of knife crime who were injured, 1,749 of whom were under 25. Khan told the summit: “The rising numbers are absolutely unacceptable to me as mayor, as a Londoner, and as a father of two teenage daughters growing up in our city.” In the five months since he became mayor, Khan said, he had met many families devastated by knife crime. He added: “I’ve also met young people left physically and psychologically scarred by brutal knife attacks. There can be no hiding the fact that knife crime is a growing threat.” Thursday’s summit brought together about 150 Londoners, including young adults, victims, police, community leaders, and health and education professionals, and aimed to devise a more collaborative and effective strategy for keeping young Londoners safe. About 95% of knife crime offenders are male, 60% are under 25 and 59% are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. Khan said it was crucial to understand why young people carried knives. “Prevention must always be our first priority,” he said. “As mayor I want to ensure that everyone in our city has the confidence, the skills and opportunities to learn, grow and succeed. In some of our city’s most challenged areas, the reality is that deep-rooted deprivation and low educational achievement stifles the prospects of so many Londoners and significantly increases their vulnerability towards crime.” While Khan praised the government’s ban on the sale of “zombie knives”, he called for better relations between police and communities to prevent crime despite the impact of public sector cuts. “Over the last six years councils have lost almost half their funding … The Met police have lost £600m over the past six years. Money’s still tight, but prevention is better than the cure,” he said, adding that the average cost of keeping someone in prison for a year was three times the cost of a place at Eton. Yvonne Lawson, who set up the Godwin Lawson Foundation in the name of her 17-year-old son who was killed in a knife attack in 2010, spoke about the emotions parents go through when they lose a child. “I can’t seem to function as efficiently as I used to, and you just have to learn how to cope. Each time there’s another incident it takes you back to this memory, and you know another family has to endure this pain.” She told the summit that Godwin, who grew up in Tottenham, had won a scholarship to play football at Oxford United and would return to London every fortnight. “It all changed on … 27 March 2010,” she said. “My whole world felt dark, I couldn’t see any light anywhere. I was just wondering who had done this to my family, who had taken my baby away, and why were they carrying knives? To know he had taken his last breath on the streets was so painful.” The mayor’s office for policing and crime funds £6.8m worth of services to address knife crime in London every year, including the Redthread youth violence intervention programme in all four of London’s major trauma centres. Khan’s knife crime strategy is to form part of his police and crime plan, which is expected to be launched for public consultation later this year."
2016-10-13T16:27:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Driving licences wrongly revoked under May's immigration measures,"Hundreds of people have been wrongly refused bank accounts or had their driving licences revoked under the former home secretary Theresa May’s measures to “create a hostile environment for illegal immigrants”, the immigration watchdog has revealed. David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the Home Office had failed to appreciate the potential impact of such wrong decisions on those affected. His report, published on Thursday, shows that more than 250 people who had their driving licences revoked last year had been wrongfully identified as being in the UK illegally, as had 10% of those denied a bank or building society account. The chief inspector’s first assessment of the initial 2014 phase of May’s “hostile environment measures” to deny public and private services to people with no legal right to be in the UK raises questions about whether ministers were justified in pressing ahead with phase two, due to come into effect next year. The second phase will create a new offence of driving unlawfully in Britain, and banks and building societies will be empowered to close the accounts of immigrants who are in the country illegally and freeze their assets. Bolt said there was insufficient hard evidence to determine whether the measures were achieving what the government intended, such as an increase in those voluntarily returning home. A proper evaluation was needed, he said, not least because of concerns about the potential damage of the measures to individuals and communities. In a separate report commissioned by May in January when she was home secretary, the chief inspector revealed that almost 200,000 foreign nationals had been arrested in 2014-15 in England and Wales. But the police asked the Home Office to carry out immigration status checks on only 30% of the foreign nationals arrested outside London. When the Metropolitan police force was included, the proportion whose immigration status was checked rose to just over 50%. The “hostile measures” report reveals that 9,732 people had their driving licences revoked in 2015 after Home Office checks on their immigration status – close to the 10,000 a year target set by ministers. In total, 20,000 people have had their driving licences revoked since the measure was introduced in July 2014. Bolt said, however, that human error and poor quality Home Office data led to 259 people who were not in the country illegally having their driving licences revoked in 2015, and the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency had to reinstate them. “While these cases amounted to a small percentage of the total numbers of revocations, the Home Office did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of such errors for the individuals affected,” said the chief inspector. “This was particularly true where a licence had been revoked when the individual had departed the UK before their leave had expired.” In such cases, if the person returned without knowing their licence had been revoked they faced being disqualified if they drove on British roads. He said only 583 of the 9,732 people who had their licences revoked in 2015 subsequently left the country. On top of that, only 475 revoked licences were actually returned to the DVLA in 2014-15. Bolt said it was not possible to say how many people were refused a bank or building society account on the grounds of being in the country illegally because the 2014 law does not require them to report customer refusals from immigration status checks. But, he said, a sample of 169 case files of those refused accounts showed that 17 (10%) should not have been listed as “disqualified persons” on immigration grounds, despite the list being updated weekly. A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the home secretary announced earlier this month, we will be introducing measures that will mean that banks will have to do regular checks to ensure that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. Furthermore, we are introducing a new power to search for and seize UK driving licences held by those living in the UK unlawfully. “The measures discussed in the independent chief inspector’s report should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the wider action we are taking that has made it harder than ever before for illegal migrants to live in this country.”"
2016-10-13T17:42:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen Elizabeth II is longest-reigning living monarch after Thai king's death,"The death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand means Queen Elizabeth II has become the world’s longest-reigning living monarch. The Queen became monarch at the age of 25 on the death of her father King George VI on 6 February 1952. Now 90, she has reigned for 64 years, eight months and seven days, or considerably more than two thirds of her life. Before his death on Wednesday at the age of 88, the Thai king had chalked up more than 70 years and four months on the throne. The Queen has a comfortable margin over the next longest-serving monarch, the Sultan of Brunei. Hassanal Bolkiah can boast 49 years and nine days on the throne of the tiny, oil-rich Asian state, having ascended the throne on 4 October 1967. The wealthy Sultan is a car enthusiast, reportedly owning a private collection of up to 5,000 luxury sports cars.
Qaboos bin Said al-Said has been Sultan of Oman since 1970, when he overthrew his father in a coup, giving him 46 years, 2 months and 20 days on the throne so far. Sandhurst-educated, he served with the 1st Battalion The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) before returning to eventually lead his country. He is closely followed by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, affectionately known in her home country as Daisy, who despite a lifetime’s heavy smoking has chalked up 44 years, eight months and 29 days in the top job. Like the Queen, she has indicated that she has no desire of abdicating in favour of her son, saying “you are handed your job as the old king or queen dies”. Prince Charles, incidentally, holds a world record of his own – as the longest-waiting heir apparent, surpassing his great-great-grandfather Edward VII who waited for more than 59 years for Queen Victoria to die. Carl Gustaf XVI ascended to the Swedish throne on the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI on 15 September 1973, giving him a tally of 43 years and 28 days. He had been heir apparent since the age of four, after his father Prince Gustaf Adolf was killed in a plane crash when he was a baby. The Queen is already the longest-serving British monarch in history, having surpassed Queen Victoria’s tally of 63 years and 216 days last year. Her impressive stint is dwarfed, however, by the reign of Sobhuza II of Swaziland, whose period on the throne, from 1899 to 1982, overlapped with both the reign of Queen Victoria and the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. Having sired around 210 children by 70 wives in that time, he had more than 1,000 grandchildren at the time of his death."
2016-10-13T17:43:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Labour will continue to back Trident, shadow defence secretary says","Labour will continue to back the renewal of the Trident weapons system despite Jeremy Corbyn’s longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons, the new shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, has said. The Llanelli MP used an interview with British Forces Broadcasting to confirm she would not “shilly-shally” by seeking to change a policy reaffirmed by the Labour conference in 2015. A spokesman confirmed that meant not revisiting the party’s position on the issue before 2020. “I think we have to look where we are, we are already committed to trident going ahead and therefore we have to back that. We can’t be shilly-shallying about, a decision has been taken, that decision was actually taken back in 2007 and as I say that is an issue which we as a party have consistently voted to keep as our policy,” she said. Griffith added that instead of seeking to block Trident, which the House of Commons overwhelmingly backed in July, she would focus her efforts on multilateral disarmament.
“What we do need to do now, and there is a very strong mood for this, both within the Labour party and in the broader public, is really push forward on the multilateral nuclear disarmament, on the multilateral approach of bringing people together across the globe to try to make our world a safer place,” she said. Labour split three ways on the recent Trident motion, with Corbyn voting against, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and then shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, abstaining, and many Labour MPs backing renewal. Griffith took the role after Lewis was moved sideways into the business brief, following an embarrassing incident at the Labour conference where he appeared to react angrily when the wording of his speech on Trident was altered at the last minute.
Griffith’s appointment was widely seen at the time as a signal that Corbyn, who has campaigned against nuclear weapons for decades, was uncomfortable with Lewis’s pledge not to alter Labour policy before the 2020 general election. But she reaffirmed the commitment Lewis made not to revisit the issue. Meanwhile, Corbyn has announced more appointments to his frontbench, including the campaigning Dewsbury MP, Paula Sherriff, as the shadow member for women and equalities, and the MP for Birmingham Northfield, Richard Burden, who will be shadow transport secretary. Sherriff coordinated a letter from more than 40 of Labour’s female MPs in July, calling on Corbyn to do more to tackle “escalating hostility and abuse” within the party. Rosie Winterton, whose sacking as chief whip angered many Labour MPs, has accepted a job as Labour party envoy to sister parties across Europe in the run-up to Brexit, including acting as Labour’s representative in the Party of European Socialists, which brings together left-of-centre groups across Europe. “Rosie has a wealth of knowledge and experience and will be a real asset in helping the Labour party develop closer links with our sister parties around the world and I am absolutely delighted that she has agreed to serve in this important role for the Labour party,” Corbyn said, adding that he had asked her to accompany him on a trip to meet the Party of European Socialists next week. Asked whether the seven new appointments – plus Winterton’s post – meant Corbyn’s reshuffle was finally complete, a spokesman said there would be further announcements in the days ahead, including relieving of one of his two roles, as shadow Scotland and Northern Ireland secretaries. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, travelled to the giant BAE Systems shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria this month to see the first steel cut for the new Successor submarines, which will replace the ageing Vanguard fleet. The Labour MP for Barrow and Furness, John Woodcock, sometimes a vehement critic of Corbyn, welcomed Griffith’s statement. “This is very welcome and sensible from the new shadow defence secretary. Nia has taken over the brief in unusual and difficult times but she will generate much good will with this pragmatic recognition that the Trident decision has been taken,” he said."
2016-10-13T19:39:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Police brace for Operation Midland report as former suspects call for 'severe criticism',"Scotland Yard will publish the conclusions of a report into its heavily criticised investigation of child sexual abuse allegations against VIPs within weeks, an email from the force has disclosed. In an indication that the report will condemn police tactics, the Met’s commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has asked to meet one of the main suspects, who has now been cleared, before it is released. It comes as the force apologised to Lord Bramall, the former chief of the defence staff, over its investigation into allegations against him. The report’s publication will bring to an end one of the most embarrassing and much criticised inquiries ever conducted by a UK force. The inquiry, called Operation Midland, was based on claims from a single alleged victim known as Nick. He said he witnessed a group of powerful men in the 1970s and 80s abusing young boys in central London locations, such as a flat in the Dolphin Square block near Westminster.
Nick’s allegations centred on a number of figures in the establishment at the time. These included the former MP Harvey Proctor; Leon Brittan, a former home secretary; Bramall; Sir Edward Heath, the late prime minister; and the former heads of MI5 and MI6, all of whom were said to have been part of the savage paedophile ring, which was claimed to have killed three boys. An email sent on Thursday by Assistant Commissioner Helen King to Proctor says that Hogan-Howe received a draft of the report conducted by the retired judge Richard Henriques on 6 October. “Sir Richard anticipates that process will be completed fairly soon and that the report will be finalised by the end of the month at the latest,” King wrote. “Once the final report has been received, the Commissioner would welcome an opportunity to meet with you privately to discuss the report.” Nick claimed that Proctor stabbed one boy to death, assaulted another, and helped organise the death of a third boy who was subsequently run over by a car. Proctor was finally told he was no longer a suspect in March. The former MP for Billericay and Basildon said that Hogan-Howe’s invitation to meet had come as a surprise. “He has until now been keen to avoid me,” he said. “I hope this report will uncover the truth.”
It emerged earlier this month that the report will not be published in full, much to the anger of those accused. In an indication of the condemnation of police tactics within the report, King’s email adds that the report is still at the draft stage “because it is necessary to allow some of those who may be subject to criticisms to respond to that provisional criticism”. On Thursday, Lord Bramall spoke of his anger that his wife died before child sex abuse allegations against him were dropped. The 92-year-old D-Day veteran, whose home was raided by 22 officers in March last year while he had breakfast with Lady Bramall, told the Telegraph that he had now received an apology from Hogan-Howe. Hogan-Howe told him that there was no case against him “very early” but could not remove him from the inquiry for fear of being accused of not properly investigating the claims against him. “Sir Bernard has apologised for the search of the house. He said they should never have searched the house,” Bramall told the Telegraph. “The commissioner also apologised for the inordinately and unnecessarily long time they took to the complete the investigation, and the words they used to say they were taking no further action against me,” he said. Lord Bramall said that he did not want to see action taken against Nick, adding: “It wasn’t just Nick’s baseless and totally unbelievable claims that did the damage. It was the police taking notice of them. As I understand it, Sir Richard Henriques in his independent report will severely criticise the Metropolitan police, although I have not seen that report.” It took 16 months for the Met to conclude that there was no corroborative evidence to support lurid, horrific and, for some, extraordinary murder allegations from a single witness. Under scrutiny will be police tactics of working with journalists from the now-defunct website Exaro, and the announcement by a senior officer that Nick’s claims of rape and murder were “credible and true”. An earlier review by Dorset police found that the Met was right to investigate an allegation of rape against Brittan. The former home secretary died in January 2015, not knowing that police had concluded four months previously that he had no case to answer. The Met has said the Henriques review would consider concerns raised by Brittan’s widow, Lady Brittan, and Bramall. Hogan-Howe has met both of them in private to express “regret about the distress felt”. Henriques examined whether a policy that “the victim should always be believed” should be dropped. Hogan-Howe claimed that Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary had recommended such a move in 2014, but the HMIC’s head, Sir Tom Winsor, said Hogan-Howe had misunderstood its advice. Hogan-Howe said last month that the inquiry had no connection to his decision to retire early."
2016-10-14T07:26:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Former child abuse inquiry judge Lowell Goddard denies racism claims,"Dame Lowell Goddard, who resigned as chair of the UK’s public inquiry into institutional child abuse in August, has rejected as “a vicious campaign” reports that she made racist remarks and acted aggressively in the role. The Times reported on Friday that Goddard, a New Zealand judge who was appointed in February 2015 as the third person to head the troubled independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, was allegedly warned by officials about offensive remarks, including a claim that she had said high rates of child abuse in the UK were “because it has so many Asian men”.
In a statement issued on Friday, Goddard said the accusations were false and malicious. She said she had, through lawyers in London, informed the Times of “the falsity of the matters raised, and the malicious background to them”. She added: “I await the advice of my London lawyers on these articles, which I have only just seen. I confirm my absolute rejection of this attack. I am confident that in New Zealand my known reputation from my work over many years will provide its own refutation of these falsities. “I will be making no further statement and will not engage with those conducting this vicious campaign.” Following her resignation in August, Goddard refused requests to go before the House of Commons home affairs select committee to explain why she stepped down. The Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is campaigning to be chair of the committee, tweeted that the allegations against Goddard renewed MPs’ desire to quiz her.
Peter Saunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, who sits on the victims advisory panel for the review, said he was “distressed” by the allegations against Goddard, but suggested they were aimed at undermining the process. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “The [alleged] behaviour is not behaviour that I personally recognised with Justice Goddard in my dealings with her over many months.” He added: “There are people out there who most definitely want the the inquiry to fail. It has had far too many setbacks, it has had far too many people sniping at it.” Saunders insisted that the inquiry had “turned a big corner” in the last few weeks under Alexis Jay, its fourth chair in two years. He added: “It is about exposing the failures on an industrial scale in most of our institutions in this country, who failed children and who continue to fail children. That is why this inquiry is so desperately important.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The independent inquiry has a vital role to play in exposing the failure of public bodies and other major organisations to prevent child sexual abuse. We owe it to victims and survivors to get to the truth and the independent inquiry is continuing its vital work.” Goddard was appointed by the then home secretary, Theresa May, to succeed two previous chairs – Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf – who stepped aside after concerns were raised over their links to the establishment and potential conflicts of interest. Her abrupt resignation in August this year, claiming the inquiry was weighed down by a “legacy of failure”, prompted calls for a reassessment of its work and scope. The tenure of Goddard’s successor, Jay, has also been controversial, with lead counsel to the inquiry, Ben Emmerson, suspended in September after reported conflicts with the new chair. He quit the role soon afterwards."
2016-10-14T11:19:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow airport expansion backed by George Osborne,"The expansion of Heathrow airport has received its most explicit endorsement from a major Westminster political figure since the Airports Commission reported in 2015, after the former chancellor George Osborne said the economic case to build at the west London airport instead of Gatwick was “overwhelming”. While Osborne has long been thought to back Heathrow, ministers had carefully maintained the line that either of London’s biggest airports could be expanded, despite the commission’s recommendation. In a series of tweets, Osborne said it was time for a decision and it had to be Heathrow, to connect with the “northern powerhouse” and ensure the UK was open to global trade. He added: “If we want Britain to be outward-looking, free-trading and global, we must expand the great airport that connects us to that world & that trade.” Osborne, who has been careful to avoid public interventions since leaving government after the EU referendum in June, said Heathrow expansion should be prioritised over Gatwick “or else, in practice, nothing will get built”. “Time for a decision on airports and go for Heathrow,” the Conservative MP said. “Economic case overwhelming; connects Northern Powerhouse; ensures Britain is open to world.” He added: “We can consider Gatwick expansion. But not at the expense of Heathrow – and not in parallel – or else, in practice, nothing will get built.” A decision from the government on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick is expected as early as next Tuesday.
While no date has been confirmed, a cabinet subcommittee led by the prime minister, Theresa May, is widely believed to be meeting on 18 October to finally respond to the commission’s report. The commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, was established under the coalition government more than four years ago, and gave a “clear and unanimous” verdict in favour of building a third Heathrow runway soon after the last election. The runway would cost an estimated £17.6bn, plus at least £5bn to constuct new road and rail links outside the perimeter, the funding for which remains unresolved. The airport hopes it could build its runway by 2025. However, ministers have since almost entirely referred to Davies’s shortlist, delivered in 2013, which included a £7.1bn second runway at Gatwick airport as well as the Heathrow hub scheme, an alternative £13.5bn proposal for Heathrow to expand an existing runway. Last week, Heathrow was boosted by a memorandum of understanding signed with the Scottish government, which gave its backing to the third runway plan in return for guarantees over flights. But while the west London hub has the backing of trade unions, business, airlines and many MPs around Britain from all parties, expansion has proved politically toxic in London, with MPs in nearby seats – including cabinet ministers such as Justine Greening and May herself – representing constituents who are vehemently opposed to a new runway. That led to Gatwick returning to the frame, with the West Sussex airport consistently stressing that Heathrow was politically undeliverable. Any decision next week may prove only the start of a new battle. Legal challenges from nearby councils and environmental groups are expected, as well as protests. Many in the government are believed to think, like Osborne, that there is an urgency to expand, especially post-Brexit. But a consultation will follow that could highlight unresolved concerns over air quality, flight paths, surface access costs and night flights. Gatwick has said it will stand by even if Heathrow gets the go-ahead, in expectation that plans for a new runway may once again collapse before spades are in the ground."
2016-10-14T13:14:40Z,uk-news,UK news,First heterosexual civil partnership in British Isles celebrated,"The first opposite-sex couple in the British Isles to go through a civil partnership ceremony have celebrated their union in Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man. Adeline Cosson, 24, and Kieran Hodgson, 22, wanted to “keep it simple” rather than have a traditional wedding. They are considering getting married at a later date. Civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2004 for same-sex couples following lobbying by equal rights campaigners, are not available for heterosexual partners in the UK. A London couple, Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, are going to the court of appeal in November to argue that denying opposite-sex couples civil partnerships breaches their human rights. But the Isle of Man, which is not part of the UK and decriminalised gay sex in the 1990s, made civil partnerships available to everybody this summer. Hodgson, who was born on the Wirral but brought up on the Isle of Man from the age of six, and Cosson, who is from central France, are the first couple to take advantage of the new legal freedom. The ceremony was held mid-morning on Friday at the registry office in Douglas. She wore a velvet dress; he chose a velvet jacket. “We didn’t want to call it a marriage, we wanted to call it a civil partnership,” said Cosson, who works in a cafe. “We were told we were the first ever. We are very proud to do it. “The main thing was that we wanted to keep it simple. We are a young couple. We do want to get married one day but not now; at a later date. This gives us rights under the law. “It helps couples move forward without having to get married right now. To create full equality on the Isle of Man, they have allowed gay couples to get married but also to start civil partnerships.” She said she was surprised that the UK, which she had always regarded as adopting progressive policies, was denying most citizens the right to civil partnerships. “In France, everybody can get a civil partnership. A lot of people don’t want to get married. ‘Marriage’ is a big word. “I open doors [for men sometimes]. I believe in equality,” she said. “I live in my century.” Hodgson, who is a healthcare assistant at an Isle of Man hospital, said: “It’s a good idea.” Rather than him dropping down on one knee and proposing, they had talked about the idea, he said. “We decided together to do it. It was a short discussion.” The couple, who live in a flat in Douglas, held a celebration party with friends and family later on Friday. Jane Salter, the registrar who conducted the ceremony, said: “They are the first opposite-sex partners who have chosen a civil partnership. They were very happy and relaxed. It was just them and two witnesses. “It’s the same sort of ceremony as a wedding but we use different wording. We don’t refer to the ‘bride’ and ‘groom’. They can exchange rings, but this couple didn’t. They are now civil partners for life.” Salter said she was due to hold another civil partnership next week for a couple travelling from London to take advantage of the island’s more liberal laws. “I could become a real expert. It could be good for tourism here,” she said. Matt Hawkins, of the Equal Civil Partnerships Campaign, said: “I’m delighted to send congratulations to Adeline and Kieran. I hope that the joy they share in their civil partnership is one that many different-sex couples across the British Isles will soon be able to experience. “It seems remarkable that different-sex couples in Britain are now just a stone’s throw away from getting a civil partnership. Extending civil partnerships extends choice and gives couples who do not feel a marriage is right for them the chance to gain legal and financial protection for their relationship and, if they have any, their children. “With our 70,000 supporters, politicians backing us from every party, and endorsements from fantastic organisations, we are confident that that choice and opportunity will soon be extended and Adeline and Kieran’s example followed by couples across Britain.”"
2016-10-14T13:24:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Stansted promises fight if Gatwick and Heathrow both get new runways,"The owner of Stansted and Manchester airports is prepared to mount a legal challenge against the government if Theresa May approves the building of new runways at Gatwick and Heathrow next week. There has been speculation that ministers could take a surprise decision to give the green light to expansion at both airports on Tuesday, prompting Manchester Airports Group (MAG) to say it would fight the government in court. MAG, which owns Stansted, Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports, said the Airports Commission’s 2015 report by Sir Howard Davies had only fully examined the case for one new runway to be built before 2030, though it had concluded two would be needed to fulfil demand by 2050. Tim Hawkins, MAG’s corporate affairs director, told the Guardian his group would have no choice but to challenge the government if it decided to approve new runways at both Gatwick and Heathrow, because other airports had not been given the opportunity to present their own cases for the second phase of UK airport expansion post-2030.
Any decision to press ahead with both runways would be a major concern for other London and regional airports, Hawkins said. “If the government tries to make a decision about a second new runway at this point, we would almost certainly object, including by way of legal challenge,” he said. “The government would put us in a position where we basically had no choice. “We’re very clear there’s no evidence for the government to make a decision about more than one new runway. It’s going to need to run a further process before it can make that decision.”
Hawkins said the second phase of expansion should be widened to “include other options, including Stansted, including the loser of this process, probably, and others. There are a lot of other contenders for a second runway and we think the government knows this.” Calls for the government to commit to expansion of both airports have grown in recent weeks, including from the boss of Monarch airline group and editorials in both the Sun and the London Evening Standard. On Thursday, the trade publication New Civil Engineer reported it understood Downing Street was poised to give the nod to expansion at Heathrow immediately and also allow Gatwick to expand with a second runway within the next five years, as well as calling for an advancement of expansion plans at Birmingham airport. However, there was no additional detail to back up the assertion in the report. Earlier on Friday, George Osborne said the economic case to build a new runway at the west London airport instead of Gatwick was “overwhelming” and that Heathrow expansion should be prioritised over Gatwick “or else, in practice, nothing will get built”. In a series of tweets, the former chancellor said it was time for a decision and it had to be Heathrow, to connect with the “northern powerhouse” and ensure the UK was open to global trade. He added: “If we want Britain to be outward-looking, free-trading and global, we must expand the great airport that connects us to that world and that trade.” The commission reported that there was “likely to be sufficient demand to justify a second additional runway by 2050 or, in some scenarios, earlier”, though it said such further expansion would not necessarily be justified on environmental grounds. The commission said that it would be “premature” for it to consider post-2030 expansion plans, and cautioned that any new cases for additional expansion still “need to be closely scrutinised in the light of climate-change policy”. Hawkins said the Davies commission’s focus on the first phase of expansion meant its research had “excluded a whole load of options that could be relevant for the period post-2030”. “It hasn’t provided any evidence to government to be able to make a decision about those options,” he said.
“We’ve been really clear and consistent on this point with government and the commission and other stakeholders throughout the process, that this is a major concern to us – that this process that was focused on the period before 2030 but now the shortlist from this process could somehow be used to decide on a second new runway as well.” The government has thus far played down the possibility of building both runways, with the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, telling the Conservative party conference that building both was “not legally straightforward”.
In the House of Lords this week, Lord Bilimoria, the cross-bench peer and multimillionaire founder of Cobra beer, called on the government to build both runways. “We probably need both of them as, if one of the Heathrow options is chosen, the legal objections might drag on, and at least we would be able to get on with one airport in the meantime.” However, in his response, the aviation minister, Lord Ahmad, appeared to scotch rumours of dual expansion, telling the House of Lords that “the commission reported back on the need to increase capacity by 2030 with the addition of one runway in the south-east, and that is where the government’s decision is focused”. Any decision on airport expansion is likely to face considerable legal obstacles. On Tuesday, May’s local authority in her Maidenhead constituency revealed it is prepared to spend £50,000 on a judicial review if her government approves the expansion of Heathrow."
2016-10-14T16:15:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-IRA chief granted extended bail from Jean McConville trial,"A one-time senior IRA commander charged in connection with the murder and secret burial of a woman has been granted extended bail so he can celebrate his wedding anniversary outside Northern Ireland. Ivor Bell has been allowed to attend the celebration across the border in the Irish Republic later this month. The 79-year-old can now enjoy an anniversary break with his wife in Letterkenny, Co Donegal. A crown lawyer said on Friday he had no objections to Bell travelling across the border for the anniversary party. Bell faces two counts of soliciting the murder of Jean McConville, who was dragged out of her flat in Belfast in front of her children just before Christmas 1972. She was then bundled into a car, driven across the border, shot in the back of the head and buried in secret at a remote beach location in the Irish Republic. No one has been convicted of her murder. In Belfast crown court on Friday, the judge, Seamus Treacy, agreed to vary bail “in the manner that has been agreed and require the two sureties and Mr Bell to re-resign”. The prosecution had requested two bail sureties from Bell’s legal team before it was agreed he could travel out of the jurisdiction. The court was also told that medical experts have yet to examine Bell to decide if the veteran republican was fit to plead in the case. The case against Bell is based on the alleged content of recordings made for the Belfast Project for Boston College in the US. This was a controversial archive of former IRA and loyalist activists who recorded their paramilitary activities during the Troubles. Participants in the project were promised none of the recorded material would be released until they were dead. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland successfully pursued the tapes through courts in the US and now have access to them. The PSNI did so as it was conducting a number of historical criminal investigations including the killing of McConville. It is alleged that Bell gave information about the murder in one of the project interviews. The McConville case is one of the most controversial murders of the early Troubles as it allegedly implicates a number of senior republicans with the killing and with the IRA policy of “disappearing” dozens of people accused of informing for the British army and the police. One former Belfast IRA commander, ex-hunger striker Brendan Hughes, claimed on the oral history project that the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, gave the order that McConville be killed and then disappeared, with republicans spreading the legend that instead of being murdered she had abandoned her 10 children for a British soldier and went off to live in England. Adams has consistently denied any knowledge of the McConville murder or being in the IRA. The IRA only admitted it had murdered McConville – whom it accused of being an informer – in 1999. Despite a long campaign by her children and their supporters to locate her body, her remains were found by accident in August 2003 when a man walking his dog on Shelling beach in Co Louth came across the site where the IRA had hidden her. The case against Bell has been adjourned until another hearing on 18 November."
2016-10-14T18:08:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Anti-Heathrow MPs plan to thwart government over third runway,"An alliance of MPs opposed to the expansion of Heathrow, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, are plotting to undermine the anticipated government approval of a third runway. They are set to argue that the “real decision” will only come next year, when parliament votes on a national planning statement to expand the west London airport. Gatwick’s hopes of getting permission to increase capacity alongside Heathrow were further dented on Friday as the owner of Stansted, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), promised to mount a legal challenge if more than one runway were approved.
Earlier on Friday, the former chancellor George Osborne broke his silence to back Heathrow and oppose the simultaneous construction of a runway at Gatwick. An announcement on the location of a new runway is expected as early as Tuesday. A cross-party group of MPs and peers has already met privately to discuss tactics, with McDonnell and Goldsmith agreeing to portray the economic affairs (airports) subcommittee’s choice as only a staging post on the way to the final decision. The opponents, who include Liberal Democrat peers and Labour and Conservative London MPs, hope that a year of public consultation, with accompanied legal challenges and heightened protests, will convince MPs that a third runway at Heathrow is undeliverable. It could also allow Goldsmith to remain an MP for longer to fight expansion, without breaking his pledge to trigger a byelection once a decision on expansion is made. The government has not yet decided whether to hold an early poll on a pro-Heathrow motion, instead of waiting for the final vote on the national planning statement. Nor has it determined whether or not to whip Conservative MPs to back its decision. The prime minister, Theresa May, is under pressure from ministers, including the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, not to offer her backbenchers a free vote, which some believe would appear weak and create a damaging precedent. The subcommittee, which May chairs, will meet to formally respond to the report of the airports commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, established under the coalition government more than four years ago. In July 2015, it gave a “clear and unanimous” verdict in favour of building a third runway at Heathrow, costing an estimated £17.6bn. But ministers have since almost entirely referred to Davies’ shortlist, delivered in 2013, which included a £7.1bn second runway at Gatwick, as well as the Heathrow hub scheme, an alternative £13.5bn proposal for Heathrow to expand an existing runway.
Suggestions that Heathrow and Gatwick could both be allowed to expand have been played down by ministers, with Grayling saying it would not be “legally straightforward”. The commission concluded that a second UK runway would be needed to fulfil demand by 2050. Tim Hawkins, MAG’s corporate affairs director, told the Guardian that it would have no choice but to challenge the government, because other airports had not been given the opportunity to present their case for expansion. Osborne’s backing for Heathrow was the most explicit endorsement from a major Westminster figure since the commission reported. He said the economic case to build at Heathrow instead of Gatwick was “overwhelming”.
While the former chancellor has long been thought to favour Heathrow, ministers had carefully maintained the line that either of London’s biggest airports could be expanded. Last week, Heathrow agreed a memorandum of understanding signed with the Scottish government, which gave its backing to the third runway plan in return for guarantees regarding flights. While Britain’s busiest airport has the support of trade unions, businesses, airlines and many MPs from all parties, expansion has proved politically toxic in London, with MPs in nearby seats, including the education secretary, Justine Greening, and May representing constituents who are vehemently opposed to a new runway. Legal challenges from surrounding councils and environmental groups are expected, as well as protests. Many in the government are thought to believe that there is an urgency to expand, especially since the Brexit vote. A consultation will follow the decision, which could highlight unresolved concerns over air quality, flight paths, surface access costs and night flights. Gatwick has said it will stand by in readiness even if Heathrow gets the go ahead, in expectation that preparations for a new runway may again collapse before work begins."
2016-10-14T18:48:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Jermaine Baker shooting: IPCC 'failed to hold Met to account',"The family of Jermaine Baker, who was shot dead by police last year, have accused the IPCC of betraying them and failing to hold the Metropolitan police to account over the shooting. Baker, 28, was shot dead by a Met firearms officer in north London on 11 December 2015. He was sitting in a car with two other men and was believed to have been planning to help a prisoner who was being brought to Wood Green crown court to escape. Five men, including the two in the car who survived the police shooting, were later convicted of an attempt to break a criminal out of a prison van. Baker was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car and was pronounced dead at the scene. A replica Uzi was found on the floor next to back seat. Baker was unarmed at the time he was fatally shot. Margaret Smith, 48, Baker’s mother, speaking to the Guardian in her first newspaper interview, said she was struggling to come to terms with the loss of her beloved son.
Smith said that initially she and other family members were building a relationship with the IPCC but now that relationship has been severely damaged. “The IPCC has failed me and my family,” she said. The family’s concerns about the IPCC relate to the commanding officer in the police operation that resulted in Baker being shot dead. On 4 October 2016, the officer, a Met tactical firearms commander, known as FE16, who was facing an IPCC allegation of gross misconduct in relation to his briefing of the firearms officers in the operation that led to Jermaine’s death, retired from the police. As a result, he will avoid the possibility of disciplinary proceedings and sanction for any part his alleged failings may have played in Jermaine’s death. He is not the police officer who fired the fatal shot. The Met firearms officer who fired the fatal shot is under criminal caution, with decisions pending on whether he will face a criminal trial. The family has called on the IPCC chairwoman, Dame Anne Owers, to meet with them to address those concerns. Initially the IPCC indicated that they would support legal action to prevent the police officer from retiring before the allegations against him could be investigated, but then they later decided that they would not support the family’s legal action. The family took the legal action alone but the judge ruled that the officer should not be prevented from retiring. He has now retired. Baker’s family say that the IPCC U-turn undermined their case. Smith said that although her son was shot dead by police in the morning of 1 December last year the family were not notified of his death until the evening. “I just knew he was dead even before we were told,” she said. “He used to message me a lot but that day I heard nothing from him all day and knew that something was wrong. Jermaine was a lovely boy. He used to visit his grandmother every day and help her out. He adored animals especially dogs and when he was younger he used to bring stray dogs home and asked me to look after them. He was a painter and decorator by trade, not a gang member as was initially stated. “He had some minor convictions but I knew nothing about his involvement with the plan to release the man from the prison van. Jermaine should have been put on trial for that and if he had been found guilty he should have been sent to prison but he should not have been shot dead by police. He was unarmed when he was shot dead. We are fighting for answers. This case cannot end the way all the other cases involving people who have died at the hands of the police have ended.” Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, which is supporting Baker’s family, condemned the IPCC for failing to take legal action against the Metropolitan police. “When the IPCC refused to take legal action to prevent the officer’s retirement, they refused to do their job and abandoned a grieving family to do it instead. “We need a police investigation body that protects the public by deterring misconduct and holding police to account. The IPCC has failed not only the Baker family, but all victims of alleged misconduct, all bereaved families and the wider public.” IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: “The IPCC supported the view of Mr Baker’s family that the officer should have been suspended to prevent his retirement, but the force declined our repeated requests to do so, leaving a legal challenge as the only option available. “At the time of the first hearing, our assessment of the allegations against the officer, was such that if proven, those allegations were likely to amount to gross misconduct meaning he could face dismissal. On that basis, we believed the judicial review could be successful. In the lead-up to the second hearing our analysis of the evidence continued so that the position had changed and it was the investigator’s opinion that the allegations, if proved, would meet the lower threshold of misconduct only and could not lead to dismissal. At that point we immediately notified all parties concerned. “While I understand this change in position and our subsequent decision was extremely disappointing for Mr Baker’s family, it would be irresponsible for the IPCC to pursue a legal challenge with very little prospect of success. We are now focusing on bringing our investigation to a conclusion in the very near future and considering whether any officer should face a potential criminal charge or disciplinary hearing.” The family’s solicitor, Michael Oswald of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, said: “It is very disappointing to see the IPCC attempting to avoid responsibility for its actions by issuing this statement, which is so patently misleading. The reality is reflected in a statement from the investigator who undertook the ‘analysis of the evidence’ to which Butts refers. “That statement, which was provided to the court on 30 September 2016, states clearly that in the investigator’s view there ‘was and remains an indication of gross misconduct’ and that the outcome of an outstanding investigative action could result in a case to answer for gross misconduct.”"
2016-10-15T09:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,'He was very scared': the death of a teenage stowaway,"The death of Raheemullah Oryakhel, a 14-year-boy from Afghanistan, was marked last month with just a couple of paragraphs in the French press, under the headline “One migrant dead on the port ring road”. There was nothing much to excite further interest; the boy was the 12th refugee to die in Calais this year. The news item added that Raheemullah’s body had been found on the N216, on a stretch of motorway where a number of migrants had previously been run over. Police said he had probably been hit by a car. Whoever was behind the wheel had not bothered to stop. Nor are the details of Raheemullah’s death particularly shocking to the handful of relatives and acquaintances he left behind in the Calais camp, a fetid, cramped cluster of sagging donated tents and roughly built wooden shacks, now home to an estimated 9,000 asylum seekers. The idea that vulnerable children, some as young as eight, who have mostly fled conflict zones, should spend night after night trying to leap on to moving vehicles, in a desperate (and mostly futile) attempt to reach the UK, surprises no one. It’s a risky business. Sometimes people get suffocated in the trucks, or frozen in refrigerated containers; sometimes they choose a different route and drown trying to swim to England or get electrocuted on the railway. And sometimes they just get run over. But there is sadness and some bitterness at the driver’s failure to stop, and at the apparently cursory nature of the police investigation. Abdul Wali, an older camp resident who helped raise more than €4,000 (£3,516) to send Raheemullah’s body back to his parents, says, “Even in Afghanistan, if someone is hit by a car, at least the driver will take him to a police station or hospital and say sorry. Here, people are dying and no one cares.” Raheemullah is probably the youngest asylum seeker to die yet, but his death epitomises the risks that hundreds are taking every night on the roads outside Calais. As the French government prepares to dismantle the camp next week, aiming to disperse its residents around the country instead, the sense of urgency surrounding the mission to get to the UK has intensified. It is an intolerable situation for everyone involved: the lorry drivers, Calais residents, local police (who are exhausted by nightly patrols) and, most of all, for the camp’s population.
The last person to see Raheemullah alive was almost certainly his friend Karim, also 14, who was trying to pull him on to the top of a moving lorry shortly before dawn on Friday 16 September. “I was saying, ‘Give me your hand’ but he didn’t,” Karim says. “He didn’t listen.” It was a terrifying few minutes, in total darkness. One second his friend was there, the next he was gone. Until recently, Karim (an assumed name to avoid anything that might complicate his asylum claim, should he ever be in a position to make one) was showing anyone he met a photograph of his dead friend, taken in the Lille morgue, looking as bad as you might expect after a fatal road accident. Volunteers who have stepped in to help with the hundreds of children at the camp have since persuaded him to delete the image from his phone. They know Karim is devastated, but have little at their disposal to cheer him up. One volunteer took him out of the camp for an ice-cream; another took him to the donations warehouse and got him a new pair of socks. Because the French authorities are unwilling to recognise the camp, there is no UN presence here, and no mainstream children’s charity on site; the 800 or so parentless children (a third of them from Afghanistan) are left largely to look after themselves. Volunteers with groups such as Help Refugees do their best, but are dismayed at the hopeless inadequacy of what they can offer. “We have a severely traumatised child,” one says, “and what can we do? We say: ‘Your friend’s dead, he’s been squashed, have an ice-cream.’ It’s awful.” Two weeks after the accident, Karim sits on a wooden pallet at the edge of the camp and explains how he and Raheemullah came to be on the motorway before dawn that night. The two boys had walked for an hour along the high barbed-wire fencing that separates the camp from the road, to a spot where other asylum seekers had dragged some wooden logs into the centre of the road, forcing lorries to slow down.
Both had made frequent night-time attempts to get to England together. Karim has been in the camp since January, trying most nights to make his way across the Channel. Raheemullah, who came from the same part of Afghanistan, arrived in July, and the two became friends. Most evenings they played cricket and volleyball on the wasteland beside the motorway. “He was a good friend,” Karim says. “I liked him very much.” They found a crowd of people hoping to push their way on to the stream of heavy goods vehicles as they slowed to navigate the obstacles. Karim and Raheemullah followed two older men, climbing on to the axle between the driver’s cab and the container section of the lorry. Karim managed to get on to the top of the container, but Raheemullah was still on the ledge between the cab and the rest of the truck when it began to gather speed. Karim says the lorry started swerving abruptly, as if trying to shake off the uninvited passengers. He leaned over the edge, offering his friend his hand. “Why didn’t he take it?” he asks. No one knows quite what happened next. One of the older men cut a small hole in the roof of the truck (a black vehicle with an enormous red logo on the side, Karim says). Karim lowered himself through it into the container, which held a consignment of swivelling office chairs, and hid there as the truck continued to the port. Some time later, he was discovered by port officials before the truck drove on to the ferry. When he returned to the camp, he discovered his friend was missing. *** Raheemullah lived in the camp in a windowless chipboard hut with his first cousin, Wahid, 23, and two other men. No one has moved his belongings, a few clothes stored in plastic bags. The grubby brown blanket and mattress where he slept for the last two and a half months of his life are still there. Wahid is better able to articulate the loss and anger he feels about his cousin’s death. He speaks good English, having spent three years at secondary school in Norwich, after fleeing the Taliban when he was 14. He was taken in by a foster family, made friends, studied hard, took a part-time job in a Chinese takeaway – and then, at 17 and a half, his case was reconsidered and he was told he would be deported back to Afghanistan, which the Home Office categorises as a safe destination. He spent some time trying to appeal, but left for Europe rather than be sent back. There are many young Afghan men, with fluent English, in a similar situation in Calais. Wahid’s friend Abdul went to school in Birmingham (also after being threatened by the Taliban), before being told at 17 that he was no longer eligible to remain in England. Both hope to return to the UK, which is the place they consider home, to appeal for leave to stay.
Wahid was shocked to see his cousin, whom he had not seen since he was a child, arrive in the camp. While ambivalent about Raheemullah’s determination to get to England, given his own mixed experiences, Wahid didn’t try to dissuade him. “It was not my job to tell him how to decide his life.” Instead, he invited him to come and share his hut. Raheemullah had travelled alone from Afghanistan, and been badly beaten by Bulgarian police; he was relieved to find someone to protect him. For a month, they went out together five nights a week, to try to jump on a lorry. “In the beginning he was happy,” Wahid says. “He said it was good fun. Slowly he realised it was not easy, that it was risky. Sometimes I’d say, let’s go tonight, and he’d say, ‘No, tomorrow.’ I knew he didn’t want to go. He was very scared. It’s a one-hour walk in the dark. You feel scared of the French people. You worry that if they see you alone, maybe they will beat you. Sometimes there are 100 people by the road, trying to get into the lorries. People are pushing. Of course someone is going to fall over and get hit.”
Wahid was also aware the camp wasn’t a safe place for Raheemullah. “That’s why I said, ‘The sooner you can go from here, the better.’ There is fighting between the Sudanese and the Afghans, between the Afghans and the Afghans – for no reason, just because of the tension here. It gets boring. You sleep, wake up, sleep, wake up. You can’t shower for a week. People are desperate. It is not a good place for anyone, especially not a child.” He feels anger at how slow the British response has been. Raheemullah had an older brother in Manchester, and was in theory eligible to join him in the UK; but the process for organising reunification is very slow, bureaucratic and hard to understand. It is not clear how much his brother was able to help with the application, or if the papers had even been lodged. Charities estimate there are 300 to 400 unaccompanied children in Calais with relatives in the UK; but even in straightforward cases, the legal process takes between five and 10 months, during which time the children often give up waiting and start making the nightly journey to the motorway instead. Security has been increased around the port, so that finding a way in has become harder and much more dangerous. Work has recently begun on a £1.9m, 1km-long wall to block off the dual carriageway, half-funded by the UK. Although French president François Hollande has committed to clearing the camp by the end of the year, there is scepticism about how easy it will be to find homes for everyone. Officials believe that people will stay on, and the barriers will still be needed. “Why are you spending the money on building a wall?” Abdul wonders, sitting with Wahid in a caravan that serves as a clothes distribution point, donated tracksuits piled up on the surfaces. “You are wasting money. If they hadn’t built these fences, people wouldn’t risk their lives.” Wahid and Raheemullah managed to get on lorries together three times, but each time were pulled off at the border by officials with sniffer dogs. “The police were nice with him. And, because of him, they were nice with me as well. They take you to the front of the port and say, ‘Go back to the jungle.’” Early last month, Wahid hurt his back badly after his friends put a heavy box over him to hide him inside a lorry. “I was under it for eight hours. I couldn’t stand [it] any more, so I left.”
When Raheemullah suggested he come with him early on the morning of 16 September, Wahid said no: his back was too painful. “I told him to be careful. He knew it was very dangerous.” The next morning, when it became obvious Raheemullah was missing, a youth worker from the camp visited local hospitals and police stations to look for him. Later, Wahid went to the morgue to identify the body. Raheemullah’s face was so badly damaged, he was unrecognisable, except for his clothes and a distinctive mark on his arm. Wahid thinks his cousin wasn’t strong enough to pull himself up on to the roof. “He was young, he had no muscles.” Wahid spoke to his uncle, Raheemullah’s father, in Afghanistan, but found himself unable to break the news. “They asked what happened, and I said, ‘He is injured.’ I told them a lie. His parents are quite old. I didn’t want to hurt them.” He assumes their older son called later, from Manchester, to tell them. Since the body arrived back in Afghanistan, accompanied by another relative who came from Norway to travel with the coffin, Raheemullah’s parents have called again to ask how their son died. The calls are distressing: “They keep ringing me. I say, ‘You don’t need to know. He is dead.’ Why make them more upset?” It is still unclear why Raheemullah’s parents sent their son 4,000 miles across Europe to try to start a new life in England. Wahid isn’t forthcoming; his own experiences of hostile questioning by the Home Office have made him wary of the question and he will say only that “it wasn’t an economic problem. There was a danger for him.” But Karim thinks the absence of work in postwar Afghanistan was a factor. “He was going to send money to his family. His father was an old man – he couldn’t work. No one wants to go to England, but if they have problems at home, that’s why they go.” Whatever the reason, the decision to send a child away is never taken lightly, Wahid says. “Of course they will be wishing with their hearts now that they hadn’t. They didn’t know he was going to die.” His own advice to other parents now is not to send their children to Europe, but there is often a reluctance to listen. On the whole, children do not tell their parents about the difficulties they have encountered, so an unrealistic perception prevails. “Life [in Afghanistan] is very hard. There’s Isis and the Taliban, and no security. They don’t know anything about the situation in Calais. The parents don’t know about the risks.” Abdul has become equally firm. “I have five brothers. They call me and ask, shall we come? I say, if you come, you will sleep in the street. Please don’t waste your time.” Volunteers attempt to persuade refugees to claim asylum in France, rather than wasting months and risking their lives trying to get to the UK. They point out that – particularly for young people from Afghanistan – it makes more sense to remain in France, because there is less risk of being deported when they approach 18. But it is hard to persuade children whose parents have paid large sums of money to dispatch them across Europe. People smugglers operating in the camp also have a vested interest in encouraging others to get to the UK, otherwise their business model disappears. Increasing numbers of camp residents have applied for asylum in France; it is now largely those with relatives in the UK who persist in their attempts to join them. But many of those children who decide to stay in France are told there is no room for them in the nearby emergency shelter, which is turning away between 15 and 35 children a day, so they remain in a dangerous limbo. No one knows where the children will be sent once the camp is shut down. Wahid believes any investigation into his cousin’s death has already been closed. No one has come to look for witnesses in the camp. He made one visit to the police station when he was searching for Raheemullah, where he says the police officer was rude; he is reluctant to go again because of his illegal status in France. “They don’t care who has died. To them, we’re just illegal migrants, ‘jungly people’.” The prosecutor’s office of Boulogne-sur-Mer did not respond to emailed requests for details of the police investigation. Meanwhile, a minute’s silence was held for Raheemullah in the camp at the end of September. Friends who spent time with him in the Kids’ Cafe, a wooden hut serving free food to unaccompanied children, say he was shyer than most. Mary Jones, an English volunteer who runs the cafe, describes him as “very quiet and polite”. He attended some of the English lessons given by volunteers, who remember him as “reserved, in a well-brought up way” and “very determined in everything he did, especially learning English”. If Raheemullah’s death failed to register more widely in France, it has had a quiet but significant impact in the UK – both positive and negative. Some of the news reporting prompted delight among the more extreme anti-immigration voices on Twitter (even to hardened eyes, to respond to this death by typing tweets such as “Can’t they show it happening I would enjoy watching it one less to worry about” goes beyond the normal parameters of nastiness).
More constructive was the decision by a group of Conservative MPs to write to home secretary Amber Rudd, calling on her to do more to help reunite children such as Raheemullah with their families. The letter, signed by former education secretary Nicky Morgan and nine others, told Rudd that Raheemullah had “a legal right to be with his brother” but that, “having waited for months in wretched conditions”, he “took fate into his own hands with devastating consequences”. It was discussed at last month’s Labour party conference, too, by Alf Dubs, the kindertransport child refugee and Labour peer, who in May forced the government to accept an amendment to the Immigration Act, agreeing to give homes to some of the estimated 88,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers in Europe. Since his amendment was passed, none of the qualifying children has arrived in the UK. At a conference fringe meeting, Dubs dropped his determination to be politely cooperative with the government, describing them as “bloody liars” for failing to act. As the demolition date approaches, concern about the fate of unaccompanied children is rising, but a solution has yet to be found. Last time French police attempted to demolish the camp, 129 children went missing, according to Help Refugees. Karim has promised volunteers that he won’t try climbing on lorries again, but they suspect he is still going every night anyway. On Monday, Rudd told parliament that she wanted to speed up the transfer of those children with family in the UK, and that Britain would help to fund a shelter in France for children whose cases needed longer consideration. She promised to cut the bureaucracy involved, but there were no details of how many children would be given sanctuary here, and when they could arrive. Meanwhile, the bald list of “registered migrant deaths” compiled by the local police grows longer, with a 13th death in late September and a 14th death last Sunday. This year’s toll includes: “a migrant whose sex could not be identified at the time of the discovery of the body, found drowned in Calais port”; “an Afghan migrant, 22 years, hit by an HGV on the A16 just before 6am”; “body of a migrant found dead around 7am near the port bypass – injuries suggest this migrant was hit by a vehicle”; “a Sudanese migrant, 30 years, hit by a freight train on the railway, close to the port bypass”; “a migrant of unknown nationality on the A16 at the A47 interchange. No witness.” Raheemullah’s death is there, recorded succinctly: “Around 5:30am, the lifeless body of a migrant found on the port ring road.”"
2016-10-15T12:14:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May Brexit strategy could depend on giving London more autonomy,"Theresa May has rightly read the Brexit vote as a popular revolt against metropolitan trendies like David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn and every other variant of the species. Given the chance to poke the whole pack of us in the eye, what with our “progressive” values and smug, big city ways, Leavers seized it with Faragist glee. The prime minister has taken their cue. Disastrous, disordered and unlovely it may be, but her Brexit stance has, at least for now, caught the mood and achieved the substantial feat of making the Labour leader and his coterie look even more clueless than they did already. But May presumably also knows that the path she’s set could lead to economic calamity. For now, she can afford a bit of that: prosperous Outers may be ready to be a little worse off for a while in return for their hoped-for reassertion of their idea of their country’s true identity; the less prosperous who voted Leave, many of whom don’t normally vote at all, have low expectations about everything anyway. Even so, May won’t want to preside over too steep or too ugly a decline. With Keir Starmer on the case, even Her Majesty’s Opposition might help make something useful out of it. That is why May badly needs the very things the Brexit vibe she’s milking most reviles. London, like it or not - and this is hardly ideal - is the key to UK financial health. Globalised, multicultured and full of immigrants, it powered through the last recession as the rest of proud Britannia flailed. At the last count, London was generating £364bn of the UK’s £1,590bn annual economic output – a massive 23% of it, with the surrounding south east of England contributing a further 15%. Between 2010 and 2014, London’s economy grew by 6.8% compared with 4.4% for the UK as a whole. London’s workers’ output is 73% above the average. When Brexit darling Boris Johnson wrote three years ago that “we can no longer blame Brussels” for our problems and should look instead at our own “sloth” – especially when compared with “the Germans” – he might have named the labour force of the city he (loosely-speaking) led as mayor at the time as an exception. Britons who fear and loathe London and all it symbolises in their eyes might note that taxes raised in the capital help fund their public transport, their affordable housing, their health services, their schools, their police officers and the upkeep of their public footpaths and parks. Almost one third of UK taxes are raised in London. A report compiled for Johnson found that the equivalent of £2,500 per Londoner subsides the rest of the UK every year. So here’s an irony: even as the PM endorses the disruption of all that is integral to the nation’s capital – its international business links, its receptiveness to foreign incomers, its resulting cultural variety - she is to draw more deeply from its well of wealth. A revaluation of business rates looks set to increase London’s tax bill by an average of 11% - amounting to more than £700m - while in most of the rest of England rates will go down. Johnson’s successor at City Hall, Sadiq Khan, has called this a “kick in the teeth” for the capital. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned of the dangers of London business being seen as a cash cow. The Institute for Fiscal Studies comments from a wider angle: “It will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole”. Here is the intensifying context for the continuing debates about giving London government and those of other big city regions greater autonomy. No one is demanding a bigger piece of the pie, just more control over the piece they have. Regional, rather than Whitehall, decisions about transport infrastructure, housing, schools and skills training should mean better results, with social and economic gains to follow. Progress in that direction had already been made in the form of new, executive “metro” mayoralties for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region and the West Midlands. Inaugural elections will take place next year. The victors will be looking for more powers to be sent their way. In London, Khan is pressing for post-Brexit arrangements that will help the capital, which voted 60-40 to Remain, to maintain its status as a city that is “open for business”, including the creation of a London-only work visa. Some of his critics, still truffling for imagined un-Britishness in the born-and-bred Tooting boy, imply that in so doing he seeks to subvert the national will. Well London, didn’t want what “Good old Boris” helped them get, and other big cities felt much the same way. They are the very parts of Britain the prime minister must help to better help themselves if Britain is to survive her Brexit strategy. She needs London. She’d be wise to give the capital what it needs too. Dave Hill is the author of Zac versus Sadiq: the Fight to Become London Mayor, available from the Guardian Bookshop."
2016-10-15T23:05:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Controversial garden bridge to cost public total of £50m – even if it fails to go ahead,"London’s controversial garden bridge will cost taxpayers £50m – enough to construct almost three millennium bridges across the Thames – if it is not built. A letter from a senior Department for Transport official reveals that £50.5m – far more than previously thought – will be wasted, either because it has already been spent or will need to be paid in cancellation costs, regardless of whether any construction work takes place. The National Audit Office last week warned that nearly £23m of taxpayer money was at risk of being lost if the project was cancelled. The total cost of the millennium bridge near St Paul’s cathedral was £18.2m, £2m over budget. The letter, sent on 24 May by the permanent secretary of the DfT, Philip Rutnam, to then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, raises “reservations” over the project and cites “a number of significant risks to the delivery of the project”. Rutnam, the DfT’s accounting officer, reveals that cancellation costs to the public sector of up to £15m combined with “sunk costs of around £13.5m committed by DfT and £22m by Tfl” mean that more than £50m will be lost if the contentious bridge fails to go ahead. Rutnam also reveals that he has long had serious concerns about the scheme’s viability: “After examining the business case for the project in summer 2014, my judgment was that the transport benefits of the project were limited and came with a relatively high level of risk to value for money.” He is the latest person to criticise the project, whose opponents claim that a £75m funding gap exists between the garden bridge’s estimated costs and the level of private investment in the project. Another major obstacle is that the Garden Bridge Trust has still to acquire the land needed on the South Bank, although it remains hopeful that construction will start next year. A further problem is that planning consent requires the mayor of London to underwrite the bridge’s annual running costs, and Sadiq Khan has refused to commit any more public money to the project. Scepticism over the viability of the scheme also raises uncomfortable questions for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson who, as mayor of London, was accused of sidestepping normal protocol and usual checks to ensure that the bridge – the brainchild of actor Joanna Lumley, who has known Johnson since he was a child – went ahead. Michael Ball, of pressure group Thames Central Open Spaces, said: “As mayor in 2013, Boris outrageously pushed aside quasi-legal procurement processes designed to protect the public purse, simply in order to get his pet project going. “However, this project is fatally flawed and has proved incapable of delivery – but not before Boris has effectively thrown away £50m of public funding. He should pay for it personally.” Dan Andersen, of property consultancy Fourth Street, said he was doubtful whether the project could make up the funding shortfall. He said: “Maybe they can charm a few £1m or £2m donations from some wealthy benefactors. But you can’t close a £60m gap with small donations. They need at least two or three very large £10m-plus donations to come in or they will never get over the line. And I can’t fathom who would make that kind of contribution to a project that seems to lurch from one controversy to another. The garden bridge is very quickly becoming radioactive.” The Garden Bridge Trust said that “nearly all pre-commencement planning conditions” had been satisfied, along with pre-construction work and advanced negotiations on land deals. It also said that £129m of funding had been raised and that the project had “a strong donor pipeline”. They added: “Trustees will decide when to start construction. Many projects start construction without all funds raised, such as the Tate Modern and the Olympic park. We need to be sure we have between 75% and 80% pledged before we start. We are not far from this figure.”"
2016-10-16T06:00:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Gatwick’s the best choice in many ways, but a Heathrow Hub fudge could sweeten the deal","David Cameron is gone, and his “no ifs, no buts” rejection of a third runway at Heathrow is not binding on his successor. Boris Johnson, no longer mayor of London and told to be on best behaviour at the Foreign Office, has gone conspicuously quiet on Heathrow, where he once he threatened to lie down in front of bulldozers. Now no one even expects him to resign from the cabinet if the airport expansion gets a green light. We’ll learn the truth as soon as next week but the rumour mill sounds correct. Theresa May will say yes to a third runway and will spout some banalities, straight from the airport’s PR handbook, about how only Heathrow can deliver those connections to deepest China, India and Latin America that the UK will need to prosper in a post-Brexit world. Thus she will buy a short period of peace from the Heathrow-loving business lobby that is currently hopping mad about everything from “hard” Brexit to workers on boards. It will be the wrong decision. Gatwick is the better choice on four grounds: cost, certainty, competition and pollution. On cost, the Airports Commission priced a third runway at Heathrow at £17.6bn, versus £7.1bn for a second runway at Gatwick. The money would be raised privately, of course, but the bill will ultimately fall on customers in the form of higher landing charges. But the cost estimate has to be taken with a pinch of salt when you consider the second factor. The only guaranteed arrival following approval for a third runway is that of a swarm of lawyers. The public inquiries and judicial reviews would last for years. By contrast, work on expanding Gatwick could start by the end of the decade, and with less fuss. The competition angle is crucial. The old BAA was privatised by the Thatcher government with a monopoly over London airports – Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. That structure is now seen as utterly mad. Smashing that monopoly in 2009, on the orders of the Competition Commission, encouraged competition, fuelled investment in Heathrow and Gatwick under separate owners, and made the flying experience less unpleasant. A third runway at Heathrow would make it harder for Gatwick to compete in the long-haul market; some of its short-haul traffic could even head to the larger airport. On pollution, relatively rural Gatwick is plainly the better choice: there are fewer homes there. At the time the commission was writing, the area around Heathrow was already breaching European regulations on nitrogen dioxide pollution. Sir Howard Davies’s panel nevertheless preferred a third runway at Heathrow because its established status as a hub makes it better-placed to deliver more routes to more places. The benefits, it said, are “significantly greater, for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy.” That is almost certainly true in a world of theoretical economical modelling. In the real world, Gatwick is simply more likely to happen. If May wanted to attempt to square the circle, an alternative suggestion has been gaining popularity in some quarters: approve a second runway at Gatwick but give Heathrow permission to proceed with the first stage of the lower-cost idea of extending the existing northern runway. This is the “Heathrow Hub” proposal and one of its advantages is that extra capacity could be phased in: the extended runway could handle 70,000 additional aircraft movements a year while still using existing terminals. Expansion beyond that would require more infrastructure, but could be left for another day. The cost of phase one would also be relatively low – less than £4bn, say the backers. Some of the same legal complexities would apply, but at least Gatwick would be happening and competition between the airports would be preserved. A joint Gatwick/Heathrow Hub ticket would be a fudge, or course. But solving this interminable problem question of airport capacity has always involved imperfect compromises. William Hill merger deal leaves no one holding an ace Less than a week after it was unveiled to surprised shareholders, William Hill’s proposed £6bn merger with Canadian-listed Amaya looks dead in the water. The bookmaker’s biggest investor, Parvus Asset Management, holding a 14% stake, is fiercely and loudly opposed. Former chief executive Ralph Topping, who is still revered at William Hill as the man who outpaced Ladbrokes by several furlongs, also can’t see the logic. “When this deal was announced I was left scratching my head,” Topping told the FT. “I’m very anxious on the future of William Hill.” The sceptics are right. Amaya is an online poker company carrying a pile of debt. While, in theory, some of the players on its PokerStars website might be persuaded to have a flutter on William Hill’s online sports offering, any precise projection is guesswork. What is certain is that the combined group’s borrowings would rise well beyond levels William Hill has previously deemed prudent. There is also the small matter of Amaya’s $870m (£713m) penalty for alleged breaches of Kentucky gambling law. The fine will probably end up being reduced, but by how much? Gareth Davis, William Hill’s chairman, is an old hand whose touch is normally assured. He’s seen more than a few deals over the years and will know that zero-premium “mergers of equals”, which is how this one is being advertised, require the advantages for both sides to be obvious on day one. The Amaya deal has failed to generate the required fizz of excitement. At the moment, it is merely a proposal, and Davis and co could claim they are required to give all proposals an exploratory poke. True enough, but investors also expect directors not to dawdle when resistance is so strong. In a gambling industry consolidating at speed, there is a fair argument that William Hill should combine with somebody. Just not Amaya. Davis and his interim chief executive, Philip Bowcock, should know that half the skill of poker is knowing when to fold a weak hand. That time is now. Samsung must raise its game Among the rifles and submachine guns in the weapons store, a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 glows threateningly inside its display case. Ignoring the Uzi, the thug in the video game opts for the smartphone. In the street, he launches it like a grenade at moving vehicles. Explosions, fireballs, carnage! The flame-prone handset was withdrawn from sale last week, but not before inspiring a Grand Theft Auto tribute. The Note 7 is gone, and Samsung executives must hope it will soon be forgotten. The Seoul firm sells more phones than anyone else because its technology works, is cutting edge – and is cheaper than Apple’s. But its flagship devices are not particularly cheap. The Note 7 would have cost £700 in the UK. At that price, customers rightly expect a brand that puts consumer safety first. Samsung took more than a month to scrap its botched product but it will take it far longer to recover from the reputational hit."
2016-10-16T16:22:29Z,uk-news,UK news,UK to take small group of children from Calais refugee camp,"A group of around 10 unaccompanied refugee children are expected to leave France for the the UK on Monday as part of the Home Office’s attempt to relocate children from the refugee camp in Calais before it is demolished. The 10 children follow an advance party of five – four Syrians and one Afghan – who arrived over the weekend. According to French authorities they will be followed by a further group of around 10 on Tuesday, all of whom qualify for relocation under the Dublin Regulation because they have family living in the UK. Local government officials in Calais told AFP there was “no deal for a larger-scale plan” for the UK to take more.
The Home Office said that after a meeting between the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, it had sent a team to Calais to help identify children who qualified. Cazeneuve said he was asking “Britain to assume its moral duty”. At least 187 children in Calais have been identified by the Red Cross as being eligible under the Dublin rules. However, the Home Office has been accused of dragging its feet over processing their cases. In the first nine months of 2016, just 140 children were brought to the UK under the Dublin rules, 80 of them from France. The UK has also made a wider commitment to taking in unaccompanied migrant children under the Dubs amendment passed in the House of Lords this year. The Home Office said it would send a second group of staff to France to help identify and prioritise children to be brought to the UK under the amendment. It was originally expected that the amendment – which was introduced by Lord Dubs, who came to the UK from Nazi Germany as a child on the Kindertransport – would see around 3,000 children given a home in the UK. However, Rudd said last week that it would be a “good result” if the UK ended up taking around 300 unaccompanied children from the camp in Calais.
The Calais camp – a dirty and unsafe collection of makeshift shelters – is home to around 10,000 people, with official estimates suggesting there are between 600 and 900 unaccompanied minors. The French were originally planning to begin demolishing the camp as early as Tuesday, but the plans have been postponed for at least a week. “As the home secretary told the House of Commons on Monday, our priority must be to ensure the safety and security of the children in the Calais camp,” said a Home Office spokesman. “When she met the French interior minister she made it crystal clear that we intend to transfer as many minors as possible who qualify for transfer to the UK to claim asylum on the basis of close family in the UK under the Dublin Regulation, before the start of the clearance. “In addition, children who are eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered. Work is continuing on both sides of the Channel to ensure this happens as a matter of urgency.”"
2016-10-16T17:13:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Merseyside police reopen investigation into 1980 killing of two boys,"Police have reopened an investigation into the killing of two 11-year-old boys in Merseyside in 1980. John Greenwood and Gary Miller were found badly beaten and hidden under a mattress at a rubbish tip in Whiston, near Liverpool. They died in hospital and an autopsy found both had suffered head injuries. A man was tried for their murder but acquitted in 1981. Police were criticised for interviewing the man – who had a mental age of 10 – without a guardian or lawyer present. The case has been reopened 36 years later after a Sunday Times investigation unearthed new evidence and witnesses. Greenwood’s younger sister, Deborah Lewis, who was two when he was killed, said: “Losing the boys in such an horrific way was devastating for both families and has been heartbreaking to cope with. The fact that no one has been convicted for their murders has made it so much harder. “For 36 years we have lived with the frustration and the fear that we could be sitting next to their killer on a bus, or walking past them on the street. The murder of a child in a family causes so much pain to everyone, the very least we deserve is to find the evil person that did this and put them behind bars.” The case was reviewed in 2008 when it was found that items of forensic evidence had been lost or destroyed. DCS Paul Richardson told the newspaper that the failure to reopen the case before now was “completely unacceptable”. In a statement he added: “This is a tragic case and the families of both boys quite rightly want justice. This was a high-profile case at the time and I am sure that people in Whiston will have information which could help us identify the person, or people responsible.” Merseyside police’s serious crime review unit has asked for anyone who saw Greenwood and Miller on Saturday 16 August 1980 to make contact."
2016-10-16T18:52:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour adds to growing demands for urgent Heathrow expansion decision,"The swell of voices demanding an urgent decision on Heathrow’s third runway has been intensified by the Labour party, a cross-party group of politicians and Britain’s biggest trade union, as the pressure grows on Theresa May to approve the airport’s expansion. Labour sources said the party would back a third runway, despite the reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn and the opposition of shadow chancellor John McDonnell, whose constituency borders the airport. In an article for the Guardian, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the “imperative was overwhelming” for more capacity and that “there would have to be overwhelming evidence that the Airport Commission’s report and conclusions were fundamentally flawed for parliament to depart from it”. A Labour source said McDonald’s words were intended to back Heathrow’s expansion. “Until we see the detail we can’t commit unequivocally but on the assumption that they meet the tests we’ve been clear on, we will look to support.” In a letter to the prime minister, 50 MPs and representatives from the major parties in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish devolved assemblies urged May to approve the third runway. Describing Heathrow as their “gateway to the world”, they claimed that the airport’s expansion would create almost four times more jobs for the UK’s three smaller nations than rival plans for Gatwick. Meanwhile, the Unite union will deliver a letter to Downing Street signed by 125 reps from across the country, saying: “We work across all sectors of the economy from construction to logistics, manufacturing to transport and the services industry, our livelihoods depend on the jobs and economic prosperity Heathrow expansion will bring.” The cabinet subcommittee will make a decision by the end of October, No 10 said – and it could come on Tuesday – to finally respond to the Airports Commission report of July 2015 that recommended expanding Heathrow. However, ministers have never ruled out the rival plans of Gatwick, which hopes to build a second runway. A third option, to expand one of Heathrow’s existing runways, is also on the table.
The latest show of political support for Heathrow comes from a group including former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb, Northern Irish DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and Welsh Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. In the letter to May, they urge her to honour her Tory conference speech pledge “to take big, sometimes even controversial, decisions about our country’s infrastructure”. They added: “Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have our own successful and growing airports. But Heathrow is our gateway to the world, bringing tourists to our attractions and helping our exporters reach new markets … We know that connections to Heathrow are a key driver of investment decisions. “Expanding Heathrow will create nearly four times more jobs in our three nations than other options being considered … We urge you to act in the interests of all the nations of the UK and urgently approve the expansion of Heathrow.” But prominent and widespread opposition remains, not least within May’s own party. The Tory MP Zac Goldsmith warned the prime minister that the party would lose MPs and councils if it backed Heathrow. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: “There is no doubt that despite huge gains against the Liberal Democrats in west London in recent years, the Conservative party would be badly damaged in the event that Heathrow gets a green light.” Goldsmith reiterated his pledge to resign his seat if a third runway is approved, but said the decison would be a “political millstone” for May, and that “the fallout will be much wider, and it will be hard for our brilliant local councils to weather the storm”. He added: “That’s not just a party issue. If I were investing in Heathrow, it would worry me greatly because there is a very real risk that as soon as the polls tighten, the party will feel the need to reverse its policy, yet again.”
Most west London MPs strongly oppose expansion. Adam Afriyie, the Tory MP for Windsor and a vocal opponent of Heathrow, said he believed there would be more than 60 Tory rebels, as well as anti-Heathrow Labour MPs. But his fellow Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng, for nearby Spelthorne, said the number was “way off the mark”. He told the BBC: “My sense in the House of Commons is that there are probably about 20 hardcore people.” However, another Conservative MP warned that approving Gatwick would also prompt party rebellion. Crispin Blunt, chair of the Gatwick co-ordination group of MPs whose constituencies surround the airport, said it was wrong to claim that Heathrow was a tougher parliamentary fight. “More Conservative MPs will oppose Gatwick than oppose Heathrow – Gatwick is the politically and practically controversial project, not Heathrow,” Blunt said. “No local council supports expansion at Gatwick, nor any local MP – not even their biggest customer [Easyjet] supports it.” Blunt said he believed some form of expansion at Heathrow had greater consensus among his colleagues, including in the Conservative party. “Heathrow has the support from a majority of Conservative and Labour MPs and also the SNP and the DUP,” Blunt said. Gatwick airport has said it would remain confident in its own plan even if Heathrow’s was approved, believing the project would fail under legal and political challenges. One such challenge is likely to crystallise on Tuesday, when lawyers for Client Earth seek a high court ruling forcing the government to show it is attempting to comply with the legal limits on air pollution, as ordered by the supreme court. Speaking to the BBC, James Thornton of Client Earth said: “The current plan won’t get us into compliance by 2025 … Until you can show you can comply it is illegal to build [at] Heathrow.”"
2016-10-16T22:20:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Two men arrested after laser pointed at police helicopter in Stoke-on-Trent,"Two men in Stoke-on-Trent have been arrested on suspicion of endangering an aircraft after a police helicopter was targeted using a laser. The pair in their 20s were taken into custody only 15 minutes after allegedly pointing the device at a helicopter over Northwood which was supporting colleagues with a search on the ground. The aircraft directed police community support officers who were in the area at the time of the incident – around 8.50pm – and were able to track down the men before being joined by police officers. In a statement, Staffordshire police said: “Two young men in their early 20s have been arrested by police on suspicion of endangering an aircraft this evening. A laser has been recovered and the men will remain in custody and be questioned by police.” In February this year, the National Police Air Service raised concerns about the increasing number of laser “attacks” on aircraft. The director of operations, Ollie Dismore, said: “In an attack, a laser pointer is deliberately or recklessly shone at airborne aircraft sometimes persistently over a period of minutes. The impact on a pilot is at the very least distracting but can be serious enough to cause temporary ‘flash’ blindness and in some cases lasting eye damage.“What may seem like harmless fun to the culprit could potentially have devastating consequences for the crew and passengers in the aircraft as well as innocent members of the public on the ground. In serious cases, using a laser pointer in this way can carry a prison sentence.” Last year there were 1,800 “laser incidents” on aircraft in the UK reported to the Civil Aviation Authority. In August a British Airways flight to Heathrow from Bergen was targeted by a green laser beam as it made its final descent. It was among a string of incidents targeting planes taking off and landing at UK airports, with Heathrow the worst target for the laser pen incidents. Birmingham airport is the second most heavily targeted with one incident a week. Earlier this year a former US navy pilot warned that the increasing number of such attacks could lead to a “terrible tragedy”. Dr Steve Schallhorn urged for more to be done to raise awareness about the irreversible injuries that can be caused by laser pens. In July a pilots’ union called for the lasers to be classified as “offensive weapons” after figures suggested Heathrow’s pilots were targeted 48 times in the first six months of 2015. The National Police Air Service is conducting a laser eyewear protection trial that may allow it to protect its staff against the threat of laser strikes."
2016-10-16T23:01:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Bookmakers' attempts to curb problem gambling 'in disarray',"A system set up by bookmakers to address problem gambling is in disarray, according to campaigners, after a report exposed vast differences in how firms apply the measures. The report, produced by accountancy group PwC and seen by the Guardian, found flaws in how betting shops use “player awareness systems”, which are meant to curb addiction to fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). It comes ahead of a government review into the machines, sometimes dubbed the crack cocaine of the industry, which allow players to stake up to £100 every 20 seconds. The PwC report, commissioned by the Responsible Gambling Trust charity, identified multiple flaws in player awareness systems, which automatically identify signs of problem gambling, such as the frequency and size of a player’s bets. Once a customer is flagged as “at risk”, they can be sent messages encouraging them to take a break or warning them of the danger of addiction. But statistics from the report, which did not name individual companies, found holes in how bookies are using the system. Of 169,424 active customers, who can be tracked if they have a loyalty card for a high street bookmaker, 8,219 or about 5% were flagged up as being in the at risk category during the first three months of the systems being used. But only 7,503 messages were sent to gamblers, meaning some firms identified customers as at risk of harm but failed to take any action. The statistics, from 6,723 high street betting shops, also suggest the systems are undermined by significant variance in the way firms are implementing them. One operator flagged up 1,398 instances of customers displaying at risk behaviour and warned them every time via pop-up messages on the FOBT’s screen. Another bookmaker flagged 2,352 instances, of which 1,700 involved a customer whose behaviour saw them flagged more than once. But the unnamed company sent only 591 text messages and 36 emails over the period, suggesting it did nothing to engage with half of those players deemed at risk of addiction. The systems work by identifying certain markers that indicate a gambler is having trouble stopping. But there is no standardisation of how the companies interpret those markers or which markers they use, leading to major discrepancies in the data. For instance, two of the operators run a daily check for patterns indicating problem gambling, while another of the firms does so only every fortnight. The length of time between a new customer displaying signs of potential harm and them being sent a message varied from a few days to 13 weeks. The report also found that only two people opted to ask firms to block from gambling during the period, calling into question efforts to promote so-called “self-exclusion”. “At this early stage of the initiative, the design of the systems and processes is still a work in progress,” said PwC. It said that companies often did not track whether warning messages were delivered, nor did they collect information on whether the gambler changed their behaviour. PwC also said that procedures designed to halt adverts being sent to at risk players often did not work or were activated after a lengthy delay. It said that weaknesses in the player awareness systems had the “potential to detract significantly from the good work that has been done by the industry in this area”. Labour MP Carolyn Harris (Swansea East), who chairs a cross-party group on FOBTs, said the report raised questions about the gambling industry’s commitment to ensuring they don’t encourage addiction. “I wish they were as quick to send messages warning people to stop as they are to send adverts encouraging people to use FOBTs,” she said. “They’re paying lip service to the commitment to look after the punters, as they call them. It’s not acceptable. “Clearly this system, designed by the bookmakers themselves, is in complete disarray and is far from adequate to address gambling addiction,” said Derek Webb, a former professional poker player who founded the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. “This is only another ineffective PR exercise and it should not deter the government from stake reduction to £2 in the pending review.” A spokesperson for the industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, said: “We are pleased that the Responsible Gambling Trustcommissioned work to evaluate the effectiveness of player awareness systems across the industry, and making the findings publicly available demonstrates that it has been a transparent process.” “We look forward to seeing how the industry utilises the results to shape best practice for operators in a bid to strengthen the protection of players.” Malcolm George, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the industry’s use of player awareness systems was a “world-first” that demonstrated gambling firms’ commitment to tackling addiction. “This report has greatly helped in identifying some of the strengths and weaknesses of the varied systems that were developed by operators,” he said. “While each operator was at different stages of development during the three month period examined by PwC, which immediately followed the launch of the programme, identifying best practice has led to significant improvement since that time. We will continue to build on this work towards developing greater alignment between operator’s player awareness systems and a consistent set of standards.”"
2016-10-16T23:01:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Property rentals to outstrip sales for first time since 1930s,"The property rental market is booming at the expense of the sales market, making it look as if house-buying will be outstripped for the first time in eight decades next year, as home-buyers face a continued struggle to find properties they can afford. Activity in the sales market has cooled since June’s Brexit vote and a lack of property for sale combined with rising prices are set to lead to more new lets than purchases, the UK’s largest estate agency chain, Countrywide, said. Johnny Morris, research director at Countrywide, said: “As some would-be buyers and sellers sit on their hands, Brexit-induced uncertainty has continued to boost the rental market … September saw record activity, with increasing numbers of lets agreed and tenants choosing to renew their contracts. On current trends 2017 could be the first time since the 1930s that more homes are let than sold.” Separate reports suggest that affording a new home is becoming increasingly difficult for would-be buyers, with asking prices rising since the summer and borrowers having to find bigger deposits than in 2015. Homeownership levels had fallen to their lowest levels in 30 years at the start of 2016, and although recent figures from mortgage lenders showed a pick-up in the number of loans taken out for house purchases, the number of homes for sale remains near a record low and prices are rising. In 2015 1.2m properties costing more than £40,000 changed hands, according to official figures. Morris said analysis of the number of homes advertised for sale and for rent online showed that over the past five years rental activity in the mainstream was catching up. In March there was a boom in sales as landlords attempted to buy properties before a change in stamp duty rates and this has since led to an increase in the number of rental properties advertised.
“The shift between the number of properties being offered for rent and sale has been a long-term trend, boosted a bit by stamp duty and a bit by the Brexit vote,” he added. Morris said that when informally advertised lets were taken into account, the rental market may have already outgrown the sales market. Meanwhile the property website Rightmove has flagged a north-south split in the housing market after the Brexit vote: asking prices for new homes coming on to the market have gone up for two consecutive months. However, it added that the north of England has become a “sellers’ market”. Rightmove’s latest report on asking prices showed that sellers coming on to the market in October asked 0.9% more for their properties than those putting their homes up for sale in September. The average asking price for a home in England and Wales now stands at £309,122, the website said – just £1,349 below the record set in June. Rightmove said that the market was busiest in the north of England, where activity had picked up very quickly after the Brexit vote. Miles Shipside, Rightmove’s director, said: “After the referendum result and the usual summer slowdown, estate agents’ experiences appear to fall into one of two camps, with a definite north/south divide.” Across six regions of the north of England and the Midlands, Rightmove said that the number of homes for sale had fallen by 11% since 2015, giving buyers less room to negotiate on price. “Agents report brisk sales in many areas, especially in the mass-market sectors,” said Shipside. “They say as long as it’s not over-priced, the right house in the right area is quickly being snapped up for close to, at, or even over the asking price.” In contrast, in the south of England available stock increased by 16% year-on-year, while sales agreed were down by 10%, Rightmove said. Activity in Greater London is likely to have been stifled by affordability problems, with asking prices averaging £645,833 in October, compared with £630,974 in September and a similar figure a year ago."
2016-10-17T08:45:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Neo-Nazi band Bound for Glory cancels Scottish concert,"The neo-Nazi rock band Bound for Glory is believed to have cancelled its first gig in Scotland after campaigners and the Scottish government called for the group to be denied entry to the UK. The US thrash metal band was booked to play a venue in or around Edinburgh on 22 October. But Nick Lowles, the founder of the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, confirmed that on Sunday evening the concert’s organiser emailed those who had bought tickets to tell them the event had been cancelled amid “travel concerns”. Hope Not Hate believed this would be the largest white power concert ever to take place in the country, attracting hundreds of skinheads and white supremacists from Scotland, England and across Europe. More than 500 tickets had been sold, with the location of the event kept secret by organisers to try to prevent protesters from shutting it down. Scotland’s justice secretary, Michael Matheson, announced on Sunday that he was “considering every option” to prevent the band visiting Scotland, including writing to the British home secretary, Amber Rudd, to ask her to consider refusing them entry to the UK. “I have also asked the chief constable [of Police Scotland] to consider with partners [the] powers available to stop this event happening. There is no place for hatred of this kind in Scotland.” The Scottish National party’s justice and home affairs spokesperson at Westminster, Joanna Cherry, was considering raising the issue as an urgent question in the House of Commons on Monday. Lowles told the Guardian he had been “fairly confident” that the gig would be cancelled, after 1,700 people contacted their MPs and MSPs over the weekend, and the organisers of the event were reported to be increasingly concerned about losing money on the venture. “We had expected the Scottish government to step in, given the politics of the SNP which have always been very good on race,” he said. “In Scotland generally at the moment, there seems to be more of a public rejection of racism.” In her closing address to the SNP’s conference in Glasgow on Saturday, the leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, talked of the “uniting vision” of “an inclusive, prosperous, socially just, open, welcoming and outward-looking country”, contrasting this with the xenophobic rhetoric of Theresa May’s government."
2016-10-17T12:04:50Z,uk-news,UK news,UK conspiracy theorist's mother fears he was murdered in Poland,"The mother of a British conspiracy theorist who died suddenly in Poland has said she fears he was murdered. Max Spiers, 39, was visiting the eastern European country to give a talk but was found dead on a sofa days after she says he texted her to say: “Your boy’s in trouble. If anything happens to me, investigate.” Vanessa Bates, 63, said the Polish authorities told her her son died in July of natural causes but no postmortem examination was carried out. “I think Max had been digging in some dark places and I fear that somebody wanted him dead,” she said. “Max was a very fit man who was in good health and yet he apparently just died suddenly on a sofa.” Spiers, a ufologist and paranormal researcher originally from Canterbury in Kent, claimed to have been the victim of a mind control programme run by Britain and the US in conjunction with surviving Nazis, including an attempt to create a “superman” warrior. Believers have long raised concerns that UFO researchers are being killed by “men in black” and Spiers’ death prompted online discussion suggesting he was murdered because of his work. On the whistleblower website, Project Camelot, Kerry Cassidy wrote: “This death is very suspicious. I now have reason to believe a cover-up is in motion.” Talking about her son’s acquaintances in Poland, Bates told KMTV: “These people seemed to be involved in some very, very dark and dangerous areas of the world and I was afraid that as he was gaining popularity and fame perhaps somebody would want him out of the way ie not alive any longer.’ Spiers’ body was flown home a week after his death and a postmortem examination was carried out in Kent. Bates said she was still waiting for the results and had not been told whether there would be an inquest. “Apparently, he had not suffered any obvious physical injuries but he could have been slowly poisoned, which is why the results of toxicology tests from his postmortem are so important,” the English teacher said. The North East Kent coroner’s court said it could not comment on the case unless an inquest was announced. In the event of a death overseas an inquest should usually take place “if the cause of death is unknown or if it was sudden, violent or unnatural”. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: “We provided assistance to the family of a British national following his death in Warsaw, Poland, in July.”"
2016-10-17T14:14:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Hiker dies trying to find Lake District cave made popular by BBC show,"A hiker has died in the Lake District after falling nearly 150 metres (500ft) while trying to reach a remote cave made popular by a BBC television series. The 50-year-old man was with a group of friends who had planned to spend the night in the Priest’s Hole cave when the accident happened. The “secret” beauty spot, on Dove Crag near the Cumbrian village of Glenridding, has become increasingly popular with hillwalkers since it featured on the BBC series Secret Britain earlier this year. Cumbria police said mountain rescue workers were alerted at 10pm on Saturday following a 999 call reporting that the man, who has not been named, had slipped from a ledge and fallen down the front face of the fell. He was found with fatal injuries after a seven-hour rescue operation involving a coastguard helicopter scrambled from Scotland. Mike Blakey, the leader of Patterdale mountain rescue team, said: “The helicopter was able to direct the team straight to the man’s location, approximately 50 metres below the bottom of the main crag. The man, who had slipped from the ledge, had fallen approximately 150 metres vertically and had sustained fatal injuries. “This kind of evacuation is always complex as it involves belaying the stretcher down the mountainside and team members literally manhandling the stretcher over each boulder, through dense bracken and over streams. “We also deployed four team members to the Priest’s Hole to assist the remaining members of the party back to the safety of our base.
“Our thoughts are with the man’s family and friends, including those who were staying the night with him. No matter how many times we deal with such incidents they are always tragic and very sad for all concerned.” He said there had been an increase in visitor numbers to the Priest’s Hole since it featured on the BBC’s Secret Britain in spring, when presenter Chris Hollins made the ascent to the site. The natural shelter, which sits more than 640 metres (2,100ft) above ground, features breathtaking views of the northern Lake District and has become a rite of passage for some outdoors aficionados. Blakey said a man had suffered very serious injuries while trying to access the location during the summer. In April, rescuers searched for a father and son who had been reported missing while trying to find the Priest’s Hole, weeks after the show aired. He added: “This group of friends were very well equipped and prepared for their adventure. “However, as a team we are seeing more and more people who are attempting to locate the Priest’s Hole in the dark and without the right equipment. Indeed, during this rescue we came across three men who had been searching for the cave for a couple of hours. “We really would like to remind people that the cave is on the front face of a vertical cliff and it is only accessible by one route. It is always best to plan to stay in good weather and to arrive in daylight. An Ordnance Survey map and good navigations skills are prerequisites.”"
2016-10-17T14:22:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged killer of antiques dealer denies drawing up list of famous targets,"A man accused of murdering an antiques dealer after plotting to steal a rare first edition of The Wind in the Willows has told a jury that an unnamed man used his laptop and mobile phone to make a list of robbery and kidnap targets that included celebrities and prominent business figures. Michael Danaher, 50, is accused of attacking and killing Adrian Greenwood at the latter’s home in Oxford on 6 April, in an assault that left the rare-books dealer with more than 30 stab wounds. He denies murder. Oxford crown court previously heard that a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet entitled “Enterprises”, containing Greenwood’s name and those of Kate Moss and Jeffrey Archer among others, was found on Danaher’s laptop after the killing. Alongside the names were columns headed “modus” and “expected take”, and terms such as “ransom” and “stun”. In addition, the court heard that Danaher’s laptop and phone had been used to research the home addresses of other prominent figures, including Eamonn Holmes, Gary Lineker and Louise Redknapp. On Monday, Danaher, who is unemployed, denied he had drawn up the spreadsheet or carried out the web searches, instead blaming an unidentified man whom he said he would not name in court. The man would come and go from Danaher’s Peterborough flat and use his laptop and mobile phone, the defendant told the jury. He said he had met the man in a pub in 2015, but that he would not say anything to help identify him. Asked why he would not name him, Danaher said he had been threatened in prison with “consequences” for him and his family if he disclosed the man’s identity. Danaher said it must have been this man who made the first celebrity search, for TV presenter Holmes’s address, on 30 June 2015. “The only person it could have been was him,” he told the court. Asked by Amjad Malik QC, defending, why some of the searches were in the early hours of the morning, Danaher said: “He must have come round then. He seemed to keep odd hours.” Danaher told the jury that in December 2015 he had bought a stun gun online, disguised as a mobile phone, because he had been afraid of the man after catching sight of the Enterprises document on the screen of his own laptop. “It just looked like he was up to no good,” he told the court. He said he had asked the man about the document but was told it was none of his business. “He said I would get fucking hurt if I said anything to anyone.” Similarly, it was the other man, said Danaher, who had been driving his car and using his mobile on 22 March this year, when both were recorded in Hampstead, north London, near the home of the Wonga investor and Conservative donor Adrian Beecroft, whose name also appeared on the Enterprises list. The jury previously heard that a man attempted to force his way into the Beecroft family home that day but was foiled when the businessman’s wife screamed for help. The prosecution says this man was Danaher. The accused told the court he had met Greenwood at an auction, perhaps in Henley, where he had gone to buy second hand books towards the end of 2015. Greenwood had “piqued [his] interest” when he bought a crate of books, and the pair had got talking. Danaher said: “He seemed very sociable. A nice guy. I just thought he obviously knew far more about it [buying books] than I did. He obviously knew his stuff.” Danaher said some of the searches on his phone and laptop, into Greenwood’s addresses and business, had been made by him. This included multiple searches about The Wind in the Willows copy, which the jury heard Greenwood put on eBay in August 2015 for £50,000. The prosecution previously accused Danaher of targeting Greenwood because of this book, and of listing it on the auction site on the evening of his death after stealing it from his flat. The defendant said he searched repeatedly for information about the dealer because he wanted to “learn from him”, and was “just looking to see how he was advertising things”. Asked by Malik if he had written “tosser” alongside Greenwood’s name in the Enterprises spreadsheet, he said: “Certainly not. I thought he was a nice guy. I didn’t have any problem with him at all.” Danaher told the jury he had been severely overweight and about £13,000 in debt in about March or April this year, after his marriage broke up in 2012 and he lost his job at an engines company in Peterborough. He had also been struggling mentally, he told the jury while fighting back tears, and had tried to kill himself. “I thought the place might be better off without me,” he said. When his attempt failed, he said: “I thought I had better get myself in gear. It obviously wasn’t meant to be. I needed to get back out and take another chance.” The trial continues."
2016-10-17T15:33:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Rotherham: eight men convicted of sexually exploiting teenage girls,"Eight men have been found guilty of sexually exploiting teenage girls in Rotherham. The men, who include two brothers and four cousins, all raped or indecently assaulted the same girl when she was as young as 13, a jury at Sheffield crown court found on Monday. Some of them had abused two other girls as far back as 1999, the jury ruled. The main complainant, who is now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, said her abusers threatened to “gang-rape” her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a local park and in bushes near a museum. Her family were so afraid of her alleged abusers that they moved to Spain after their complaints to the police, social services, their MP and the home secretary went unresolved, the court heard. The jury believed her when she said that Sageer Hussain, 30 – who is of British Pakistani origin, along with all but one of the other men in the dock – first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a “white slag” when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch. He was found guilty on Monday of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. His older brother, Basharat Hussain, 40, was found guilty of indecently assaulting her. Six further men, including two cousins of the Hussain brothers, were found guilty of abusing her or helping others to do so. After the majority verdicts were returned in this trial on Monday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was separately investigating more than 11,100 lines of inquiry relating to non-familial child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2003.So far 38 people have been designated “suspects” with many more under investigation, according to the NCA, which is carrying out the independent investigation at the request of the chief constable of South Yorkshire police.
NCA staff have been talking to 133 victims and survivors and have so far recorded 163 crimes in relation to their experiences. They have identified 17 distinct investigations under the overall inquiry. To date, nine people have been arrested as part of the operation, codenamed Stovewood, with all suspects bailed until November and December, and one organised crime group has been mapped, identifying the nature and scale of its offending. Money laundering, other financial crime and drug-related offences have also been identified. The distinct investigations would be carried out by South Yorkshire police or other appropriate authorities to enable Stovewood to retain its focus on investigating child sexual exploitation and abuse, the NCA said. The operation is recruiting additional officers to increase the size of the team to 117. Stovewood’s senior investigating officer, Paul Williamson, said the operation was receiving good cooperation from South Yorkshire police, Rotherham council and health agencies “who have a vital long-term role in supporting victims and witnesses and providing information” to help the investigation. “I am determined to identify and bring to justice all those who have abused children in Rotherham in the period covered by Operation Stovewood. The scale and complexity of the investigation is extremely large and it will take a number of years to complete.” He said agencies were working together to identify any suspects who might still be active, and more arrests would be made this year. The operation began after the publication in August 2014 of the Jay report, which said at least 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited over a 16-year period from 1997. The full verdicts returned by the jury on Monday were as follows: Sageer Hussain, of Goole, was found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. His brother Basharat Hussain was found guilty of indecent assault. The brothers’ cousin, Mohammed Whied, 32, of Kimberworth was found guilty of aiding and abetting rape. Ishtiaq Khaliq, 33, of Eastwood was found guilty of rape and three counts of indecent assault. Waleed Ali, 34, of Rotherham was found guilty of rape and indecent assault. Another of the Hussains’ cousins, Asif Ali, 30, of Rotherham, was found guilty of rape. Masoued Malik, 32, of Rotherham, was found guilty of rape, false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit indecent assault. Naeem Rafiq, 33, from Bradgate, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit indecent assault and false imprisonment. They will be sentenced on 4 November at Sheffield crown court. The Crown Prosecution Service praised the victims in the case for their bravery in coming forward. Peter Mann, of CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: “In contrast to the courage and strength of the victims, these men’s actions are utterly abhorrent. They waged a campaign of sexual violence and intimidation against young girls in the Rotherham area 13 years ago. “Their victims were targeted, sexualised, and in some cases subjected to degrading and violent acts. Sageer Hussain in particular took a leading role in befriending the young girls, and in the case of one victim, passed her on to his friends and other associates, assisted in various ways by the other defendants.” Dr Alan Billings, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, said the convictions showed that authorities had changed the way they handled cases such as this. He said: “South Yorkshire police is proving that it has learned from past mistakes and is determined to get right what it got so badly wrong before. “The teams of specially-trained and dedicated officers work tirelessly to pursue and bring to justice those who exploit and abuse young people, which goes towards putting right some of the injustices and institutional failures of the past.” He added: “This judgment sends a clear message to any others who think they can get away with treating girls and young women in this way, that this will not be tolerated and that the police and other authorities will ensure offenders are caught and brought to justice.”"
2016-10-17T16:28:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Rowan Williams: government is 'foot-dragging' over Calais child refugees,"Rowan Williams has warned that the safety of up to 400 unaccompanied children stranded in the Calais refugee camp is being put at risk by the government’s “foot-dragging”. Speaking on the day the Home Office said 14 children from the camp arrived in Britain, the former archbishop of Canterbury said the “clock is ticking” for the remainder because of the imminent dismantling of the site. The children who arrived on Monday are among about 100 to be resettled in the UK. They come from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Kuwait’s stateless Bidoon community. Lord Williams was speaking in Croydon, south London, where the children’s resettlement was scheduled to be processed by the Home Office. The department later confirmed that the young people, aged 14-17, were transferred on Monday morning. They will be assessed and screened and may be cared for in specialist accommodation before being reunited with their relatives. Outside the Home Office processing centre in Croydon there were chaotic scenes as excited relatives were refused entry and told they could not see the new arrivals until Tuesday at the earliest.
Afghan chef Jan Ghazi, 39, had not seen his 16-year-old nephew, Haris, for seven years. He had travelled from his home in Wallington after receiving a call from the Red Cross on Monday morning to tell him he was one of the 14 minors taken from the camp to the UK. “I was so excited and happy to see him and now I am disappointed. I am shocked. I do not know why we cannot see him,” he said. A lawyer for the charity Citizens UK Safe Passage explained to him that it was legal due diligence designed to safeguard the children and ensure no bogus claims were being made for their future care. Minutes later Ghazi ran to a minibus at the back of the imposing building waiting to take the children to overnight accommodation where they would get their first night’s sleep in a proper bed in many weeks or months. “I saw him in the window and I shouted to him: ‘Come here I have come to take you home,’” said Ghazi. They hugged and embraced for about 30 seconds before security guards closed the window.
“He said they said to him they would let us know in 24 hours when we are going to see him. The only thing I recognised was his eyes,” said Ghazi, who fled his war-torn country with the help of the Red Cross in 2009. He said his nephew has no living family left in Afghanistan and had started his journey by being smuggled overland with an older brother who got killed when they reached Iran. “I am very happy he is here. I want to tell him that he is safe, that there are no bombs here and I want to help him go to school and become a lawyer or an engineer or whatever he wants. He is a smart child; I will do my best for him.” Another man, Asif Khan, who was waiting outside the Croydon immigration centre, said his 14-year-old brother, Aimal, was among those children. Khan, 25, is a chef who has been living in the UK for 11 years after fleeing Afghanistan. He said: “I really appreciate this. My brother was in Calais for the last six months. It was a blessing to receive him from there – I’m really happy. His journey was so difficult, it was by walking, by bus to Calais. He gets a new life now, because there are many people who died in Calais.” Asked what he would say to his brother when he saw him for the first time in more than a decade, Khan replied: “I will just hug him because I haven’t seen him since I left – I just miss him. I came across the same way 11 years ago; every night was hell for me, so I’m relieved he is here.”
Earlier, Williams said the refugee children were “extraordinarily vulnerable” in the “chaos of the camp and the chaos of the demolition”. He called on the government to expedite the cases of up to 400 children remaining in Calais. “I’m not sure why there is such foot-dragging,” Williams said at Croydon Minster. “The clock is ticking, the likelihood is the Calais camp will be demolished in the next 10 days.” Tina Brocklebank, a volunteer who has been conducting refugee counts with the charity L’Auberge des Migrants, said the most vulnerable children in Calais could miss out on being helped amid what she called a confusing census carried out by the charity France Terre d’Asile (FTDA). She said: “The FTDA registered a very small number of children on Friday and then shut the gate and told everyone to come back on Monday. It’s a despicable way to build up hopes, withhold and keep changing information and confuse everybody. “We are concerned that buses may at some point arrive for the children, and the pushy ones will get on while the most vulnerable ones will still be hiding in their shelters and tents – either because they don’t know what’s going on or will be too scared to get on a bus.” Last week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, indicated that the UK would accept unaccompanied children with or without relatives in the UK. After a two-hour meeting last Monday with her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, she said the official effort would prioritise safeguarding children under 12. But Williams said no process had yet been put in place to accept those children without relatives in the UK. He said there was “a moral imperative” for the UK to accept those that did not have relatives already settled in the country. “We’ve omitted to think what’s in their best interests and to consider whether we take more children,” he said. Under EU laws, a child seeking asylum who has a parent or a sibling in another European country can be fast-tracked to join them in that country. Earlier this year, Alf Dubs forced the government to agree to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees who have no relatives in the UK. Lord Dubs called for a “shared enterprise” between government and charitable organisations working to secure a future home for the children, many of whom have fled wars. Meanwhile, the actor Juliet Stevenson, who is supporting Citizens UK’s Safe Passage programme, said of Monday’s arrivals: “Today is a proud moment for Britain. We did the right thing.” She added: “The arrival of hundreds of vulnerable children from Calais to the UK in the coming days is in no small part due to the tireless campaigning of community leaders, the hard work of Citizens UK’s lawyers, and the Safe Passage team in Calais who have been working to safeguard children for over a year.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We can confirm a group of children who left the Calais camp this morning have arrived in the UK. This is the start of the process to transfer as many eligible children as possible before the start of the clearance, as the home secretary set out in parliament. “These vulnerable children, aged between 14 and 17, were transferred to the UK under the care of Home Office staff, with the support of volunteers from specialist NGOs and charities. They will join their families in the UK as quickly as possible over the coming days.”"
2016-10-17T17:08:59Z,uk-news,UK news,TfL to make written English test compulsory for private cab drivers,"All aspiring private-hire taxi drivers in London will have to pass a two-hour written English exam, including those for whom it is their first language, the capital’s public transport authority has confirmed. Transport for London (TfL) has fought a legal battle with taxi-hailing app Uber over plans to introduce written tests for anyone seeking a private-hire licence. Uber succeeded in derailing TfL’s plans to offer an exemption for drivers from English-speaking countries on the grounds that it would be discriminatory, a view supported by campaign groups representing migrant workers. But rather than abandon the requirement, TfL has announced that the exam will be compulsory for anyone seeking to obtain or renew a licence to drive a private-hire taxi from 1 April 2017, regardless of their nationality. The deadline has been extended from this month to give would-be cab drivers more time to prepare and there will be an exemption for anyone who can provide “satisfactory documentary evidence” they already have an English qualification. However, the requirement means someone who has spoken English all their life may be forced to pay £200 to take an exam in rudimentary writing skills, unless they can dig out their GCSE certificate or equivalent. Uber said it had no objection to drivers being asked to show proficiency in spoken English, but criticised TfL’s decision on written exams, which it says will put some drivers out of business. “It’s disappointing that, to try and dig themselves out of a legal hole, TfL is now insisting every private hire driver in London must have essay writing skills,” said a spokesperson. “We’ve always supported spoken English skills, but passing a written English exam has nothing to do with communicating with passengers or getting them safely from A to B. “Thousands of drivers who’ve spent years providing a great service to Londoners will now have to fork out £200 and pass a writing exam, try to find an old GCSE certificate or lose their licence and their livelihood. “Transport for London should think again and scrap these unnecessary new rules.” Helen Chapman, TfL’s general manager for taxi and private hire, said: “It is essential for public safety that all licensed drivers can communicate in English at an appropriate level. “Drivers must be able to communicate with passengers to discuss a route, or fare, as well as reading and understanding important regulatory, safety and travel information. “We are clear that this is crucial to a driver’s role in transporting the public.” TfL did not comment on the specific requirement for exams in written English."
2016-10-17T17:48:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Fresh attempt to end Southern rail strike fails to stop latest walkout,"A fresh attempt to break the deadlock in the Southern rail dispute has failed to stop the second three-day walkout in consecutive weeks, with conductors taking strike action from midnight. Southern’s operator, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said it would restore a £2,000 incentive for staff if controversial new onboard supervisor roles were accepted, and urged the RMT to ballot its members on the offer. But the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union rejected what it described as a “bribe”, and insisted its action would go ahead. Southern will attempt to run about three in five of the trains scheduled in its normal timetable during this week’s strikes. While commuters have grown used to mass cancellations and late-running trains on its routes, GTR claimed the effects of the strike were diminishing, saying that one in four conductors worked last week in spite of the three-day stoppage – a figure rejected by the RMT. Replacement buses will again be provided, despite GTR telling commuters none were available during strikes earlier this year. Charles Horton, GTR’s chief executive, said: “There have been significant developments since the union tabled the original ballot to conductors over six months ago. In order to move things forward, I am asking the union to let conductors – the people at the heart of this matter – determine whether this dispute comes to an end or continues.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “The company have been told repeatedly that money is not the issue and that the safety of passengers and staff is not for sale. RMT disputes the bogus figures on the number of staff working. Our reps at all locations report that morale is high and that support for the strike action remains rock solid.” The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the transport select committee that the industrial relations situation at Southern was “hugely frustrating”. He said he could not understand the union’s position, insisting: “I am not in the business of slashing the number of people working on the railways.” Grayling said changing technology meant trains could operate safely without a conductor, and he repeated that “unofficial wildcat action” was adding to Southern’s problems. Urged by Conservative MP Huw Merriman to help resolve the dispute in direct talks, he said: “I’m not convinced that’s for the best ... I think that could make things worse.” While the RMT has accused the government of hiding behind GTR management in scrapping conductors, Grayling told the committee: “We’re not shaping the strategy, no.” He added that Southern had been “too dysfunctional”, and said “the Network Rail team and GTR have not been working properly together ... there has not been a joined-up response”. Last week, the committee issued a scathing report saying the data showed clearly that Southern had breached its contract and that ministers had failed to monitor the firm. But Grayling reiterated that stripping GTR of its franchise was not on the table, saying: “What would that change?”"
2016-10-17T18:16:58Z,uk-news,UK news,First group of refugee children arrives in Britain from Calais,"An uncle who had not seen his 16-year-old nephew for seven years has been briefly reunited with him as the first group of 14 refugee children arrived in the UK from a camp in Calais. Afghan chef Jan Ghazi, 39, had travelled from his home in Wallington after receiving a call from the Red Cross on Monday morning to tell him Haris was one of the 14 children taken from the camp to the UK as part of the government’s resettlement programme of a few hundred minors. When the minibus left to take the children from the processing centre in Croydon to their overnight accommodation, Ghazi glimpsed his nephew. “I saw him in the window and I shouted to him: ‘Come here – I have come to take you home,’” said Ghazi. They hugged and embraced for about 30 seconds. “He said they said to him they would let us know in 24 hours when we are going to see him.

He is a smart child; I will do my best for him.” Last week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, told MPs the French authorities had agreed to verify a list of 387 child refugees with a legal right to come to the UK drawn up by Citizens UK. “Once we have that official list we will move quickly within days and remove very quickly those children,” she said. Earlier on Monday, Rowan Williams said the safety of up to 400 unaccompanied children stranded in the Calais refugee camp was being put at risk by the government’s “foot-dragging”. The former archbishop of Canterbury said the time was short for the remainder because of the imminent dismantling of the site.
He described the refugee children as “extraordinarily vulnerable” who were trapped in the “chaos of the camp and the chaos of the demolition”.

Writing in the Guardian, Bernard Cazeneuve said there had been a litany of misunderstandings between the two countries but added that there was now an urgent need for a common outlook to tackle a situation “everyone agrees is a disaster”. “From the point of view of some in France, the Calais migrants’ misery is entirely down to the selfishness of the British government,” he wrote. The politician said there was a perception that the UK was using a bilateral agreement with France in an “unscrupulous way, as a means of refusing to take in refugees fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, including unaccompanied children with family connections in the UK”. Cazeneuve argued that neither country was the first entry point for migrants, but said that both could not abdicate their responsibilities in the long run. Under EU laws, a child seeking asylum who has a parent or a sibling in another European country can be fast-tracked to join them in that country. Earlier this year, Alf Dubs forced the government to agree to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees who have no relatives in the UK. Lord Dubs called for a “shared enterprise” between government and charitable organisations working to secure a future home for the children, many of whom have fled wars. The actor Juliet Stevenson, who is supporting Citizens UK’s Safe Passage programme, said of Monday’s arrivals: “Today is a proud moment for Britain. We did the right thing. The arrival of hundreds of vulnerable children from Calais to the UK in the coming days is in no small part due to the tireless campaigning of community leaders, the hard work of Citizens UK’s lawyers, and the Safe Passage team in Calais who have been working to safeguard children for over a year.”"
2016-10-17T19:49:47Z,uk-news,UK news,'You can feel the atmosphere': Britain's Olympians and Paralympians enjoy rainy victory parade,"It started with a firework spectacular on the sun-drenched beaches of Rio de Janeiro, and it ended – with no less of a party – on the rain-soaked streets of Manchester. Tens of thousands of Britons scaled statues, donned ponchos and packed the city’s historic Albert Square to salute the country’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes in a jubilant, if damp, outpouring of pride and patriotism. Wearing gold bowler hats and National Lottery foam fingers, they cheered, whooped, whistled and blew horns as 400 Rio heroes paraded their record haul of 214 medals through Manchester.
With her Olympic gold medal round her neck, Britain’s world champion boxer Nicola Adams sent the crowd into raptures as she danced and shadow-boxed on one of 14 floats that made its way up Deansgate to the Victorian Gothic town hall. “The best moment was seeing everyone that’s turned out. Even though it’s raining we had so much support out there. I’d like to say thank you to everyone who turned up,” she said, before disappearing into the crowd to take selfies with the spectators. There were pantomime boos when Jessica Ennis-Hill, the 2012 Olympic heptathlon champion and Rio silver medallist, confirmed on stage her decision to retire from athletics. Speaking from one of the floats snaking through Manchester, Ennis-Hill said she would step away from the limelight to spend time with her young family before returning to sport in some way. “For the moment I’m just going to have a bit of time away to spend time with Reggie and my family,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I need to think about what I really want to do, something that I enjoy and that I’m passionate about moving forward. I think I’ll definitely stay involved in sport in some way. I love getting people into sport, helping people get active and healthy, that’s something I enjoy and I’m passionate about.”
Maddie “Mad Dog” Hinch, the hockey star whose Olympics heroics helped Team GB edge out the Netherlands to win gold, thanked the Dutch airline KLM after it rescued her when she became stranded in Amsterdam’s Schipol airport on Monday, meaning she nearly missed the celebration. “How weird is that!” she laughed before being ushered on stage. “They’re not holding the gold medal against me too much over there – very ironic that the British airways couldn’t help me out and the Dutch came to the rescue.” Being reunited with her fellow hockey champions was “like the first day of school”, she said. “We all got really emotional on the lorry thing. Even in this weather people are out to see us – it’s absolutely freezing cold and wet and they’ve all still got smiles on their faces. It just shows how much of an impact we’ve had. It’s been a really cool day.” There were huge cheers for Lutalo Muhammad, the taekwondo star who captured the nation’s hearts with his tear-choked interview after he missed out on gold by the narrowest of margins.
Putting the agony of defeat behind him, Muhammad japed around on stage and winked when the BBC presenter Mark Chapman asked if he was going out in Manchester later. “I won’t answer that on-mic,” he said. “To be an Olympic silver medallist is a great achievement and to come home and get a reception like this – thank you Manchester. The parade was brilliant – the fact you all came out when it was pouring down with rain.” Standing in a crowd of thousands at the steps of the town hall, Diane Clarke, the mother of paracanoeist Rob Oliver, said she was “absolutely bursting with pride” at her son’s achievements. Oliver, 28, an aeronautical engineer from Birmingham who is the world’s fifth best paracanoeist, suffered a double break of his right leg in a football accident in 2008. He suffered a series of complications and had 17 operations before the leg was eventually amputated. Then, last year, after winning silver at the world championships in Milan, he was mugged in the street, losing his medal and suffering a serious shoulder injury in the process. Not that any of that stopped him from competing at Rio. “Even coming here today sitting on the train and I said I can’t believe we’re going to Manchester to watch Rob in the Olympic and Paralympic parade. It’s unreal really,” said Clarke, wearing a Team GB scarf and carrying two mascots – named Polly and Jack – that a colleague knitted for good luck. “The Paralympians before they even start training are inspirational. It’s a word that’s used too often but when you see what they go through before they even start competing it is unbelievable,” she said.
“2008 was a vile year and for him to come back from that is amazing. He was very angry, very depressed but through it all he was still Rob – thank God he came back.” Some spectators simply wanted to “give something back”. Jenny Evanson, from Walsall, made the nearly two hour train journey from the Midlands and said she had been “kicked out into the summer house” for cheering so enthusiastically during the summer’s games. Now, she said, she wanted each and every athlete to hear her appreciation in person. “I only decided this morning to come to Manchester but I shouted myself hoarse during the Olympics so I thought I should be here,” she said. “They deserve everything we can give back to them – especially the Paralympic athletes because it takes that bit more.” Decked out in a union flag, Mandeep Singh, from Stretford, Manchester, ditched a giant gold wig so he could show off his turban to the photographers. “I’m the only Sikh guy here,” he beamed. “I’m really proud to be British.” “You can really feel the atmosphere,” he said, before the heavens opened. “I was surprised when they said it was Manchester, I thought it was going to be in London, but it’s great that other cities get to share that culture and look at the athletes.” As the rain-sodden parade wound down to the sound of Rebecca Ferguson singing Heroes, there was gratitude that Manchester – not London – was chosen to reflect the success of athletes from across Britain. “It’s great because Manchester doesn’t get anything like this and it’s inspiring for the kids,” said Angela Garner, huddled underneath a big screen with her eight-year-old daughter, Paige, and 10-year-old son, Kyle. They would not be put off by a little downpour, she said. “It’s Manchester, int it? Not bothered.”
Andy Burnham, the former Labour shadow home secretary who is running to be mayor of Greater Manchester, said the city could now lay good claim to being Britain’s sporting capital. “This is a day that people here, particularly young people, will never forget,” he said. “What unites Greater Manchester, and all of the great towns that make up Greater Manchester, is a passion for sport in all of its forms. “This day will live long in the memory and the reason I, and others, called for it to be here is that Manchester has played a pivotal role in Team GB and Paralympic GB’s success not just in Rio but over three Olympic cycles.”"
2016-10-17T23:01:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Under-18s in army 'face greater injury, death and mental health risks'","Recruiting children aged 16 and 17 into the British army places them at greater risk of death, injury and long-term mental health problems than those recruited as adults, according to a new report. The public health charity Medact uses its report, published on Tuesday, to call for the minimum recruitment age to be raised to 18. “Minimum age laws exist to protect children from smoking, drinking, driving and watching violent films,” said Dr David McCoy, director of Medact. “It’s time for the UK to fall in step with the vast majority of countries and raise the minimum recruitment age to 18.” The UK is the only country in Europe, and only permanent member of the UN security council, to still allow recruitment from age 16. A nationwide poll in 2014 found that 77% of the general public support a rise in the recruitment age to 18. The army’s policy of recruiting children has been strongly criticised by multiple UN and UK parliamentary bodies, child rights organisations and human rights groups. Despite the criticism, Medact found child recruits to the British army are more likely to be deployed on the frontline. In Afghanistan, British soldiers who enlisted at 16 were approximately twice as likely to be killed or injured when compared with soldiers who enlisted when they were over 18. Child recruits are also more vulnerable to suicide, self-harm, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse than adult recruits, the report found. Steve Brown joined the army cadets aged 13 in 1995 and the army three years later. “I became a child soldier in the British army because they’d groomed me since the moment I joined the cadets,” he said. “The army turned up every couple of months with motorcycle displays and other spectacles, and promised us life in the army would be glamorous, fun and well-paid. There was no mention of the downsides, even at the recruitment office itself.”
Brown left the army after his second tour of Iraq in 2006. Now 35, he struggles with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. “A decade after leaving the army, I’m still recovering from the damage it did to me,” he said. “I joined straight out of school, so didn’t have a chance to become an individual. When I left, I realised that I had never learned how to make my own decisions or have my own opinions. Because I’d joined so young, I had been completely moulded by the army and life outside was almost impossible.” The army accepts applications from children aged 15 years and 7 months. In the last financial year, 22.2% of recruits were under 18. New recruits under 18 have to sign terms of service which can prevent them from leaving the army for up to six years. McCoy said that how the UK armed forces recruits children breaches its own definition of “informed consent”. He said: “Full and informed consent of these children is not always gained. There are compliance issues with the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, which the UK has signed.” Young veterans, aged 16-24, are more likely to kill themselves when compared with the general population: between 1984 and 2013, male soldiers aged under 20 were 47% more likely to kill themselves than the same age group in the general population. “These findings are mainly a result of a higher prevalence of pre-service vulnerabilities amongst young recruits to the armed forces,” the report said. The report comes after the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, announced that cadet army units would be expanded in state schools. While the government argues that the cadet programme helps raise pupils’ attainment, campaigners have expressed fears that these units act as a channel of recruitment into the armed forces, and that military activities for children as young as 12 are inappropriate in the educational environment. Citing evidence that military marketing strategies which glamorise war “take advantage” of the tendency of adolescents to be driven by immediate social rewards and risk-taking behaviours, the report also accuses the army of not being truthful enough about life in the military. “The recruitment approach is designed to appeal to adolescent decision-making biases by portraying military life in glamorous terms whilst frequently using terms such as ‘big guns’, ‘awesome armour’ and ‘big boys’ toys’,” the report notes. Recruitment materials “often fail to provide complete and accurate information about the terms and conditions of service for potential recruits”, the report says. They also don’t include information about the difficulties and long-term risks of an armed forces career while briefing materials for parents do not fully explain the demands or risks of military life. “All too often, the claim is made that military life can be good for troubled adolescents,” said McCoy. “The argument is that the military can provide discipline and a sense of purpose for individuals who may be struggling with education, or who are engaged in self-harming or antisocial behaviour. “There are two things wrong with this viewpoint. First, there is evidence that military life may be harmful to the health and wellbeing of those recruited as adolescents,” he said. “Second, there are other ways to support adolescents who are struggling with their education and social situation, and if the military is presented as the only viable option, then the recruitment of under-18s cannot be considered to be consensual.” A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “The armed forces offer young people opportunities that aren’t available elsewhere, from basic literacy education and support for postgraduate degrees, to high-quality accredited training and unique employment prospects. Like everyone who serves our country, under-18s – who can only sign up with formal written consent of a parent or guardian – are fully supported throughout their service career.”
Case study: Wayne Sharrocks My father was in the army but I didn’t consider it as a career until I was 15 and the Iraq war was happening. I was manipulated by the media: soldiers were always referred to as “heroes” and being in the army, fighting these terrorists, was presented as being the noblest thing a man could do. At 15, you desperately want to be a man. I was immature and naive: I didn’t even think about any of the realistic aspects of going to war and no one told me about them. I tried to sign up at 15 but problems with my eyes meant I had to wait. I joined the day I turned 17. The manipulation started immediately: we were battered into following orders without thinking, the loyalty to our unit was absolute and – most psychologically damaging – we had our human instincts destroyed, so killing someone wasn’t a big deal and always being ready to fight was second nature. If I’d been older, perhaps the training wouldn’t have affected me mentally in the way it did. But as a child, I accepted it entirely. My friends now say that I became hyper-aggressive and super-angry as a result of my army training. At the time, I thought that was a really good thing. As I say, I was a child. I had no wider experience of life to give me perspective. I was used by the army. I decided to leave after seeing two colleagues seriously hurt and being badly hurt myself in Afghanistan in 2011. But I was still so brainwashed that it took me a couple of years to actually get out. I spent the next few years in a terrible state. I’d lost my army family, my support system, my bubble of existence. The army promises you qualifications but they’re not transferable: I went from a position of responsibility in the army to spraying kitchen furniture as a civilian. There was nothing else I could do. I eventually had a breakdown. I was going to ask the army to take me back: I thought I couldn’t survive outside it. But I’ve had counselling and am working my way back up. I’m 27 now. The army has taken 10 years of my life. And yes, I’m angry about that. Very angry."
2016-10-18T03:54:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Australian police officer Nick Kaldas joins Stakeknife investigation in Northern Ireland,"A top Australian police officer, Nick Kaldas, is joining an investigation into the alleged murders of IRA members by a British spy codenamed Stakeknife during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The former New South Wales deputy police commissioner who resigned abruptly earlier this year has been asked to join the six-person steering committee leading the investigation.
Stakeknife was a British double agent for about 20 years. He infiltrated the top ranks of the IRA and has been connected to the murders of IRA men. “It’s a complex investigation by any measure and it spans a number of years – the investigations team has already hit the ground running,” Kaldas told Radio National. “I understand they have already undertaken many steps in interviewing witnesses and victims’ families. “I am humbled and quite honoured for an Australian to be asked to be part of this, and I saw it as really important in getting the truth and getting justice and closure for the families of the victims.” Kaldas said he had been approached because of his work investigating the assassinations of 21 people in Lebanon and his extensive homicide investigation experience in Australia. He acknowledged the political sensitivity of investigating the British army for crimes against Irish Catholics during the Troubles but referenced public pressure as one of the main factors behind the investigation.
“I think the pain being felt by the victims’ families, the voices reached an crescendo and they decided to lance the boil, have an inquiry and hopefully that will get everyone closure,” he said. Kaldas will travel to the UK in December. He said the job would be a part-time role. When asked if there had been any restrictions put on him, he responded: “None at all, they want frank and fearless advice and that’s what they are going to get.” Before he resigned from NSW police he signalled an interest in becoming police commissioner. “I’ve always had a passion for serving New South Wales and I absolutely have a passion for serving the men and women in New South Wales police, if called on I would have to seriously consider it, but I am doing other things now and heading in a different direction,” Kaldas said. “I’m in a different space at the moment, I don’t really see that happening in the current environment.”"

2016-10-18T10:55:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"London business chief: we will find a way through Brexit, but government must help","You might say that Colin Stanbridge is in the confidence business. As chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) since 2002, he has worked for the interests of thousands of companies in the capital, most of them small and medium enterprises, over a period when even global financial crisis and domestic austerity failed to derail the nation’s principal economic locomotive. Now comes the turbulence of Brexit. Stanbridge remains upbeat. “Businesses, especially the smaller ones, are very pragmatic,” he says. It is the very first thing he says when asked about the impact of the Leave vote, sitting in his office in Queen Street in the Square Mile. “They may well have been shocked, as many people were, that the vote across the country went the way it did, but I have absolutely no doubt that they will find a way through and that London will find a way through.” The optimistic note is struck against a pessimistic backdrop. The most recent of the LCCCI’s regular Capital 500 surveys, conducted by ComRes during August, unearthed continuing deteriorating expectations that had begun in the run-up to the EU referendum and are now projected into the future. The survey found that during the third quarter of this year, both domestic and export demand for goods and services fell, as did employment levels. It concluded that “on balance, 9% of London businesses expected their overall company prospects to decline, moving into negative territory for the first time”. Stanbridge has called for “solid reassurance” from the government and warned against complacency: “As we said in our Brexit response, no one is panicking. However, there are serious issues the government needs to recognise.” For him, the opportunity side of the Brexit balance sheet is largely about concentrating minds on London’s strengths as a business environment and the value of making them stronger. As employers weigh the pros and cons of re-locating, Stanbridge asks out loud if they really want to ship out to Stuttgart. Or even Paris: “We have a huge number of advantages in terms of the language, the legal system and, actually, very importantly, as a place to live.” The Chamber is urging support for exporters and has renewed long-standing calls for decisive further investment in transport capacity and for greater devolution of powers to London government. The cry is to press boldly ahead with Crossrail 2 and a Crossrail 3; and with new river crossings in the east; and with airport expansion - not just one more runway, but two!: “We need these things. We need them more than ever.” Stanbridge says he wrote to Sadiq Khan and had a meeting with him, urging him to revisit and enlarge on the work of the London Finance Commission (LFC) set up by Boris Johnson, which argued for giving the mayor and the boroughs direct control over the use to which all property taxes raised in the capital were put. Khan, already a convert, did just that. An interim report by LFC2 concludes that there is also “scope to devolve an assigned share of one or more major national taxes,” as a way of facilitating growth, making a better job of tackling deprivation and taking “steps towards a better-run country.” And then there’s the the question of labour. “In our round table discussions with members, the message about talent and migrant workers and the necessity of having those workers in London is huge. We have to find some way to keep them or London will be severely damaged,” Stanbridge says. An advocate of introducing a London-specific work permit or visa, he accepts that the case for foreign migration can be difficult to make. Politicians will speak up for wooing the highly-skilled and qualified but not “the people who keep the hospitals clean and make the Underground run. They may not be, in those terms, highly-skilled workers, but they are vital.” Anticipating objections that London business favours a liberal line on overseas labour because they provide a source of cheap labour, he speaks of his own ancestry: Polish, three generations back, settling in Liverpool. “It’s about the city I want to live in. Some people get angry that they come off the Tubes and buses and don’t hear an English accent in the shops, but I think that’s great. As a citizen of London, I want it to be a city that says, ‘You know what? You come here, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you are law-abiding, then you are a Londoner.’ If we lose that, it’s bad for the city.” Stanbridge dismisses the idea that the Brexit negotiations should be approached as “some kind of poker game” in which the UK’s hand must remain fully concealed. For him, the broad outline of the best possible deal is already perfectly clear, and London should be at the heart of striking it: if you can’t have full access to the single market and the free movement of people at the same time, then you bargain for the nearest to both you can get. It’s about pragmatism. It’s about confidence. It’s about doing business."
2016-10-18T12:14:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow expansion: ministers free to object to pending decision,"Theresa May will allow ministers to express their opposition to airport expansion for a period of time after the decision is made next week, in the strongest signal yet that the government is preparing to back Heathrow’s bid to build a third runway.
The prime minister told colleagues at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that opponents of whatever decision was made would have a “set period” to speak frankly about their opposition. Downing Street would not confirm whether that meant ministers would have a free vote in parliament to oppose the decision. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the education secretary, Justine Greening, are vocal opponents of Heathrow expansion. Crucially, there are no London MPs on the cabinet subcommittee that will make the decision next week. The other two options under consideration are the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick. The committee members are: May; the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the business secretary, Greg Clark; the transport secretary, Chris Grayling; the communities secretary, Sajid Javid; the Scottish secretary, David Mundell; the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom; the chief whip, Gavin Williamson; and the party chair, Patrick McLoughlin.
During cabinet discussions, which lasted more than an hour, May told colleagues she expected any final scheme to be a “boost to business and competitiveness” and that the decision would be taken in the national interest.
Her spokeswoman said: “The prime minister wanted to approach this in a mature way, recognising that a number of ministers have long held views on this issue. And in light of that there would be a certain period of time after the committee had taken its decision where they would be able to express those views and they would not be expected to publicly support the government’s decision.” May was to write to colleagues on Tuesday afternoon to set out the precise details of how the process would work, and the period of time when Tories would be able to speak their mind on the issue. Downing Street said most cabinet members spoke during the meeting, but there was consensus that a decision needed to be made as soon as possible. The spokeswoman hinted that ministers would eventually have to accept the government’s decision. “The decision will be subject to the ministerial code, in the usual way, including the rules of collective responsibility, but with this special arrangement for a limited time. She would not confirm if the period would cover the timescale for a vote in the Commons. “Once a decision has been taken, certain ministers who have long-held views or particular constituency interests will have some flexibility to set out their personal position.” No 10 said it was “not the expectation” that ministers would be able to actively campaign against the decision that was taken. Johnson has previously vowed to lie down in front of bulldozers if they started work on the third runway. Of the MPs on the committee, Javid is the only one who has expressed strong public support for Heathrow expansion. Both May and Hammond have expressed tepid concerns about a third runway in the past, and the local council in May’s Maidenhead constituency is one of those vowing legal action if expansion goes ahead. In 2008, May said she was concerned that if Heathrow expansion goes ahead the quality of life for her constituents “will deteriorate significantly”. However, she has been tight-lipped on the issue since entering the cabinet in 2010. Hammond, a former transport secretary, has also historically expressed concerns about congestion and pollution from Heathrow, saying the airport should improve rather than expand. However, he is understood to be open to the economic case for expansion. Asked why there was no London MP on the committee, May’s spokeswoman said: “This is about national infrastructure. One of the things that came through in the discussion was the importance of this for regions across the UK and making sure that, as we take a national infrastructure decision, we take it on the basis of creating a country that works for everyone.” Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate, has said he would resign and trigger a parliamentary byelection if the government approves Heathrow, with his constituency one of the worst affected by the flight path. Goldsmith, who is popular locally, is considering running in any subsequent byelection, leaving May with a difficult decision over whether to stand a Tory candidate against him, or risk reducing her majority. The Liberal Democrats, who also oppose Heathrow expansion, are thought to be preparing an all-out assault in an attempt to win the west London seat, which recorded one of the highest remain votes in the EU referendum, though Goldsmith voted to leave. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, made it clear that party policy was to support Heathrow expansion, which is overwhelmingly backed by some of the country’s largest trade unions, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency contains Heathrow, are opposed to expansion. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “Suspending collective responsibility to avoid a tricky vote is something that Corbyn does to try and paper over the massive schisms in his party, and now, it seems, the prime minister has taken a leaf out of his book. “The Conservative party made a ‘no ifs, no buts’ promise to people in west London – waiving collective responsibility to save the hides of a couple of ministers will not fly. People will remember this and hold the Tories to account for their actions.”"
2016-10-18T15:28:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Child abuse inquiry insider 'told Home Office about Goddard concerns in April',"Serious concerns about the leadership of the chair of the national child abuse inquiry were taken to the top of the Home Office under Theresa May months before officials claimed they were aware of any reservations. It also emerged on Tuesday that relations between the leading panel members on the £100m inquiry and its chair, Dame Lowell Goddard – who was appointed by May in 2015 – were so bad that a professional facilitator was recruited to try to aid communications between them. May’s knowledge of the worries held by panel members about the leadership of the New Zealand judge she appointed came under intense scrutiny by MPs on the home affairs select committee on Tuesday. Dru Sharpling, a panel member, told the committee that she raised concerns about Goddard’s leadership with the director general of the Home Office in April this year – nine months after the panel began their work with Goddard. At the time, May – who set up the inquiry and as prime minister maintains a strong personal interest in it – was running the Home Office. But one of her officials – Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary to the Home Office – repeatedly denied that he or May were made aware of the Sharpling meeting with the Home Office official. He maintained that the first the Home Office knew of problems about the leadership of Goddard and the worsening relationship between the chair and her panel was on 29 July this year. Six days later, Goddard resigned, leaving the inquiry without a chair for the third time since it began in July 2014. Labour MP David Winnick accused Sedwill and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, of “shabbily misleading” the committee last month when giving evidence about Goddard’s departure. Rudd told MPs that Goddard had quit because she was a long way from home and was lonely. She made no mention of the Home Office being made aware of the panel’s concerns about the New Zealand judge in April this year. Sedwill said the home secretary had been responding to questions about Goddard’s motivation for leaving, and had not been aware of earlier concerns raised with officials. Neither he nor the then home secretary May had been made aware of Sharpling’s meeting with the director general, he said. In an at times defensive performance before MPs, the panel members said they were determined to carry out the remit of the inquiry and come up with robust recommendations to prevent children being abused within institutions in the future. Sharpling, responding to questions about the departure of Goddard, revealed that she had informed Mary Calam, the Home Office director general for the crime and policing group, on 26 April about the concerns with Goddard’s leadership. Responding to allegations reported in the media that Goddard was racist and abusive to staff on the inquiry, Sharpling said: “I am not going to engage in the sort of character issues that have been published across the papers. It seems to me to be entirely inappropriate. These are matters which are not something that ought to be played out in the public domain.” Professor Alexis Jay, the new chair of the inquiry, also refused to go into details about why the panel had difficulties with Goddard, except to say they had concerns about her “leadership and the progress of the inquiry”. Jay said Goddard had made it clear she wanted to work alone and had kept panel members at a distance. Giving evidence alongside Sharpling and inquiry panel member Ivor Frank, the trio refused to comment on the departure of three senior lawyers since Jay took up her position. These departures have included that of lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC. Jay said the inquiry had never been in crisis. “This inquiry has always been bigger than any single person,” she said. Frank revealed that the challenges in the relationship between the panel and Goddard were so great that a professional facilitator was hired in an attempt to improve the relationship. The panel members insisted that the turbulence had not impacted on the work of the inquiry and that there had been achievements, including the gathering of evidence in private from 200 individuals via the “truth project”. Despite criticism of her lack of legal expertise and background as a social worker, Jay said she believed she had the support of many victims and survivor groups, though she acknowledged that many were unhappy at her appointment. Jay said she had never in her life been accused of tolerating bullying or offensive behaviour but could not comment on the allegations in the press against Goddard. In correspondence published by the inquiry, Tim Loughton, the acting chair, made clear to Goddard that if she did not agree to give further evidence to the inquiry, either in person or via video link, she may be open to parliamentary censure. Loughton told the New Zealand judge in a letter dated 14 October: “I would just add that committee members have asked me to make clear that, if you are unwilling to comply with this further request to cooperate with our formal scrutiny role as a parliamentary select committee by giving oral evidence, we may well feel it necessary to draw this refusal to parliament’s attention in any report we produce on the recent events affecting the independent inquiry. That report would of course be published and the issue would then be a matter of public record.”"
2016-10-18T16:40:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Man claims self-defence after admitting killing Oxford antiques dealer,"A Peterborough man who admits killing an antiques dealer at his home in Oxford has claimed he was defending himself after the dealer attacked him with a knife when he made a bad joke. Michael Danaher, 50, is accused of murdering Adrian Greenwood on 6 April after drawing up a “hitlist” of celebrities and businesspeople to rob and kidnap. A jury at Oxford crown court has heard that Greenwood died as a result of 16 stab wounds, 20 further knife wounds and multiple blunt force injuries. Danaher told the court that he killed Greenwood during a struggle, but denied he had gone to his home intending to rob him of a £50,000 first edition of The Wind in the Willows, which the dead man had listed for sale on eBay eight months earlier. He denies the charge of murder. Rather, the defendant said, he was visiting the dealer to discuss buying cheap secondhand books. After an “interesting conversation”, he said he made a limp joke about another man whom Greenwood had been expecting. At this point, Danaher told the jury, the dealer had suddenly called him an “obese tosser”, his face like “the angriest man in Britain”, before shoving him to the ground and going to fetch a knife. He told Amjad Malik QC, defending: “My jokes are not necessarily funny but I have never had that effect on anyone.” He wrestled with Greenwood on the floor of his hallway in an attempt to defend himself, he said, before the other man “just stopped” and lay motionless on the floor. Danaher said he was unsure if Greenwood was alive or dead, but he had decided to rob him of a number of items including the copy of The Wind in the Willows, a camera and his wallet, because, “I wanted to pay him in some way for attacking me”. Danaher has previously told the court that a “hitlist” found on his laptop entitled “Enterprises”, which listed a number of targets for robbery and kidnap including Greenwood and celebrities Kate Moss and Jeffrey Archer, was not created by him but by a mystery man whom he would not name. He said the unidentified man was also responsible for repeated searches on his laptop for the home addresses of other celebrities including Eamonn Holmes and Rio Ferdinand, and that it had been this man, not him, who had earlier attempted to force his way into the home of Adrian Beecroft, a wealthy businessman, before being foiled. The unnamed man had taken Danaher’s car and mobile phone, which is why they were traced to the Beecroft family’s Hampstead home at the time of the attempt, he said. But Oliver Saxby QC, cross-examining for the crown, said the reason Danaher was not prepared to name the other man was that “he doesn’t exist”. “Your counsel called him ‘Unknown man’. He’s ‘Made-up man’, isn’t he? Utterly made-up man.” Danaher said: “No, he’s not.” Saxby listed 20 coincidences in the accused’s account of the other man which he said were “too far fetched to be true”. One was the fact that Greenwood’s name appeared on the “Enterprises” list, which Danaher says the other man drew up, Saxby said. “He seems to have been plotting to rob by any means necessary somebody whom you ended up killing and then stealing from. And that person wasn’t a well-known figure, he was a 42-year-old rare book dealer from Oxford. “That’s a whacking great coincidence, isn’t it?” the barrister asked. “Potentially, yes,” said Danaher. Saxby asked the defendant why he had not mentioned the unidentified man when he was arrested on 10 April or at any point until 4 October, at the start of the trial, when he was first shown the full timeline of the prosecution’s case. “It’s a complete and utter fabrication,” he said. The accused said he had mentioned the other man to his solicitor “ages ago”. The case continues."
2016-10-18T17:01:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man found dead on board lorry near Ashford, Kent","A man suspected of trying to smuggle himself into Britain illegally has been found dead inside a lorry that entered the UK from Calais, and may have been killed after its load crushed him to death. Owners of the Airport Cafe in Sellindge, near Ashford, Kent, called police at around 8.30am on Tuesday, after a distressed lorry driver reported a body trapped between pallets of catalogues for children’s retailer Jojo Maman Bébé. Paramedics from the South East Coast ambulance service (Secamb) pronounced the man dead at the scene. It is understood the man, described as African in appearance, managed to evade border checks at Calais, where other would-be immigrants were detected, and again at Dover. It is not known at what point during the journey he was killed. Pat Breen, 65, co-owner of the Airport Cafe, said the driver had parked the lorry and approached a member of his staff. “He was obviously a bit panicked, saying ‘politsky, politsky’,” Breen said. “The wife spoke to him, he took her over to the lorry and asked her to go into the back. In the back, she saw a leg sticking out. The person didn’t seem to move or respond to any noise or shouting, so she assumed ... “Her immediate thing was to come back and phone the police. She said she thought the person was probably dead. All the [emergency] services came. “Since then we’ve found out that the driver reported immigrants at Calais in his vehicle. The vehicle was searched, they found immigrants and they removed them all, apart from the one that was hidden. [The lorry] was again checked at Dover; a dog was sent on which failed to find him. And at some time, the load was shifted and he was crushed between it.” Breen said it was clear that the pallets holding the magazines had moved during the journey, trapping the man, who had attempted to conceal himself between them. “He’d gone down between the pallets, I’m assuming it moved across and crushed him and he couldn’t breathe,” he said. “He’d disguised himself in the lorry by covering himself in these magazines, and apparently he’d taken cling film off the pallets to wrap himself in, to keep warm overnight or something.” A spokeswoman for Kent fire and rescue service said firefighters had used a forklift truck to remove the load to allow officers and paramedics access to the man’s body. Secamb sent two paramedic cars and an ambulance to the incident. “Sadly the man was pronounced dead at the scene,” a spokesman said. Kent police issued a statement stating they were called to the scene at 8.29am. “It is believed the lorry had travelled from France and inquiries are on-going to identify the man and ascertain the cause of death,” they added."
2016-10-18T17:19:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Two injured in roof collapse at Manchester Victoria station,"Two people were injured after heavy rain caused roof panels to collapse at Victoria railway station in Manchester. The panels within the roof linking the Grade II-listed station buildings buckled owing to rain water, witnesses said. The incident at the city’s second largest mainline railway station came after recent refurbishment work to the roof. Police confirmed on Tuesday that two people suffered head injuries and were taken to hospital. A small part of the concourse was fenced off and photographs posted on social media showed the bulging roof.
Managers at Northern Rail, which runs the station, said the two people involved in the incident, just after 4.30pm, were not seriously injured. A spokeswoman said one plastic roof panel above platforms one and two had collapsed. “It has not disrupted the station and services are running as normal,” she added. “Two customers are being seen by paramedics. They are not seriously injured. No platforms are closed.” The station’s new 8,500 sq metre roof over its new concourse links the original station’s buildings. The “bubble roof” was the central part of a £44m upgrade. Daniel Pratt, 25, a witness, said a “tidal wave” of water from the roof collapse landed on a train and a platform where people were walking. He said a group of between 20 and 30 commuters were hit. “About a tonne of water dropped down and the train took the brunt of it but there was a big group of people who it landed on too, and one woman I saw who was knocked down and didn’t get up,” he said. “I don’t know if she was knocked out but she didn’t move. She looked like she was in her 30s. I think it’s a fabric roof in different segments and one or two segments must have been damaged so the water wasn’t draining then suddenly it just collapsed. It was like the huge wave you get on the log flume at a theme park. I hope no one was injured.”"
2016-10-18T17:28:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour peers under fire for backing expansion of surveillance powers,"Privacy campaigners have expressed anger over a vote by 64 Labour peers to back an expansion of state surveillance powers, within hours of a ruling by top judges that the spying agencies unlawfully scooped up personal confidential information on a massive scale for more than a decade. The Labour peers voted with the government to ensure that major new powers are handed to the security services to get access to records tracking every citizen’s web use for the past 12 months.
The Liberal Democrat attempt to delete the powers to order the collection and storage of the new internet connection records from the investigatory powers bill in the House of Lords was voted down by 75 to 292. It was notable that neither the former Labour home secretary Lord Blunkett nor the new shadow attorney general, and former Liberty director, Lady Chakrabarti, took part in the vote. The 64 Labour peers who voted with the government included frontbench spokespersons, Lady Hayter and Lord Rosser and the party’s chief whip, Lord Bassam. The vote came just hours after the ruling by the investigatory powers tribunal, the only court to hear complaints against MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, that the security services had until 2015 secretly and illegally collected huge volumes of confidential data of millions of British citizens without adequate or safeguards. The Labour peers’ vote also contrasted with a sharp attack on the investigatory powers bill by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who described it as “draconian” and said the ruling demonstrated why it needed amending. “The latest ruling from the investigatory powers tribunal should be a sharp reminder that we should not lightly hand over powers to the security services and police and that greater accountability is needed. The government’s bill needs amending in all these areas,” said Abbott, who has sharpened Labour’s approach to the bill since the party abstained on its Commons second reading. The Lib Dem Lord Paddick said: “Labour’s decision not to back us in opposing this huge intrusion into our privacy shows once and for all that they cannot claim to be the party of civil liberties, regardless of who sits on their benches. “Internet connection records are ill-conceived and disproportionate and no doubt this fight will continue in the courts.” Jim Killock, the Director of the Open Rights Group also strongly criticised the Labour peers. He said: “Labour did not table any serious amendments to this draconian legislation in the House of Lords. Labour is simply failing to hold the government to account. “The Labour Lords had an opportunity to improve the IP bill and make it closer to becoming a surveillance law fit for a democracy not a dictatorship. They could have called for proposals to record UK citizens’ web browsing history to be scrapped or demanded that the police need independent authorisation to access our data.” But Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith told the Guardian: “It’s pretty rich for the Lib Dems to question our peers over this, when a number of their own side also voted against the amendment. It’s also the case that we were voting to protect a concession achieved earlier in the day – and which follows our general strategy towards the bill, to try and improve it wherever necessary. “The impressive work of Labour colleagues in the Commons during the report stage there and our own shadow home affairs team in the Lords has contributed significantly to the government’s tabling of over 300 amendments to its own bill – including on greater safeguards against abuse,” Lady Smith said. “Appalling as the tribunal ruling is, it is historic and the regimes used to hold and collect data since 2015 have been legal and appropriate. This bill updates and improves the framework used by agencies and the way existing investigatory powers are authorised. It also enables, for the first time, judicial commissioners to veto warrant approvals made by the home secretary.” The peers secured a concession that access to web browsing histories should not be given to the police involved in investigations into offences that carried a prison sentence of less than 12 months. The government had proposed the threshold should be six months."
2016-10-18T18:16:04Z,uk-news,UK news,May puts Heathrow vote on hold to avoid Tory resignations,"Theresa May has retreated from holding a parliamentary vote on airport expansion this autumn after the government was warned that Tory MPs could resign their seats if ministers backed a third runway at Heathrow. Two Conservative sources said Downing Street had been warned by whips that May could face resignations and byelections in seats that could be lost to the Liberal Democrats in south-west London. The prime minister appeared to prepare the way for a decision in favour of expansion at Heathrow on Tuesday, as she revealed cabinet responsibility would be suspended for longstanding opponents of airport expansion in west London. This would allow Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to carry on voicing dissent on behalf of their constituents. However, May also signalled there may not be a major vote in parliament on the issue until winter 2017/18, despite the belief of senior government and opposition figures that a vote would take place this autumn. One of the MPs who has long been threatening to trigger a contest is Zac Goldsmith, who would be likely to stand as an independent with the support of his local party. He may resign at the point of a decision in favour of Heathrow or put this off until after a formal Commons vote on the issue. Tania Mathias, the Twickenham MP who won her seat from Vince Cable last year, is reported by the Evening Standard to support Goldsmith’s decision to trigger a byelection, even though it is strictly against party rules to support anyone standing against an official candidate. May outlined her timetable on Tuesday in a letter to cabinet colleagues, saying cabinet ministers with longstanding opposition to the chosen option could dissent publicly as long as they do not campaign against the government or speak against it in parliament. However, her official spokeswoman could not say whether Conservative MPs would eventually be given a free vote when the final decision is put before parliament. Asked how many ministers have threatened to resign over the decision on aviation strategy, she said: “I’m not keeping a tally.” Downing Street sources said May had not categorically ruled out holding a preliminary vote before winter of next year, but pointed out the only legal requirement was for a vote in the final stages, when a national policy statement needed for planning purposes is put to parliament for approval. One Tory backbencher said the parliamentary vote had been put off because of increasing nervousness about resignations. The decision suggests she is not strong enough to whip her cabinet in favour of a pro-Heathrow decision, although her official spokeswoman rejected the idea that partially suspending collective responsibility on this issue was a sign of weakness. Richard Burden, the shadow roads minister, said: “Downing Street’s memo proves once again that ministers are more concerned about managing divisions in the Conservative party than tackling the vital issue of airport capacity … If the cabinet are now going to be allowed to go their separate ways on this, why could they not have decided to do that a year ago?” The Liberal Democrats accused the government of “kicking the can down the road” and breaking the Conservative party’s promise to people in west London. May allowed a discussion of airport capacity at cabinet on Tuesday morning, but the final decision on whether to back expansion at Heathrow or Gatwick will be taken by a smaller subcommittee by the end of this month. They will choose between three options examined by the Airports Commission, led by Sir Howard Davies: a third runway at Heathrow, which was the preferred choice, the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick. The commission, established under the coalition government more than four years ago, gave a “clear and unanimous” verdict in July 2015 in favour of building a third runway at Heathrow, costing an estimated £17.6bn. But ministers have since almost entirely referred to Davies’ shortlist, delivered in 2013, which included a £7.1bn second runway at Gatwick, as well as the Heathrow hub scheme, an alternative £13.5bn proposal for Heathrow to expand an existing runway. Members of the subcommittee include May, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Sajid Javid, a vocal supporter of Heathrow expansion, but not Johnson, Greening, or any other MPs from the London area. A Heathrow spokeswoman said the process was what the airport had expected, with a parliamentary vote necessary on a national policy statement. She said: “This is the expected and appropriate political process; there is no delay. Government announces its preferred option, consults on that position and publishes a national policy statement, which parliament then approves. Heathrow then applies for planning permission with support of government policy.” She added: “Heathrow expansion has the support of the majority of MPs. In recent polling, 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs back a new runway at Heathrow.” Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told the transport select committee on Monday that parliament would eventually have to vote on a national policy statement, which could only be published following a period of public consultation, to allow a new runway to be built. Opponents of expansion said that the legislative timetable was “normal procedure”. John Stewart of Hacan, who chaired the campaign against Heathrow’s third runway last time it was approved by the government, said: “You could argue that they have given themselves a fair bit of time to publish the statement and hold the consultation, but the letter appears to be setting out what would be normal procedure, not any real delay.” The winning airport would expect to secure planning permission by 2021 and not open a new runway before 2025. A new study suggested the need for urgent airport expansion by 2030 could be diminished by Brexit, as the number of UK air passengers could be around 25 million fewer than forecast by government – or more than the entire annual traffic of Stansted. Although airports have argued that Britain’s future isolation from the European Union requires rapid investment in airport capacity, the analysis by economists from airline industry body Iata predicts UK air traffic will tail off in the next two years, having experienced four years of rapid growth before the EU referendum. If membership of the European Common Aviation Area is forfeited, Iata’s report warns, the impact would be “front-loaded” and the costs of air travel to the UK would remain higher for decades, dampening demand. However, the weaker overall demand will make little difference to the main contenders for a new runway in south-east England, with Heathrow having effectively reached capacity in 2011, and forecasts predicting Gatwick’s subsequent rapid growth taking it to capacity by the next decade if not before."
2016-10-18T23:01:15Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's Prevent counter-radicalisation policy 'badly flawed',"The British government’s key counter-radicalisation policy is badly flawed, potentially counterproductive and risks trampling on the basic rights of young Muslims, a new study has concluded. Following a nine-month examination of the programme known as Prevent, the Open Society Justice Initiative has recommended a major government rethink, particularly on its use in the education and health systems.
The US-based NGO studied 17 cases in which individuals had apparently fallen foul of the Prevent programme, or had been referred to a sister programme, called Channel, both of which are intended to prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism. They included instances in which information was apparently gathered from Muslim primary school children without their parents’ consent; Prevent being used to bypass disciplinary processes during the attempted dismissal of a school dinner lady; a 17-year-old referred to the police by his college authorities because he had become more religious; and the cancellation of university conferences on Islamophobia. It is the second time in three months that Prevent has faced criticisms following a major study. In July, another NGO, Rights Watch UK, concluded that the programme stifles free speech. A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that the programme may stifle healthy discussion and debate. The Justice Initiative report, entitled Eroding Trust, says: “The current Prevent strategy suffers from multiple, mutually reinforcing structural flaws, the foreseeable consequence of which is a serious risk of human rights violations. “These violations include, most obviously, violations of the right against discrimination, as well the right to freedom of expression, among other rights. Prevent’s structural flaws include the targeting of ‘pre-criminality’, ‘non-violent extremism’, and opposition to ‘British values’.” This leads the government to interfere in everyday lawful discourse, the report says. “Furthermore, Prevent’s targeting of non-violent extremism and ‘indicators’ of risk of being drawn into terrorism lack a scientific basis. Indeed, the claim that non-violent extremism – including ‘radical’ or religious ideology – is the precursor to terrorism has been widely discredited by the British government itself, as well as numerous reputable scholars.” The report says that there is cause for serious concern about the treatment of children who come into contact with the Prevent programme, arguing that the best interests of the child are not always regarded as a primary consideration. It says that the statutory responsibility on public bodies to take steps to prevent radicalisation, introduced under the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, jeopardises health bodies’ responsibility of confidentiality to their patients. Finally, the report says there are serious indications that Prevent is counter-productive. According to police figures, only around 20% of the people referred to in the Channel programme are subsequently assessed as being at risk of being drawn into violent extremism. The report concludes: “Being wrongly targeted under Prevent has led some Muslims to question their place in British society.” Among the case studies in the report is that of a four-year-old who drew a picture of a cucumber while at nursery, and then told staff it was a “cuker-bum”. The staff, believing he was referring to something called a cooker bomb, told the child’s mother that he was being referred to Channel, and might be taken away from her. In her panic, the mother says she instructed the boy to stop drawing pictures. She is quoted in the report as saying: “I’ve never felt not British. And this made me feel very, very, like they tried to make me feel like an outsider. We live here. I am born and bred here, not from anywhere else. I feel this Prevent duty is picking on you because you are Muslim, Asian, Pakistani, or whatever. I don’t feel it’s working at all. They need to look at it and change it.” The Prevent programme was launched in 2003, but its existence went unacknowledged by the government for some years. Earlier this year the Guardian disclosed that one component of Prevent has been a covert propaganda campaign that aims to bring about “attitudinal and behavioural change” among young British Muslims. Among the people interviewed as part of the study was Sir David Omand, who was the UK’s security and intelligence co-ordinator when the Prevent programme was launched. He said he would not have placed it on a statutory footing, on the grounds that “if you can persuade people of why it benefits everyone to do what you consider best, you will get a more positive response than you would if you simply instructed them on what you want them to do”. Omand also stressed the need for public support for the programme: “The key issue is, do most people in the community accept [Prevent] as protective of their rights? If the community sees it as a problem, then you have a problem.” The author of the report, Amrit Singh, said: “This report shows that Prevent is a serious problem, not only because it creates a systemic risk of human rights violations, but also because it is counterproductive. We urge the government as well as health and education bodies to heed the voices in this report and abandon the fundamentally flawed aspects of this strategy.” The Justice Initiative is calling on the government to commission a public inquiry into the programme, publish whatever scientific data it possesses relating to extremism risk assessments, halt the targeting of non-violent extremism, and to place the health and education systems outside its remit. It is also calling on the Children’s Commissioners for England, Wales and Scotland to assess the impact of Prevent on children. Responding to the report, the security minister Ben Wallace said: “The threat from radicalisation, both Islamist and extreme rightwing, is very real. Helping to protect those vulnerable to radicalisation is challenging but absolutely necessary work. It is disappointing to see conclusions that risk damaging work that is essential to keeping vulnerable people safe from extremism and terrorism. “The findings contain inaccuracies and lack balance. They take no account of the severe nature of the terrorism threat and nor do they offer any solutions for how we protect vulnerable individuals.”"
2016-10-19T09:06:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May accused of 'dither and delay' over Heathrow expansion,"Theresa May has been accused of “dither and delay” by Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, after putting off a parliamentary vote on airport expansion for another year. There are strong signs that a cabinet committee will decide next week to back expansion at Heathrow after the prime minister set out plans to let ministers such as Boris Johnson and Justine Greening carry on opposing the government’s position. However, May also appears to have shelved plans for a parliamentary vote on the issue this autumn after being warned of possible Conservative resignations in south-west London, including Zac Goldsmith, who would be prepared to run as an independent. Khan, who backs expansion at Gatwick, said he thought the prime minister needed to be more decisive about airport expansion after so many years of delay.
“The government’s decision to yet again delay deciding where to build a new runway will cause unnecessary uncertainty for British businesses already struggling with Brexit,” he said. “Now, more than ever, businesses need certainty and stability in order to make investment decisions and to keep jobs in Britain. Instead they are getting dither and delay.” May appeared to later confirm there would be no vote for at least a year when pressed about the timetable in the House of Commons. “This month, this government will take a decision on the appropriate site for expanded airport capacity in the south east,” she said. “This is a subject that has been debated, discussed, speculated on for 40 years. This government will take a decision. But there is then a formal process that has to be undertaken. The government will identify its preferred option of site. That will then go to a statutory consultation. The government will then consider the results of the statutory consultation and bring forward an airports national planning statement on which this house will vote.” Sir John Armitt, a former member of the Airports Commission that backed a third runway at Heathrow in 2015, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that it was a step forward for a government decision to be made next week. He said he was “pretty confident” there was support in the House of Commons and across the country for Heathrow expansion. But he added: “It is another delay and I am not quite sure why it takes a year for that debate to take place because there has been a lot of consultation and MPs are well up to speed on this issue. I would have hoped it could have taken place sooner than a year’s time.”
Grant Shapps, the former Tory co-chairman, said more “guts and authority” was needed and he was “sorry this is going to be fudged for another year”. Speaking to the International Business Times, Goldsmith said on Wednesday morning that Heathrow could still be stopped by “more years of dithering and delay”. Goldsmith, the former Conservative mayoral candidate, added: “For my part, I made a promise some years ago, and I will honour it. But for now I am concentrating on winning the arguments.” Two Conservative sources told the Guardian on Tuesday that Downing Street had been warned by whips that May could face resignations and byelections in seats that could be lost to the Liberal Democrats in south-west London when there is a vote on Heathrow expansion.

2016-10-19T11:30:06Z,uk-news,UK news,How York Minster bellringers' sacking blew the lid off bitter dispute,"Behind a locked door in York Minster, 100 stone steps spiral up to the door of the bell chamber. A second key is needed to enter the room, revealing spectacular views over the city and surrounding countryside. At its centre hang thick ropes leading up to 14 bells, with the heaviest weighing in at three tonnes. It was in this chamber that the minster’s volunteer campanologists regularly gathered to make music, exercising a creative skill that was regarded by many as the best in the country. But that all ended last Tuesday, when the 30-strong bellringing team was summoned at short notice to a meeting which blew the lid off the tensions that been simmering for months within the walls of the 15th-century cathedral. According to bellringers’ accounts, those present were abruptly told they were being sacked. A few minutes were allowed for questions, then letters were handed to the assembled men and women, some of whom had been members of the York Minster Society of Change Ringers for decades. The minster’s famous bells would be silent forthwith. A new team of volunteers under a paid head bellringer was to be recruited in the new year. Those present were welcome to reapply. The reasons for the move were given as health and safety and risk management.
By the time the meeting was over, the locks to the tower had already been changed, even though all the numbered keys were held by the eight-strong force of York Minster police and only handed to bellringers on request. (York Minster is one of only seven churches in the world to have a dedicated police force.) The shocked ringers say they offered to go to the tower to change the bells’ position from up to down, safer for a period of abeyance. Their offer was declined; the next day the minster brought in a specialist from Taylor’s Bell Foundry in Loughborough to do the job for a substantial fee. The news of the bellringers’ dismissal caused an outcry. Dave Taylor, the lord mayor of York, described the move as “shocking and unreasonable” and York Central MP Rachael Maskell said it had been “disproportionate”. Some of the bellringers expressed anger and dismay on social media, and messages of support poured in from around the country. Six days after the meeting, John Sentamu, the archbishop of York and the second most senior person in the Church of England, held a press conference at which he disclosed that a safeguarding issue lay behind the mass dismissal. Reading a statement from the minster’s governing body, the Chapter of York, Sentamu said: “Earlier this summer it was necessary for the chapter to take action regarding a member of the bellringing community on safeguarding grounds. This came after complex multi-agency activity involving the City of York council, York diocese safeguarding adviser and the Church of England’s national safeguarding officer.” Since then, some campanologists had “consistently challenged the chapter’s authority on this and other important matters”, he added. Decisive action had been required. “This is why the chapter took the decision to disband the bellringing team last week.” Few of the people closely involved in the drama were willing to speak on the record this week. But accounts from both sides suggest that the dispute centres on David Potter, a leading figure in the bellringing team who has been the subject of two police investigations following allegations made in 1999 and 2015. On neither occasion were charges brought.
In January 2000, days after Potter had been awarded an MBE for bellringing services over three decades, he was suspended as ringing master at York Minster and from his job as a teacher after claims of indecent assault. The following month, the police said he would not be charged. Last year, Potter was the subject of another police investigation. “In June 2015 North Yorkshire police applied for a sexual risk order following concerns raised during multi-agency safeguarding processes about a 66-year-old York man and his contact with children,” the force said in a statement. “The order was initially granted by York magistrates court on an interim basis pending final determination. Ultimately the court refused to grant a sexual risk order, but other safeguarding measures were put in place by other authorities.” Despite the court’s conclusion, senior officials at the minster are understood to have read testimonies and other material which led them to conclude that steps needed to be taken. The Church of England, conscious of its past failures regarding survivors of sexual abuse, is determined to do better in protecting children, young people and vulnerable adults. Whereas in the past allegations of abuse were often ignored, dismissed or covered up, the church now favours swift action where it feels it is appropriate. In July, Potter was excluded by York Minster from its team of volunteer bellringers on safeguarding grounds. Potter could not be reached for comment, but his solicitor has been quoted as saying “the process that he has been subject to has shown a disregard for due process and equally the treatment of his fellow bellringers”.
Other members of the bellringing team rallied round their former captain. Some say there followed an attempt to frustrate the church’s safeguarding efforts, particularly by members of Potter’s extended family, who form the core of the team of bellringers. As ranks closed, the minster authorities were forced to act to regain control of the bell tower. It was in the hands of a “fiefdom”, said one church insider. On the other side of the bitter dispute, Potter’s supporters accuse the minster’s dean, Vivienne Faull, of being a “control freak” – although she is highly regarded within the church for her competence, energy, warmth and honesty. Potter’s friends say both allegations were found to be groundless. “These days all you have to say is that someone touched you 20 years ago. Everyone’s absolutely petrified. You can easily become a sitting target,” said one. The friend said the bellringers were “close-knit group, but not secretive or closed – there are no funny handshakes. They’ve always welcomed new ringers, although you have to choose carefully so they’re cautious about who they let in.” Teaching bellringing involves physical proximity. “The learner is encompassed physically while learning to pull the ropes. Navigating the accepted limits and boundaries of physical contact can be difficult,” said one vicar who has had to deal with safeguarding issues within his bellringing team. Between 30,000 and 40,000 bellringers operate in about 5,000 churches in the UK, according to Kate Flavell of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers. It takes about 10 hours to learn the basic technique “but a long time – years – to perfect it”, she said. Some bellringers became “wild enthusiasts”, practising in different churches every night of the week, she added. In York, the bells will remain silent until a new ringing team is in place. A week after the dismissals, more than 16,000 people had signed a petition urging the minster to permit the sacked ringers to ring the bells on Remembrance Sunday and at Christmas. A former ringing master, Peter Sanderson, accused the chapter of “doublespeak [that] would hardly be out of place in George Orwell’s most famous work”. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the minster said: “We remain committed to embedding a strong safeguarding culture across the minster despite the protests that have resulted from our actions.” • This article was amended on 20 October 2016. An earlier version said that York Minster and St Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican are the only churches in the world to have dedicated police forces. They are in fact two of seven churches in the world to have dedicated police forces."
2016-10-19T12:03:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Muslim leader jailed for life after hiring hitman to kill mosque rival,"A Muslim leader has been jailed for life after hiring a hitman to execute his rival in cold blood following a bitter dispute over control of a controversial mosque. Khalid Rashad, 63, a Muslim convert, is the brother of Liz Mitchell, the lead singer in the 1970s band Boney M, famous for disco hits such as Rivers of Babylon, Rasputin and Daddy Cool. She appeared as a character witness in his trial, held in January this year, explaining how they had grown up in a large Christian family in Jamaica. The case can finally be reported at the end of a second trial in which Rashad was convicted of possessing military-grade plastic explosives and rounds of ammunition at his home, yards from Wembley stadium. In the first case, Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, was found slumped in the driver’s seat of his VW Passat in a street in Wembley, north London, with the engine still running and bullet wounds in his chest in April last year. There was speculation that the preacher could have been murdered by a Syrian hitman when it emerged that he had been a vocal opponent of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
But police identified the killer as Leslie Cooper, 38, a former soldier from Harlesden, north-west London, who was born in Jamaica and had served with the Princess of Wales regiment in Iraq. Detectives were able to track down Cooper because he had topped up an unregistered phone in a shop in Harlesden High Street and then walked to a nearby shop to top up a British Gas card, which had his name on it. His phone was geo-located and then he was tracked on CCTV as he walked along the road to the second shop. When officers searched Cooper’s house, DC Matthew Rogers found a Mac-10 submachine gun, with its magazine and the silencer still attached, in a Marks & Spencer bag in a wicker picnic basket in the bedroom wardrobe. “On any reading, this was a serious bit of kit,” Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, told Kingston crown court. It emerged that Cooper had been hired by Rashad, formerly known as Burnell Mitchell, who had been involved in running the An Noor Cultural Centre in Acton, west London, for 20 years. Arwani worked in the construction business with Rashad and the pair had set up the mosque together, with Arwani acting as imam. However, the pair had fallen out and Rashad had changed the locks, causing Arwani to retaliate by suing Rashad for ownership of the building. Investigators believe that money played a part because the premises had quadrupled in value in a decade in the London property boom and were said to be worth £3m-£4m. The mosque had also come under scrutiny from MI5 after a series of incidents, including a male terrorist suspect escaping from the premises dressed in a burqa and another person linked to the mosque who was killed in Syria. The mosque had also hosted a number of controversial speakers, including one of the sons of the radical imam Abu Hamza. Rashad knew Cooper from the building trade and the pair met up at Rashad’s home in Monks Park, Wembley, on 2 February 2015, when the plot is said to have been hatched. Three days later, Rashad messaged Cooper: “Hi bra mi want that ting del with.” Cooper replied: “Yeah mon, mi a go mek it happen.” They met up at 2pm on 13 February near the mosque and an hour and a half later Cooper sent four images of a Mac-10 submachine gun on his Blackberry to a girlfriend in Jamaica. The weapon and its magazine and silencer were laid out on Cooper’s distinctively patterned duvet, helping police identify where the pictures were taken.
He also sent her an audio file referring to the weapon as “big dog” and asking if she could “see the boss” before pulling the trigger so that she could hear the click. Cooper posed as “John” to hire Arwani for a building job and turned up in gloves and a woolly Manchester United hat, although it was a hot day. But when Arwani turned up with his son, who was going to help him with the quote, Cooper called the hit off and made an excuse about not having the right keys. He tried again two days later, using another unwitting girlfriend as a getaway driver, asking her to give him a lift back from a job. As she waited for him in her silver VW Eos, she listened to music and put on her makeup in Greenhill, not far from where the shooting took place. A mother and her daughter were returning from a doctor’s appointment when they realised that a man they thought was asleep in his car had actually been shot five times. The suburban street was littered with spent and live cartridges and Arwani had wounds to his neck, lung, heart, stomach and liver. During the search of Rashad’s ramshackle end-of-terrace house in Monks Park, Wembley, counter-terrorism police found 226g of PE4 plastic explosives in a knotted Tesco carrier bag on a cardboard box in the garage. In a Chanel shoebox, on a shelf in the garage, were a number of Islamic audio cassettes, along with five 8mm modified blank rounds. Sentencing Rashad and Cooper to life in jail with a minimum of 32 years, Mr Justice Singh said the murder had been planned over a “significant period of time”. “On any view this was a shocking killing of a man in cold blood on the streets of London during the daytime,” he added."
2016-10-19T12:34:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Royal Military Police apologise to family of corporal who killed herself,"The Royal Military Police (RMP) have apologised for failings in the way they investigated the case of a female corporal who killed herself after alleging she had been raped. Anne-Marie Ellement was found dead two years after claiming she had been sexually assaulted at a barracks in Germany. Two former colleagues of the 30-year-old were finally put on trial for rape at a court martial in April – more than six years after the incident – and the RMP conceded on Wednesday that mistakes had been made and apologised to the woman’s family. In a statement it said: “The Royal Military Police takes any allegation of rape very seriously. However, it is now clear that mistakes were made in the original investigation, including in relation to decision making. As a result, aspects of the original investigation were unsatisfactory. “Any instance where this happens is unacceptable and it is vital that we learn the lessons of these events. The Royal Military Police has done so.
“Anne-Marie deserved better and for that the Royal Military Police apologises unreservedly to her family for those failings. In apologising to her family, the Royal Military Police and the wider army pay tribute to them for the courage and determination that they have shown on behalf of Anne-Marie.” Ellement’s allegation was initially investigated by the RMP’s special investigation branch and in December 2009, two men were referred to the independent service prosecuting authority. However, the prosecutors determined there was no realistic prospect of a conviction and no charges were brought. Ellement took her own life at a barracks in Wiltshire in 2011, shortly after her 30th birthday. A coroner said she had felt betrayed over the lack of action following her complaint. The RMP investigation was reviewed three times and in 2013, after pressure from her family who had threatened to take legal action under the Human Rights Act, it was reopened by the RAF police, assisted by civilian officers from Bedfordshire police. Andrew Cayley, the director of service prosecutions, concluded that the decision not to prosecute had been wrong and directed charges against the two former members of the RMP, Jeremy Jones and Thomas Fulton. The pair said Ellement had consented to take part in what was described as a drunken threesome and were acquitted. However, the judge, Jeff Blackett, a former navy officer, said the pair’s conduct was disgraceful and criticised the culture of drinking and sexual behaviour at the camp. Ellement’s sister, Sharon Hardy, said she was pleased the RMP had admitted failings. She said: “Both the coroner at Anne-Marie’s inquest and the judge at her trial made strong criticisms of the conduct of the Royal Military police men and women involved. “I know that the RMP failed my sister and am glad that has finally been admitted. I acknowledge the apology offered today with a heavy heart – but it remains to be seen if they have in fact learnt any lessons.” Another sister, Khristina Swain, added: “The RMP let Anne-Marie down 100%. Please give her one last bit of respect and don’t fail others. Don’t let victims or families go through what our family went through. Not just the pain and grief – but having to fight just to get to the truth.” The family was supported by the campaign group Liberty. Its legal director, Emma Norton, argued that the allegations were only aired because the family had threatened to take legal action under article 3 of the Human Rights Act – the right not to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment. She said: “It was only the Human Rights Act that let Anne-Marie’s sisters secure a fresh inquest, exposing the bullying she had suffered and leading to important reforms for crime victims in our armed forces. It was only the act that let them secure a fresh, independent rape investigation.” Liberty is deeply concerned at plans for the military to opt out from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) during future conflicts to see off what the prime minister, Theresa May, described as an “industry of vexatious claims” against soldiers. Norton said: “It is stories like Anne-Marie’s that show exactly how important the Human Rights Act is for our soldiers and their families – and exactly why the government and Ministry of Defence are so opposed to it. “Without it, we wouldn’t be here today – and the MoD would have been able to keep the awful truth of what happened to Anne-Marie firmly behind closed doors.” • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

2016-10-19T12:40:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Jealous and dangerous' New Yorker strangled UK student, jury hears","A millionaire New York businessman strangled a British student in a hotel room after meeting her on a dating site, a jury has been told. Nadine Aburas, 28, was found on New Year’s Eve by staff at a hotel in Cardiff hours after her killer, Sammy Almahri, fled in her car to drive to Heathrow airport and flew to the Middle East in an attempt to escape justice, it is claimed. Almahri, 44, had hung a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door of room 203 of the Future Inn before allegedly fleeing abroad. He has admitted manslaughter but denies murder, claiming voices in his head told him to kill the young woman. However, Roger Thomas, prosecuting, said: “This was the killing of a defenceless woman by a jealous and dangerous man.” The court heard Aburas, who lived alone in her own flat in Cardiff Bay, met Almahri on an internet dating site aimed at Muslim people. Thomas said: “They became friendly and contacted each other regularly by telephone, text and Skype. The friendship developed. It’s clear Almahri visited Nadine two or three times in 2013 and she travelled to New York to see him in the summer of 2014.” Jurors were told Almahri was “besotted” with Aburas, showering her with money and expensive presents. Thomas said: “There can be no doubt their friendship developed into an intimate relationship.” But the court heard that Aburas – described as “slim and petite” – “suffered violence” during the relationship. She called police to say she had been raped by Almahri in New York and claimed he had also attempted to strangle her. She began to see other men in Cardiff. The court heard that Almahri became “increasingly jealous” and bombarded her with abusive messages, warning her: “You will be in hell.” Almahri travelled from the US to see Aburas and booked into the Future Inn hotel near her home on 30 December 2014. Shortly after 3am on 31 December, Almahri left the hotel, travelled in Aburas’s car to Heathrow airport and took a flight to Doha in Qatar. Aburas’s body was found at about 12.20pm on New Year’s Eve by the duty manager and police were called. The court heard that Almahri was eventually located in Tanzania and arrested on an Interpol arrest warrant before being returned to Britain. Cardiff crown court heard he has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder. Almahri claims he was suffering from an “abnormality of mental function”. He claims he heard “the voice of God” telling him to kill. Thomas said: “We submit quite simply this was the killing of a defenceless woman by a jealous and dangerous man.” The court heard Almahri claimed he worked and travelled on behalf of the FBI but Thomas said: “That seems to be fictitious.” The court was told that during their two-year relationship, Almahri gave Aburas mobile phones and a car. But he became obsessed and compiled a “minute by minute” account of what she was doing – monitoring her movements from the other side of the Atlantic. When he discovered she had seen another man, he sent her messages calling her a “hooker” and a “whore”, the court was told. He sent her a phone message of her naked saying: “I am going to post these around Facebook you hoe.” The court heard the message was seen by one of her brothers. In the run-up to the killing, the brother, Aman, told Almahri to leave his sister alone and drove him to the railway station. Instead of leaving the Welsh capital, he bought a bottle of gin before going to the Future Inn hotel. She agreed to meet him and the pair went to a restaurant, where they argued. Later when her body was found her hands were placed across her chest with her hands interlocked. The court heard that it appeared her body had been washed. Almahri tried to pretend she had killed herself – and that he had assisted her suicide, the jury was told. A note found in the room was addressed to Almahri and began “Sorry, have come to an end, I love you” – and was signed “Nadine”. Thomas said: “In various conversations he suggested Nadine committed suicide and he said he helped her because she effectively couldn’t live without him.” The trial continues."
2016-10-19T12:47:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Meet The Drainspotter – Cornwall’s No 1 gnome-based blockage vigilante,"Name: The Drainspotter. AKA: Bryan Gibson. Age: 67. Appearance: Wherever stagnant water accumulates in the county of Cornwall. Unless that’s a polluted lake in the photograph, he’s very small, isn’t he? That’s not Bryan; that’s Cormy, the £1.99 garden gnome who appears in Gibson’s photographs of blocked drains. Why? Because before Cormy was in the picture, no one wanted to know. “People love him and he is finally helping me get this out there,” says Gibson. Get what out there? “The scandal of the drainage maintenance in Cornwall,” according to Gibson. The retired journalist travels the county most days, photographing clogged and flooded drains and emailing the pictures to the council. Drains get blocked – it happens. That appears to be the council’s position. “There is no significant problem with blocked drains, but blockages will always occur,” said a spokesman. But that’s not Gibson’s position, I take it. No, he insists that poorly maintained drains are “killing people, wrecking houses and ruining cars”. Killing people? Who died from a blocked drain? That’s unclear, but Gibson’s car was damaged by floodwater, and he has been taking pictures of drains ever since. How long ago was this? Four years. And how many drain pictures has Gibson taken in that time? By his own reckoning, about 15,000. As crusades go, his sounds boring and stupid. Gibson is used to such criticism: “People may think I am a nerd and I was laughed out of court by a judge who called me obsessive, but it takes this much dedication to get something done.” So something has been done? No. Gibson says there has been absolutely no sign of improvement. It sounds as if he is wasting his time. What is the point? “I just want someone to look at all the background work I have done and take me seriously,” he says. I suppose that is all any of us want, although I’d prefer to be taken seriously without doing any background work. That’s where the gnome comes in. Since Cormy – named for Cormac, Cornwall’s civil engineering service – started appearing in them, Gibson’s drain snaps have been published in the Plymouth Herald and on the BBC website. And now on the Guardian website. Yes, because gnomes. Do say: “Cormy saves Cornwall from plight of inadequate drainage, and man from bleak spectre of retirement.” Don’t say: “Gnome-Man is an island.”"
2016-10-19T13:35:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Gang of up to 11 involved in fatal attack on woman in Newcastle, say police","A woman who had won awards for her charity work died after being attacked in the street in Newcastle by a gang of up to 11 men, police have said. Jodie Wilkinson, 27, died in hospital after being stabbed shortly before 3.50pm on Monday afternoon in the Arthur’s Hill area of the city, near the Newcastle United football ground. A 25-year-old man, who was also stabbed in the attack, received treatment in hospital and was later discharged. Three men – one aged 22 and two aged 25 – were arrested on Monday at a house close to the scene of the attack and, on Tuesday, a further two men, aged 18 and 20, were arrested. On Wednesday, a sixth man, aged 43, was arrested and held in custody. Police believe there could have been 10 or 11 men in the group involved in the attack. Ch Supt David Felton of Northumbria police said Wilkinson was thought to have known her attackers and that it was not a random attack. “Although the motive behind the attack is still being investigated we believe it potentially could have been some kind of dispute and I want to reassure the community that we do not believe there is any risk to the general public,” he said. Part of Stanhope Street was still cordoned off to allow for a full investigation to be carried out. The weapon used had not been located. Neighbours left flowers, cards and candles at the scene of the attack, paying tribute to a “loving aunt and sister”. Felton said Wilkinson was “a very popular young girl” who had been well known throughout the city. Wilkinson, who is thought to have been homeless when she died, got into trouble with the police shortly after leaving school. She battled drink and drug problems in her early 20s and had spent time living on the streets before turning her life around and becoming a well-known volunteer with local charities. In 2010, Wilkinson was given a young achiever’s award by the Evening Chronicle newspaper in recognition of her work with young people. The same year she was also the recipient of a young person’s achievement award by Children & Young People Now magazine.
Leon Mexter, the chief executive of the charity Youth Focus: North East, where Wilkinson volunteered over a number of years, said she was very open about some of the challenges she had faced in her life, but that she had been determined to turn her life around. A statement from the charity read: “Jodie continued with our group for several years, and then drifted off to another life, and we lost touch. Whatever happened in Jodie’s life over the past couple of years, her death yesterday was devastating – a young woman who wanted to be a different person and make more of her life. Tragically, she will no longer have that opportunity.” “What was the thing that led to her being on that street on Monday?” asked Mexter. “It’s a tragedy. When she was with us her absolute driving force was to change her life, and then for this to happen – it’s an appalling full-stop, isn’t it? There’s no chance now for her to realise that things have got bad and that she wants to change again. That is now denied to her and her family and friends.” In a 2010 report by the charity Wilkinson wrote that her picture had been printed in local papers when she was 14 because she was in trouble with the police. “I have [now] had my photo in several newspapers recently for all the positive things that I have done, and my gran even has a framed press cutting of me on her wall,” she wrote. “I feel proud that I am being recognised for the positive stuff that I am doing, and I hope that I can be a role model for other young people.” Northumbria police issued an appeal for witnesses of the attack on Monday afternoon and the independent charity Crimestoppers offered a cash reward of up to £1,000 for information that leads to the arrest and charge of those responsible. “The attack happened in Stanhope Street and we know it was fairly busy at the time. It was 3.50pm and schools had not long finished and people were walking, driving and cycling in the area,” said Felton. “There will be lots of people who were there or who were passing through and who might have seen something. We really need these people, or anybody who thinks they can help us, to speak to us straight away. Any tiny piece of information could be key so please don’t hesitate in contacting us. “The incident itself would have looked like a group of people fighting, like an altercation of some kind, and there would have been shouting and fighting. People would have then seen the group flee the scene, we believe, in the direction of Queens Court. If anyone saw anything suspicious in the area then please come forward and speak to officers or ring us on 101.” Wilkinson’s sister, Amy, said: “She would do anything for anyone and we’ve got no idea why someone would take her life. All we ask is at this stage anyone with any information, no matter how small, to please come forward and assist the police.” Speaking to the Chronicle in 2011 after the coalition government announced plans to scrap antisocial behaviour orders, Wilkinson said that getting an Asbo had encouraged her to change her ways. “I certainly wasn’t proud about having an Asbo,” she wrote. “In fact, it made me realise how my behaviour had negatively impacted on other people. It was just the shock I needed to turn my life around. I didn’t want to be known as the girl with the Asbo. I have heard that some people frame their Asbos and put them on their wall like a certificate. I feel sorry for those people – why be proud of causing stress to other people?”"
2016-10-19T15:14:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office rules out 'unethical' dental checks for Calais refugees,"The Home Office has ruled out dental x-ray checks to verify the age of Calais refugees arriving in Britain, criticising them as “inaccurate, inappropriate and unethical”. The official rejection of the demand from Conservative backbenchers was welcomed by the British Dental Association, which had earlier condemned the proposal as inappropriate and inaccurate. “We do not use dental x-rays to confirm the ages of those seeking asylum in the UK,” said a Home Office spokesperson. “We work closely with the French authorities and their partner agencies to ensure all those who come to the UK from the camps in Calais are eligible under the Dublin regulations.
“All individuals are referred to the UK authorities by the France Terre d’Asile [charity] and are then interviewed by French and UK officials. Where credible and clear documentary evidence of age is not available, criteria including physical appearance and demeanour are used as part of the interview process to assess age.” Home Office officials say that once refugee children have arrived in Britain they are fingerprinted as part of further identity checks. There is also the option of requesting a further local authority age assessment, which must be case law-compliant and approved by two social workers. David Davies, chairman of the Commons Welsh affairs select committee, had said dental checks or hand x-rays to check bone density should be used to check ages and stop Britain’s hospitality being abused. He said: “People in Britain want to help children but we don’t want to be taken for a free ride either, by people who seem to have got to the front of the queue even though they clearly look in some cases a lot older than 18.” The British Dental Association had told the Home Office that it was “vigorously opposed” to the use of dental x-rays to determine the age of asylum seekers and asked for the privacy of “these vulnerable young people” to be respected by the media. “It’s not only an inaccurate method for assessing age, but it is inappropriate and unethical to take radiographs of people when there is no health benefit for them. X-rays taken for a clinically justified reason must not be used for another purpose without the patient’s informed consent, without coercion and in full knowledge of how the radiograph will be used and by whom.” On Wednesday several UK newspapers including the Daily Mail and the Sun questioned the age of the some of the 14 migrants who were bussed into London from Calais as part of an unaccompanied children’s resettlement programme. They used pictures of seven of them who looked like older teenagers and pointed out that one had the features of a 38-year-old, according to computer facial recognition software. It has transpired that seven of the remaining children were younger and officials had asked photographers not to take pictures of them. “To their credit all the media accepted the request and put down their cameras. That’s why you don’t see the pictures of the children, some of whom we believe may be as young as 12 or 13, in the papers today,” said Father Michael Scanlon, a local priest, who was there at the time. Under voluntary press guidelines no child under 16 can be photographed or interviewed without the consent of a parent or guardian. George Gabriel of Citizens UK, which has been working in the Calais camp for more than a year on the transfer of child refugees to Britain under its Safe Passage programme, said that one of the photographs of “overage” refugees that appeared on the front pages of British newspapers on Wednesday might in fact be a translator.
He said: “The reason they look so old is they have been waiting in the Calais ‘Jungle’ for over a year to reach their loved ones in Britain,” he said. Gabriel added that there were 43 young girls who were lone unaccompanied refugees eligible to be brought to Britain under the Dubs amendment but to date nobody had come to the UK under this provision. Unicef said the official census of the camp now shows there are about 1,300 unaccompanied children in total, and there are 500 children who claim to have family in the UK. “We’ve seen a few reports quoting older numbers but these come from the official census,” said a Unicef UK spokesman. Jonathan Clark, the bishop of Croydon and Citizens UK leader, explained: “Extensive checks are carried out on the children Safe Passage UK works with while they are still in Calais to verify that they are under 18; this is an extremely rigorous process and our lawyers spend 10 hours just on verification for each case. In addition, the Home Office carries out their own checks before children are brought to the UK. The average age of Safe Passage’s clients is 16 and the youngest unaccompanied minor in Calais to be reunited with family in Britain was a nine-year-old girl. “The children we work with have experienced massive trauma, fleeing their homes and living for months in dangerous conditions in Calais. Those who have experienced such hardship often look older than their years.”"
2016-10-19T15:53:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Calais camp charity threatens UK with legal action over vulnerable children,"A charity operating in the Calais refugee camp is threatening to launch legal action against the British government unless it intervenes in the cases of 30 of the most vulnerable children stranded there. Citizens UK, which is working with the Home Office on the current Calais operation, says the current programme, which has seen 39 boys and young adults brought to the country this week, is slow and one-dimensional.
It says the Home Office programme is totally ignoring a group of 500 or more unaccompanied children, some as young as eight and many of them girls, because they do not have a relative in the UK. This is despite the Dubs amendment to the immigration bill, passed in May, which meant Britain agreeing to offer sanctuary to some of the most vulnerable unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. “The government has still not set up a system to assess their best interests and transfer these children, who include 38 girls from the Calais camp. Zero children have been transferred to date under the amendment’s terms,” the charity said in a statement. George Gabriel, community organiser with Citizens UK, said: “There are over 1,200 children in the middle of a muddy, freezing field surrounded by 10,000 adults they do not know. The idea that as a country we cannot successfully reunite the small number eligible with their families is ridiculous. “The real problem here is that the provisions introduced specifically to protect the very youngest and most vulnerable children under the Dubs amendment have never been acted on.” However, it is understood the Home Office is stepping up its efforts given the impending demolition of the camp. Fr Michael Scanlon, a priest at St Mary’s Catholic church in Croydon who is working with Citizens UK in Britain, said he understood the Home Office was going to bring in 15 or 16 children on Thursday, but as many as “40,50 or 60” on Friday. He said he was led to believe the Home Office was also planning to open its Lunar House processing centre on Saturday and Sunday. Citizens UK said in a statement on Wednesday that unless the Home Office acted by Thursday it would launch action in the high court using section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016. The Foreign Office has warned of disruption around Calais, with the French authorities expected to begin demolishing the refugee camp. The camp, which is home to about 10,000 immigrants and refugees, is expected to be closed and demolished in the coming days after a French court rejected an appeal from aid groups to delay the clearance. New travel advice issued on Wednesday warned Britons of disruption in the area for several days. It said: “The French government has declared its intention to clear the migrant camp in Calais imminently. Although the French government has plans in place to manage disruption, there remains a possibility that those travelling to Calais port may experience some delays during the clearance, which is expected to last several days.” Lord Dubs, the man behind the amendment, said it was “vital that the UK lives up to its promise”. He added: “With reports that the demolition is just days away the government needs to act quickly.”
A Home Office minister, Susan Williams, told the House of Lords on Wednesday that the priority was children who had family in the UK. “We will transfer as many as children who qualify under the Dublin regulation before the start of the clearance. We will start to transfer other unaccompanied children under section 67 of the Immigration Act in the coming weeks,” said Lady Williams. She said there were an estimated 1,300 children in Calais, a third of whom were eligible to come under the Dubs amendment or the Dublin regulation. She confirmed there were 14 children transferred to London on Monday, 13 on Tuesday and 12 on Wednesday.
Frontline workers in Calais on Wednesday said they were alarmed the Home Office was moving so slowly to rescue the children in the camp. This week, with the clock ticking after the French declaration that the camp will be demolished, the Home Office has speeded up the process. But at the current rate of taking 12 to 14 children a day, about 1,000 will be left to the mercy of the elements if the bulldozers arrive on Monday. “They are the most vulnerable of the most vulnerable and we have no idea what is going to happen to them. Many of them are girls,” said Mary Jones, who ran the Jungle Books charity in the camp until it was closed by the French authorities. “There was clearly a will at government level to help because they accepted the Dubs amendment but they are not doing anything about it. We have got all these vulnerable children and we don’t know what to say to them,” said Jones. Josie Naughton, founder of Help Refugees, one of the biggest charities in the camp, said nobody knew what would happen to the children when the bulldozers arrived.
Its last census in September established there were 1,022 children in the camp, of whom just 187 qualified to come to Britain under the Dublin regulation, which allows minors seeking asylum to be fast-tracked to another EU country if they have a relative there. Most of these are teenage boys and young adults, which explains why the three busloads of migrants rescued from Calais this week were all male. With time running out and winter approaching, Citizens UK has now taken matters into its own hands and set up a system of processing the children. It handed the Home Office details of 30 “fully assessed children” and gave the department 48 hours to respond before it faced action on behalf of each child. It has identified three local authorities, Hammersmith and Fulham, Ealing and Hounslow in London, who say they can provide care and accommodation for all 30. One of the children is a 16-year-old girl from Eritrea. She described life in the camp in Calais as “a war”. She said it was very scary and noisy at night from the sound of the nearby trees and people. She spent most nights trying to get on passing lorries. She was particularly distressed after she witnessed an Eritrean man get hit and killed by a lorry last week."
2016-10-19T16:22:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"How-old.net no real indicator of age, says Microsoft amid child refugee row","Microsoft has warned that software being used to guess the ages of child migrants admitted to the UK was designed as a “fun app” and was “not intended to be used as a definitive assessment of age”. A Daily Mail article stated that one migrant pictured “was rated by a facial recognition program as having the features of a 38-year-old”, following comments from the Conservative MP for Monmouth, David Davies, who questioned the age of some of the minors pictured in the media. But a Microsoft spokesman said: “How-old.net was designed to be an example of how developers could build a fun app using modern development practices. It is not intended to be used as a definitive assessment of age.” The row comes after Davies tweeted:
He was reacting to photographs published by some publications, despite the photographing of minors without permission being against the Independent Press Standards Organisation code of conduct. It was soon noted that How-old.net estimated that Davies – a fresh-faced 46-year-old – was, in fact, 58.
Davies’ demands for people coming to the UK from the Calais camp to have dental tests to verify their age was dismissed as “inappropriate and unethical” by the British Dental Association (BDA). The Ukip MEP Jane Collins also tweeted to say those arriving from Calais “look very mature for their age”. Collins is 46, but the program estimated her in one photo to be 70, although in another image it said she looked 54 years old.
Government guidance states: “All available sources of relevant information and evidence should be considered, since no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine the applicant’s age with precision.” The government uses a number of factors to determine age, including whether asylum seekers have provided credible documentary evidence proving their age and that they have a “physical appearance or demeanour which does not strongly suggest they are significantly over 18 years of age”. Borderline cases are subject to the Merton test, which is used by local authorities to assess the age of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children before support is given, and which has to be signed off by two social workers. The chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, David Isaac, who the facial recognition software thinks is 85, tried to bring the subject away from the “irrational” tone and back to the plight of child migrants. “We are seeing the highest number of child refugees since the second world war. Britain has a proud history of welcoming people that need our help. We have always treated them with respect. Calling for intrusive checks on teeth on those coming from wartorn countries is not the answer,” he said. “Experts also agree it is not an accurate way to determine age. The best way to protect children’s rights is to treat them as children until proven otherwise. If there is any doubt, age should be verified by an independent expert. We should not resort to determinations by using photographs or computer software.” Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow (real age 39, estimated age by facial recognition program 44) noted in a tweet:
She added that she had asked for further details on the government’s verification process to “end the madness”."
2016-10-19T16:36:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May knew of child abuse inquiry tensions weeks before chair quit,"Theresa May was aware of “tensions” between Dame Lowell Goddard and panel members in the national child abuse inquiry “some weeks” before the Home Office took action, her spokeswoman has admitted. The prime minister has been under mounting pressure to reveal what she knew, and when, about the troubles in the inquiry. Goddard resigned in August, initially citing homesickness, but a series of allegations have since emerged about her leadership style. The prime minister’s spokeswoman said on Wednesday that May had heard suggestions that “there were tensions between the chair and some panel members”, some weeks before the issue was raised with the permanent secretary of the Home Office, Mark Sedwill, in late July. But she refused to say whether the prime minister had taken any action as a result, or sought to ascertain whether the rumours were true, repeatedly insisting that “it is only right to act on formal complaints or convincing evidence”. May had earlier rejected claims from the Labour MP Lisa Nandy that the Home Office failed to act soon enough, saying during prime minister’s questions that it could not be expected to respond to “suspicion, rumour or hearsay”. In a later statement, Nandy said the comments from May’s spokeswoman meant the prime minister should explain “why she took no action other than to allow a generous £80,000 payoff to the judge at the centre of these serious allegations”. Nandy said: “This feels like a cover-up, making it imperative that the prime minister and home secretary are now completely open about precisely what they knew so that survivors can regain confidence in this crucial inquiry.” It had emerged on Tuesday that a member of the panel raised concerns about Goddard with senior Home Office officials as early as April this year, when May was home secretary.
A hearing of the home affairs select committee also heard that relations between leading panel members and Goddard were so bad a professional facilitator had been brought in. One of May’s officials told the committee that the Home Office first heard of the concerns about Goddard only six days before she stepped down, but it is now clear that May had heard informal suggestions of deteriorating relations earlier than that. Nandy had asked the prime minister in the Commons why no action was taken before Goddard stepped down. Nandy said of May: “She set up the inquiry. She appointed the chair. She was the individual responsible for the inquiry’s success. She was the home secretary in April and she was the only person who had the power to act. “Can she now finally tell us when she, personally, learned of the serious problems developing in this inquiry, and why it was that she took no action at all?” May responded by stressing that it was vital for survivors’ groups and others to have faith in the inquiry, which now has its fourth chair in just over two years. “There were stories around about the inquiry and about individuals related to the inquiry,” May said. “But the home secretary cannot intervene on the basis of suspicion, rumour or hearsay.” May said the home affairs committee was also told that the concerns raised in April were confidential and they were treated as such. She added: “I think it is important for us to recognise, when the Home Office was officially informed of issues, the Home Office acted. It’s now for the inquiry to get on and deliver for victims and survivors.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn used his questions to May to quiz her on funding for the NHS, notably for mental health services and social care, with the Labour leader complaining of “reckless and counterproductive” cuts to the latter. The NHS was “on its knees”, Corbyn said, and May had failed on her intention to give mental health care parity of esteem. He said: “All this government has produced is parity of failure. Failing mental health patients, failing elderly people who need social care, failing the 4 million on the NHS waiting list, failing five times as many people waiting more than four hours at A&E departments, and another winter crisis is looming.”

2016-10-19T16:43:36Z,uk-news,UK news,The Calais child refugees need help â€“ not trial by press in row over ages,"I was in the Calais refugee camp filming a couple of weeks ago. It is a horrible place to be. Aside from the general conditions, with the demolition looming, there is a sense of desperation hanging over the place. A protest held at the entrance to the camp by some of the refugees was brutally dispersed by police using teargas and rubber bullets. However, there was some sense of hope for one set of people living there – the unaccompanied children. I spent a lot of time at one or two of the youth clubs there, meeting young people and hearing about their daily lives, their back stories, and their hopes for reaching the UK.
Riswan was a shy, softly-spoken teenager from Afghanistan. He told me he was 15, which seemed about right. I met him in a quiet corner of Jungle Books, a makeshift youth centre built and run by volunteers. He gradually told me his story. He said his father was killed by the Taliban, and shortly after that his mother died from a heart attack. He says it was the grief. With no one left in Afghanistan, he and his 14-year-old brother left and spent a troubled year in Pakistan. He has an uncle in Birmingham, who told them to come and he would look after them. Riswan told me that all he wanted was to be able to go to school, study and have a normal life. With that, he left to find his brother. He was worried about him, living in conditions like this, and being responsible for him had led Riswan to grow up fast – these were his words. I wanted to hear more about Riswan but the next day I went back, nobody knew who he was, and he didn’t come back. The Calais camp is like that. More young refugees arrive all the time, while others disappear. What support there is for them is a fairly chaotic network of volunteer-run services and shacks. The legal centre is a small portable hut with a couple of French volunteers taking notes. The hugely dedicated volunteers who run the youth clubs are constantly worrying, or on the phone trying to track one or other of the young people who have gone missing. The next I saw of Riswan was in a set of photos splashed in a tabloid newspaper, under angry headlines questioning the young people’s age. When I met him, like most of the young people there, he didn’t want to be filmed or photographed. Yet here he was being used to whip up outrage that these young people were being allowed into Britain. It is very difficult to judge a troubled adolescent’s age, but Riswan came across as sincere, young and fragile. He told me his age and story before he knew anything about the legal moves to bring unaccompanied minors to Britain.
I sat around in another hut late at night with a group of boys. One of them was practising on a battered old guitar. Another boy said he was 14 and seemed incredibly cheerful, but then his mood began fluctuating wildly. It was clear that what he needed was a child psychologist, not trial by press. Yet one of the boys partially visible in the tabloid’s pictures looks like him. And another boy, Hassan, spoke in my video, with his face hidden and name changed. He had been living in the camp for six months. His older brother lives in Britain, and he did his paperwork to come to the UK legally under the Dublin regulations three months ago. Like many, during this interminable wait he was trying to get through by jumping on the lorries on the motorway. Tragically, his cousin who was in Calais with him died a few weeks earlier, hit by a lorry. “Now I don’t go,” he told me, his voice breaking. Instead he is waiting to be transferred to the UK under the Home Office initiative. While some of the press here are now hunting for pictures of the oldest-looking refugee they can find to try to discredit the whole process, we mustn’t lose sight of some important facts: there are lots of young people at the camp, many have family in the UK, and almost all of the ones I spoke to seemed vulnerable and in need of care. I hope Hassan, Riswan and others succeed in getting that care and are finally made to feel welcome here. •Names have been changed."
2016-10-19T17:21:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Pentonville stabbing: death prompts call for inquiry into state of jails in England and Wales,"Calls for an inquiry into the state of jails in England and Wales have intensified after a prisoner died and two others were injured in a stabbing. Jamal Mahmoud, 21, who had just become a father, was killed in the attack at HMP Pentonville on Tuesday and his family have accused the prison of failing in its duty of care to protect him. The Prison Governors Association (PGA) claimed government cuts to staff and resources meant the “tragedy” at the north London prison was “no massive surprise”. It follows a slew of warnings about safety behind bars, while Pentonville was last year singled out by the then justice secretary, Michael Gove, as “the most dramatic example of failure” within the estate.
Mahmoud, who was of Somali descent, was jailed for six and a half years in July as one of two gang members sentenced after hiding a loaded Skorpion machine gun and ammunition in a garden in Enfield, north London, the previous July. He was already serving five and a half years in prison for a separate robbery. His sister, Souzan Mahmoud, said: “You think your brother is in safe hands, you know, and to hear that he had to die that way, alone. Where we thought he would be safe. It really hurts us. Everyone is in pieces as you can see.” Speaking to ITV News, she said: “The case ended a long time ago. Why was he still there [at Pentonville]? He should have been shipped out a long time ago. “We just thought the guards would be there ... I blame the prison more than the actual person that done it. They owed him a duty of care and they just neglected him. [My mother]’s worried about my other brother who is also in prison.” Their mother, Hawa Mahmoud, added: “I miss him so much. I can’t ever forget, never ever, my son.” Former prisoners described conditions as “horrible” and “disgusting”. Danny Rynne, a scaffolder from Enfield, described Mahmoud as “lovely” and “placid”. He said: “He’s got a girlfriend who’s just had a baby that was born two weeks ago. It’s a shame what happened. I don’t know too much about what it’s about but it’s a shock to everyone. He’s a small fella and proper placid. He wouldn’t say boo to no one unless somebody started on him.” Rynne said he had just completed a stretch inside Pentonville himself, and called the jail “a horrible place, not good at all”. Muneer Bhatt, 37, of Walthamstow, north-east London, said he had just been released from a two-week sentence for breaching licence conditions for a car theft conviction. He said: “They had the whole place locked down yesterday so nobody could get out of their cells. It’s disgusting. It’s a horrible place in there. “After what happened yesterday, I’m going straight now. Pentonville is one of the most violent prisons in London.” Bhatt and another source said the attack took place inside G wing. HMP Pentonville is a category B Victorian prison that opened in 1842 and holds more than 1,200 men. An inspection report on the jail published last year said: “Most prisoners felt unsafe; levels of violence were much higher than in similar prisons and had almost doubled since the last inspection.” Plans to shut old Victorian jails have been outlined as part of a modernisation drive, with only HMP Holloway in north London confirmed as facing closure so far. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “The secretary of state has been clear that safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. We are fully committed to addressing the significant increase in violence, self-harm and self-inflicted deaths in our prisons.” Official figures show there were more than 20,000 assaults in prisons – 2,813 of them deemed “serious” – in the 12 months to December, a rise of 27% year on year, with nearly 5,000 attacks on staff – a jump of more than a third compared with 2014. The data also showed there were six apparent killings in the year to March 2016, up from four in the same period in 2015 and the largest number for a year to March since current records started in 2000. The PGA’s national policy officer, John Attard, told the Press Association: “The Ministry of Justice statistics paint a very grim picture indeed. “Sadly, it comes as no massive surprise to anybody close to this that we have had a tragedy such as this. The prison service paid staff to leave – the years of experience, the mentoring, the sharing of their experiences, a lot of that has been lost, and it is showing. It’s why we need an inquiry into this.” Speaking outside the prison gates, Attard told the Guardian: “We called for an independent public inquiry a week ago. The reduction in staffing is a key factor, there’s no doubt about that, but synthetic drugs also had some part in that. What we would like to see is a regime that can be managed safely with the right number of staff.” He said the prison was one of the most dangerous in the country and would be at maximum security while it was searched. “Pentonville is one of the busiest prisons and it will, by its very nature, be one of the most violent prisons as well,” he said. “Right now it will be on lockdown. With additional support from other prisons, all of the prison will be searched and there will be a hunt for any weapons, mobile phones, drugs and tools.” The Prison Officers Association said it “once again” has serious concerns following the incident, and it warned “the unprecedented rise in violence in all of our prisons must not be underestimated”. Visitors queuing inside the prison spoke of their safety concerns. A woman visiting her son initially feared he could have been the victim. She said: “My son is 21, I haven’t felt the same since I heard the news. “As a mother, everyone tells you at least you know where he is and he is safe – but actually he’s not safe, is he? No matter their age or what they have done, no one deserves to die in prison. It is supposed to be a place of safety.” Another woman said: “It shouldn’t be allowed to happen anywhere, let alone in prison. It’s obviously not safe in there.” Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, whose Islington South and Finsbury constituency includes Pentonville, gave her condolences to the family of the victim. The prison, she said, was completely inappropriate for modern needs and should be shut down. She told ITV News: “It is unsafe, it is rat infested, it was built in 1842. It is an absolute shame on our country that we continue to put people into that prison. I believe that if you commit a crime, your liberty should be taken away. That is enough. You should not be subjected to the conditions in Pentonville today.” She added: “Despite the efforts of staff to make the best of difficult circumstances, the prison is overcrowded, understaffed, and plain dangerous both for staff and prisoners. A prison built to house 900 inmates now holds 1,300, and there is scant provision for the most vulnerable amongst them. “It has the additional problem that – as a prison primarily used to hold inmates on remand and on short sentences – its high turnover makes for a naturally unstable and volatile environment, not helped by the easy availability of, and roaring trade in, drugs.” Police were called to Pentonville prison at around 3.30pm on Tuesday. Officers and paramedics found three prisoners with stab wounds. Two men, aged 21 and 30, were taken to an east London hospital, where they remained in a critical condition, a Metropolitan police spokesman said on Wednesday. Two men, aged 34 and 26, have been arrested in connection with the incident. • The headline on this article was amended on 20 October 2016. An earlier version referrred to “UK jails”."
2016-10-19T21:07:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Muslim Council of Britain to set up alternative counter-terror scheme,"British Muslims are planning to set up their own programme to stop people becoming terrorists in a direct challenge to the government’s controversial Prevent scheme, the Guardian has learned. The plans are being masterminded by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), representing 500 charities, schools and mosques, which plans to start the Muslim-run counter-radicalisation scheme next year. “In reflecting the wishes of a cross-section of British Muslim society, our affiliates have directed the MCB to explore a grassroots-led response to the challenge of terrorism. Real challenges exists, as we see with Muslim families broken up as a number of children, mothers and fathers leave to travel to Syria,” the MCB said in a statement. The Home Office’s Prevent scheme is run by the police and security officials. The new initiative, run by a network of community groups across Britain, could cause concern as it could take people away from the official programme. The number of referrals to Prevent reached a record 8,000 in the year to April 2016. Critics, many of whom are in the Muslim community, say Prevent has at its heart an ideological purity test meaning western foreign policy can not be criticised, and the government is only prepared to work with those who do not challenge it.Instead of trying to liberalise British Islam, the new scheme will focus solely on a message that violence can never be used. A source familiar with the plans said: “If we can get these voices more heard, they are anti-government and therefore more credible in saying do not turn to violence.”
Mosques will be the key point of contact, being at the heart of Muslim communities across Britain. People can also be referred directly to the new counter-radicalisation scheme. Some of those who will try to turn people away from violence may include conservative Islamic scholars who are considered by government to be extremists. These are people who may have illiberal views on homosexuality or women’s equality. MI5 estimates that 3,000 people in Britain may pose a terrorist threat and that more than 850 have travelled to Isis-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq, some of whom may want to return to the UK as Isis suffers military reverses on the ground. Isis has replaced al-Qaida as the Islamist brand that attracts most people to violent jihad, counter-terrorism officials believe. The source involved in setting up the new scheme said its launch, probably next year, was a matter of “when not if” and added: “The approach of the government is wrong and ineffective and not engaging with local communities, and does not have community support.” The aim is to “tackle the … issue of Daesh [Isis] within our communities, which splits up families,” and to be more transparent. The MCB version of Prevent will include panels of community leaders, former police officers and professionals from mental health and other agencies willing to support the scheme. It will face a dilemma about whether it would ever report people to police if, for instance, their behaviour broke terrorism laws. The official Prevent scheme aims to detect people before their actions turn criminal. Former Met police chief superintendent Dal Babu said disquiet about Prevent has spread among Muslim communities and also to wider society. He said Prevent was a “toxic brand” and said: “It’s not rocket science: go back to how we defeated the IRA. Just like when we were dealing with the IRA, we needed the confidence of Catholic communities.”
The MCB said: “Having Muslims pass through subjective and discriminatory counter-extremism litmus tests as a condition of engagement only re-enforces the terrorist narrative. “The Prevent strategy exacerbates this problem and it is quite clear that it does not currently have the support of many among Muslim communities across the UK, yet the threat of terrorism is real and severe.” Prevent is a key plank of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy. Supporters say it is no different to “safeguarding” activities that the authorities carry out to stop people falling into other serious crimes. Activities include mentoring, help with employment and, increasingly, help with mental-health vulnerabilities. Waqar Ahmed, head of Prevent for Birmingham city council, said the scheme had saved lives: “Any strategy aimed at safeguarding and supporting vulnerable individuals from a range of harms is surely a concept we can all agree on. Prevent is about protecting people from exploitation and harming themselves and others.” However, concerns about Prevent appear to be growing. A report released on Wednesday said Prevent was badly flawed, potentially counterproductive and risked trampling on the basic rights of young Muslims. The Open Society Justice Initiative called for a major government rethink, particularly on its use in the education and health systems. The US-based NGO studied 17 cases in which individuals had apparently fallen foul of the Prevent programme, or had been referred to a sister programme, Channel, both of which are intended to prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism. They included instances in which information was apparently gathered from Muslim primary-school pupils without their parents’ consent, and a 17-year-old referred to the police by his college authorities because he had become more religious. David Anderson, the official reviewer of terrorism legislation, said earlier this month: “There is a strong feeling in Muslim communities that I visit that Prevent is, if not a spying programme, then at least a programme that is targeted on them.” The government defended Prevent and said: “People referred under Prevent are absolutely not considered or treated as criminals. The strategy is about spotting early signs that someone is vulnerable and providing support to make them more resilient to grooming by terrorist recruiters.”"
2016-10-20T07:19:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland constituency changes branded outrageous and undemocratic,"A radical overhaul of Westminster constituency boundaries in Scotland has been condemned as “outrageous” and “undemocratic” by both the Scottish National party and Scottish Labour. The proposals from the Boundary Commission for Scotland leave only one existing constituency unchanged, in addition to two island groupings protected by legislation. They come a month after similar plans for England and Wales were dismissed as gerrymandering by Labour, after analysts suggested they could result in the opposition losing 23 sitting MPs. The changes, initiated by David Cameron as part of an effort to cut the number of politicians in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, will result in the number of Westminster constituencies north of the border being reduced from 59 to 53. Two of these 53 – Na h-Eileanan an Iar, or the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland – are defined in legislation and will not be subject to change. The shifting boundaries aim to ensure that each person’s vote is of similar value by equalising the number of registered voters in each constituency to within 5% of 74,769, and will inevitably hit the SNP, which won 56 seats out of 59 in the 2015 general election, hardest. Only 11 existing Scottish constituencies have electorates within 5% of the quota, largely because of the country’s divergent population distribution between rural and urban areas. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, described the proposals as “unacceptable”. The newly elected SNP deputy leader said: “At a time when Scotland already faces a deep and growing democratic deficit, with a Tory government that we didn’t vote for imposing increasingly rightwing policies against our will, it is vital that the Scottish people have strong elected representation at Westminster to stand up for Scotland’s interests and to hold the UK government to account.” Robertson added: “Furthermore, it is outrageous and undemocratic that the UK government is planning to cut the number of Scottish MPs while it continues to pack the unelected and unaccountable House of Lords with yet more Tory donors and cronies to do the government’s bidding.” The proposals include a significant redrawing of constituency boundaries in the north of Scotland, with the largest new constituency by area, Highland North, taking in Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross along with the bulk of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, currently held by the SNP’s Ian Blackford. Blackford told the Guardian that the plans showed little appreciation of geography, or the particular challenges of representing a widely spread constituency. “It is not right to have such large constituencies in the north of Scotland. It would appear from the plans that about 50% of the land mass of Scotland is to be represented by three MPs, which brings about basic issues of democratic accountability and accessibility to constituents.” Proposed changes to urban areas have also drawn criticism. Plans to cut Glasgow’s constituencies to six would leaving the city’s seven sitting SNP MPs facing a round of musical chairs. Scottish Labour’s Westminster spokesman, Ian Murray, described plans for six new constituencies for Edinburgh as being drawn “by someone who knows very little about our capital city”. Murray’s own constituency of Edinburgh South would face a split between the once traditionally Labour-supporting Edinburgh East, whose voters migrated to the SNP at the last election, and the more affluent Edinburgh South West and Central seat. He said: “The proposals would split communities down the middle, with one seat stretching from Bonaly Country Park in the shadow of the Pentland Hills all the way to the top of Leith Walk in the city centre.” Murray said: “These Tory proposals to redraw constituency boundaries are unfair, undemocratic and unacceptable. They are based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register with nearly two million voters across the UK missing. “In the past, ministers have argued that cutting the number of MPs will save the taxpayer £12m, but David Cameron created scores of extra unelected peers in the House of Lords, costing £34m. Labour has proposed abolishing the House of Lords, replacing it with an elected senate of the nations and regions.” Prior to publication, the prospect was raised of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, the only Tory MP in Scotland, losing his seat to the SNP. However, the planned changes to his Dumfriesshire constituency appear to take only a bite of the central belt likely to be diluted by still more of the rural Conservative demographic that elected him previously. The UK minister for the constitution, Chris Skidmore, said the proposals, which will now be subject to consultation, with final recommendations submitted to the Commons in autumn 2018, would cut the cost of politics. He said: “We are committed to ensuring fair and equal representation for the voting public across the UK is in place by the next general election.”"
2016-10-20T09:26:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"Violent crime in England and Wales is up 24%, police figures show","Violent crime in England and Wales has risen by 24%, including a 9% rise in knife crime and a 7% rise in gun crime in the 12 months to June, according to police recorded crime figures. The number of murders in England and Wales also jumped 20% to 681, a rise of 144 – the highest level for more than five years. The murder rate includes the 96 killed at Hillsborough in 1989 following the conclusion of the official inquests. Police figures also show that the number of reported rapes and other sexual offences rose by 14%, reflecting a slowing of the recent increase in reporting rates for these types of crime. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the 24% rise in violent crime was largely due to improvements in recording practices and increased coverage but did include “a small but genuine increase in some categories of violent crime”. But the overall crime rate remained broadly flat as measured by the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which estimated that there were 6.5m crime incidents in the 12 months to June – a fall of 1% compared to the previous year. The ONS also published its second ever estimate of online crime, which it put at 5.6m fraud and computer misuse offences, confirming its high volume on a level comparable with offline crime. The two sets of figures will be merged into the overall headline figure in January. John Flatley of the ONS said: “Violent crime covers a wide spectrum from minor assaults, harassment and abuse that result in no physical harm to the victim through to incidents of wounding and murder. “The latest figures present a complex picture, with the crime survey for England and Wales estimating similar levels of violent crime to that seen in recent years, but the number of offences recorded by the police increasing. “We think the rise in the police figures is due to a combination of factors. First, the expansion of the police series to cover new harassment offences. Second, a greater proportion of incidents reported to the police being recorded as crimes. At the same time, the crime survey has shown a greater proportion of victims of violent crime reporting to the police. Finally, it appears there has been a small but genuine increase in some categories of violent crime.”"
2016-10-20T13:13:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Social worker 'obsessed with Breaking Bad dismembered police officer',"A crystal meth user obsessed with the TV drama Breaking Bad strangled a Metropolitan police officer after inviting him to his flat for a sex session and then attempted to destroy the evidence by aping a method used in the show, a court has heard. Stefano Brizzi, 50, is accused of the murder of PC Gordon Semple, whose body was found at the social worker’s flat in Southwark, London, on 7 April this year. He admits disposing of the 59-year-old’s body but denies murder, claiming the officer died by accident during a drug-fuelled sex game that went wrong. Opening the prosecution case at the Old Bailey on Thursday, Crispin Aylett QC told the jury that Brizzi was a heavy user of crystal meth who had lost a job at Morgan Stanley. He sought help from a support group for users run by Alex Roberts. “Mr Roberts ... says that Stefano Brizzi had been obsessed with the American television show Breaking Bad. In the series a chemistry teacher named Walter White starts producing crystal meth,” said Aylett. “At first this is done to pay for medical care but he soon descends into the criminal underworld. After poisoning a rival, White ends up dissolving the body in acid.” Aylett, who warned the jury that the evidence called for “strong stomachs”, said officers were called to Brizzi’s flat on 7 April after a neighbour complained about the smell. There they found human remains in the bath, which was filled with acid, as well as in plastic buckets on the bathroom floor. “In dismembering Gordon Semple and disposing of some of the body parts, the defendant must have hoped, first, to avoid being caught and, if that failed, that it would be impossible to identify how Gordon Semple met his death,” said Aylett. The jury heard that Brizzi told the police officers: “I’ve tried to dissolve the body ... I’ve killed a police officer.” Aylett said Brizzi continued: “I killed him last week. I met him on Grindr and I killed him. Satan told me to.”
The prosecutor said Brizzi was now saying that Semple’s death was an accident. The jury heard explicit details of extreme sexual practices favoured by Semple and the defendant, including domination and bondage, revealed by their profiles and messages they sent to various men on Grindr. Both men also used illegal drugs. Aylett said that Brizzi had upset other people in the crystal meth support group by talking about his sexual practices including satanic rituals, pain and sacrifice. The prosecutor said that Semple, who had served with the Metropolitan police for 30 years, was in a relationship but regularly met strangers for sexual encounters. On 1 April, when he was supposed to be on duty, he made contact with Brizzi, whose Grindr profile was Dom SE1 – indicating a liking for dominant activity and his postcode – and said he was “free now for (a) hot dirty sleazy session”. Semple arrived at the defendant’s flat and over the next few hours they used Grindr to invite other men to join them for a sex party where drugs would be available. One man, identified in court only as CD, turned up shortly after 7pm. However, when he rang the entry buzzer he was told by a voice over the intercom, presumed to be that of Brizzi: “We are having a situation here. Someone fell ill but we’re taking care of it, so our party is cancelled.” Brizzi later told police that when a man arrived at the flat “I was right in the middle of strangling Gordon”. Semple last used Grindr shortly after 7pm. Twenty minutes later there was no answer when his partner tried to call him on his mobile. The partner reported him missing the next morning after he failed to return home and or answer more than 20 phone calls. Over the next few days Brizzi’s neighbours became conscious of a nasty smell emanating from his flat. One of the neighbours knocked on his door to complain on 4 April and Brizzi apologised, saying it was caused by a meal he was cooking. The next day the defendant was caught on CCTV at a hardware store buying items including pincers, heavy-duty scissors, a putty knife, plastic buckets, carpet cleaner and a perforated metal sheet. Aylett told the court the sheet was “wound up into a coil, maybe to be used as a grater”. He suggested this was used to extract pieces of flesh later found in Brizzi’s bath. Brizzi sobbed loudly at times as he heard the case against him and proceedings were halted early after he appeared to be in some distress. The case continues."
2016-10-20T14:44:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"Woman who imported 'euthanasia kit' took her own life, rules inquest","A retired academic raided by armed police after Interpol tipped them off that she had illegally imported a “euthanasia kit” took her own life a few days later, an inquest has ruled. The coroner said that Prof Avril Henry, 81, a member of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, died at a “time and place she decided herself”. Coroner John Tomalin said Henry was a “lady who knew her own mind, a bright, intelligent retired professor”. He added: “She suffered a number of painful and debilitating conditions which there were no cure for.” The full details of the police raid were not given in court but it is understood that she surrendered some of the drugs in her kit after officers forced their way into her home – but kept half without officers realising. Police were called back to her cottage in the village of Brampford Speke in Devon a few days later and Henry, who was a professor of English medieval culture at the University of Exeter until 2000, was discovered dead in her bath. At the time of her death in April, the Australian euthanasia campaigner Prof Philip Nitschke, who founded Exit International, said Henry was furious at the intervention by Devon and Cornwall police, accused the force of being heavy-handed and said Exit International was warning other members of what had happened. The inquest in Exeter was told that Henry had “a number of painful and debilitating conditions” including arthritis, spinal pain, incontinence, cardiac failure, chronic deafness, sleep problems, asthma and swollen feet. Her GP, Dr Stephen Vercoe, said she first mentioned euthanasia in November 2013 when she told him: “Life is not really worth living any more.” She told other health workers that she wanted to go to Dignitas in Switzerland to end her life but they told her it was illegal for them to help her – which she accepted. Vercoe said: “Myself and several other medical professionals were well aware of Prof Henry’s intention but we all felt she had mental capacity, was not sectionable and there was no further action we could take.” She ordered drugs from Mexico on the internet but police were tipped off and raided her home. However, this did not stop her taking her life a few days later. In a note she said her death had been “laboriously planned” and described the law that prevents people being helped to take their own lives as “illogical” and “cruel”. Henry said she did not believe there needed to be a postmortem examination and asked that her body be buried in her orchard. A postmortem examination found Henry’s death was caused by the drugs she had taken. Of the raid, William Michelmore, her solicitor, told the inquest: “Two armed police officers smashed a glass panel in Avril’s door and came into her house. She was very upset by the infringement on her personal space by the police forcing their way in.” She instructed Michelmore to lodge a complaint with Devon and Cornwall police. The coroner said: “Dr Henry appeared to start considering ending her life before she became too unwell. This goes back to November 2013, when she first spoke to her GP about this. “In fact, she made no secret of her intentions and was assessed by her GP and psychiatrist on more than one occasion. The medical profession all concluded that she wasn’t depressed, she had full mental capacity to make decisions about when and how she would end her life. “The evidence to me is quite clear. Dr Henry set about a course of action that was intended to end her life at a method, a time and place that she decided herself.” In April when Henry died, Nitschke said: “Police need to realise that in the UK suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention. “Her death was a clear case of ‘rational suicide’ and her decision to die at her own time and in her own place should have been respected. As it is the authorities did everything they could to make her last days on this earth a misery.” After the inquest Nitschke told the Guardian there were about five more police raids around the UK following that on Henry’s house. He said: “The pattern was always the same – local police visiting at night asking to come in for a talk as they ‘were concerned about the person’s wellbeing’. Generally they were let in, at which point they said they had information ‘from Interpol’ that they had imported the euthanasia drug and that they should hand it over. “The information was always correct. Generally the drugs were handed over and they were asked about their involvement with Exit.” He added: “The effect on our membership was dramatic. Lots of anxious people wondering where the breach in security had come from. In retrospect it looks as though it was the email communication with a particular Mexican supplier. This supplier now uses email encryption. “My best guess is that these bouts of enthusiastic activity are designed to ‘send a message’ to Exit’s elderly membership to stop seeking internet euthanasia drugs. If this is the case it’s been remarkably successful.” Exit International is a not-for-profit Australian company that says it has an online membership of 18,000 supporters around the world. It says the average age of Exit members is 75 years. A significant minority, it adds, are seriously ill. Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate last November after a long-running fight with the Medical Board of Australia but said he would continue to advise terminally ill patients about how to take their lives. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14."
2016-10-20T15:39:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Three teenagers arrested over Jodie Wilkinson death,"Three teenagers have been arrested over the death of a 27-year-old woman who was stabbed in Newcastle. Jodie Wilkinson died in hospital after being attacked on Stanhope Street, Arthur’s Hill, on Monday. A 25-year-old man who was also stabbed in the attack was treated in hospital and later discharged. On Thursday, police said they had arrested two boys, aged 14 and 15, and a 15-year-old girl in connection with the death. A total of nine people have now been arrested as part of the investigation. Police believe a gang of up to 11 people were involved in the attack. On Wednesday, a 43-year-old man was arrested. Three men – one aged 22 and two aged 25 – were held on Monday at a house near the scene, and on Tuesday two more men, aged 18 and 20, were arrested. Five people remain in custody while the 18-year-old has been released on police bail. Ch Supt David Felton, of Northumbria police, said Wilkinson was thought to have known her assailants. He said: “Although the motive behind the attack is still being investigated, we believe it potentially could have been some kind of dispute and I want to reassure the community that we do not believe there is any risk to the general public.” Northumbria police renewed their appeal for witnesses, saying they were keen to hear from anyone with information into the incident. The independent charity Crimestoppers has offered a cash reward of up to £1,000 for information leading to arrests and charges. Felton said the attack happened in a busy area not long after schools had finished. “The incident itself would have looked like a group of people fighting, like an altercation of some kind, and there would have been shouting and fighting,” he said. Wilkinson, who is thought to have been homeless, got into trouble with the police shortly after leaving school. She had drink and drug problems in her early 20s and lived on the streets before turning her life around and becoming a well-known volunteer with local charities. In 2010, Wilkinson was given a young achiever’s award by the Evening Chronicle newspaper in recognition of her work with young people. The same year she was also the recipient of a young person’s achievement award by Children & Young People Now magazine."
2016-10-20T16:26:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Aberfan: memorials mark 50 years since tragedy in Wales,"Over the decades, the villagers of Aberfan have found many different ways to remember. For some it is comforting to gather together in public and they will attend Friday’s anniversary ceremonies alongside family and friends. Others prefer to stay indoors and mourn the loved ones they lost, at home, in private. A number cannot ever bear to be in the Welsh village on 21 October and leave Aberfan every autumn. The fact that it is the 50th anniversary this time makes no difference.
“They just can’t stand to be here on the day,” said Jeff Edwards, who was the last of the children pulled alive from Pantglas junior school after thousands of tonnes of slurry, coal waste and tailings slipped from an unstable tip on the mountain above the village and engulfed the classrooms. “People grieve in different ways. That’s right and natural.” At 9.15am on Friday it will be exactly half a century since the disaster – in October 1966 – claimed the lives of 144 people, 116 of whom were children aged between three months and 14 years. A minute’s silence will be observed in Wales, across the UK and in pockets around the globe. For people such as Edwards the memories of that terrible day remain horribly vivid. Aged eight, he had just picked a Tintin book from the library and walked back to his desk when he heard a rumbling sound. The teacher thought it was thunder. The next thing he remembers is waking up and hearing shouts and screams. For two hours he was pinned next to a dead girl from his class, her head next to his face. “You don’t forget something like that,” he said. “Not ever.”
Edwards was speaking on Thursday in the Aberfan memorial garden, rectangles of manicured lawn laid out to represent the footprint of the school, the main path standing in for the corridor. He can point to the precise spot where he lay next to the girl. Another survivor, Bernard Thomas, stopped by to talk to Edwards. He was nine and in the classroom next to Edwards when the black, wet, avalanche struck. “We heard this horrible roar and then found ourselves drowning in this muck,” he said. “I’d have died if I was sitting three inches across from where I was,” he said. “That’s the difference between life and death – such small distances.” The pair remembered later being sent to a “mental hospital” where electrodes were fixed to their skulls to try to measure their psychological damage. Thomas said he had suffered with bouts of depression over the years. Both men seemed to joke about some of the incidents but as they did so their eyes welled with tears.
As Edwards and Thomas talked, a party of children from Afon Taf high school arrived to pay their respects. The pupils bowed their heads as Afon Taf’s deputy head teacher, Emma Clarke, read out the names of all the children who died. It took a while. The events that have been organised this week have been nicely judged – poignant, telling, but not extravagant. On Thursday night a service of remembrance was to be conducted at St David’s church in Merthyr, featuring a reading of the poem Aberfan by the writer T Llew Jones, who had seen parallels between the disaster and the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. On Friday a royal visitor will arrive to take part in a service at the cemetery, with its rows of bright white memorials to the children that can be seen from miles away, and plant a tree in the memorial garden.
Over recent weeks and months artists have tried to find ways of marking the anniversary; poems have been written, musical works created. Still, one of the most effective reminders of the tragedy may be the original newspaper articles from the weekly Merthyr Express on display at the Smyrna chapel in Aberfan. The yellowing pages show how quickly horror and sadness turned to anger. A report on one of the first inquests reminds you that someone stood up and branded the National Coal Board, which had responsibility for the spoil heap, “murderers”. The 50th anniversary is different. It has prompted some to tell their stories for the first time. Karen Thomas, who was a pupil at Pantglas, has only now revealed how she puts flowers on the grave of the dinner lady Nansi Williams, who used her own body to protect the children she could reach, sacrificing her life. Yvonne Price, one of the first police officers at the scene, finally described how her small stature meant she climbed through a window into the school and spent the day helping to get victims out. The half-century mark has caused commentators to think again about the disaster and aftermath. The BBC newsreader and journalist Huw Edwards has been widely praised for his well-aimed criticism of the NCB and its chair at the time, Lord Alf Robens, who died in 1999. Edwards argued that the lessons of Aberfan were still of profound relevance today because they touched “on issues of public accountability, responsibility, competence and transparency”. Back at the memorial garden Jeff Edwards, who went on to lead Merthyr council, agreed it was important to remember Aberfan not just because of the personal tragedies but because of the lessons about society it revealed. “Good things came out of the disaster,” he said, “such as more care over health and safety and more thought about corporate responsibility. In these days, when public expenditure is being cut, it’s worth remembering what happens when corners are cut.”"
2016-10-20T16:54:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigating torso found in layby release picture of suitcase,"Police investigating the murder of a man whose badly burnt torso was found in a layby have released an image of a suitcase similar to the one he was discovered in. The unidentified body, which was missing its head and limbs, was found by a member of the public in a parking area off the A628, just east of Tintwistle, Derbyshire, at 12.30pm on Monday 10 October. Police believe the man’s remains were left in the layby, which is popular with walkers, some time between 9pm and midnight the night before. Detectives are widening their inquiries to include Derbyshire, Manchester, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Cheshire, Merseyside and Staffordshire. There is no match for the man’s DNA on the national database, but analysis of the body suggests he had white or light-coloured skin, was aged between 18 and 40, and was probably between 173cm and 180cm (5ft 8in and 5ft 11in) tall. The suitcase was black, 80cm by 68cm by 31cm, and was made by the brand Stockton.
Derbyshire police have called for anyone who saw somebody carrying such a suitcase in the Tintwistle area on the day in question to contact them. Police have also asked anyone to come forward if they have a friend, colleague, neighbour or relative matching the description of the murder victim who they have not seen in recent weeks. Assistant chief constable Bill McWilliam said police had had more than 60 calls from members of the public with information. “We’re grateful to these callers but unfortunately, we have still not been able to identify the man. He could have gone missing from anywhere in the country but simply hasn’t been reported missing by those who know him,” he said. “Do you have a friend or neighbour you haven’t seen for a while? Maybe you only see them from time to time. If you think they could have gone missing, please get in touch with us. Similarly, if you know anyone who owns a suitcase like this, or you saw someone in the area with a suitcase like this on 9 October, call us.”"
2016-10-20T17:01:58Z,uk-news,UK news,No 10 rejects idea that foreign students should not count as immigrants,"Theresa May has dismissed the suggestion that foreign students should not be counted as immigrants, after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, suggested that such a move could be in line with public opinion. Downing Street said it was not looking at whether to remove foreign students from official migration figures, despite earlier appearing to say this would be part of an overall review of the system. It comes after reports of distance between No 10 and No 11 on a number of issues, from the approach to Brexit to May’s comments about monetary policy in the most recent Queen’s speech. On Wednesday, Hammond told the Treasury select committee there were “conversations within government about the most appropriate way to record and address net migration”. “As we approach the challenge of getting net migration figures down, it is in my view essential that we look at how we do this in a way that protects the vital interests of our economy,” he said. “It is true that student visas have been abused in the past. The previous home secretary did sterling work tightening up on bogus educational institutions.” When asked if students should be counted among immigrant numbers, he said: “My view is, this is a question of public perception and the public’s view. Clearly, immigration and the level of net migration is an issue of concern. “The question we should be asking is, ‘What does the public understand should be included within that definition?’. It’s not whether politicians think one thing or another, it’s whether the public believe it.” Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the committee, highlighted research showing that one-fifth of people thought students counted as immigrants and 59% were opposed to efforts to reduce their numbers, prompting Hammond to respond: “I think that’s very interesting information.” However, a No 10 spokesman said on Thursday: “The government objective is to reduce annual net migration to the tens of thousands, and in order to deliver this we are keeping all visa routes under review. “Our position on who is included in the figures has not changed and we are categorically not reviewing whether or not students are included.” Asked whether May had changed her mind, her deputy official spokesman said: “The issue of migration, migrant numbers, who enters the country and under what terms, is very much subject for review as we go through the process of exiting the European Union.” The prime minister has long stuck to the position that foreign students should be included in the figures showing overall net migration numbers, fighting off an attempt to take them out under the previous Conservative government."
2016-10-20T20:43:41Z,uk-news,UK news,London tube station closed for controlled explosion of 'suspicious' item,"Counter-terrorism investigators are assessing what they believe was a suspicious device found on a London underground train. Experts decided that a controlled explosion was needed to make the item safe, which was discovered just after 11am on Thursday by train staff at North Greenwich station. Investigators are now seeking answers to key questions, such as who placed the device on the train, for what reason, and whether or not it was viable. The United Kingdom is on a heightened state of terrorist alert stoked by fears that an attack by Islamist extremists is highly likely. But there is also the threat of an attack from dissident Irish republicans, which in May was raised to substantial, meaning a terrorist attack is a strong possibility. Police said they were keeping an open mind but that “the Met’s counter-terrorism command is leading the investigation because it has the expertise to deal with incidents of this kind”. Several hours after the discovery of the item it was not being decisively classed as a terrorist incident, nor were investigators sure whether it was linked to an ideological motive. The alert came after a suspicious item was found on a train traveling eastbound on the Jubilee line at 11am. North Greenwich station was evacuated with people being told to “leave immediately” because of an emergency. Searches and examinations of the scene were carried out by counter-terrorism investigators as part of the inquiry leading to the closure of the station for several hours. North Greenwich station serves attractions such as the O2 centre, home of concerts and events, and is south-east of central London. Police said: “Shortly after 11am on Thursday 20 October, the British Transport Police (BTP) was called to North Greenwich underground station after train staff reported finding a suspicious item on a train travelling eastbound on the Jubilee line. “Specialist officers from the Met and BTP are in attendance and a controlled detonation has since taken place to ensure the item is safe.” The O2 arena said a concert scheduled for Thursday evening would go ahead. The O2 said in a statement: “Following a security incident at North Greenwich earlier today, the station and part of the Jubilee Line remain closed. Following discussions with the police, the O2 remains open and tonight’s Nickelback performance will go ahead as planned.” Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, known as SO15, undertook the investigation because of the suspicion that the device if triggered would explode or cause a fire. It would also investigate if the motive was believed to be jihadi terrorism, Irish terrorism, or other causes such as animal rights or far-right ideologies."
2016-10-20T22:11:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies after shooting in west Belfast,"A man has been shot dead in Belfast in what local sources said was a so-called punishment shooting carried out by Irish republican dissidents. The Police Service of Northern Ireland initially confirmed that a man had been shot and had sustained serious injuries at about 8.15pm in Poleglass, an area in the west of the city, and that he had been taken to hospital. However, local and security sources later told the Guardian that the man had died from his injuries. He was believed to be in his early 60s. The victim was shot at Glenwood Court, around the corner from Glenwood Drive where on Sunday night another man was shot, sustaining up to six bullet wounds to his legs. The dissident republican paramilitary group Oghlaigh na hEireann released a statement admitting responsibility for Sunday night’s attack. In their communique they claimed to have attempted to murder another man in the same area whom they accused of dealing heroin in west and north Belfast. The 56-year-old victim of Sunday’s shooting was from Ardoyne in north Belfast. Condemning Thursday’s shooting, Alex Attwood, a member of the Northern Ireland assembly for the Social Democratic and Labour party, said such a “savage assault had no place in our past and they have no place in our society today”. “This is a very small group of people, unrepresentative of the local community, who have now repeatedly taken the law into their own hands,” Attwood said. “The best response that we can make is to provide information to law enforcement and ensure that these individuals are caught, arrested and prosecuted under the full weight of the law.” Speaking at the scene of the shooting, Jennifer McCann, a Sinn Féin member of the Northern Ireland assembly for Belfast West, said: “I condemn the murder of a man who was shot dead in his home in Poleglass tonight. This brutal killing has achieved nothing other than plunging another family into grief and despair.”"
2016-10-20T23:01:14Z,uk-news,UK news,First heterosexual UK couple in civil partnership urge government to end ban,"The first UK-based opposite-sex couple to enter into a civil partnership in the British Isles have called on the government to make the process available to all couples, regardless of sexuality. Claire Beale and Martin Loat travelled from their home in Ealing, west London, to the Isle of Man – the only place in the British Isles where heterosexual couples can have a civil partnership – where they will have the ceremony on Friday. The couple, who have two children and have lived together since 1992, said they wanted a formal recognition of their relationship but did not want to get married. Civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2004 for same-sex couples, are not available to heterosexual couples in the UK. But the Isle of Man, which is a crown dependency but not part of the UK, made civil partnerships available to everybody this summer.
Beale and Loat hope the UK government will come to allow heterosexual couples to enter into civil partnerships, or that public pressure will lead to a civil partnership formed in the Isle of Man to become recognised in the UK. The couple said in a statement: “We respect that other people in committed, lasting relationships might want to opt for marriage. We regard ourselves as one of the millions of ‘happily unmarried’ couples in the UK. “We want a less encumbered, light-touch civil union that recognises our relationship on our terms, free from the trappings and social pre-conditions of marriage.” Last week, Adeline Cosson and Kieran Hodgson became the first ever opposite-sex couple in the British Isles to get a civil partnership. As residents of the Isle of the Man, their union will be recognised by their home government, unlike Beale and Loat’s. “The main thing was that we wanted to keep it simple,” Cosson told the Guardian after the ceremony. “We are a young couple. We do want to get married one day, but not now. This gives us rights under the law.”
The Isle of Man ceremonies come less than two weeks before the appeal court in London is due to hear the case of another couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who argue that the ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships breaches the Human Rights Act. The couple lost the first ruling on their case in January, but decided to appeal following a wave of public support, in which 70,000 people signed an online petition asking UK civil partnerships to be open to all. Both London couples are part of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign. “We now have 0.1% of British Isles sewn up, only another 99.9% to go!” Loat said."
2016-10-21T09:20:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Man shot dead in west Belfast named,"Police have named a Belfast man believed to have been killed by Irish republican dissidents on Thursday evening. Joe Reilly, 43, died at a house in the Poleglass area in the west of the city after shots were fired through the window at about 8.15pm. Jennifer McCann, the Sinn Féin MLA for West Belfast, said there were “distraught scenes” after members of Reilly’s family rushed to be with him while paramedics tried in vain to save his life.
“This brutal killing has achieved nothing other than plunging another family into grief and despair,” McCann said. Four days before Reilly’s killing, on Sunday evening, another man was shot multiple times in the legs near Reilly’s home on Glenwood Drive. The dissident republican terror group Óglaigh na hÉireann, which opposes the Good Friday agreement, claimed responsibility for this attack. Stephen Magennis, a local Sinn Féin councillor, said it was likely that Reilly’s murder was also linked to anti-ceasefire republicans. “The people who did this need to get off the people’s backs,” Magennis said. “This community is very very shocked at what happened here tonight. The mood is very tense, very angry.” He added that his heart went out to Reilly’s partner and their teenage son. Alex Attwood, a Social Democratic and Labour party MLA, said that such a savage attack had no place in Northern Irish society. “This is a very small group of people, unrepresentative of the local community, who have now repeatedly taken the law into their own hands,” Attwood said. “The best response that we can make is to provide information to law enforcement and ensure that these individuals are caught, arrested and prosecuted under the full weight of the law.”"
2016-10-21T11:08:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies in fall on ship off Tyneside coast,"A Ukrainian seaman has died after falling from a height on a ship stranded for months off the North Tyneside coast. The accident happened on the Brasschaat bulk carrier, which has been anchored in the North Sea since June after its owner went bust. A coastguard helicopter was called shortly after 2.20pm on Thursday to reports that a person had fallen from a height. Fellow crew performed CPR in an attempt to save the man’s life before paramedics and a doctor arrived. Northumbria police confirmed on Friday that the 29-year-old man had died. The Brasschaat bulk carrier is one of three ships that have been anchored a mile and a half out to sea near Tynemouth since June. They were owned by a Belgian company, Sobelmar, which hit financial problems last year, and have been managed by an India-based crewing agency, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, since June. It is understood that the man, who has not yet been named, had been onboard the Brasschaat since 20 June. A spokesman for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said on Friday: “It is with deep regret that we confirm that a crew member serving on board the managed vessel MV Brasschaat suffered a fatal accident yesterday afternoon whilst carrying out his shipboard duties. “Next of kin were immediately informed and a full investigation into the cause of the accident is now under way by all the relevant authorities. The deceased individual was a Ukrainian national. No other details are being released at this time.” Police officers were on board the 179m-long Brasschaat as it was brought to shore at Northumbrian Quay in North Shields on Friday for investigation. It is understood that the Brasschaat shipmaster is due to give a statement to police about the man’s death. Fifteen seafarers remain onboard the vessel. Local residents have previously expressed concerns that the three ships are eyesores blighting the Tynemouth coastline. One resident of nearby Whitley Bay, quoted by Newcastle’s Evening Chronicle in August, said: “I don’t want our coast to become a kind of dumping ground for container ships.” He added: “There are three of them a couple of miles offshore which are sitting high up in the water so it doesn’t look like they have any cargo. I don’t know if they have a skeleton crew but they seem empty and they’ve been there for ages.” The Brasschaat was named after its home district in Flanders, while the other stranded ships, Vyritsa and Zarechensk, have Russian names. Sobelmar, whose contracts included fertilisers, grain and coal, shipped between Murmansk in Russia and western Europe and the Baltics. The firm was reported to be seeking bankruptcy protection last year after restructuring talks with its German bank broke down. This year the lender HSH Nordbank was granted control over the four-bulker fleet, according to the shipping news service TradeWinds. It is thought that the three ships off North Tyneside’s coast had initially been part of Sobelmar’s plans to renovate an ageing fleet. It is not clear how they came to be in the north-east, but Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement has an office in Newcastle."
2016-10-21T11:09:14Z,uk-news,UK news,North Greenwich tube station terror alert sparked by bag of wires,"A terror alert at North Greenwich tube station in London was prompted when a worker discovered an abandoned bag “full of wires”. The item was discovered just after 11am on Thursday by train staff. The station was closed, and a controlled explosion was carried out by counter-terrorism investigators. Colleagues of the tube driver involved said a passenger handed a bag to the driver, who took it in into his cab thinking it was lost property. He became suspicious and on closer inspection was able to see wires in the bag, and according to some reports, a clock or some kind of electrical equipment. Neither police nor TfL have confirmed the details of the suspect item. However, a Tube source said: “Staff follow a training procedure known as ‘HOT’ – is the object hidden, obvious, typical? There’s a lot of lost property every week and it’s quite rare for something to be regarded as this suspicious, and obviously for the police to close down the line for this length of time.” Police chiefs ordered extra officers to patrol potential transport targets across London after the suspicious item was found on a Jubilee line train. They said it was a “reassurance” measure, with more officers seen patrolling the capital’s underground network and at key overground stations. The extra patrols were expected to continue as investigators tried to establish the motive for leaving the item on the train, and whether or not it was viable. Unions sought assurances over the safety of the tube following the controlled explosion. The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: “I’d like to pay tribute to all our tube workers who were at the forefront of [the] evacuation of the Jubilee line tube and station at Greenwich North. “However, in light of very serious concerns raised about security by our members following the alarming events, we are urgently pressing for an emergency and immediate security summit with London Underground, British Transport Police, Scotland Yard and City Hall. “Our members are telling us that they are scared and that the company is giving them scant reassurance. The network should be shut until we are given assurances that it’s made as safe as possible for them and for passengers.“ Steve Griffiths, London Underground’s chief operating officer, said: “We understand the concern on the part of some of our staff, and kept everyone informed during the incident. We have been working closely with the police and continue to take all appropriate measures to keep customers and staff safe. “Our teams are trained and very experienced in managing the security of our operations and responded professionally to this incident.” A spokesman for Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “Terrorists win by making people afraid, and we just need to do our job properly and continue to be as careful as possible.” The UK is on a heightened state of terrorist alert stoked by fears that an attack by Islamist extremists is highly likely. But there is also the threat of an attack from dissident Irish republicans, which in May was raised to substantial, meaning a terrorist attack is a strong possibility. Police said they were keeping an open mind but that “the Met’s counter-terrorism command is leading the investigation because it has the expertise to deal with incidents of this kind”. Police said: “Shortly after 11am on Thursday 20 October, the British transport police was called to North Greenwich underground station after train staff reported finding a suspicious item on a train travelling eastbound on the Jubilee line. “Specialist officers from the Met and BTP are in attendance and a controlled detonation has since taken place to ensure the item is safe.”"
2016-10-21T13:37:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police chief found guilty of sexually abusing boys in 1980s,"A former police superintendent has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys in the 1980s at a Home Office attendance centre for young offenders and at a children’s home. Gordon Anglesea, 79, becomes the highest-profile offender brought to justice through the National Crime Agency’s Operation Pallial, which has been investigating allegations of widespread and organised child abuse in north Wales. Judge Geraint Walters gave Anglesea bail but made it clear he would be jailed when he is sentenced next month. Before leaving court, the judge said the defendant, a father of five, would have to sign the sex offenders’ register. A man in the public gallery overlooking the court shouted: “This is a great day for British justice! Thirty years we’ve waited for this.” Anglesea had faced claims for a quarter of a century that he preyed on young boys, and in the mid-90s was awarded £375,000 in damages after successfully suing news organisations that had linked him to abuse. At that time he depicted himself as an old-fashioned north Wales police officer who had been inspired by the fictional neighbourhood policeman Dixon of Dock Green. Over the past six weeks at Mold crown court in north Wales Anglesea has been accused of sexually abusing two boys aged 14 and 15. The first said he was assaulted by Anglesea in the shower and a changing room at the attendance centre he ran in Wrexham. Such centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for youths and included physical training and woodwork. Anglesea would “inspect” a military-style parade, make the youngsters do naked sit-ups and squat thrusts, then loiter around the showers “with a smirk on his face”, the court heard. The complainant – who described the centre as a “naughty boy school” and had been sent there for “petty” crimes – made allegations against Anglesea after receiving counselling. He said of Anglesea: “You did what you were told because he was the boss … he used to hit everyone around the head … He was a powerful person. He’s wrecked my life.” In the witness box, the complainant described Anglesea as “evil” and added: “I have got no respect for authority at all because of him. Since all this happened I haven’t had a life.” The second victim lived at a children’s home called Bryn Estyn. He claimed he was taken from there to various addresses and passed around “like a handbag” to men including Anglesea. He was accused of trying to win compensation from Anglesea. “I don’t want a penny, I don’t want a bean,” the complainant said in court. “All I want is justice, nothing else.” Anglesea was convicted on Friday of four counts of indecent assault. North Wales police apologised for Anglesea’s actions and said it had changed the way it investigates such offences. Asst Ch Con Richard Debicki said: “The victims in this case have waited a long time for justice and I am pleased that today they have seen this done. Time has caught up with Gordon Anglesea. It is true to say that no occupation is immune from individuals who will exploit their position of authority and trust to abuse vulnerable victims, but people expect and deserve better from the police. “I am saddened that a former NWP officer was one of these individuals and I would like to apologise on behalf of the force to those whose lives he so traumatically affected. “Nothing anyone can do now will change the past, but I can assure people that the way in which we now investigate sexual abuse, the investment which goes into it and the significance it is given is considerably different to how it ways in the past.” Ed Beltrami, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, said: “Gordon Anglesea abused a position of power and authority in order to prey on very young and vulnerable victims. I would like to thank the victims, survivors and witnesses who had the courage to come forward and provide important evidence in this case.” In 1994, Anglesea sued the Observer, Private Eye, the Independent on Sunday and the Welsh broadcaster HTV over allegations connecting him to abuse. During libel hearings at the high court, Anglesea, then in his late 50s, was portrayed as a stalwart of the community, a freemason, rotarian, Methodist and a school governor. He described how the allegations had made him a “leper” in the small seaside community where he lived in north Wales. The news organisations called evidence from three young men who claimed to have been Anglesea’s victims while they were teenagers at Bryn Estyn. Anglesea persuaded the jury of his innocence and was awarded damages. The papers and broadcaster were also left with a £1m legal bill. In 2012, the National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial at the height of the swirl of false allegations linking the Tory peer Lord McAlpine to child abuse in the Wrexham area. Its mission was to look at the allegations of sexual abuse within the care system in north Wales that once again surfaced during the scandal, which was triggered by a Newsnight report. More than 300 people made contact with the investigation, dozens have been arrested and scores of complaints are still being actively investigated. It is no surprise that so many came forward. During the Sir Ronald Waterhouse inquiry in 1997, almost 300 men and women named 148 abusers including police officers, social workers, local authority executives, senior businessmen and politicians. Waterhouse ordered that they could not be identified by the media. Among those who have been convicted through Pallial are care home owner John Allen, who was jailed for life, and a gang of five including a former professional wrestler, a radio presenter and a civil servant, who were found to be members of a predatory paedophile ring that abused vulnerable boys."
2016-10-21T14:49:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Russian warships pass through Channel watched by Royal Navy,"Royal Navy vessels are monitoring Russian warships as they pass through the Channel, potentially bringing supplies to the bombing campaign against the Syrian city of Aleppo. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, promised this week that the Russian fleet would be marked “every inch of the way”. No 10 confirmed that the vessels, including Russia’s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, were being shadowed by the navy as they headed towards the eastern Mediterranean via the Dover Strait. The ships were expected to leave the Channel later on Friday. The flotilla of Russian warships made for an incongruous sight as they made their stately progress along the Kent coast. At about 10am the vessels were clearly visible from St Margaret’s Bay, near Dover, as they steamed past the white cliffs. The so-called Russian armada attracted a small crowd of sightseers with binoculars, and photographers armed with telephoto lenses, as it passed along the coastline in calm sea conditions with clear visibility and under beautiful blue skies. The Admiral Kuznetsov attracted the most attention, looking like a second world war battleship, with clouds of black smoke billowing from its funnels. A fighter jet was clearly visible on the deck, glistening in the sunshine. The Russian ships, shadowed by Royal Navy vessels, were interspersed with P&O and DFDS ferries sailing in and out of the port of Dover and by cargo and container ships in one of the busiest and most congested shipping lanes in the world. Theresa May’s deputy official spokesman rejected suggestions that it was a sign of weakness that Russia felt able to send its ships via this route. A Downing Street spokesman said: “I would reject suggestions that the Russians feel we are too weak. Clearly, we are not weak at all.” The type-45 destroyer HMS Duncan sailed from Portsmouth on Tuesday to “man-mark” the Kuznetsov group, and the type-23 frigate HMS Richmond escorted the group from the Norwegian Sea as it steamed south.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the British vessels were keeping a distance of about five miles from the Russians. “It really depends. If they are really flying you will keep well away; if they’re not flying you will get a bit closer,” the spokesman said. “It’s just about manners, really. They know you are there if you are at 10 miles, same as they do if you’re at one mile. They will put themselves at a distance that makes it obvious that they are there but without making it either dangerous or annoying.” According to a senior Nato diplomat quoted by Reuters, the Russian ships were likely to pass from the Channel towards Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean, heading for the Syrian coast. The source said the warships were carrying fighter bombers expected to join the attack on Aleppo. The diplomat said: “They are deploying all of the northern fleet and much of the Baltic fleet in the largest surface deployment since the end of the cold war. This is not a friendly port call. In two weeks, we will see a crescendo of air attacks on Aleppo as part of Russia’s strategy to declare victory there.” Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said in September that the Admiral Kuznetsov and other ships would be joining a taskforce in the Mediterranean."
2016-10-21T14:59:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man may have cooked and eaten parts of PC's corpse, court told","A man may have cooked and eaten parts of a police officer’s corpse after strangling him, a court has heard. Stefano Brizzi, 50, is accused of murdering PC Gordon Semple, who had served with the Metropolitan police for 30 years, on 1 April after inviting him round for drug-fuelled sex. Brizzi admits dismembering and disposing of the 59-year-old police officer’s body, but claims his death was an accident and denies murder. At the Old Bailey on Friday, the prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said Semple’s DNA was recovered from Brizzi’s oven, a cooking pot and chopsticks found in the flat. Additionally, possible bite marks were found on a rib in the kitchen dustbin and a leg bone showed signs of heat damage, he said. “It could be seen that the handle of the oven was bloodstained. Inside the oven, there was a pool of fat and grease,” Aylett told the jury. “This was found to contain a DNA profile that matched that of Gordon Semple.” He continued: “The prosecution suggests that it would be open to you to find that the defendant had cooked part of his body and eaten it as well.” Other human remains were found in the bathroom, in the bath, which was filled with acid, and in plastic buckets and binliners. Officers went to Brizzi’s flat on 7 April, after neighbours complained about the smell, and reported “an overpowering smell of chemicals combined with the smell of rotten meat”, Aylett told the court. He said one of the officers went into the bathroom, “parted the top of one of the bin bags and saw what she thought was flesh. Then she saw what she believed to be a human pelvis, hip bone. Shaken by what she had seen, she nonetheless called: ‘There is a carcass in the bag.’” A paramedic, Marianne Hardie, opened a bag in the bathroom and found what she realised was a human hand and what appeared to be part of the spine, the court heard. The defendant, who now claims that Semple’s death was an accident, confessed to police that he had killed him, saying: “Satan told me to.” He said he did not know his victim but did not like him, describing Semple as fat, ugly and unattractive, the jury was told. Brizzi added: “I am from a Catholic family so when I found out I was gay, I found out I was from Satan.” After being arrested, in an interview at Lewisham police station he told detectives he had cut the body into sections using a saw, attempted to roast a leg and disposed of body parts beside the Thames. The jury has heard that Brizzi, a heavy user of crystal methamphetamine, was obsessed with the US television drama Breaking Bad in which the main character, Walter White, a chemistry teacher turned crystal meth producer, kills a rival and dissolves his body in acid. Details of the extreme sexual proclivities of both Semple and Brizzi have been described to the court in graphic detail. The pair made contact on gay networking site Grindr on 1 April and Semple, who messaged the defendant to say he was “free now for (a) hot dirty sleazy session”, went to Brizzi’s flat in Southwark, London, later that afternoon. The defendant claims that Semple, who the jury has heard enjoyed sexual asphyxiation, wanted to be physically restrained and whipped while bound and hooded. Brizzi will argue that a leash that was placed around Semple’s neck slipped momentarily causing the police officer to stop breathing. But the prosecution contends that for death to occur there would have to have been a prolonged period of pressure. The prosecution case is that Brizzi was tired and fractious, partly because he had been let down by someone else on Grindr, and deliberately killed Semple before attempting to dispose of his body. A postmortem examination found that Semple had been struck in the face while still alive. Concluding his opening argument, Aylett said: “Whether it was done as part of some satanic ritual (as the defendant originally claimed) or whether it occurred in the course of sexual activity (as the defendant now says) or whether any drugs that the defendant had taken make him paranoid, the prosecution allege that the defendant deliberately strangled Gordon Semple. “Having murdered him, he went on to dismember his body before attempting to dispose of it in circumstances that the prosecution suggest amount to cannibalism.” The police officer’s partner, Gary Meeks, made more than 20 unanswered calls to Semple’s mobile phone on the evening of 1 April and, when he failed to return home, reported him missing the next morning. As the days passed an extensive investigation into Semple’s disappearance was conducted. The jury was shown CCTV footage of the defendant visiting a hardware shop on 5 April. Among the items he purchased were a metal sheet, bleach, pincers, a putty knife, heavy-duty scissors and carpet cleaner. The search for Semple ended only by chance when neighbours of Brizzi, upset about the smell emanating from his flat, called the police. The case continues."
2016-10-21T15:12:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Aberfan: Prince of Wales among those marking disaster's 50th anniversary,"In the moments after Panglas junior school was engulfed in a black avalanche of slurry, coal waste and tailings, the abiding memory of those first at the scene was of the silence.
Exactly half a century on, the village of Aberfan, and communities the length and breadth of Wales, once more fell silent as thoughts turned to the 144 people – 116 of them children – who died on 21 October 1966. A cemetery on the hillside above Aberfan, where the children’s bright white headstones stood out in the bright autumn sunshine, and a beautifully manicured memorial garden designed to echo the footprint of the lost school, were the public focal point of the commemorations.
Prince Charles and government ministers were among the dignitaries paying their respects. But it was the survivors, the still-grieving families, and the rescuers – one of whom brought a clock recovered from the debris, forever frozen at the time the disaster hit – who were centre stage. People such as Gerald Kirwaun, who as an eight-year-old was pulled out of the rubble of Pantglas, which means green hollow. He recalled walking to school via the canal bank that day, cheerful at the thought of the half-term holiday just hours away.
After singing All Things Bright and Beautiful in assembly, the class was settling down to their final lessons before half term. Kirwaun’s usual classroom neighbour was off school, so another friend slipped into the desk next to him. Then came the roaring sound. “It was like a jet airplane coming,” said Kirwaun. “And then I must have been knocked out or something. When I woke I hadn’t a clue what had happened. I thought maybe it was an earthquake.” He asked his friend if he was OK. “His head was on my shoulder and he had blood coming from his mouth.” The friend did not make it. Had he not moved desk he may have done. Kirwaun went to work as a mining engineer – coal was still king here back then – and had spoken little of his memories until now. “But I think the 50th anniversary is a good time to talk. We must make sure future generations will remember.” Susan Robertson, who was carried out of the rubble by a policeman – an image that was beamed around the globe – laid a wreath at the cemetery with her 10-year-old grandson Mackenzie. “It felt so right that he should come with me to the cemetery to lay a wreath because no-one should ever forget what happened that day,” she said. “I’m overwhelmed at the way Mackenzie has taken such an interest in what happened and so proud of him.” Many still cannot talk about what happened. Some stay at home behind closed curtains when the anniversary comes around; others time their holidays so they are away for the duration.
At first light one middle-aged man man stood silently in a corner of the memorial garden, slipping away before the official programme of events began. Later in the day other men and women quietly placed bouquets on the precise spots where their loved ones had died. But the consensus seemed to be there was still a story that needed to be told. People had to be reminded how the National Coal Board (NCB) tried to avoid blame for the tragedy and how, disgracefully, the people of Aberfan had to pay £150,000 from the disaster fund to have the remaining tips from around the village removed. It was fitting that among those at the ceremonies was Iain McLean, an academic whose acute analysis of the papers that emerged under the 30-years rule helped expose the failings of the NCB and led to the £150,000 being paid back. But there were some absentees on Friday. The prime minister, Theresa May, did not visit. The UK government was represented by the Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns. The Queen is said to regret waiting eight days before she visited Aberfan in 1966. For this anniversary, her son was here in her place.
The chatter in the Megabytes cafe on Aberfan Road was of the regret that there had not been more of an effort to promote the minute’s silence around the UK. It felt like a Welsh silence rather than a UK-wide one. Once Charles had gone and the media began packing up, the playground where the press had been corralled was once again the domain of children rather than reporters. The 50th anniversary ceremonials were over but, of course, they do not draw a line under anything. Another survivor, Gaynor Madgwick, who lost two siblings in the disaster, said the media interest had made this year’s anniversary more intense, visits to the cemetery and memorial garden more charged. But she said: “We were here for the 49th anniversary and will be here for the 51st. I’ll be coming here until the day I die.”"
2016-10-21T15:22:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Bodybuilder's race hate claim against BBC investigated by police,"Police are investigating an allegation against the BBC of incitement to racial hatred after a bodybuilder with a muscle fixation complained that a documentary about his life was racist. The BBC3 film, The Man Who Squeezes Muscles: Searching for Purple Aki, presented itself as an investigation into how Akinwale Arobieke, 55, has been portrayed as a bogeyman terrifying north-west England. An article on the BBC website that appears alongside the film states: “The nickname itself was racially charged – the suggestion being he was “so black he’s purple”. Arobieke complained to Merseyside police that the documentary was racist and demonised him. Arobieke, a 6ft 5ins bodybuilder, has a series of convictions relating to the harassment of young men. He is known for approaching younger men and striking up conversations about weight training, before touching and measuring their muscles, and then inviting them to squat his body weight. In 1986, Arobieke was convicted of manslaughter after 16-year-old Gary Kelly was electrocuted at New Brighton railway station, allegedly while running away from him. But there was no evidence that he had threatened or touched Kelly. The conviction was later overturned, and Arobieke was awarded an estimated £35,000 in compensation due to alleged racial overtones in the prosecution case. The BBC3 film, available online and first broadcast in September, starts: “Purple Aki, a name that’s whispered in the parks and playgrounds of Merseyside … a threat made to kids … watch out or Purple Aki will get you.” In the film he is referred as as a “big black” man three times, and it is said that “everyone has seen him or been chased by him” and “everyone thinks they have spotted him and felt a shiver”. One alleged victim says “He is just purple and huge.” A spokesperson for Merseyside police said: “Officers from the Liverpool Sigma team are investigating an allegation of a race hate crime. This follows the release of a BBC3 documentary. Specialist detectives are working alongside partners in the Crown Prosecution Service and at this time the investigation is ongoing.” Arobieke told the Guardian that the film was racist and failed to point out that he has never been convicted of a sexual offence and that he was compensated after his conviction for manslaughter was overturned. In 2001, he was cleared of 50 counts of indecent assault and harassment against 14 teenage boys between 1995 and 2000. But he was later sentenced to 30 months in jail for making threats to kill. Arobieke was imprisoned for a further six years in 2003 following his guilty pleas to 15 counts of harassment and one count of witness harassment. After he was released in 2006, Merseyside police successfully applied to Liverpool magistrates court for a sexual offences prevention order (Sopo) against Arobieke, banning him from touching, feeling or measuring muscles; asking people to do squat exercises in public; entering the towns of St Helens, Warrington or Widnes without police permission; and loitering near schools, gyms or sports clubs. But in May the order was overturned after Arobieke, representing himself at Manchester crown court, argued that the Sopo was draconian and that his behaviour was neither criminal nor sexual. Judge Richard Mansell QC said the restrictions it placed on his “freedoms” could no longer be justified. Lifting the order would allow him to pursue his interest in an “appropriate venue”, the judge said, such as a gym or a bodybuilding event. “The ban on touching muscles is just not on,” the judge said. “I’m not into bodybuilding myself, but I’d have thought men who have muscles in their arms the diameter of my leg are the sort of men who will admire each other’s bodies.” Arobieke vowed to reinvent himself, telling the judge: “From today I’m going to conduct myself properly … I’m not going to run around touching everybody’s muscles because there’s no need for that.” Arobieke told the Guardian that he has asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission to review his conviction for threats to kill. The CCRC confirmed it had received an application from Arobieke to have his conviction reviewed. The BBC has been approached for comment."
2016-10-21T15:46:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Anger as Northumberland rural bus service shuts while big players prosper,"At 66 years old, Duncan Foster thought his hitchhiking days were over. He would regularly thumb a lift to watch football matches as far away as Leeds (60 miles as the crow flies) as a young lad growing up in Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria. But as a pensioner, now living alone in the nearby village of Whittington, he was happy to rely on the bus to go for a few pints with old mates back in Kirkby. With 111 services passing through the village each week, including one handily timed around last orders, he could maintain his social life without drink-driving – or forking out £6 for a taxi for the three-mile journey to and from Kirkby. All that changed in April, when Lancashire county council drastically cut bus subsidies, which resulted in Whittington suddenly receiving just five buses a week, all one-way. Foster was outraged. But instead of sulking at home – or switching to soft drinks at the pub and taking the car – he decided to start a one-man protest. He paid £8 for a hi-vis reflective jacket on which he had printed “lift please – no buses”, and stood at the largely dormant bus stop with his thumb out hoping to be picked up. It nearly always worked, with the retired building site engineer getting lifts from friends and strangers alike. Less intrepid residents unable to drive find themselves stuck at home or forced to move, he said. “I know one gentleman had to move because he needed to get to Kendal for hospital appointments. Another lady who has problems with her eyes can’t get anywhere now.” Whittington is far from the only village affected by bus cuts. This week, Department for Transport statistics on local bus passenger journeys in England for the 12 months to March 2016 reported a 2.6% decrease to 4.53bn, compared with the previous year. Bus mileage in England fell by 2% over the year, “largely due to a 12.3% decrease in mileage on local authority supported services in England outside London”.
Most bus services in England are provided by private companies since the industry outside the capital was deregulated in 1986. This allows commercial firms to bid for only the most profitable routes, with local authorities generally subsidising the less lucrative services. However, massive cuts to council budgets have prompted councils in some areas – including Stockton, Darlington and Wrexham – to cut subsidies altogether. In Cumbria, the bus budget is now zero, down from almost £1.84m in 2010-11. More than 68 routes have been affected since 2014-15, meaning many people in Cumbria have been cut off completely with little or no public transport available, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. In Northumberland national park two years ago one enterprising young local decided to set up his own bus company to service his remote part of the country. Steve Hurst, from the market town of Rothbury, started Spirit Buses “to plug a gap” in the Coquetdale valley. But on 5 November, the Spirit Bus will make its final journey after carrying 50,000 passengers in its two-year life. Hurst is throwing in the towel after accepting he could not continue to offer a service that paid him no salary. Almost 31, he still lives with his parents. According to his dad, Rich, who runs a deli in Rothbury, he draws no salary and relies almost entirely on “the bank of mum and dad” to survive. His parents even make him his daily packed lunch. “I’m in debt, let’s put it that way,” said Hurst on Friday, talking on hands-free as he drove the bus. Hurst had hoped to win another contract to run a service between Morpeth and Rothbury, opening up economies of scale that would have made his two rural routes financially viable. But Northumberland council awarded the contract to Arriva, saying it offered better value for money, despite Hurst having run a 100% reliable service for the previous year, compared with Arriva, which had a reputation for frequent breakdowns and delays. Whether out of spite or thoughtlessness, Arriva celebrated by changing the timetables so that its buses no longer linked with Spirit’s at the key interchange town of Morpeth, resulting in a drastic fall in custom for Spirit.
“I feel tremendously sad to be packing it in. I love this community,” said Hurst. “It’s very tight-knit and everyone has done what they can to help me, whether giving donations, or my engineer, who has given his time for nothing.” But he is frustrated that the law allows big operators like Arriva to cherrypick the best routes. The bus services bill going through parliament should address this, he said. “Of course you do need the big operators, but you can’t expect little independents to put on these lifeline services and not make a profit while the big operators make loads. Either the big operators need to be told that they have to also operate the lifeline services, or the independents need more help.” Passengers are sorry to see Hurst give up. “Spirit Buses will be a huge miss on our roads,” said one regular on Spirit’s Facebook page. “You did a community service, not just a bus service. I have seen you deliver parcels to outlying villages, you provide weather reports & beautiful photos. Very best wishes for the future Steve & thank you.” Another remarked on how Hurst had recently stopped the bus to administer first aid to a road traffic accident victim. Back in Whittington on Friday afternoon, Foster needed to get back to Kirkby Lonsdale, having left his car there on Thursday night. He decided to leave the tabard at home, sharing a taxi with local retired couple John and Maureen Keegan, both 76, who now make just one weekly shopping trip into Kirkby Lonsdale each Friday because of the bus cuts. On Friday morning John had put the finishing touches to a homemade timetable he and Foster had devised, which proposed altering existing services in the Lune Valley to give four services a day instead of just one. Buses are a lifeline for villages like Whittington, said Keegan, which has lost its pub and has a pop-up post office that opens for just two hours a week in the village hall. “Nowadays there are an ever-decreasing number of services in rural villages, with shops, post offices, GP practices and pubs shutting down all the time. Buses have never been more vital for people to access these services elsewhere.”"
2016-10-21T17:45:41Z,uk-news,UK news,'Clock is ticking' on companies exploiting 'gig economy' says Labour MP,"Influential Labour MP Frank Field has said the “clock is ticking” against companies who exploit workers trapped in the gig economy. On Thursday ministers ordered a crackdown on companies using large numbers of self-employed or agency workers following an investigation by the Guardian into low pay at the delivery company Hermes.
Field warned that other firms could now face scrutiny, revealing his office had been contacted by couriers working for other delivery companies airing similar grievances to those raised by Hermes workers. “This is the beginning of what will be a long process of investigating this sort of exploitation,” said Field, adding that he was delighted with the speed with which Theresa May’s government had tackled the issue. “Compared with the last three governments this is rocket speed. We have had a period where employers have been testing the law and no one has been pushing back. This is the beginning of the pushback.” From parcel carriers delivering packages to online shoppers, to app-driven services such as Uber and Deliveroo, the gig economy, which has transformed delivery services, relies on large networks of self-employed contractors. Their status means they are not entitled to earn the “national living wage” or receive benefits such as sickness and holiday pay.
The growing pressure comes as drivers for the taxi-app company Uber await an employment tribunal verdict on their claim that they should be classed as workers rather than as self-employed. Since taking over as prime minister, May has talked about the need to “reform capitalism” and promised to improve the pay, security and employment rights of ordinary working people. She has also hired Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair’s policy unit, to head a review of workers’ rights and practices, which will try to address concerns that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work. Field wrote to May recently, asking her to examine a dossier of claims of false self-employment at Hermes. Scores of Hermes couriers’ testimonies revealed how their self-employment meant they received no paid holidays or sick pay – and in some cases were paid below the national living wage. Field heard back this week from the financial secretary to the Treasury, Jane Ellison, who revealed that HM Revenue and Customs was establishing a specialist unit to investigate firms shirking employment obligations. In her letter she said the government was “committed to taking strong action where companies, to reduce their costs, force their staff down routes which deny them the employment rights and benefits they are entitled to”.
Field said the action showed May’s sentiment about “protecting the soft flesh of Britain’s underbelly” was beginning to take shape. “The gig economy has made it too easy for companies to unthinkingly exploit large tracts of that soft underbelly,” said Field. “They have been able to offer any terms in gaining flexibility. Clearly that flexibility should have to be bought at a higher price. I think these practices exist because companies could get away with it and now we are testing the law and HMRC rules. If they are found wanting I would expect HMRC to change them.” In a separate response, Edward Troup, the executive chairman of HMRC, said the Hermes dossier supplied by Field had been referred to the “appropriate compliance teams” for consideration. Troup said confidentiality prevented him from commenting on the tax affairs of individual companies but he fired a warning shot to unscrupulous employers: “Individuals cannot be opted out of employment rights and protections simply by calling them ‘self-employed’. We are committed to tackling false self-employment. “If we find that companies have misclassified individuals as self-employed, we will take all necessary steps to make sure that they pay the appropriate tax, NICs, interest and penalties.” In a recent case, agency workers at Sports Direct’s warehouse in Derbyshire were awarded £1m in back pay after it emerged that they had been paid below the minimum wage. Field said he would be pressing HMRC for an update before Christmas – the busiest time of the year for courier firms. “If we haven’t got a timetable I will be putting pressure on them for one,” he said. “I would like to see them report back before Christmas because if you are being sweated, everyday is a horror.”"
2016-10-21T18:18:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"Countess Raine Spencer, stepmother of Princess Diana, dies aged 87","Raine Spencer, the socialite stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales, and daughter of the prolific romantic novelist Dame Barbara Cartland, has died aged 87. Countess Spencer passed away on Friday morning at her London home following a short illness, her son William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth and a Ukip MEP confirmed.
A society figure and a local politician, she married three times, and amassed various aristocratic titles. She was born Raine McCorquodale – the only child of Cartland and Alexander McCorquodale, an army officer and heir to a printing fortune. During her life she was known as the Honourable Mrs Gerald Legge, Viscountess Lewisham, the Countess of Dartmouth, Countess Spencer, the Dowager Countess Spencer and Countess Jean-François de Chambrun. She grew up in the rarefied world of upper class England – she was named “Deb of the Year” in 1947 – and throughout her life was instantly recognisable for her bouffant hair, pearls, clipped accent and immaculate dress sense. She married Gerald Legge, later Viscount Lewisham, in 1948 and they had four children. As a young mother, aged 23, she became the youngest member of Westminster city council, and went on to hold positions on many other bodies.
She married Diana’s father, the eighth Earl Spencer in 1976. She was not very popular with the young Diana and her three siblings who reportedly referred to her as “Acid Raine”. Many years later, Diana’s younger brother, now the ninth Earl Spencer, reportedly described her taste in decor at the Spencer’s ancestral Althorp home in Northamptonshire as having “the wedding cake vulgarity of a five-star hotel in Monaco”. Much was written about the “strained” relationship between the countess and her world-famous stepdaughter, but in the years immediately before Diana’s death there was a reported reconciliation between them. In an interview with the Gentlewoman magazine last summer, Spencer said of Diana: “She had incredibly heavy pressures put upon her, but we ended up huge friends. She used to come and sit on my sofa and tell me her troubles.” After the death of her second husband in 1992, she moved out of Althorp. In July 1993 she married her third husband, Count Jean-François Pineton de Chambrun. They divorced in 1995. For many years she sat on the board of directors at Harrods, and also worked on the shop floor. Giving evidence at the 2007 inquest into Diana’s death, she revealed: “I never went shopping at Harrods. It was my husband [Earl Spencer] who practically lived there.” Also at the inquest, she made a rare public comment about her relationship with Diana, who died in 1997. “She always said I had no hidden agenda,” she said in her evidence. “So many people, because she was so popular and so world famous, wanted something out of her. It was a very draining life.”"
2016-10-21T19:54:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman granted UK visa to donate bone marrow to sister in U-turn by Home Office,"The government has backtracked on its decision to prevent a Nigerian woman from entering the UK so that she can donate bone marrow to help save the life of her seriously ill sister. The decision came amid public pressure after a petition calling for May Brown’s sister Martha to be granted a visa was signed by more than 60,000 people. “I am overjoyed for the U-turn the Home Office has taken,” she said on Friday. “I would like to thank the British public and beyond, and my MP Richard Drax, for their overwhelming support.” May Brown, who lives in Dorset and has a two-year-old daughter Selina-May with her ex-soldier husband Mike, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia last year. Doctors said her only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant and assessed her sister, who lives in Nigeria with her own two young children, as a “10 out of 10 match”, campaigners said. She was the only suitable match to be identified after what doctors at King’s College Hospital, London, said was “an extensive search” for another donor. But earlier this month it emerged that Home Office officials had refused Martha the visa, saying they did not believe she would be a “genuine visitor”. Despite May Brown’s offer to pay for the trip, the officials believed Martha did not have the necessary funds to make it and that she would not return to Nigeria once the visa expired. May Brown insisted her sister, whose children were to stay behind in Nigeria, had “no desire” to relocate to the UK. A campaign led by the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) called for the decision to be reversed and the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, confirmed the Home Office had relented on Friday. “I have carefully considered the case of May Brown and decided that her sister will be granted leave to enter the UK given the compassionate and exceptional circumstances,” he said. May Brown added: “I would also like to thank ACLT. I will forever be grateful for the love and support they have shown my family and me.” She is currently receiving her second round of intensive chemotherapy at King’s College Hospital."
2016-10-22T06:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Artists fight to save one of London's last studio colonies from development,"Artists, craftspeople and fashion designers in one of London’s largest remaining studio colonies are fighting plans to bulldoze their premises and replace them with almost 1,400 mostly luxury apartments. In a new frontline in the battle against the capital’s gentrification, housing giant Berkeley Homes has applied for planning permission to demolish studios on a former gas works site in Fulham in southwest London, which is currently used by more than 200 businesses in the creative industries. Tenants opposed to what they describe as a Dubai-style development of blocks rising to 27 storeys include one of the Duchess of Cambridge’s favourite fashion designers, Pepa Gonzalez, who has made clothes for Prince George and Princess Charlotte; and Julius Schoonhoven, a leading clockmaker who works for the National Trust and the Royal Palaces. The affected businesses include fine artists, architects and designers and have a combined multi-million pound turnover.
The dispute is set to test a manifesto promise made in May by London mayor Sadiq Khan to “protect London’s workspaces and venues threatened by encroaching development”. The plans are set to go before the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham’s planning committee in the coming months and Khan’s spokesman said it would “inappropriate to comment while this is still a live case”. The threat to the studios is not an isolated case. Between 2014 and 2019, 3,500 artists were predicted to lose their places of work in London – a 30% cut, according to a report by the Greater London Authority. The temptation to replace them with private housing is strong for developers. The artists pay as little as £500 a month in rent, but Berkeley Homes is currently selling three bedroom apartments for £6m at a neighbouring site, Chelsea Creek. The housebuilder’s founder and chairman, Tony Pidgley, earned £21.5m last year. But on a visit by the Guardian this week, the tenants argued they form a vital part of London’s creative industries sector, which provides one in eight jobs in London. Fashion designers described how they manufacture clothes in other parts of the capital while fine art and furniture restorers said they worked for Sotheby’s and major galleries. They are likely to face eviction next year.
“We are skilled artisans, gilders, clockmakers and proper creative industries,” said Francesca Sanders, a wildlife artist and part of the Old Gasworks creative enterprise committee opposing the housing scheme. “We are not a load of school kids.” However, Berkeley said its plans would bring a site largely occupied by redundant gasholders back into use and provide “much needed homes for London”. The tenants’ committee has complained to Berkeley, which is proposing the redevelopment in a joint venture with National Grid, that its demolition plans are “baffling”. They say they have been offered no alternative accommodation. “The array of British heritage brands and crafts housed here are not only a vital asset to the neighbourhood and London more broadly, but also a very obvious goldmine for any future development,” they wrote in a letter also sent to the Prince of Wales, whose support they are hoping to win for their campaign. At least two of the threatened tenants are backed by the Prince’s Trust. “This is awful,” said Gonzalez, originally from Spain, whose business started booming recently when Prince George was pictured on the cover of Hello! Magazine wearing one of her outfits. “We need places like this to help London grow. One person will get rich by selling all these apartments but what happens to everybody here? This place is full of expertise. There are painters, photographers, clothes from Africa, Spain. This is London. It is the whole world.”
“We are trying to convince them to keep us as part of the development because this could be a huge asset,” said Johnny de Ath, a musician and composer who has been based at the complex for 12 years. “Once you have the arts scene, the rest follows. If this doing and making is all pushed out we have a big problem for the creative industries in this city.” A spokesman for St William, the name of the joint venture company, said: “We are in touch with local businesses as part of our engagement with the local community regarding the proposals to redevelop Fulham Gasworks. We have submitted a planning application for up to 1,375 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes, 103,000 sq ft of commercial space, including the refurbishment of two listed buildings and a new public park providing 2.5 acres of open public space.” He said the site was “extremely complex” because of the gas infrastructure and said it had to balance competing requirements including affordable housing and the restoration of some listed buildings. Last month, City Hall planners warned the project does not yet comply with some London-wide planning policies. They called on St William to commit to providing replacement cultural and employment uses including affordable workspace and complained there was no affordable housing offer which was “a significant concern”. St William said it has submitted a viability assessment regarding affordable housing, although this remains confidential. It also said the application included space that could be used for small businesses and galleries.
But the current tenants will be moved out and they believe the vitality of their complex will not be replicated anywhere else. “These types of places – workspaces where you physically create things, not offices – are dying out,” said Schoonhoven as he repaired a 340-year old clock for the National Trust. “This is one of the last of its kind. Yes we need housing, but the sort of housing being built here isn’t what we need. This is investment housing.” Ekaterina Kukhareva, a Ukraine-born knitwear designer and maker who exports evening wear to Saudi Arabia and Dubai using a specialised loom, said if the premises were demolished “100% I won’t be able to find anywhere else and I’ll be leaving the UK.” Elizabeth Eldimaa, a fashion designer being supported by the Prince’s Trust who imports fabrics from Nigeria and Ghana and uses them in European designs, said the demolition of the studios would force her back to working alone in her one-bedroom flat, where as a single mother she brings up a five-year-old daughter. “The community here is amazing,” she said. “There are babywear designers, interior designers and it keeps you motivated. I can’t afford to go anywhere else.”"

A further 21 passengers were injured when the roof of the doubledecker was torn off in the early hours of Saturday morning after it collided with a railway bridge on St Loy’s Road in Tottenham. Fire crews from nearby Tottenham fire station helped free three people who were trapped on the upper deck. None of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening. Emergency services were called to the scene just after 4am. Police said inquiries into how the crash occurred were continuing. The bridge has been declared safe by Network Rail, the London Fire Brigade said.

2016-10-22T16:27:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Police give all-clear over item in Devon raid following London tube alert,"A suspicious device discovered by counter-terror police at an address in Devon on Saturday has been declared not viable. Metropolitan police officers investigating a package found at a tube station in London two days earlier had been at a property in Tudor Road, Newton Abbot, when they discovered an item they deemed suspicious. People were moved out of the area but a 200-metre cordon has now been lifted, the Met said. In a statement, they added: “Work has been carried out and it has now been confirmed the device is not viable. Work continues with Devon and Cornwall Police at the scene.” During the evacuation, three pitches at Baker’s Park in the town were cleared. Phil Smith, 62, who was refereeing a football match, said: “We were eight minutes into the match when suddenly a policeman appeared on the touchline and said, ‘Sorry, you are going to have to stop playing and get out of the park – we want to land some helicopters on the football pitch.’ “He said there was an incident but couldn’t say anything about it. He proceeded to hustle us all off and then he went to the children’s play park and hustled all them out and was trying to get the car park clear as well.” Saturday’s discovery followed a security scare at North Greenwich station close to the O2 complex in south-east London on Thursday. A controlled detonation was carried out on the item, which was reported to have been handed to a tube driver and possibly contained wires and a clock. A 19-year-old man who was Tasered and arrested on Friday afternoon on Holloway Road in north London remains in custody. The Guardian understands the item found on the tube is believed to have been a homemade device, possibly constructed with the intention of exploding. It was unsophisticated and the suspect has been detained under terrorism legislation covering the “commission, preparation and instigation” of a violent act. It is not believed by police to have been a hoax, and the leaving of the device on a train is being treated as a deliberate act. Counter-terrorism investigators believe whoever was behind the incident at North Greenwich station was acting alone, a so-called “lone wolf”, if they establish it was terrorism. However, they have not yet done so, and an initial check of mental health records linked to the sole suspect has led to further inquiries into material held by the health service. The part of the investigation covering the health history of the suspect is complicating the part of the inquiry trying to establish the motive. The arrest in broad daylight is unusual in a counter-terrorism investigation. Commuters were told to expect to see more officers, including armed police, in and around transport hubs while patrols by British Transport Police officers on the underground and at stations are in place. The current threat level for international terrorism in the UK is severe, meaning an attack is “highly likely”."
2016-10-22T18:54:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan to appoint London ‘night tsar’ in light of club closures,"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is poised to name a “night tsar” after a spate of closures of clubs and other late-night venues that has prompted alarm about the city’s future as a 24-hour city. The identity of the tsar will be made public next month, and a report by the mayor-appointed “night time commission” published by the end of the year. The commission will propose steps to promote the night-time economy as “a key driver of economic and cultural regeneration, and a magnet for domestic and international visitors”. According to a recent study by London First, the capital’s night-time businesses contributed up to £26.3bn to the UK economy in 2014, forecast to rise by £2bn by 2029. But behind the upbeat tone of the report, club and bar owners are voicing growing concern about their businesses, which they say are being threatened by bureaucracy and the pace and scale of development in London. In the past five years, London has lost half its nightclubs and more than 40% of its music venues. Last month, one of the country’s best-known nightclubs, Fabric, lost its licence after two drug-related deaths. The closure was “a miserable day for London’s clubbing landscape”, according to the Ministry of Sound.
Earlier this year, Passing Clouds, a live music and community venue in east London, closed after the building’s lease was sold to “property developers seeking to cash in on the huge popularity of Dalston, which we ourselves were instrumental in helping to establish”, said Gudrun Getz, its events manager. “Every venue owner I’ve spoken to is worried they’re going to be next on the chopping block,” she told the World Travel Guide. The roll call of closures includes Cable, a 1,300-capacity club under railway arches in London Bridge, which in 2013 was forced to make way for station redevelopment; Turnmills, which became an office block; and the Vibe Bar in Brick Lane, which closed in 2014 due to “excessive and unreasonable restrictions on our activity”. The Coronet in south London recently won a year’s reprieve but is expected to close in January 2018 as part of a shopping centre redevelopment. Club owners and advocates of London’s night-time economy blame restrictive licensing laws, aggressive property development and growing complaints from new residents. “What’s frustrating about the UK is that we don’t actually see that the night-time economy helps make places more attractive to a highly educated, very mobile, creative workforce that creates a huge number of new jobs and businesses wherever they choose to go,” said Rohan Silva, the founder of start-up workspace and cultural centre Second Home. “British policy makers don’t understand the relationship between the night-time economy and our cities being places that talented people want to live and work in.” London’s mayor and his new night tsar will address these issues, says City Hall. Better protection for music venues and nightclubs will be put in place and the mayor will work with developers to find new sites. A new “agent of change” principle means that the onus will be on developers to take steps such as soundproofing new residential properties in areas where music venues or nightclubs are already established. Likewise, if a nightclub opens in a residential area, it will be responsible for safeguarding residents’ peace.
Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Zurich and Toulouse already have “night mayors” but, said Marion Roberts, professor of urban design at the University of Westminster, “you have to be very careful about making comparisons between London and other European cities”. London’s population is almost three times that of Berlin and four times that of Paris, she pointed out. “New York or Tokyo are more accurate comparators.” Roberts hopes the night tsar will encourage new kinds of night-time activity in London, such as markets, gallery openings, film clubs and classical music concerts, as well as clubs. Londoners want relaxed, quirky and experimental offerings, she said. According to Silva, “it’s striking how few things there are to do at 1am or 2am. We’re nothing like a 24-hour city.” He opened his bookshop Libreria through the night to mark the start of the night tube in August and was astonished when thousands of people flocked there. He also cited the popularity of the Institut Francais’ all-night philosophy sessions, and the Shuffle festival in Mile End, “where there was poetry at 3am and science workshops at 4am, and it was packed all night”. Changes in working patterns were fuelling demand for more flexibility in people’s lives, he said. “By the end of 2018, we’re expecting there to be more freelancers and self-employed than there are people working in the public sector. “There have been profound shifts in the way we work, freeing people from the tyranny of nine to five. It’s creating more expectation that cities like London should cater for different lifestyles.” Meanwhile, an appeal against Fabric’s loss of licence will be heard next month, and many clubbers, club owners and champions of the night-time economy will be watching closely. “It will be a signal,” said Silva. “London is facing a big test of its resolve post-Brexit to be attractive to global people who can choose to be anywhere they want to be. We need all the positive messages we can muster.”"
2016-10-22T23:05:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Stage play reveals pressure athletes face to use drugs,"One of Britain’s leading experts on doping in sport, and an adviser to a new play on cheating among athletes, has warned that British sports stars are under pressure to use performance-enhancing drugs in the wake of the country’s Olympic success. Michele Verroken, former director of ethics and anti-doping at UK Sport and a campaigner for improved drugs testing, spoke this weekend of her fears for elite athletes before the premiere of a disturbing drama that exposes the amount of normalised drug-use among top competitors. “Rio was very inspiring and there was a crazy medal tally for us, for whatever reason, whether partly that the Russians were not there in numbers or because of more robust testing. But the UK is not beyond suspicion,” said Verroken, who hopes the new play, Deny, Deny, Deny, will highlight the growing threat to British sporting integrity. “Olympian athletes are now doing everything they can to stay up there. Most may just be using more science to analyse their data and lose weight, but we are hugely in danger of not giving people confidence that sport is clean and is fair.” Deny, Deny, Deny is written by a former TV reporter, Jonathan Maitland, who is already acclaimed for two recent plays on controversial themes: Dead Sheep, about the Thatcher cabinet in 1989, and An Audience with Jimmy Savile, which examined the way the paedophile TV personality evaded detection. Maitland’s new subject is the intense relationship between a ruthless coach and a talented athlete and Deny, Deny, Deny, which opens in London on 3 November, shows the increasingly blurred line between sensible preparation for a competition and cheating. “It’s the first rule in the doper’s handbook: if you’re accused of cheating, deny it. Then deny it again. And carry on denying it until you can’t,” said Maitland this weekend. “It is important because sport is a very emotional thing for those who play and those who watch it. It matters whether it is genuine sporting achievement or not.”
The writer spoke to coaches and competitors, as well as to Verokken, and he found that some now regard athletic performance as a branch of the entertainment industry. A victory on the track or in the field, they argue, is no longer as simple as it looks. “It does become a form of entertainment and about keeping television viewers,” said Verokken. “We have a surfeit of British Olympians now and they will not all be able to make a living endorsing products or becoming television pundits. So it is competitive, even after you are an Olympian. I can see why Jess Ennis is retiring now rather than have that potential conversation about whether she is going to deliver the medals any more.” Broadcaster and retired British sprinter Jeanette Kwakye was technical consultant on the play and wants coaches and aspiring athletes to come along and consider the arguments. “The timing of this play could not be more apt, given the current status of doping in sport,” she said. “It is a subject close to my heart, having raced and competed against those who will cross the line of ethics to get to the finish line first.” The play is set in the near future and tells of Eve, a young athlete, who is offered a cutting-edge therapy by her charismatic coach. “The coach-athlete relationship fascinates me,” said Maitland. “There was a telling line in the book by Dwain Chambers [the British sprinter banned for doping], which said ‘Looking back, I now realise my coach was grooming me.’ When I read that I knew there was a play in the subject.” Although the drama is set in a world of technological developments yet to come, Maitland has still had to update the script. “I added a line recently about the wisdom of handing out honours to athletes before knowing all the relevant facts,” he said. “I’ve been lucky too: I came up with a sub-plot about the theft of an athlete’s medical records by a Russian computer hacker and then, a few weeks later, the same thing happened in real life.”
Verokken believes the real peril is a fresh expectation that top British athletes are on a conveyor belt to the Olympic podium. “There are definitely some coaches and even doctors who are looking for their moment of glory more than anything else, and they get close to the team and persuade them they are not breaking the rules as they are written. “The whole supplement market is predicated on that,” she said. “It will be easy for sport to lose its way when what really matters is competition on the day. You can see what has happened by the way some sports have developed so quickly.” There should be a way to make a clearer distinction between athletes who were ill-advised and those who are deliberately cheating and denying allegations in the hope they will avoid punishment, she said. “The problem is there is no precise science for testing available yet and different laboratories have different standards and resources. Even our anti-doping programmes cannot keep up once we are talking about enhancing surgery, such as the laser eye work that is already happening.” Young athletes, said Verokken, need to be helped to rediscover “that sport is about disappointment as well as success”. “Otherwise we will soon an even bigger separation between those who participate for fun and the world of elite sport,” she said."
2016-10-22T23:05:29Z,uk-news,UK news,"Britain must not abandon its role fighting terrorism in Europe, says Nick Clegg","Theresa May will be seen as “soft on terrorism and organised crime” unless she signs the UK up to continued membership of Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, warns the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. A key decision over whether the UK remains inside Europol, which pools criminal intelligence and allows this to be shared between police and security forces across the EU, is seen by MPs as the crucial “first test” for the prime minister in Brexit negotiations. MPs of all parties – including those on the cross-party European scrutiny select committee – are demanding a full House of Commons debate and vote on Europol within the next month as a matter of urgency, following calls from police and intelligence agencies for the UK to retain full membership. May herself has praised Europol and other EU crime-fighting agencies for bringing terrorists to justice and helping to track down cross-border criminal networks, including those involving paedophiles and people traffickers. Clegg said last night that the “hugely important” decision would show whether May was ready to put the national interest and safety of UK citizens above the “anti-EU” dogma of some in her own party who wish to leave all organisations run by the EU, even if they clearly benefit the UK. “If the government elevates anti-European dogma above what has been proven to keep Britain safe, Theresa May will leave herself open to claims that she has gone soft on the fight against international terrorism and soft on the fight against organised crime,” Clegg said. “It would be a spectacular own goal if we were to leave an organisation that we helped establish, contribute so much towards, and which has proved so vital in the fight against international criminal networks.” Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said it was vital that cooperation with EU nations was maintained in the fight against terrorism and international crime: “That will be difficult now that we are exiting the EU. I would expect the government to set up a specialist team to negotiate this aspect of Brexit, and parliament should be kept fully informed at all times. These issues require ongoing cross-party support. “Opting into the latest Europol measure is the first test of the government’s resolve on this issue. The clock is ticking but so far the government has sat on its hands. This is not an issue that can be fudged to appease Tory backbenchers.” Ministers must decide by the end of this year whether to accept a new, expanded remit for Europol, agreed by the 28 member states after the Paris and Brussels terror attacks. If they do, the UK police and intelligence services will continue to have full access to Europol databases and services. However, many Tory MPs will see the move as a “fudge” and a sign that the prime minister is backing away from a “hard Brexit”. Crucially, if the UK stays in Europol it will have to pay budget contributions to the EU and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes – two conditions unacceptable for hardcore Brexiters. Were the government to reject the deal, the UK would drop out of Europol from May next year. The many UK staff at its headquarters in The Hague, including its British director, Rob Wainwright, would have to go. May has raised the issue with international leaders in recent weeks, expressing her preference for remaining in Europol but also her fears that her party will see such a move as an early Brexit capitulation. In a speech in April, before the Brexit vote, she cited crime-fighting and sharing intelligence at EU level as a major reason for staying in the EU. “Our response to Paris and Brussels cannot be to say that we should have less co-operation with countries that are not only our allies but our nearest neighbours,” she said. In a recent report, the Commons European scrutiny committee demanded a debate in parliament before any decision is made and expressed disappointment that ministers had said so little on the subject. The Home Office said that no decision had yet been taken: “The prime minister has stated that law enforcement cooperation will continue when the UK is outside the EU, and we will do what is necessary to keep our people safe. The Government will take a decision on whether to opt-in to the new Europol Regulation in due course.”"

Jodie Wilkinson, 27, died in hospital after being attacked on Stanhope Street, Arthur’s Hill, on Monday shortly before 3.50pm. A 25-year-old man who was also stabbed in the attack was treated in hospital and later discharged. David Waterston, 43, of Hamilton Place in the city, appeared before magistrates on Saturday wearing a grey sweatshirt and grey jogging bottoms. He was remanded in custody and will reappear at Newcastle crown court on Tuesday. A total of nine people were arrested as part of the investigation into Wilkinson’s murder and eight have now been bailed pending further inquiries. Police believe a gang of up to 11 people were involved in the attack. Three men – one aged 22 and two aged 25 – were held on Monday at a house near the scene, and on Tuesday two more men, aged 18 and 20, were arrested. Waterson was arrested on Wednesday, and on Thursday police arrested two boys, aged 14 and 15, and a 15-year-old girl in connection with the death. Wilkinson got into trouble with the police shortly after leaving school. She had drink and drug problems in her early 20s and lived on the streets before turning her life around and becoming a well-known volunteer with local charities. In 2010, Wilkinson was given a young achiever’s award by the Evening Chronicle newspaper in recognition of her work with young people. The same year she was also the recipient of a young person’s achievement award by Children & Young People Now magazine."

Riot officers forced their way into the house just after 8pm on Sunday and detained the man, who has not been named, after attempts to negotiate with him failed. They were assisted by firefighters from the London Fire Brigade. A full search was taking place after the standoff was brought to an end on Sunday evening, officers said. Up to 80 people were evacuated from addresses in the surrounding area in Northolt, north-west London, as a precaution. Police said they were ensuring the area was safe before people could return to their homes. “I am really pleased that this incident has now ended and importantly ended without anyone coming to harm,” said chief supt Paul Martin of the Met police. “Our key priority throughout this was to get the man out of the address safely as we had growing concerns about his well-being and believed him to be in crisis. After attempts to negotiate over a number of days did not work we used specialist officers to work out how we could gain entry to the address as safely as we could. They did that this evening.” A spokesman for Scotland Yard said police had been called in the early hours of Saturday morning after reports of concerns about an occupant and hazardous substances at the address in Wood End Lane.
Police believed the man was alone at the address and may have barricaded himself in. A police statement release while the standoff was taking place said: “While it is not known exactly what the man has inside the property, police are treating seriously reports that the items appeared hazardous and dangerous, as they are said to include quantities of petrol and combustible material. It has also been reported that attempts have been made to prevent access to the property.” Neighbours told the BBC that the man had “aggressive, dangerous dogs”, which was one reason why police were being particularly cautious and had not tried to enter the house. A woman who claimed to be a cousin of the man told the broadcaster he recently had a “breakdown”. There was no suggestion the incident was terrorist related and it was not linked to any other active investigation or operation, police said. Ealing council’s leader, Julian Bell, said: “The safety of our residents is our top priority and council officers will continue to be on hand to give any necessary assistance until the incident has been resolved.”"
2016-10-24T05:00:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Court of appeal in Belfast due to give judgment on 'gay cake row',"An appeal judgment will be delivered in a Northern Ireland court on Monday morning over a Belfast bakery that was fined for refusing to make a gay-themed cake. Ashers Bakery is appealing against a Belfast county court ruling in 2015 that found it guilty of discriminating against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation. The firm was ordered to pay £500 compensation to the local gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose legal action was backed by the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland. Lee had tried to buy a cake depicting the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie below the motto “Support Gay Marriage” for an event to mark the International Day Against Homophobia. When the company refused to bake the cake, Lee sued. At the original court case in 2015 Lee said Ashers Bakery’s refusal to take his order made him “feel I’m not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong”. Lee, a volunteer member of the LGBT advocacy group Queer Space, had ordered the cake for a private function in Bangor, County Down, in May 2014. His order came shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make gay marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where gay marriage is still not recognised in law. The DUP has a strong base in the province’s Evangelical Christian community and was founded out of the late Dr Ian Paisley’s Free Presbyterian Church. The party has consistently blocked proposals in the assembly from other parties including their main partners in government, Sinn Féin, to legalise gay marriage. During a four-day hearing at the court of appeal in Belfast in May, lawyers for the McArthur family, who own Ashers, said they had challenged the finding because in their eyes it would have been sinful for them to complete the order. In their legal battle to overturn the ruling the McArthur family have won the support of Northern Ireland’s attorney general, John Larkin QC. During the hearing Larkin argued in court that the McArthur family was entitled to constitutional protection for turning down a customer’s order based on their personal religious beliefs. He claimed the case against the bakery was one of “coerced expression”. He told the court: “The wrong occurs, and can amount to cruelty, to make someone say something fundamentally at variance with their political opinion or religious views.” The three appeal judges for Monday’s judgment will include Northern Ireland’s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, and Lord Justices Weatherup and Weir. Daniel McArthur, the general manager of Ashers Baking Company, and his wife Amy will be present outside the court shortly after 9am on Monday as they attend to hear the judgment delivered. Ashers, which employ 80 staff across nine branches in Northern Ireland, has had its legal fees paid by the Christian Institute. At a previous hearing Daniel McArthur explained why his family-run firm turned down Lee’s request for the cake. “We happily serve everyone but we cannot promote a cause that goes against what the Bible says about marriage. We have tried to be guided in our actions by our Christian beliefs,” he said."
2016-10-24T07:05:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Let's get our gentrification story straight,"Are we quite sure we’re against gentrification, the urban phenomenon routinely blamed for everything held to be destroying London’s soul, from high housing costs, to corporatised shopping streets, to the pricing out of artists and other creative folk, to the alleged “social cleansing” of the poor? Do we absolutely know that gentrification is to blame for such bad things? Do we really know what we mean by the word? Its most popular deployment is familiar: it disparages the effects of an influx into neighbourhoods “with potential” of newcomers who are wealthier than those already there. At its most pejorative it characterises economic and demographic change in London – especially Inner London - as the colonisation by wealthy people of working class areas with high percentages of ethnic minority residents who are “pushed out” as a result. This story has become firmly entrenched among the metropolitan left and beyond. Resistance has been declared. Hostility is aimed at estate agents, property developers and local councils deemed too friendly with them. Campaigners vow to defend “the community” and what they say are its wishes against the ravenous encroachments of “the rich”. The value of all this is that it highlights genuine anxieties about change and the current rapid pace of it, many of them easy to sympathise with. But that value is limited. The analysis that drives it may not be quite as solid or as righteous as it thinks. Gentrification in London is not new. It has been going on for decades, beginning in the 1960s when bits of the dirty old post-war city began to swing and adventurous young architects started doing up dirt cheap Georgian squares. By the early-1980s, Alexei Sayle had a joke about entire streets in Stoke Newington falling down because all the middle-class people who’d bought terraced houses there chose the same weekend to knock their front and back rooms into one. Thirty years on, that same joke might be made about Leyton, Peckham, Deptford or Plaistow. There is comedy too in the dislike gentrification inspires. Some of its fiercest opponents are its instigators: the media types and liberal young professionals of every kind who settle the wild and “edgy” urban frontiers, not necessarily to the delight of people already there, and in so doing quite literally prepare the ground for the value “uplift” to come. The funny part is that this truth escapes them. There is, though, a broader and a deeper irony. It is that these forces of change accused of ruining London are products of its revitalisation. People forget that for four decades the city was bombed out, smogged up and in decline. The population of Inner London still hasn’t recovered to its levels of 1939. Today, people bewail a “hollowing out” attributed to rich foreigners who allegedly “buy to leave” in large numbers. It’s worth remembering that ordinary people have migrated from the centre of London to the suburbs and beyond for many, many years, often eagerly. Skilled manual workers who headed for the New Towns in the 1950s were searching for the promised land. By the start of the present century, the whole dynamic had changed. London had become a wellspring of economic growth, gushing money from its turbo-charged Square Mile. Where there is profit, there are opportunities. Where there are opportunities, there are people eager to take them – in London’s case, more and more people, from near and far, many of them needing somewhere to set up shop, all of them needing somewhere to live. Demand for space is the seed of gentrification. Its growth stems from a failure to meet that demand. Squeezed by rising prices, those too affluent to qualify for social housing but not affluent enough to buy in newly-expensive areas – sometimes the very areas where they were born – look further afield. Opposition to gentrification sometimes sounds like the way a particular section of the London middle-class complains about not being able to get a mortgage. When we look at London’s unacceptable poverty, especially its child poverty, should gentrification be held responsible or is doing so a distraction from the job of addressing the issue properly? Assertions that it is “pushing out” the poor in London look less persuasive in light of the very high levels of social housing that still exist in the classic gentrified boroughs of north London. In Camden, 35% of all housing is for social rent, in Islington it’s 42% and in Hackney, 44%. Although poverty rates have fallen in those boroughs, the absolute numbers of poor people living in them remain high. There are good arguments that gentrified areas meet poor people’s needs less well, as shops become posher and more niche. But there are also good ones for saying that they benefit from middle-class pressure for better schools and public spaces. Some studies in the United States, focussing on the changing ethnic compositions of urban areas, have found that black people actually moved out of those that had gentrified less than they departed those that hadn’t. It’s time to get our gentrification story straight. Edward Clarke of the UK thinktank Centre for Cities writes that the debate should not be reduced to “a simple battle between plucky communities and greedy gentrifiers”, stressing that this “fails to recognise that the roles and functions of urban neighbourhoods have always changed over time and within a city” or to acknowledge that gentrifying “new work” businesses can create new jobs and improve wages across the board. He adds that “the myth that creative incomers are to blame” for rising housing costs and commercial rents works against addressing the true root of the problem, which he sums up as “poor city management”. To improve this, Clarke argues for better skills training for local people, more planning and tax-raising powers to be devolved to local politicians and more land, including a small portion of green belt, being made available for building. The thing we call gentrification raises large issues for London - and all the UK’s growing cities - and opposing it like trying to hold back the sea. Dealing with it requires a constructive, practical, flexible political response that helps to shape this force of urban change to best and most equitable effect. The politics of protest aren’t up to it."
2016-10-24T10:12:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Q&A: what happens now to the Calais refugees?,"Where are they going? Sixty buses will move the refugees and migrants to 164 reception centres across France. The accommodation centres, which are intended to be temporary, will each hold 40 to 50 people for up to four months while their asylum cases are examined. Those who do not claim asylum will be sent back to their country of origin. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed in the camp have said they do not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third say they will continue to try to get to the UK, according to the Refugee Rights Data Project.
How many people live at the camp? The authorities say 7,000 people live here but charities put the number closer to 10,000. The French president, François Hollande, appeared to acknowledge that the official figure was an underestimate when he said last month that as many as 9,000 people could be moved from the camp to the reception centres. How will the camp be demolished? It is understood that 40 people will arrive on Tuesday to begin dismantling the camp. An additional 3,000 police are expected in and around Calais this week to assist with the process of clearing the camp and to attempt to ensure that migrants who do not want to claim asylum do not flee and/or set up new, smaller camps. With the eyes of the world on Calais, police are expected to try a soft approach, at least to begin with. There are fears that anarchists will stoke the atmosphere if French police are deemed to be heavy-handed.
Why is this happening? France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, says the intention is to “unblock Calais”, which is said to have suffered serious economic security consequences as a result of the camp and the daily attempts by migrants to smuggle themselves on to lorries bound for Britain, sometimes leading to violent attacks on drivers. Politics has played a big part with the French right and far right increasing their calls for hardline action before next year’s presidential election. Alain Juppé, the current favourite to become the next president, has said France must push back its border with Britain from Calais to the Kent coast. The French government has also been under pressure to act to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the camp, where there is overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages as well as trafficking and exploitation of women and children. Hollande has said that conditions are not acceptable, especially for people fleeing war. What will happen to unaccompanied children? There is supposed to be a separate queue for the estimated 1,300 unaccompanied children in the camp at the warehouse that will act as a processing centre. About 500 are believed to be eligible to come to Britain under the amendment, brought about by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, himself a former child refugee. But campaigners fear that vulnerable minors could be lost in the chaos of the evacuation. Charity workers have expressed concern that children could be caught up in violence or left vulnerable to people traffickers. Have the French previously tried to clear the camp? In February and March, the authorities demolished a large area of the southern part of the camp, saying the aim was to radically reduce numbers of migrants. Police fired teargas at migrants who threw stones and set fire to shelters after dozens of makeshift shacks were dismantled. Despite the move, the number of people in the camp subsequently reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, exacerbating the overcrowding problem as an increased number of inhabitants were squeezed into an area of land less than half the size it previously was."
2016-10-24T10:55:02Z,uk-news,UK news,'Gay cake' row: born-again Christian bakers lose court appeal,"A bakery in Northern Ireland owned by evangelical Christians has lost an appeal to overturn a conviction that found it guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a pro-gay-marriage themed cake. The court of appeal in Belfast on Monday upheld a previous judgment last year that Ashers Bakery had discriminated against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation. The family-owned firm in the original case was also ordered to pay £500 compensation to the local gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose legal action was backed by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Lee had tried to buy a cake depicting the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie below the motto ‘Support gay marriage’ for an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia in 2014. The Ashers case has received international attention, and highlighted the tensions between gay rights reformers and the politically influential and socially conservative born-again Christian lobby within Northern Ireland. The three appeal judges on Monday were Northern Ireland’s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, and Lord Justices Weatherup and Weir. In delivering their judgment, Morgan rejected the argument of lawyers for Daniel McArthur and his family that the bakery would have been endorsing gay marriage equality by baking the cake. “The fact that a baker provides a cake for a particular team or portrays witches on a Halloween cake does not indicate any support for either,” the lord chief justice said. Following the judgment, Daniel McArthur, flanked by his wife Amy, said: “This ruling undermines democratic freedom, religious freedom and freedom of speech.” Supporters of the family firm, including former Democratic Unionist minister in the devolved government at Stormont Jim Wells, described the judgment as “an awful decision”. Wells said an appeal would be mounted against the ruling at the supreme court in London. Morgan declared that the original judgment at Belfast recorders court had been correct in finding that, “as a matter of law”, Ashers had “discriminated against the respondent directly on the grounds of sexual orientation contrary to the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2006”. He said the legislation on equality in the region could not be changed to suit one particular religious or political group. On Ashers’ stance regarding the cake, Morgan said: “The supplier may provide the particular service to all or to none but not to a selection of customers based on prohibited grounds. In the present case the appellants might elect not to provide a service that involves any religious or political message. What they may not do is provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious message in relation to sexual orientation.” The lord chief justice criticised the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. He said the publicly funded body should also have offered the McArthur family advice during the case, as the bakers believed their rights as people of faith within the commercial sphere were being undermined. Lee was embraced and shook hands with supporters after the judges left the court, and made a brief statement outside court expressing his relief. “The only thing that I would like to say is I’m relieved and very grateful to the court of appeal for the judgment,” he said. Speaking before going into the appeal court on Monday morning, Daniel McArthur had said: ”This has never been about the customer. It has been about a message promoting a cause that contradicts the Bible.” Lee placed his order at the bakery shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make gay marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still not recognised in law. The DUP has a strong base in the province’s evangelical Christian community and was founded out of the late Dr Ian Paisley’s Free Presbyterian church. The party has consistently blocked proposals in the assembly from other parties including their main partners in government, Sinn Féin, to legalise gay marriage. During a four-day hearing at the court of appeal in Belfast earlier this year, lawyers for the McArthur family said they challenged the finding because in their eyes it would have been sinful for them to complete the order. In their legal battle to overturn the ruling, the McArthur family won the support of Northern Ireland’s attorney general, John Larkin QC. During the hearing in May, the attorney general argued in court that the McArthur family was entitled to constitutional protection for turning down a customer’s order based on their personal religious beliefs. Following Monday’s ruling one of the main gay rights organisations in Northern Ireland welcomed the judges’ decision. John O’Doherty, the director of the Rainbow Project, said: “Ashers Baking Company entered into a contractual agreement to make this cake and then changed their mind. Sympathetic as some may be to the position in which the company finds itself, this does not change the facts of the case. The judgment clearly articulated that this is direct discrimination for which there can be no justification.” O’Doherty added: “We once again extend the hand of friendship to all people of faith, churches and families. We would encourage faith leaders to engage with our community to ensure better relations and to develop trust and respect between our overlapping communities for the betterment of our society.”"
2016-10-24T11:06:39Z,uk-news,UK news,"Eggheads star CJ de Mooi will not be extradited, court rules","The former Eggheads star CJ de Mooi no longer faces extradition to the Netherlands after a judge said a European arrest warrant should never have been issued. Dutch police had wanted De Mooi extradited to question him about an alleged murder in Amsterdam almost 30 years ago. However, Judge Khalid Quereshi said at Westminster magistrates court in central London on Monday that because no UK arrest warrant had been issued, no European equivalent should have followed. He dismissed the European arrest warrant issued in De Mooi’s real name, Joseph Connagh, and ordered that the £5,000 security he had paid be returned. The former panellist on the BBC quiz show was arrested after arriving at Heathrow airport on 21 September and appeared at Westminster magistrates the following morning. Chris Stevens, De Mooi’s lawyer, said the Dutch warrant did not even contain a victim’s name.
Dutch police began to investigate the alleged crime after De Mooi’s autobiography was published in September 2015, in which he said he “might have killed a drug addict by punching him and throwing him into a canal” when he lived in Amsterdam in 1988. Stevens told the court in September that his client had cooperated with British police earlier this year after the book was published. “It was a shock to him and his husband when he came to Heathrow to be pulled aside by security,” he said. De Mooi had been bailed pending a full extradition hearing scheduled for 28 November. He was also banned from travelling abroad, had to sleep every night at his home address and keep a charged mobile phone with him at all times. Rachael Scott, prosecuting, told the court on Monday that UK police were still interested in talking to De Mooi, who said he was happy to do so in Britain. The 46-year-old became a panellist on the BBC2 show, which features five quiz champions competing as a team against different challengers, in 2003 after winning a series of game shows. He was dropped by the BBC earlier this year."
2016-10-24T11:11:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester lord mayor 'subjected to homophobic abuse at Justin Bieber gig',"The lord mayor of Manchester has said he was subjected to a barrage of “really offensive and hurtful” homophobic abuse at a Justin Bieber concert on Sunday night. Carl Austin-Behan, Manchester’s first openly gay lord mayor, said he was called a “dirty faggot and a dirty gay” by two young women before the sold-out gig at Manchester Arena. Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the former RAF serviceman said he had reported the alleged hate crime to police. He said the offenders appeared to be in their late teens. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said: “Shortly after 7.30am on Monday 24 October 2016 police received a report of a hate crime that occurred on Hunt Street in Manchester city centre at around 6.50pm on Sunday 23 October. Inquiries are ongoing.” Bieber drew criticism from some fans for appearing to storm off stage. The Canadian singer, 22, had pleaded with the audience to stop screaming between songs. He told fans: “I don’t think it’s necessary when I’m trying to say something and you guys are screaming.” When the noise continued, he dropped the microphone and walked off stage before later returning to continue his performance.
Describing the incident with the two women, Austin-Behan said: “I’m in a privileged position at the moment as the lord mayor and one of the things I’ve stood my ground on is that we need to make sure we report hate crime and get that message across. The fact of highlighting that it’s still out there – however small it is, you still have to report it – because there are still people out there who feel it’s all right to be abusive. “I’m quite a strong person, I can take that. But if people are still saying those things about someone’s sexuality, I find that really offensive and hurtful. It’s important that we stand our ground and that we demand the respect we should get. It may seem trivial to some people, a bit of name-calling, but it’s highly offensive.” Austin-Behan, who was sworn in as lord mayor in May, said he was walking to the arena and saw the two girls arguing with a ticket tout when one of them allegedly said: “I’m not paying that to see a dirty gay.” He added: “As I walked past them I thought ‘I’m not happy with that’ so I turned round and said: ‘Do you think that’s appropriate, in this day and age?’ That’s when the barrage of comments came back [saying] ‘Am I gay? Am I gay? Am I a dirty faggot?’ and all that sort of stuff that started coming out. “I was annoyed. I wasn’t shaken up, I was annoyed. Because it was a Justin Bieber concert there was a lot of young people there, and it was a mix of people. I was more annoyed that people could go to a gig like that and feel they could get away with saying things like that.” Austin-Behan, who is also the youngest lord mayor in the 124-year history of the role, has told how he was thrown out of the RAF for being gay. He was fired from the air force in 1997 when his then partner told RAF bosses about his sexual orientation in order to stop him being posted abroad. Rules preventing gay people from serving in the RAF were overturned in 2000. After an 18-month stint working for Manchester fire service, Austin-Behan was crowned Mr Gay UK in 2001. The councillor for the Burnage ward has since worked as a small business owner in Manchester and runs a cleaning company with a business partner. He married his partner of 12 years, Simon Austin-Behan, last year."
2016-10-24T11:56:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Greenwich tube bomb suspect named as Damon Smith,"A man arrested on Friday in connection with an improvised bomb found at a London tube station has been named as first-year university student Damon Smith, 19. Police found the device at North Greenwich underground station last Thursday. Smith was arrested after being Tasered on Holloway Road, north London, on Friday lunchtime on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. Counter-terrorism officers sealed off a road and evacuated homes in Newton Abbot, Devon, to search a property in connection with the case on Saturday afternoon, and a local football game was interrupted so that helicopters could land on the pitch. The police found a second improvised bomb behind a garage, which police later said was “not viable” as a device. Neighbours revealed that Smith, who had once wanted to be a policeman, lived at the Devon address with his mother until he moved to London for university weeks ago. Alan Warburton, 40, who lives nearby, said Smith was “always nice”, adding: “He just came across as an intelligent kid. He didn’t go to mainstream school for a bit because he used to get bullied because he sounded like a girl.” Warburton said Smith’s arrest and the raid was “scary” adding: “He would say when he was finished at uni he would leave and train as a police officer.” Smith described himself as a fan of online poker and posted videos of himself gambling to his social media accounts. Warburton said: “He would go to casinos and his mum would take him.” He added there were rumours circulating locally that the garden of Smith’s former house would be dug up as some said “there’s more bombs”. Alec Smith, 23, said Damon used to be friends with his younger brother Connor, 19, and was into martial arts. He also said Damon had been bullied at school. “I used to play poker with Damon in Torquay. He was always sat on his own waiting for the games to start,” he said. Sid Moslehi, who runs the Jolly Abbot pub opposite Smith’s former home, said: “I’d seen him before but knew nothing about him. It was surprising for everybody. I feel sorry for the family.” Smith and his mother left Newton Abbot “six or seven weeks ago”, neighbours said, when he moved to start a course at London Metropolitan University, which has a campus on Holloway Road. A spokesman for the university confirmed that he enrolled three weeks ago. His mother is understood to have moved to the capital with him. Westminster magistrates court granted a warrant on Saturday for the police to hold Smith for questioning until Friday lunchtime."
2016-10-24T13:30:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Tobacco smuggler has Kent land seized to help meet £4m public debt,"A convicted tobacco smuggler has been stripped of a prime parcel of riverside land in Kent to meet his more than £4m debt to the public purse. Robert Doran was jailed for four and a half years in 2012 for bankrolling a large-scale cigarette smuggling operation. The Dubai-based businessman was ordered to pay £1.45m, which he then claimed was “disproportionate” and breached the European convention on human rights. But in March 2015 the court of appeal rejected his case against the Crown Prosecution Service’s proceeds of crime unit. The judges imposed a new confiscation order of nearly £4.4m – the total benefit of the criminal enterprise – plus interest of £200,000. The decision was upheld by the supreme court last year. HMRC, working jointly with the CPS, secured a restraint order to help force Doran, 51, to part with the land in Dartford – his main asset in the UK. The holding was sold this month. The order was the result of a lengthy HMRC investigation that revealed a complex web of companies, ownerships and leases to confirm that Doran, who lived in a Dubai apartment worth millions and drove sports cars, owned the land. David Cowie, the assistant director of HMRC’s fraud investigation service, said: “His brazen attempts to have the confiscation order quashed backfired spectacularly. Doran lived the high life in Dubai but has already spent years behind British bars. HMRC and our partner agencies will work together to strip criminals of the proceeds of their crimes.” Lorraine Lally, a prosecutor in the CPS proceeds of crime unit, said Doran had spent years trying to avoid paying what he owed the taxpayer. “Fraudsters need to realise that we will go further than just imprisonment. If convicted, we can and will track down and confiscate the proceeds of their crimes,” she said. Doran and his accomplice, Patrick Gray, supplied the finance for the smuggling operation. The pair were also involved in the purchase, packaging and shipment of the cigarettes. The crime was discovered after documents were examined from two freight containers that arrived at the Port of Felixstowe. They claimed the containers were filled with more than 1,000 cartons of baby toys, but they were crammed with about 20m cigarettes, evading £3.8m in duty and taxes."
2016-10-24T15:18:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Killer of Oxford rare books dealer given 34-year jail sentence,"An unemployed father of two from Peterborough has been told he will serve at least 34 years in prison after being found guilty of the murder of a rare books dealer in Oxford. Michael Danaher, 50, attacked and killed Adrian Greenwood, 42, in the hallway of his victim’s home on 6 April, after hatching a plan to rob him of a rare first edition of The Wind in the Willows that Greenwood had listed on eBay for £50,000. A jury at Oxford crown court heard that Danaher had also drawn up a “hit list” of celebrities and wealthy business people he planned to rob and kidnap, and had researched the home addresses of others including Simon Cowell, Gary Lineker and Kate Moss. Sentencing Danaher to life imprisonment, Judge Ian Pringle QC said the “savage stabbing” had involved “significant planning and premeditation”. He added: “Despite the fact that at 50 you had no previous convictions, warnings or cautions of any sort, it’s clear that during the course of 2015 you drew up this list – probably to rob or burgle people – or perhaps kidnap people and hold them to ransom, so as to gain funds for yourself. “It’s clear from the timeline in this case you became almost obsessive about keeping up on famous celebrities.” Greenwood suffered 33 stab wounds in the assault, including a deep puncture wound to his back, and multiple blunt force injuries. There were also numerous superficial puncture wounds, which a pathologist told a jury at Oxford crown court were consistent with having been tortured for information.
Danaher admitted killing the antiques dealer, but claimed it was self-defence, telling the court that Greenwood had suddenly attacked him with a knife after he made a bad joke. He said he had visited the dealer to discuss buying other cheap books. Danaher said he had grabbed the blade of the knife to defend himself in the scuffle, but suffered only superficial scratches. He paused to take a selfie of a nick on his cheek as he left Greenwood dead or dying. The book dealer’s body was discovered by his cleaner the following day. Over the course of a three-week trial, jurors heard that Danaher targeted the Oxford dealer after he listed the rare copy of the Kenneth Grahame children’s book – particularly valuable because it still had its original dust jacket – on eBay in August 2015. Danaher, who weighed 25 stone, was estranged from his wife, £13,000 in debt and unemployed after falling out with his boss at an engines company in Peterborough, and scraped a living by buying and selling low-value items on the auction site. After the killing, police found an Excel spreadsheet on Danaher’s laptop that contained Greenwood’s name alongside those of a number of other wealthy individuals Danaher planned to rob or kidnap for ransom. Against Greenwood’s name, he had written: “Expected take: rare books”; “Reason: tosser”. Next to “Modus”, he wrote “Any!!”
Also included on the list, which Danaher called Enterprises, were the model Kate Moss and the Conservative peer Jeffrey Archer, along with a number of wealthy business figures, among them prominent Conservative party donors. Under “reason”, several were marked “Tory” or “scum Tory”. Danaher also searched for the home addresses of celebrities including Eamonn Holmes, Louise Redknapp and Michael Parkinson and other “people of means”. A floorplan of the home of the TV presenter Anthea Turner was also found on his laptop. Danaher’s internet history showed he had looked up how to buy samurai swords, regulations on owning rifles, “opening locks without keys” and “the technique of silent killing”. In a bizarre defence, he attempted to claim it was not him but another man – whom he would not name for fear of “consequences” – that had carried out the searches and drawn up the list. This man would come and go from his Peterborough flat at all hours of the day and night, Danaher claimed, and had full use of his mobile phone and laptop. Occasionally, Danaher said, he would lend the man his phone and car, which he claimed explained why both had been traced to the home of the wealthy businessman Adrian Beecroft, when a man had tried to force his way in while disguised as a delivery driver. He fled when Beecroft’s wife screamed for help. After the killing, Danaher took the copy of The Wind in the Willows back to his flat in Peterborough and showed it to his son, before listing it for sale on eBay just hours after the killing. He was arrested after phone records and numberplate scanning traced Greenwood’s mobile and Danaher’s Citroën Picasso car to Peterborough. The broken murder weapon and a pair of bloodied boots were found at his flat, along with a stun gun, disguised as an iPhone."
2016-10-24T17:43:31Z,uk-news,UK news,How Britain’s black miners are reclaiming their place in history,"One of the things that attracted Fitzalbert Taylor to becoming a coal miner was the warmth. “It was like I’d emigrated to a different country down there,” says the 88-year-old. “It was so warm. When I was in the building trade, I couldn’t feel my arms or my legs – donkey jacket, two pairs of trousers and you were still cold.” Taylor moved to the UK from Jamaica in 1954 when he was 26, and spent 25 years working as a miner. Now he has joined about 20 men who are involved in a project that aims to record the experiences of black miners in the UK – Coal Miners of African Heritage: Narratives from Nottinghamshire. The project will produce a collection of audio recordings and oral histories, along with a booklet to help preserve and share the miners’ stories. The initiative’s founder, historian Norma Gregory, says the role black miners played in the history of British mining industry has been badly neglected. “I’ve searched through so many books, films and archives, with the help of volunteers, and I’ve found very few mentions of miners of other nationalities,” she says.
Gregory is also working with the BBC to produce a programme about the history of black miners, due to be broadcast later this year. Depictions of Britain’s industrial history tend to focus on white working-class communities, but Gregory’s research into Nottinghamshire’s mining industry has revealed communities of miners from Italy, Lithuania and Poland, as well as the Caribbean islands. It’s important to recognise that “this country wasn’t built by one set of people”, says Gregory. There are no reliable records of how many non-white miners worked in British mines but Gregory estimates that between the early 50s and the late 80s there were nearly 1,000 men of African-Caribbean origin working in Nottinghamshire mines at any one time. Collieries did not keep records of workers’ ethnicity, and when pits started closing in the 1980s personnel documents were often destroyed, leaving researchers like Gregory to rely on former miners to suggest possible interviewees. Garrey Mitchell started working at Gedling colliery in Nottingham in 1975, aged 17, and worked there until 1986, when he left to start his own business. He got the job because the manager had known his father, who was also a miner, and who had emigrated from Jamaica in the early 50s. “We were very united down there. You had to be,” says Mitchell. “You had to watch each others’ backs. Colour didn’t come into it. We were all on one level.”
Lincoln Cole, 83, father of the ex-England footballer Andy Cole, worked at Gedling from 1965-87, after he left Jamaica in 1957. “I enjoyed mining, because you got to make friends,” he says. “If a finger got crushed, there would be somebody there to come and give you a helping hand.” “Once you came back on to the surface and had a shower, then the white folks would stick to themselves and the black folks would stick to themselves,” says Mitchell. “But when you were down there, you were automatically united, because you knew you were all in the same boat.” Gedling colliery – where many of Gregory’s interview subjects worked – employed men from 15 countries and was described as the “pit of nations” in a 1967 Daily Mirror report. In the 60s, 10% of the pit’s 1,400-strong workforce was thought to have hailed from the Caribbean, and the colliery’s union banner showed a black miner alongside two white colleagues above the words “Brothers beneath the surface”.
The harmony depicted on the banner, however, did not represent race relations in Nottinghamshire. On 23 August 1958, the city saw a 1,000-person-strong race riot, a precursor to the violence that erupted in London’s Notting Hill a week later. Eight people were hospitalised and the Nottingham Evening Post wrote that Nottingham had become like “a slaughterhouse”. Cole says his introduction to the city in the early 60s wasn’t particularly pleasant. “There were teddy boys with bicycle chains,” he says. “From six o’clock you couldn’t go out, because they would kick you left, right and centre.” While racial tension was simmering over on the streets, it does not feature much in the accounts from below ground. When a colleague used a racial slur against Cole, the colliery manager told the offender to apologise immediately and threatened to sack him. The men report that opportunities for promotion were limited because of their skin colour, and Mitchell says black miners generally brushed off racist comments by colleagues: “There was no use having friction, because it would give a bad atmosphere and [that was] the last thing you wanted.” When the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike in 1972 and 1974, black miners in Nottingham joined their colleagues on the picket line. However, along with 73% of their fellow Nottinghamshire miners, most did not strike during the 1984-85 strike. “I stood side by side with the miners who were on strike,” says Mitchell, who did strike in the 80s. “You had to stand with your colleagues, you couldn’t let them down.” Taylor recalls being asked to stand at the front of the picket line during a strike in the 70s. “If the policemen had seen me at the front, [a black man], you can just imagine how they would have hit me,” he says. “I’d been in this country too long not to know what was going off.”
In an interview with Gregory, Taylor said that the experience persuaded him that industrial action was not for “us black men”. “After the 1972 strike, I said I was never going on a picket line again,” he said. Many of the ex-miners now suffer from long-term health issues such as emphysema, pneumoconiosis, or “black lung” (coal dust in the lungs), and chronic bronchitis. “It was hard work, because you had to be on your hands and knees,” says Cole, who fractured his hip bone in an accident. “My body was knackered, but it was worth it, because it was secure [work].” Taylor was forced to take seven months off work after an accident left him with a broken helmet, a “bust head” and a broken jaw. “I didn’t know how bad it was until I resumed work and one of the men said to me: ‘Albert, when you came up that day and I looked at you, I thought you were dead.’” The project seeks to redress a historical oversight. “I went on the internet to find out about black miners in Britain and there was nothing at all. I was very surprised. We’ve just been left out,” says Mitchell. “I feel hurt by it all, because black people contributed a lot to the mining industry.”"
2016-10-24T18:38:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Met inspector prevented from retiring to avoid disciplinary action,"A high court judge has intervened to prevent a Metropolitan police inspector charged with two criminal offences from retiring at midnight on Monday to avoid disciplinary proceedings and the loss of his full pension. The inspector, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with actual bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. The charges relate to an alleged incident that took place at a football match in 2011. His criminal trial is due to take place early next year. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) recommended that he face disciplinary proceedings for gross misconduct in relation to the criminal charges. But the inspector said he was going to retire, which would have allowed him to avoid the disciplinary proceedings and keep his full pension. Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Fiona Taylor agreed that he could retire without facing disciplinary proceedings and he was due to retire at midnight on Monday. His alleged victim went to the high court on Monday afternoon to try to prevent him from retiring and avoiding disciplinary proceedings. Mr Justice Wilkie ruled that he should not retire on Monday and said that his retirement should not take effect until there has been a further court hearing to examine the issues relating to the officer’s plan to retire and thus avoid gross misconduct proceedings. Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who represents the inspector’s alleged victim, said: “It is not acceptable for officers to evade accountability by retiring whilst under investigation. My client has been deeply affected as a result of his treatment by this officer. He hopes that this case will clarify the law and protect other members of the public.” The inspector submitted his application to retire on 5 September 2016. The IPCC supported Monday’s legal challenge to try to prevent the inspector from retiring on Monday night. A spokesman said: “The IPCC believes that officers should not be able to avoid disciplinary proceedings by retiring while under investigation or facing proceedings in circumstances which could result in dismissal. The decision whether to suspend officers or to allow them to retire can only be taken by a police force. The IPCC strongly supported changes to the law introduced last year, which prevent officers resigning when the investigation could lead to their dismissal from the force. Further planned legislative change, also supported by the IPCC, will mean that officers can still face disciplinary proceedings after retirement in some circumstances.” A Metropolitan police service spokesman said: “The MPS has taken the decision not to suspend the inspector in order to prevent him from retiring. “As the inspector is facing criminal proceedings he will be held to account for his alleged actions during the course of the court case, meaning he will not escape sanction by retiring. “If the officer is acquitted at court then any potential disciplinary proceedings would essentially be considering the same allegations that had already been determined in his favour. Therefore there is no certainty that the officer would face misconduct proceedings. “Decisions of this nature are made on the specific circumstances of each case and are not taken lightly. The decision must be proportionate, balancing a range of considerations.” If the inspector had been allowed to retire on Monday night he would have received a six-figure lump sum for his pension along with annual payments – he has 30 years’ service and is entitled to an annual sum of two-thirds of his current £54,963 salary. For now that pension payout is on hold."
2016-10-24T19:00:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow third runway expected to get May cabinet green light,"Theresa May’s government is likely to back a third runway at Heathrow on Tuesday, six years after the coalition scrapped plans for the project.
Two sources on the cabinet’s airports subcommittee have told the Guardian they expect the group to back Heathrow, after it meets on Tuesday morning to make a final decision. Members of the nine-strong committee have been directed to make their decisions on the basis of the evidence of the Airports Commission, which was led by Sir Howard Davies. That put forward two options for expanding at Heathrow and one at Gatwick, before making a final recommendation for a third runway at Heathrow last year. The decision will be explained to MPs by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, at 12.30pm but is likely to emerge soon after the committee, chaired by May herself, has met earlier in the morning. Both the interim and final reports of the commission, in December 2013 and July 2015, were released at 7am as they were regarded as market sensitive. No 10 has been careful to say that expansion at either Heathrow or Gatwick is still on the table. However, speculation has been mounting in favour of Heathrow since May announced plans to allow ministers to speak out against the chosen option if they have a longstanding opposition and to delay holding a parliamentary vote for more than a year.
This would allow Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to speak out against Heathrow if it is chosen for many months. If Heathrow is picked, it will mean a reversal in Conservative policy since David Cameron as opposition leader ruled out backing a third runway with “no ifs, no buts”. Although ministers are likely to be happy with the compromise offered by May, a number of Conservative backbenchers would be furious with a decision in favour of Heathrow. The decision is likely to trigger a byelection at some point as Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond Park, is expected to resign and stand again as an independent. Tania Mathias, the Conservative MP for Twickenham, told the Guardian she did not feel that concerns about air quality and noise impact around Heathrow have been resolved since Cameron last year delayed a decision on a third runway to consider the environmental impact further. “If the decision is Heathrow, I do not think they can get through the public consultation and scrutiny,” she said. “I will be saying they cannot fudge their data now. I think it will mark the beginning of the end for any expansion to Heathrow.” Grayling insisted this weekend that a decision had yet to be made between Heathrow and Gatwick. But the cabinet subcommittee, which excludes prominent opponents of Heathrow expansion, appears likely to follow the “clear and unanimous” recommendation of the Airports Commission in July 2015 to build a £17.6bn runway by 2025. Gatwick, which still harbours slim hopes of getting the nod over Heathrow, has warned that its option is its own second runway plan or “Groundhog Day”, pointing to two recent instances – in 2003 and 2009 – when the government has approved a third runway at the west London hub without it being built. The West Sussex airport’s chairman, Sir Roy McNulty, on Monday wrote to members of May’s airports subcommittee in a last-ditch attempt to underline its claims as the “progressive, competitive option”. McNulty wrote: “Gatwick expansion … would build on the success of airport competition that has seen more choice, improved services and lower fares for passengers. It would help write the next chapter in this success story rather than turn the clock back to the old monopoly of the past.”
However, Sir Howard Davies on Monday reiterated his view that the case for Heathrow was overwhelming, adding: “You struggle to find local supporters of expansion near Gatwick.” The government’s response to the commission’s report was delayed last December, ostensibly to conduct further studies into air quality around Heathrow. Although the results of the Department for Transport’s research have not been released, Heathrow has said it is confident that the studies have turned up no new obstacle. But environmental concerns will be at the forefront of opposition to Heathrow expansion, in terms of air quality, climate change and noise. Green MP Caroline Lucas condemned the “climate-wrecking plans” for new runways and called for a frequent flyer levy to reduce the demand for flying. She said: “We know that laying more Tarmac at either Heathrow or Gatwick will bust any hope we have of meeting our climate change commitments, and inflict noise and air pollution on already blighted local communities.” Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth backed the proposal. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “Aviation is one of the high-carbon industries where demand restraint is essential as the only practical means of controlling its spiralling emissions.” The chair of the Commons’ environmental audit committee, Mary Creagh MP, said it would be seeking assurances from the government that any new airport capacity could be reconciled with climate change commitments and legal air pollution limits."
2016-10-24T22:48:11Z,uk-news,UK news,'Addictive' high-stake betting machines under review by sport minister,"Ministers have launched a review of the gambling industry, including fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) that have been accused of being highly addictive. The review was announced by Tracey Crouch, the sport minister, who said it would consider the maximum stakes and prizes for gaming machines. It will look in particular at fixed odds betting terminals because of concerns they can be addictive, and other rules on gaming machines across the industry.
The review will also examine whether the right regulations are in place to protect children and vulnerable people. Crouch said it was important that gambling regulations “strike the right balance between allowing the industry to contribute to the economy and enable people to bet responsibly whilst ensuring consumers and communities are protected”. A record £1.7bn was gambled last year on FOBTs, which allow customers to stake £100 every 20 seconds on electronic versions of casino games such as roulette. Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and Labour deputy leader, said the review was long overdue. “We have been calling on the government to take action on fixed odds betting terminals for many years,” he said. “The government has finally woken up to the fact that it has not done enough to curtail proliferation of FOBTs, which are now a blight on many of our high streets.
“All the available evidence suggests these machines are highly addictive. That is why Labour wants to see the maximum stake reduced from £100 to £2. They can cause real and lasting damage to gamblers and they have become a huge problem for communities that are often struggling to cope with underinvestment and high unemployment.” Simon Blackburn, chairman of the Local Government Association’s safer communities board, said: “Councils have long called for a review into gaming machine stakes so the announcement by the government today is a significant step in the right direction. Councils up and down the country are worried about the number of high-stakes FOBTs and betting shops on our high streets. Someone playing on a machine can lose £100 in a matter of seconds in a single play on an FOBT. This is money many people can’t afford to lose. “Bringing stakes in line with other gaming machines in betting shops and elsewhere on high streets and casinos, would help to protect those at risk from problem gambling, and would be an important step in the right direction,” he added."
2016-10-24T23:01:07Z,uk-news,UK news,MoD to resume training Syrian opposition fighters for assault on Isis,"The UK is to resume training the Syrian moderate opposition, sending a further 20 Ministry of Defence personnel to the Middle East to help them prepare for an eventual attack on Islamic State’s Syrian headquarters. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, is due to announce on Tuesday that the trainers will restart working with moderate Syrian opposition fighters in infantry, medical and explosive hazard awareness skills as part of the campaign against Isis. UK military personnel are currently involved in coalition airstrikes on Isis targets in Iraq and Syria. The move – largely a resumption of discontinued training – will disappoint moderates who have been asking for much more substantial aid, including heavier arms and superior air support. It comes as the Iraqi army, backed by a patchwork of local and international forces including the Kurdish peshmerga and Shia militias, pursue an offensive to oust Isis from Mosul, the group’s last significant stronghold in Iraq. If, as is expected, that ends in defeat for Isis, the battle for the city of Raqqa in north-west Syria could be the next big challenge.
The British government hopes the trainers will not only improve the capabilities of existing fighters but also generate new forces. Fallon said that up to 20 UK personnel would deploy to locations in the region “to provide vetted members of the moderate Syrian opposition with the skills they need to continue to take the fight to Islamic State”. But any British decision to help the rebels, however limited, will prove controversial. Previous attempts by the US and UK to train moderate forces have ended in disappointment and some embarrassment, with the forces collapsing in the face of attacks either by the Syrian government or Isis. In 2015 the attempts ended in military disaster with the troops trained in Turkey either being killed by fighters from the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, now known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, or else surrendering along with their new US-supplied equipment. The US reopened its train-and-equip programme in the summer. There have been reports that Barack Obama is still unwilling to agree to send further help including arms to moderates in Aleppo, partly because he fears they have become increasingly jihadist in their outlook. The reports suggest Obama has in essence aimed to defer any decisions, and leave them to his successor in the White House, so ensuring there is no new short-term counterbalance to the Syrian government advance. The MoD insists moderate fighters exist in north-western Syria, and denies they are all extremists. Fallon has described a moderate in the Syria context as someone “prepared to live within a plural political settlement that can in the end be democratic and take Syria towards elections”. The western coalition insists it has learned lessons from the 2015 debacle and is seeking to add to pre-existing armed factions in Syria, rather than form an entirely new western-backed grouping. Critics will question how the MoD can vet the moderates and ensure any skills learned through British training are not transferred away from the fight to defeat Isis. The struggle for Raqqa is diplomatically fraught since Moscow and the Syrian government regard it as their task to win back control of north-western Syria. Using a different term for Isis, Fallon insisted: “Daesh are on the back foot. Now we’re stepping up our support to moderate opposition forces in Syria, through training them in the skills they need to defeat Daesh. “As Iraqi and Kurdish forces close in on Mosul, the UK supported training will help cement recent progress in north-west Syria, underlining the pressure Daesh is now under on all fronts. “All volunteers from the moderate opposition will be subject to strict vetting procedures and will receive training in international humanitarian law. Trainees will be security and medically screened prior to the start of training and will be assessed during and monitored after training.”"
2016-10-25T05:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow expansion: opponents ready to fight back ahead of decision,"Environmental activists, communities and local authorities are preparing for a campaign of opposition to a third runway at Heathrow, ahead of a decision on the expansion of the world’s third biggest airport. Residents of villages threatened by the expansion have already been taking part in training for direct action, activists said, while four local councils have amassed a £200,000 war chest to fight expansion through the courts.
A decision is expected on Tuesday, with Heathrow’s third runway deal expected to beat proposals for a second runway at Gatwick. But both plans have opponents, and there are those who are against any airport expansion at all. Sheila Menon, of the activist group Reclaim the Power, which recently staged a “die-in” protest at Heathrow’s terminal 2, said Department for Transport data showed that just 15% of the population take 70% of flights. “This is about a wealthy minority who are driving the need for expansion,” she said. “The people who are paying for that are on a local level, people living around airports who are having to deal with the local noise and air pollution; on a national level, the taxpayer is subsidising the aviation industry to the tune of £10bn a year through tax subsidies; and then globally, the countries who are feeling impact of climate change first and hardest are the countries of the global south who have least contributed.”
But none will feel the impact of Heathrow expansion immediately more than the residents of villages set to be partly or wholly razed to make way for a third runway. About 800 homes will be demolished, and thousands more will be made uninhabitable, campaigners say. One of the villages under threat, Harmondsworth, has been home to Neil Keveren’s family for generations. His home will be 54 paces from the new boundary fence. “I’ll be looking at it out of my kitchen window, and all the houses opposite me, and the ones close beside – and beside that and beside that – will be destroyed,” the 55-year-old said.
“I’m part of the fabric here, this house isn’t for sale,” he said. “If the politicians can’t do it, and do as they say when they’ve been elected, if democracy fails, then we’ll just have to be left with direct action. What else is there? “I don’t think that Theresa May and the electorate of this country have the stomach for seeing our elderly citizens being forcibly removed from their homes, and I know a good half a dozen who are not going to shift.” In the next-door village of Sipson, a group of about a dozen activists have been encamped on an abandoned market garden site since 2010. Alex, 29, a spokesman for the Grow Heathrow camp who declined to give his surname, said the activists were united with locals in opposition to Heathrow’s expansion. “Local people have said they’re not going to leave their houses, and we’ll show them how to make that as difficult as possible for developers to do that. We’re happy to spread peaceful resistance among the local people,” he said.
“We’ve already given local people training on how to lock [themselves to objects] and these kind of things, and we’ll keep doing that. I think the more likely it looks like [the expansion] is going to happen, the more likely they will want to learn that stuff. When the threat is much greater they want to learn how to fight it.”
Plane Stupid has carried out actions against Heathrow’s expansion, including invading the airport’s northern runway in the summer of 2015 and, in February this year, blockading the entrance tunnel to terminals 1, 2, and 3. A spokesman for the group, who gave his name only as Cameron, predicted more activism. “The climate catastrophe that we are heading towards if we continue to expand climate-intensive industries is something that sits very highly in people’s minds,” he said. “People are willing to take extreme action to stop carbon emissions because the government won’t. “Just with the same conviction people like Neil [Keveren] have to saving their homes, environmental activists have to saving the environment, and the planet. There’s no point of having short-haul flights to the south of France if you don’t have a home in Norwich because it’s flooded out.”"
2016-10-25T08:27:02Z,uk-news,UK news,York Minster bellringers: archbishop called on to explain mass dismissal,"The archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has been challenged to explain the dismissal of 30 volunteer bellringers from York Minster, amid claims the controversial move followed a long-running feud with the lead campanologist. The lawyer for David Potter, who has been banned for life from ringing the famous bells, claimed the move by church officials amounted to a “breach of natural justice” and called on Sentamu to explain his claim that there was an ongoing inquiry into “safeguarding” issues at the cathedral.
Colin Byrne, of the law firm Howard & Byrne, said Sentamu’s assertion contradicted a letter he received in September from a minster canon saying: “The matter is closed.” The row comes after Potter and his 30-strong bellringing team were dismissed at short notice over safeguarding concerns, causing an outcry in York where the bells will be silent until the new year. The mass dismissal has brought to the surface a 17-year-old saga that centres on Potter, a leading figure in the bellringing team who was the subject of two police investigations following allegations made in 1999 and 2015. On neither occasion were charges brought. In January 2000, days after Potter had been awarded an MBE for bellringing services over three decades, he was suspended as ringing master at York Minster and from his job as a teacher after claims of indecent assault. The following month, the police said he would not be charged.
But in June last year, North Yorkshire police applied for a sexual risk order following concerns raised over his contact with children. An interim order was granted but quashed by York crown court a month later. Magistrates dismissed the application last December. York Minster banned Potter permanently from its bell tower in July, prompting protests from fellow bellringers. Byrne said Potter was not given the opportunity to make legal representations before he was dismissed. “The bellringers were not very happy and voiced their concerns and because of this they were all sacked, which itself is a further breach of natural justice,” he told the York Press. “I was shocked by the lack of due process and natural justice – the right to a fair hearing.” A Bishopthorpe Palace spokesman said Sentamu was away and there was no way to immediately clarify whether there was an ongoing inquiry."
2016-10-25T10:50:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow approval puts business above political and environment issues,"The business case The independent commission charged with deciding whether a new runway should be built in the UK started a report last year by declaring that air links were vital for the economy, trade and investment. It went on to select Heathrow as the best site. After 15 months of deliberation, on Tuesday, the government backed this verdict. Britain’s biggest airport has long since reached capacity, turning away airlines that would like to operate there. An enormous amount of high-value exports go through Heathrow, which carries more cargo than all other UK airports put together. Businesses have clustered around the airport and the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, estimated that a third runway would provide up to 77,000 more local jobs.
It would also stimulate economic growth throughout Britain, the commission said. More long-haul routes to emerging markets had been a mantra even before the UK voted for Brexit and a potential separation from its European trading partners. Heathrow has argued that only a hub airport with sufficient connections to other cities makes these routes viable. Almost three-quarters of long-haul flights out of Britain depart from Heathrow. An enlarged Heathrow could provide more connecting flights to the rest of the UK – allowing, for example, Scottish salmon fisheries to swiftly fly their produce around the world. How true this turns out to be remains to be seen. Regional flights have a poor record at the west London hub, and airlines that pay a premium for Heathrow slots have preferred more lucrative routes than trying to grow new markets. Witness British Airways’ recent decision to ditch Chengdu in favour of New Orleans. But the overwhelming view of business groups, looking at a share of the £211bn in extra economic growth and 180,000 jobs promised by the commission, is that a third runway is long overdue. Gwyn Topham The environmental cost Speaking in 2008, Theresa May said: “The third runway at Heathrow would undermine our national [climate change] targets.” The prime minister, having backed a third runway, might have changed her mind, but the move remains a giant leap of faith – without a parachute. The truth is that sharp cuts in global emissions are urgently required and one-quarter of Britain’s carbon budget will need to be splurged on aviation by 2050, according to the Committee on Climate Change. Even keeping aviation emissions to this level requires increasingly efficient planes, biofuels and carbon taxes running into the hundreds of pounds per ticket. The committee has asked the government to come up with a strategy to show how these actions can be implemented.
The response has been to pass the buck. “The government believes that action at the global level is the most effective means of tackling aviation emissions,” the government said in October 2015. But global leaders are also passing the buck. The international aviation deal reached this month does not cut aircraft emissions. Instead, it offsets aviation emissions growth by paying other sectors to curb their emissions and is voluntary until 2027. If the climate friendliness of the third runway depends on huge, politically unimaginable tax rises on flights by the UK government and an end to international buck passing, what is to be done? Identifying the real reason for increased flights is key: it is not business, whatever proponents of runway expansion tell you. The proportion of flights taken for work is small and has been flat or falling for a decade, according to government data. Damian Carrington
The political fallout The wise politician avoids saying never. David Cameron’s “No ifs, no buts, no third runway” quote was catchy and memorable. Three years later, he set up the Airports Commission. It was merely a way of backfilling evidence behind a decision already taken, some observers believed. Cameron has gone. May, whose anti-third runway Maidenhead constituents will liven up her surgeries over the coming years, will grow tired of being reminded that she condemned Labour’s decision to authorise the third runway in 2009 on environmental grounds. Approving the third runway now, like Hinkley, is part of May’s determination to invest in infrastructure. But she faces a torrid time from her party. The prime minister has set up some canny and innovative political arrangements to head off cabinet resignations. The decision on Heathrow was taken in a cabinet sub-committee, but the convention of collective responsibility ties all her senior ministers to the move.
In a highly unusual manoeuvre, they are licensed to dissent, but not campaign against the decision. That may be a tough line to police, given the verbal dexterity of her chief opponent, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The education secretary, Justine Greening, already unhappy over the grammar school decision, is another leading opponent and previously threatened to resign over the issue. Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park, could announce that he is standing down in protest. This would trigger a byelection in which he will almost certainly stand as an independent. Away from Westminster, Conservative councillors are manning the barricades. West and south-west London boroughs including Hillingdon, Richmond and Wandsworth are strongly opposed. So are Labour-controlled neighbours such as Hounslow. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, could fund a legal challenge. Theresa May will also have to face down criticism from as many as 60 hostile Tory backbenchers. But even if there is a majority against Heathrow expansion at Westminster, it is unlikely to delay the project. The only vote in the Commons, it seems, would be on the national policy statement for aviation, expected sometime in the next 18 months. However, protests against the decision are likely to be the most committed and politically challenging since the poll tax in 1990. Anne Perkins"
2016-10-25T11:05:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Wife of Scottish ex-soldier wins battle to stay in UK,"The Indian-born wife of a Scottish former lance corporal who was facing deportation from the Highlands has been granted leave to remain in the UK. Gloria Macleod, whose husband Robert grew up in Dingwall and now works in Dubai, was denied entry to the UK at Inverness airport in September, despite holding a valid visa. The couple have two daughters, who are British citizens. Her passport was confiscated and she was threatened with deportation within days, facing the prospect of leaving Siobhan, 11, and 10-year-old Meaghan in the care of their elderly grandparents. Macleod’s local MP, Ian Blackford, described the visa dispute as “madness”. Only a month ago, Blackford had celebrated with another family of constituents, the Brains, who were granted leave to remain after fighting since April against deportation to Australia. Gloria’s husband, Robert, whom she married in 2003, is a former Royal Regiment of Scotland lance corporal. The family, who had been living in Dubai, where Robert works as a security manager, returned to Dingwall in July, where Siobhan and Meaghan enrolled in the same primary school attended by seven-year-old Lachlan Brain. Although Gloria, an Indian passport holder, possessed a UK C-Visit passport, which is valid for 10 years, the couple decided that she should apply for permanent residence to allow her to remain in Scotland while the girls attended school and Robert continued working in Dubai. After advice from the visa office in Dubai, acting on behalf of the UK immigration service, that her application had to be made in person, Gloria briefly left the UK to complete her application process. But when she returned she was denied entry. After Blackford’s intervention, Macleod was given a stay of removal until the UK immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, formally responded to the SNP MP’s inquiry about the case, and the Home Office have now granted her a 30-month visa. Macleod described herself as “delighted”, adding: “We couldn’t be more pleased with the quick turnaround from the Home Office in issuing my visa and appreciate the help from everyone involved.” Blackford said: “This has been a huge trauma for the family. Gloria already had a visa that gave her the right to be in Dingwall when immigration officials sought to remove her right to reenter the country. The good news is that the Home Office has now given longer leave to remain and the family can get back to normal life. I am so pleased for all of them.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “All applications for leave to remain are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules.”"
2016-10-25T11:53:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Q&A: Heathrow expansion â€“ what happens next,"What are the details of the announcement on Britain’s next runway? Six years after it overturned plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, the government has announced a renewed expansion of London’s main airport. A cabinet subcommittee of ministers, excluding some notable opponents of Heathrow, met on Tuesday morning and decided to endorse the verdict of the Airports Commission by approving a third runway, rather than choose another shortlisted scheme at Gatwick. The decision will be formally announced by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in the House Commons.
What will happen next? It is likely to be another four to five years before spades are in the ground. The government will launch a public consultation on the local impacts of its decision in the new year, before publishing a national policy statement on aviation. This needs to be ratified by parliamentary vote, either in late 2017 or 2018. This is a quicker process than the parliamentary machinery employed for the HS2 rail line, whose hybrid bill for the first phase is yet to be passed. So has the government definitely approved a new runway? This was the key moment, although opponents will now argue that the real decision comes next year with the vote on the national policy statement. Theresa May appears to have dropped any plans for an early parliamentary vote to bolster the government’s hand. Instead, last week she told ministers that they could, for a period of time, continue to air their own reservations against expanding airports – an unusual arrangement allowing known opponents of Heathrow expansion, such as the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to stay in the cabinet. Despite the high-profile opposition, Heathrow believes a substantial majority of MPs are in favour of its plan.
What happens next for the planning process? Heathrow needs to draw up a development consent order, which would include health and environmental impact assessments. A separate review of flight paths and airspace will also take place. The process should see the airport submit applications for planning permission in 2019, with inspectors then recommending it to the secretary of state for communities for final approval in 2020.
Any other bumps in the road? Heathrow says the timescale takes into account inevitable applications for judicial review. Four local authorities, joined by Greenpeace, have confirmed they will mount a legal challenge. Residents’ action groups and environmental lawyers Client Earth are also set to challenge the process. Defeated Gatwick has said it will stand by in the expectation that any decision for Heathrow will be eventually reversed. So what is the earliest a runway could be built? It could be done by 2025, reckons Heathrow. Ministers had previously been more cautious in their timetable, eyeing 2029, but are understood to be keen to speed up development post-Brexit, with Heathrow pledging to find ways to add 25,000 extra flights a year before new infrastructure is completed if planners lift the legal cap. What benefits will a third runway bring? According to the Airports Commission, the economic boost could be worth up to £151bn; the government has quoted a more modest £61bn. Both think up to 77,000 additional local jobs will be created over the next 14 years. The number of planes taking off will go up by about 50%, to 740,000 annually. Some believe fares will rise but the government made it clear on Tuesday that the new runway must not make air travel more expensive for passengers. EasyJet has said it will look to operate at Heathrow, bringing low-fare competition to British Airways. What about the noise and pollution? Good question. Heathrow’s claims that noise from the airport will affect fewer people rely on technical definitions of disturbance as well as the promise of quieter planes. But locals are not convinced that planes such as the A380 really disturb them much less – and cumulatively, hundreds of thousands of new planes can only add to the noise. New communities will be under the flight path – up to 200,000 more people will be overflown. Air quality around Heathrow, which has broken legal limits, may be mitigated by plans for congestion charging and better public transport, but it will be difficult to improve with tens of millions more passengers a year travelling via the airport."

Police Scotland confirmed that the 30-year-old, who was dragged under the wheels of a car that deliberately reversed into her, and her 31-year-old colleague, were both recovering in hospital. The officers had stopped the car to speak to its occupants in Drumchapel, Glasgow, at about 11.15pm on Sunday. The vehicle then deliberately reversed and struck both officers. Emergency services were called to the scene and the officers were taken to hospital. A vehicle matching the description of a blue Nissan Qashqai seen around the time of the incident was found burnt out in nearby Scotstoun. Police Scotland said on Tuesday that forensic officers were carrying out a detailed examination of the car and have confirmed that it was stolen. Detectives are also examining CCTV footage. The force thanked members of the public for their messages of support, some of which have come from as far afield as the United States. On Monday, Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, questioned why Police Scotland did not inform the federation of the incident until almost 12 hours after it happened. He said he planned to question why a media appeal was not released more quickly. In a statement this afternoon, Police Scotland said the wellbeing and welfare of officers was paramount and wished both injured officers a speedy recovery."
2016-10-25T17:18:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow airport: an ever-expanding story,"Heathrow started life in 1930 after British aero-engineer and plane builder Richard Fairey paid the vicar of Harmondsworth £15,000 for a 60-hectare (150-acre) plot to build a private airport for assembling and testing aircraft. The site had only a single grass runway and a couple of rudimentary buildings. During the second world war, the government requisitioned land around the village of Heathrow, including Fairey’s Great West Aerodrome, to build RAF Heston, a base for long-range, troop-carrying aircraft bound for east Asia. Heathrow was demolished and land cleared for runways. After the war ended the aerodrome was handed over to the Air Ministry as London’s new civil airport on 1 January 1946. The first aircraft to take off from Heathrow was a converted Lancaster bomber called Starlight, which flew to Buenos Aires.
By the end of Heathrow’s first operational year, 63,000 passengers had travelled through it. By 1951, this number had risen to 796,000 and British architect Frederick Gibberd was appointed to design new buildings, including a control tower, 122ft (37 metres) high. Terminal 1 opened in 1969, by which time 5 million passengers per year were passing through the airport and the jet age arrived with Boeing 707s, VC10s and Tridents. In the 1970s, Concorde and wide-body jets such as the Boeing 747 were flying from Heathrow, and by the end of the decade 27 million passengers were using the airport each year. Terminal 4 opened for business in 1986. Terminal 5 opened in March 2008 while a new Terminal 2 opened on 4 June 2014. Today, more than 67 million passengers travel through Heathrow annually, with 90 airlines flying to more than 180 destinations in over 90 countries. By the time Heathrow celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006, it had served about 1.4 billion passengers on more than 14m flights. Source: Official Heathrow website"
2016-10-25T18:00:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Man jailed for stalking mother of murdered toddler James Bulger,"A man has been jailed for stalking the mother of the murdered toddler James Bulger. Howard Wilson, 56, was jailed for 26 weeks by district judge Mark Hadfield, who also made him the subject of an indefinite restraining order that bars him from ever approaching Denise Fergus, her husband or her three sons. Wilson, who appeared in the dock at Sefton magistrates court wearing a mauve tracksuit and trainers, smiled as the sentence was passed. He told the judge: “Thanks for giving me what I want.” It was the second time in a decade that Wilson had stalked Fergus. Eight years ago he was given a police warning after bombarding his victim with a series of unwanted gifts. Fergus, 49, was spared the ordeal of giving evidence at the court – the same one where her son’s killers made their first appearance – and instead appeared via videolink from Liverpool crown court. Her son’s killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, were convicted of James’s abduction and murder in February 1993. Both are now free and living under the protection of new names. Wilson was convicted of stalking Fergus and also of damaging a cell at Copy Lane police station, Liverpool. After sentencing, Fergus said she was still fearful after Wilson had been jailed. She said: “It feels like mental torture, even though he hasn’t actually harmed me in any way. “I’m convinced he’s a ticking timebomb, but none of us knows when he’s going to go off. “It’s terrifying, because the last time I used those words it was over Thompson and Venables.” Earlier, in court, Wilson had been refused permission to explain the reason for his repeated harassment of Fergus. Alison Clarkson, prosecuting, had told Wilson: “You can’t accept that your obsession with Denise Fergus caused her distress, can you?” He insisted he meant her no harm. Fergus told the court how one of her gates had been thrown open late on August bank holiday Monday 2016. Her husband re-ran the CCTV images from cameras that protect their home in Kirkby, Merseyside, and spotted earlier footage of the stalker loitering in nearby woodland and then riding his bike towards the house. After opening the gate, he sped off to the Quarry Green social club where he asked numerous “weird” questions about Fergus. Two women there were so disturbed by Wilson’s behaviour that they called round to his victim’s home to alert her. He was walking out of the club when she arrived a short time later. “I realised I’d seen him before,” she said. “It was the fella that stalked me eight years ago. “I said to him: ‘Why can’t you leave me alone? What do you want from me? Why are you harassing me?’ “He had his head down and carried on walking. I felt really anxious and I knew I was in for a long night of no sleep.” Later, in a victim impact statement, she said: “The fact that I do not know his intentions worries me. Why would someone attend my home address in the dark to sit and watch from the other side of the road? “I felt the same way on this occasion as I did back in 2008 when Howard kept leaving things outside my address and knocking on my door wanting to speak to me. “I am still on edge now. If I see a car or a person walking past that I do not know … my mind starts racing as to what could be going on. “What worries me the most is that I believe Howard to be unpredictable. What could he do next? I am constantly thinking about the ifs and buts, as I do not know what he is capable of or what he may decide to do next to me or my family.” She added: “I understand that he has to be released at some point. I am concerned he will come back and start terrorising me. Or if he can’t get at me, will he start terrorising my lads? “I really feel he should be tagged so his movements can be monitored, and the safety of my family can be ensured. “I just wish he would leave me alone so I can get on with my life. I have had enough to worry about and just want to enjoy my family life.” She first became aware of her stalker in 2008 when he called at her home and bombarded her with messages and a Christmas card adorned with love hearts. Later, after being given a police warning about his behaviour, Wilson sent her a series of letters posted from different parts of the country. The campaign ended with a card sent from Portsmouth in which he wrote: “Ha ha ha, you can’t catch me.” Fergus, who now runs a charity in her son’s name, thought she had heard the last of Wilson until he appeared at her home late at night on the August bank holiday Monday. The James Bulger Memorial Trust supports young people who are disadvantaged by being victims of crime, hatred or bullying."
2016-10-25T19:15:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Isle of Muck primary school finds new teacher after social media appeal,"A primary school with eight pupils on a remote Scottish island has found a new teacher after a social media appeal attracted interest from across the globe. Laura Marriner is moving more than 700 miles to take the job on Muck in the Inner Hebrides, which was one of the last places in the UK to get a 24-hour electricity supply. Marriner, who currently works for Hampshire county council, is expected to begin before Christmas and will boost the two-mile-long island’s permanent population of about 40 by bringing her husband, Dean, and children Charlie, five, and Atticus, 20 months, with her. The teacher said she was aware that life on an island that had no shop and was regularly cut off from the mainland during the winter would be tough. “There will be a low point and it will be when both boys are being difficult, when the weather is horrible and the boats are cancelled and we’re stuck on the island. “We’ll just have to work through that and it will be fine. It’s about accepting that life can be difficult wherever you are. It’ll just be challenging in a different way.” Marriner said the family would be bringing a chest freezer and a bread maker, as well as several boxes of tea. “As long as I’ve got tea, everything will be OK,” she said. The search for a teacher began in May when the previous incumbent, Julie Baker, had to leave for family reasons. The post was advertised by Highland council, but all six candidates eventually dropped out when faced with the reality of remote island life.
In desperation, the island community put out an appeal on Facebook. It read: “Still Wanted! A fantastic teacher who can work across the primary age group, who has lots of enthusiasm, patience, understanding, drive, a love of the outdoors with good waterproofs, the ability to wear several different hats (teacher/partner/active community member), able to survive on a very small Scottish island which has no shop and can be cut off at times but has a lovely community with fun social events and a wonderful mix of about 40 people, it can be bleak occasionally in the winter, but also amazingly beautiful in the summer.” They were inundated with expressions of interest from around the world, and almost 60 candidates applied. Nine were shortlisted and invited to travel to the island to get a better sense of what life there was like.
Muck is the smallest of the Small Isles. The others are Eigg, Rum and Canna. Marriner’s predecessor said Muck was “a wonderful place to teach and live”. Baker said: “It is a very special teaching job. There is a three-bedroom flat for the teacher and their family above the school, which makes it the shortest commute ever! The flat has stunning views across the sea to Ardnamurchan Point.” She added: “The parents and community are very supportive and the school is surprisingly well-resourced. The seven children in the class [and one in nursery] are enthusiastic learners. “There are many outdoor learning opportunities with the outdoor classroom, forest school, polytunnel, wild garden with school ducks and the island environment itself.” Reflecting on her appointment, Marriner said: “I’ve never done anything this brave before.”"
2016-10-25T21:02:04Z,uk-news,UK news,David Cameron signs deal to write tell-all autobiography,"David Cameron has signed a deal to write his autobiography, saying he will give a “frank” account of his time in Downing Street. The former prime minister will spend the next year writing the book, which will give an insight into family life at No 10 as well as the inside track on his government. Cameron said he would explain the decisions he made and admit “what worked and what didn’t”. The book, which does not yet have a title, will cover his decision to call a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union and subsequent defeat, which led him to quit as prime minister and later as an MP.
It will also cover the Scottish independence vote and his reforms to the economy, welfare and education. Cameron’s controversial handling of foreign affairs, including the bombing of Libya and the crucial vote he lost on Syria, will also be examined. William Collins, an imprint of HarperCollins, secured the autobiography and expects to publish it in 2018. Cameron said: “It was an immense privilege to lead the Conservative party for more than a decade and the country for over six years as prime minister. “I am looking forward to having the opportunity to explain the decisions I took and why I took them. I will be frank about what worked and what didn’t.” Cameron has given little indication of his plans for life after Downing Street other than chairing a panel of patrons on the expanded National Citizen Service, a summer camp initiative he set up that is designed to instill social responsibility in young people as part of his “big society”. However, it emerged earlier this month that he would give a speech for the private equity firm Bain Capital in one of his first public engagements since his departure from No 10. The former prime minister was booked to address a private event for the US company, which was co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and bought a blood plasma company from the NHS in 2012. Cameron stepped down as an MP after taking a summer holiday, meaning any earnings from the book or his speech will not have to be publicly disclosed."
2016-10-26T08:14:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Build Heathrow third runway on ramp over M25, minister says","Building the third Heathrow runway over the M25 would be a more sensible, cheaper and quicker way of completing the project than digging a tunnel for the motorway, the transport secretary has said. Chris Grayling endorsed the idea after announcing the government’s backing for a third runway, six years after David Cameron withdrew support for the scheme. The decision prompted a Conservative rift with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, saying it was undeliverable and Zac Goldsmith, a former London mayoral candidate, resigning as a Tory MP to stand as in independent, triggering a byelection. Grayling said it had been necessary to take a “tough decision in the interest of the nation”, while declining an opportunity to apologise to voters who believed the Conservative party promise not to build the runway.
The proposal to build the runway on an eight-metre ramp over the M25 in south-west London has been under consideration for several months, since a review by Lord Deighton into ways shaving £2bn-£3bn off the overall bill. It now appears to be favoured by the government, although sources at the Department for Transport stressed that all options, including the original tunnel idea, were under consideration.
Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “One of the things Heathrow have been looking at is doing what many other airports have done around the world, which is to build the runway over the top of the road rather than underneath it.” He said the government was working to make sure the third runway was affordable and a ramp was a cheaper and quicker way of doing it than tunnelling. “I am very concerned to make sure it doesn’t cause massive disruption on the M25,” he said. The proposals will be scrutinised in a public consultation before a decision is taken and documents released on Tuesday by the DfT contained correspondence from Highways England, the body in charge of Britain’s major roads, showing that it considered the M25 scheme a major risk.
Highways England said there was a “significant risk of cost overruns” in the tunnel scheme, which it estimated would cost between £476m and £1.1bn. The roads authority described the plan as “high risk”, and said there was “a substantial risk of excessive customer frustration about what might be [a] prolonged period of disruption”. The analyst firm Inrix say that traffic and delays around the motorway junction are likely to increase by 10% after the runway is built, and by 30% during construction. Grayling has begun a tour of the regions to promote the benefits of Heathrow’s third runway, starting on Wednesday in Newcastle upon Tyne where he was to visit an engineering company to stress that it was a project in the national interest, not just for the south-east. On Tuesday, the government hailed its plan to proceed with airport expansion as a sign of strength and decisiveness after years of delays. Theresa May told the cabinet it was a vital decision that had been ducked for too long. But she immediately faced a range of Conservative resistance after she decided to partially suspend cabinet responsibility to allow Johnson and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to express opposition to the plan once it was made public. Following the announcement on Tuesday, Goldsmith resigned as a Conservative MP, describing the government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow as the “most polluting, most disruptive, most expensive option”.
The Conservatives said they would not run against Goldsmith. But he will have to defend his seat against the Liberal Democrats, who will be eager for the chance to regain a foothold in south-west London, and who wish to make the byelection a vote on Brexit. The party has long opposed any runway expansion. On Wednesday, May faced hostile questioning from one of her own backbenchers at prime minister’s questions, although Labour did not address the issue. Tanya Mathias, the MP for Twickenham, cited worsening air pollution and noise and asked: “Does she agree that environmentally Heathrow is not good enough, and cannot possibly be bigger and better?” May said the government “looked very carefully at the air quality issues”, adding: “The evidence shows that air quality requirements can be met.” The new runway is not due to be built for about a decade but there will be significant local resistance before then as hundreds of houses will have to be demolished and nearby areas fear they will be blighted.
The runway, which could be finished by 2025, would lead to almost 50% more planes over London, bringing new neighbourhoods under the flightpath. Protests and legal challenges against its construction are expected to focus on air quality, noise and Britain’s climate change commitments. Ministers sought to mitigate some of these criticisms by proposing a six and a half-hour break in scheduled night flights and more stringent night noise restrictions. The scheme will take the form of a draft national policy statement, open to consultation in the new year and subject to a vote in winter 2017-18."

Helen King joined Cheshire constabulary in 1986 after graduating in philosophy, politics and economics from St Anne’s College. She joined the Met in 2014 as assistant commissioner for territorial policing, and was responsible for London’s 32 boroughs. In April, she moved to the position of assistant commissioner for professionalism, overseeing training and professional standards. King, who will take over at St Anne’s in April, tweeted:
St Anne’s was founded as a women’s college in the 19th century but has admitted men since 1979. Its alumni include the former junior health minister Edwina Currie, scientist Mary Archer, Bridget Jones author and scriptwriter Helen Fielding, musician Sir Simon Rattle, and the art historian Sister Wendy Beckett. The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, paid tribute to King, saying he was very proud of her. “This is an incredible achievement, and we enjoy a little reflected glory in the Met.” He said she had played a key part in recent moves to reduce crime and make savings: “More recently, as assistant commissioner for professionalism, she has begun preparing the Met for what will be challenging public inquiries. Her work here will put the organisation in good stead in the years to come. She has been a great asset to policing and I know she will be just as valued by her new colleagues,” Hogan-Howe said.
King said she was “immensely honoured and a little overwhelmed” at the news of her new job, “an infrequent opportunity at a college that means a huge amount to me”. She added: “As I move into the higher education sector, I am excited about the opportunity to be passionate and determined in ensuring that talented and committed young people who don’t get a privileged start in life have a demonstrably fair chance to obtain some of the best university education in the world.” She succeeds Tim Gardam, a former director of programmes at Channel 4, who will take over as chief executive of the Nuffield Foundation. The college’s acting principal, Robert Chard, said King “combines genuine human warmth with impressive competence and a commitment to inclusiveness, diversity and opportunity”. St Anne’s was founded in 1879 as the Society of Home Students, offering women the chance of obtaining an Oxford degree without the expense of living in a college. It became a full college of the university in 1952."

She was treated, after the incident on Saturday, first by paramedics then taken to Leeds general infirmary by air ambulance. Police said the girl was in a serious condition after surgery, although she was taken off life support on Tuesday. West Yorkshire police were called to a property in Illingworth, Halifax, at about 12.44pm Saturday, after a report that a child had been injured with a bow and arrow at her family home. DI Gary Stephenson, of Calderdale district CID, said inquiries were trying to determine precisely how the girl came to be injured. “Our investigations suggest she was not intentionally injured and an 18-year-old male is assisting us with our inquiries,” he said. “Specially trained officers are working to support her family as our investigations continue.” A friend of the family, who asked not to be named, described the incident as a “tragic accident” and added: “She’s doing brilliant at the moment and was taken of her life support machine.”"
2016-10-26T16:18:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"A Mancunian’s guide to Manchester, for José Mourinho","As a Manchester City fan (not to mention a human being), you can imagine my reaction to José Mourinho declaring life in Manchester “a disaster”. The United manager feels trapped living in a swanky suite at the Lowry hotel; his only comfort a reported £10m-a-year salary. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde on the death of Little Nell, one would have a heart of stone not to read this tragic tale without dissolving into tears … of laughter. However, I am a Mancunian who cannot let this slight on my city lie. So, how could Mourinho get more out of Manchester?
His first error was allowing United to billet him in the Lowry. “I just want to cross the bridge and go to a restaurant,” wails Mourinho, fearful, apparently, of running the papparazzi gauntlet. Were he living at the Palace hotel, he could simply pop downstairs to the city’s newest, much-praised hangout/restaurant/DJ bar, the Refuge (try the blitzed beetroot with smoked feta, dill and hazelnuts, José). Relocate to the Midland Hotel and he could dine daily in the stiff, undeniably glamorous, doggedly Michelin-chasing restaurant, the French. Indeed, if Mourinho is desperate, why has no-one mentioned San Carlo to him? Just across that bridge from the Lowry, this underwhelming Italian has been offering footballers sanctuary for years. He would eat better at several hidden gems (VNam, Siam Smiles, Yuzu, etc), but when Cristiano Ronaldo was at United, he virtually lived there.
This implies Mourinho cannot, as he protested, “walk a little bit” in Manchester, unmolested. As ex-City striker Edin Dzeko (who I once spotted in Costa in the Arndale) could tell him, that is rubbish. Mancunians coolly pride themselves on not giving a toss about famous people – particularly if they frequent the right places.
From the Lowry, Mourinho could walk down Chapel Street to the experimental art-music space, Islington Mill. It’s dark. It’s noisy. He would barely register. Similarly close, the tiny PS Mirabel and Paper galleries (while they do not have Home or the Whitworth gallery’s scope) are places where a man can contemplate art, life and dropping Wayne Rooney in peace. Likewise, he could hide in Manchester’s boho Northern Quarter. As a fan of Sting and Genesis, he should first sort out his appalling music taste at Piccadilly Records, before visiting menswear store Oi Polloi to buy some proper clobber, finishing with a pint in Common or the Smithfield (up north, José, your love of wine and Armani is conspicuous). Neither pub allows large, rowdy groups in, so no paparazzi. As a final resort, Mourinho could buy a house. Manchester prices are far lower than London’s, but rising fast. It is a great investment – even if, should United continue to nosedive, he won’t be around for long."
2016-10-26T17:18:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Dead curious: the artist inviting questions in a Bristol cemetery,"As dusk falls on the Victorian angels and leaning tombstones, voices will ring out across Arnos Vale cemetery in Bristol, questioning the dead. The questions range from heartbreaking to barely printable: “Why didn’t you let me say goodbye?” one woman will ask, while a man wants to know “Any chance of one last blowjob?” Marcus Coates, an artist whose work often explores shamanism and ritual, has for months been inviting people to leave their questions at the cemetery. On Friday night they will return and ask them aloud, or hear them chanted like an incantation echoing from speakers set among the memorials to waken the sleepers.
All the places for the public have now been allocated, but Questioning the Dead is one of events happening across the country in the annual Museums at Night festival, when hundreds of museums and galleries open their doors after hours. Some of the questions are painfully serious: “Why don’t I believe like you did?” or “Do you want to rest in peace? Or have the truth be spoken to those who hurt you?” But Coates expects laughs over questions such as: “I now know it was you that smashed the tail-light with the camping hammer ... How did you manage to take that to the grave with you?” One woman has asked the question that formed in Coates’s own mind when he stood by the war memorial in the cemetery: “Was it worth it?” Another asked: “Miss you so much Mum. Did you know what was happening when you couldn’t speak to us and hope you understood the choices we made for you.” And another similarly troubled: “Thinking of my great grandmother who is buried there somewhere ... could anyone have helped you?”
That last query echoes the question Coates has been asking himself since his grandfather died 10 years ago: “I’ve carried this feeling around with me ever since, that I somehow let him down. I don’t know if I will actually ask him out loud, in the presence of other people, if he thinks I did – but it will be there in my mind.” Arnos Vale was opened in 1839 as a garden cemetery, an alternative to the old parish graveyards which were so overcrowded that in some, bones were literally poking out of the soil. By the time it closed 150 years later, the 18 hectares (45 acres) held the remains of more than 300,000 people. It was brought back from dereliction by local people, alarmed by the threat that some of the land might be cleared and developed, and is now run by a charitable trust. Coates, who lives near Highgate in London, likes cemeteries and observing how people behave in them.
“Why do people talk to the dead, as if to continue the conversation? And if in some sense we believe the dead can hear, why not go the whole way and ask those questions out loud, and together?” He is expecting replies, but not from the dead. “There’s something very interesting about asking questions,” he saids. “In the right circumstances they can free the imagination, and supply their own answers.”"
2016-10-26T17:25:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"Six people are subject to Tpims, Home Office reveals","Six extremists or terror suspects are now subject to official counter-terror orders that include being relocated from their home towns or cities, the Home Office has revealed. The confirmation that there are six orders covering terror prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) in force marks a revival in their use after three years in which no more than one or two individuals have been subject to the orders. The Tpim regime, which replaced counter-terror control orders, can include a range of measures including enforced curfews of up to 10 hours, tagging, requiring a person to live up to 200 miles from their current address and restrictions on overseas travel. They last for up to two years and are the toughest tool the security services can use against people they believe to be involved in terrorism but who cannot be prosecuted or deported. The Home Office said five of the six current Tpim suspects are British. The orders were thought to have largely fallen into disuse since December 2013 when eight Tpims were in force. Their revival coincides with the return to Britain of jihadi fighters from Syria. A Home Office review of the use of Tpims , published on Wednesday, said: “In the five years since the act received royal assent, Tpim notices have been and remain a crucial component of the government’s national security response. “The threat the UK continues to face from terrorism is serious, complex and sustained. While prosecution and conviction of those individuals suspected of terrorism-related activity remains the government’s priority, the act continues to provide appropriate, proportionate and effective powers for dealing with the risk posed by a small number of people in this country who are assessed to pose a terrorism-related threat to the public.” The assessment was part of a post-legislative scrutiny of the regime demanded by parliament when Tpims replaced control orders in 2011."
2016-10-26T18:36:42Z,uk-news,UK news,City of London's tallest building to be built despite Brexit vote,"A 62-storey skyscraper – on the site of a previously planned building known as the Pinnacle or “Helter Skelter” – is to grace London’s skyline despite the uncertainty caused in the commercial property market by the vote for Brexit. Now known as 22 Bishopsgate – its address near Liverpool Street station – the building will be the tallest in London’s financial district and is being developed by AXA Investment Managers Real Assets. The building will be 278 metres tall, 10 metres lower than the original design that was first outlined almost 10 years ago. In the days before the 23 June referendum, Bloomberg quoted AXA IM’s chief executive, Pierre Vaquier, as saying options may have to be revisited if the vote was to leave the EU. “We have not launched the project because we want to see the results of the Brexit [vote],” Vaquier said in June. But he said on Wednesday that the French-owned fund management firm was taking a long-term view. “The decision to proceed underscores our confidence in the progressive and attractive development that we will deliver at 22, coupled with the anticipated breadth of demand from local and global occupiers for easily accessible space in a prime location in the City of London, as one of the leading global centres for international business, that will respond to their future business needs.” AXA IM was part of a consortium that paid £300m for the site in 2015. Construction came to a halt five years ago – a shell known as the Stump was left behind – but AXA IM said it had continued with the foundations and expected to complete the building in 2019. A contractor is expected to be appointed in the coming weeks. Chris Hayward, chairman of planning and transport at the City of London Corporation said: “This decision to continue with what is a key development in the City of London’s eastern cluster demonstrates the high level of investor confidence in London’s future growth.”"
2016-10-26T18:46:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Heathrow third runway: public bill up to £10bn hidden, says Tory MP","The true cost of Heathrow airport expansion to the taxpayer is not being divulged by the government, according to a Conservative former transport minister, who said ministers needed to “come clean” over the probable £5bn-£10bn public cost for road and rail links. Tory MP Stephen Hammond raised his concerns as it emerged that Heathrow executives would get millions in bonuses for securing approval for the £17.6bn third runway scheme. Hammond, a transport minister from 2012-14 when the airports commission was studying the scheme, said the government was misinforming the public by announcing that: “Expansion costs will be paid for by the private sector, not by the taxpayer.” The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had also omitted this in his statement to the house, he said.
“There will be a number of specific things we will be doing for Heathrow. The government and Heathrow need to come clean on what the cost to the taxpayer is going to be. No one would be surprised if it is £5bn, but we should just be honest about it,” Hammond added. While the commission report estimated a £5bn bill for new roads and rail links, Transport for London put the potential cost as being as high as £18.4bn. Heathrow said it had earmarked just £1bn, and that it only accepted direct responsibility for works to the M25, which the third runway would cross, and a few minor roads. The airport contends that it will be cutting traffic, despite adding up to 55 million passengers a year, and that revenues could offset the bill.
Heathrow confirmed on Wednesday that executives would be paid bonuses, for securing a new runway, that would be expected to run into several million pounds. A spokeswoman said the bonuses would depend on also reaching targets on customer service and profitability. The bonus scheme, devised by Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, and approved by shareholders last year, will mean senior managers getting rewards based on net earnings, passenger service and strategic targets for a third runway . Holland-Kaye earned £2.06m last year including bonuses, more than doubling his basic salary of £885,000. The new scheme, linked to expansion, did not pay out in 2015, “as the performance in respect of this scheme is so uncertain at this stage”, according to the airport’s annual report. In an unusual move, a further payment will depend on employee satisfaction and engagement scores, known as the “mojo bonus”, after “internal motivational practice” that was developed by Holland-Kaye.
Mojo may be rising at the airport faster than in the surrounding boroughs, where concerns over noise and air pollution have been heightened by a Department for Transport report into air quality. Campaigners have highlighted an apparent admission that pollution is likely to rise in parts of London with a third runway, which they say potentially makes the scheme illegal. The report, produced by Parsons Brinckerhoff for the DfT, said that Heathrow was “at risk of worsening exceedances of limit values alongside some roads within greater London, but this would be unlikely to affect the overall zone compliance”.
However, this is likely to be contested. Legal opinion obtained by the Clean Air in London campaign, from Robert McCracken QC, states that worsening pollution in any areas that already exceed legal limits would break the law. Grayling has said that the runway cannot go ahead without complying with air quality obligations, which the report suggests would be entirely dependent on proposed mitigation schemes from Heathrow. A DfT spokesperson said: “The government believes that the Heathrow north-west runway scheme could be delivered without impacting on the UK’s compliance with air quality limit values, with a suitable package of policy and mitigation measures.“ Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth pollution campaigner, said: “With 10,000 early deaths in the capital each year from air pollution this approach shows a callous disregard for people’s health. We believe this approach is at odds with EU rules on tackling air pollution.” In the Commons, the prime minister, Theresa May, said the government had “looked very carefully at the air quality issues”. Challenged by Tanya Mathias, the Tory MP for Twickenham, on worsening air pollution and noise, May said: “The evidence shows that air quality requirements can be met.”
Earlier, Grayling endorsed the idea of building the third airport runway over the M25 using a bridge rather than digging a tunnel for Britain’s busiest motorway to pass underneath the runway. He said the scheme would minimise disruption to motorists and be cheaper than the tunnel, which has alarmed Highways England, the strategic roads authority. While the so-called “ramp” has raised eyebrows, engineers insisted it was standard global practice. Chris Chalk, of the Institute of Civil Engineers transport expert panel, said: “Clearly there will have to be all sorts of simulations to ensure there is no risk of distracting drivers.” He said there would be a 150-metre width of bridge each side of the runway and that the gradient would be less steep than that on the runways at Manchester and Birmingham airports."
2016-10-26T23:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police officers must be aware of biases, says training college","Every police officer is guilty of some sort of bias, according to their professional standards body, and acknowledging as much is necessary to help stamp out discrimination in the use of controversial stop and search powers. The College of Policing on Thursday launches new guidelines for police on stop and search and also warns that an officer should consider if a bias is affecting his or her decision every time before making a stop. If they think prejudice is playing a part, they should not use the power. Richard Bennett, of the College of Policing said: “Our assumption is that every single person has biases. But the important thing if you’re someone acting on behalf of the state and exercising your powers is to recognise those biases and to ensure they do not impact on your decision-making around things like stop and search and other operational decision.” Stop and search has been blighted by overuse against black people – known as disproportionality. Police have been found by their watchdog to be exercising the power unlawfully, and the vast majority of uses end up stopping the innocent.
Theresa May, while home secretary, threatened to pass new laws to stop alleged abuses by the police, with black people four times more likely than white people to be stopped even after sustained government pressure. Against that backdrop, policing – which is still disproportionately white – is trying to reform itself, and stave off the threat of legislation. The College of Policing, set up by the government to professionalise the service, says the bias training has already been tried by 1,300 officers. The college released three examples of a stop where there were clear grounds, where the situation was ambiguous and where there was no justification at all. In the example where there were no grounds at all, it describes a situation where an officer sees a convicted burglar in a high crime area at 3am. “The officer stops and speaks to the subject who refuses to speak with the officer (there is no legal requirement to do so). There is no information or intelligence to say that this person, at this time, is likely to be in possession of a stolen or prohibited article. The person says they are on their way home and lives nearby,” it continues. Insp Garth Stinson, from the College, accepted that concerns about racial discrimination by officers that led to the focus on stamping out bias in the new training. He added biases also affected the use of the power against young and east Europeans, for instance, in the Midlands. Stinson said: “What we want to do is give the officers confidence. If they’ve got reasonable grounds and they’ve got the power that they can search people, they must do it. There’s a massive step between ‘I’ve got a gut instinct he’s a wrong ‘un’ through to ‘that gives me the evidence to get in their pockets”. Stop and search was linked to stoking discontent that fueled the 2011 riots that spread across England. Its use has been cut in recent years but there are still concerns that it may be damaging community relations. Steve Otter, who recently retired as a senior inspector with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, found in a report released in February there were continued abuses by officers and failures by forces. He warned police legitimacy was being drained, one in seven stops may be unlawful and added: “Every single major report into disorder in this country since 1970 places stop and search as one of, if not the most important contributing factor, and those lessons need to be learned.” Examples of stop and search scenarios given to officers: Clear grounds for a stop An officer on patrol is told by a shop owner that the person running away has stolen some goods and points to the person in question. The suspect continues to run from officers and refuses to answer questions when stopped clearly concealing an item under their jacket. The CCTV in the shop shows the person concealing something under their jacket before running out when challenged by the shop keeper. Ambiguous grounds for a stop Officer is directed to the scene of a recent knife-point robbery involving a young male described as being dressed in black and running away. The officer reaches the area within seconds to see a young male dressed in black running towards an approaching bus. There are numerous other people in the area. No grounds for a stop Officer sees a convicted burglar in a high crime area at 3am in the morning. The officer stops and speaks to the subject who refuses to speak with the officer (there is no legal requirement to do so). There is no information or intelligence to say that this person, at this time, is likely to be in possession of a stolen or prohibited article. The person says they are on their way home and lives nearby. A subsequent PNC check reveals the person is not currently wanted nor have there been any reported crimes in the immediate area that evening."
2016-10-26T23:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Spend £11.5bn on measures to boost economy, warns CBI","The business lobby group has urged the chancellor to adopt an £11.5bn shopping list of measures in the autumn statement. The CBI’s call for a “more flexible approach” to Britain’s public finances, with significant spending on infrastructure projects and cuts to business taxes, follows growing concerns inside the Treasury that tax revenues are falling and growth is slowing, limiting Hammond’s room for manoeuvre as he plans the next five years of government spending. A report from the Resolution Foundation on Wednesday forecast an £84bn shortfall in the Treasury’s finances against the projections to 2020-21 made by the then chancellor George Osborne in March. Hammond said he would “reset” the public finances in response to the Brexit vote, and an expected shortfall in tax revenues and lower GDP growth, fuelling expectations that spending will be increased in the autumn statement next month. But he has ruled out a spending “splurge” and emphasised the limits on the Treasury’s capacity to increase borrowing while Britain’s relationship with the EU remains uncertain. The CBI said the chancellor could spend more than £11bn and remain on track to meet his goal of balancing the books over the business cycle, particularly because its proposals were designed to increase productivity and growth. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said: “The chancellor should capitalise on the UK’s core strengths, setting out a pro-enterprise agenda that instils confidence and kickstarts investment. “With huge variations in productivity between different parts of the country, the top priority must be to set out a programme that will get our regions firing on all cylinders and supports businesses to innovate, invest and create jobs in the years ahead.” She said Hammond should reverse, at a cost of £6bn, cuts that took public investment below 2% of GDP, and fast-track £425bn of planned infrastructure investment, switching the emphasis from London and the south-east of England to the west, Midlands and north. The CBI has long campaigned for the Treasury to support road-widening schemes and rail upgrades in order to improve the UK’s infrastructure, while backing projects such as the third runway at Heathrow and the HS2 high-speed rail line. Hammond was urged to spend £2.1bn on extending maternity leave to encourage more women to return to work, An increase in maternity leave from nine months to a year would bridge the gap with the earliest date from which parents can claim childcare support. The government’s childcare voucher scheme, which subsidises a nursery place or childminder, takes effect at 52 weeks. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said small changes to business rates could also encourage investment. Under current rules, spending on solar panels and machinery can be counted as improvements to business premises, triggering extra business rates. She said the £200,000 annual investment allowance should be raised to £1m until the end of 2018 “to increase the attractiveness of near-term investment”. Fairbairn said: “With interest rates at rock bottom, now is the time for the UK to put serious effort into improving our creaking infrastructure. “We would like to see £6bn more spent each year on public investment: improving our transport and digital network, building more homes and extending regional funding.”"
2016-10-27T10:01:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Sun journalist wins challenge over Operation Elveden conviction,"The only journalist whose conviction for payments to public officials under Operation Elveden was still standing has had his guilty verdict overturned by the court of appeal. Sun crime reporter Anthony France was found guilty in May last year of aiding and abetting a police officer working for a counter-terrorism command squad to commit misconduct in a public office. He was sentenced to 18 months’ prison, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service. After the result of his appeal was announced by Lady Justice Hallett, France was congratulated by supporters outside court. He said: “I am delighted that this serious miscarriage of justice has ended today, allowing me to rebuild my life after 1,379 days of sheer hell.” Sun publisher News UK said: “Today Anthony France’s conviction has been overturned on appeal and we are delighted that these proceedings are now over for him. In the course of the last five years, 19 journalists from the Sun were prosecuted as a result of Operation Elveden and not one has resulted in any conviction being upheld.” In a written judgment, the court said the judge in France’s original trial should have give more detailed directions to the jury in what was a “complex area of the law”. In particular, it said that the the jury should have had more direction on how to assess the seriousness of harm caused by the information provided to France, and more detailed instruction on how to evaluate the public interest. It said that the “cumulative” effect of the court’s criticisms meant the conviction was unsafe. The ruling said: “Taking any one of those criticisms in isolation, we may not have been persuaded the summing up rendered the conviction unsafe. However, we must consider their cumulative effect and read the summing-up as a whole. “Having done so, we are driven to the conclusion that the jury were not provided with legally adequate directions tailored to the circumstances of the case and that the conviction is unsafe.” The decision mirrors the one handed down by the court of appeal when it quashed the conviction of a News of the World reporter for similar offences in March 2015. Later that month, the Crown Prosecution Service launched a review of its policy of prosecuting journalists under Operation Elveden. Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the case showed journalists needed greater protection when working in the public interest. He said: “In most of the cases in which journalists were charged ordinary members of the public who made up juries clearly decided that journalists were working in the public interest. “The police and the Crown Prosecution Service need to think more carefully before they charge journalists for informing the public. Careers and lives were destroyed by the over-long and hugely expensive police investigation.” • This article was amended on 28 October 2016.

Damon Smith, 19, smiled, waved to the public gallery and gave a thumbs-up to his lawyer during a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. Wearing a grey sweater and trousers, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. From the public gallery, Smith’s mother interrupted the hearing, shouting: “He doesn’t know what he’s doing, he’s got Asperger’s [syndrome].” North Greenwich station was shut down on 20 October after passengers spotted an unaccompanied rucksack. It was initially treated as lost property and handed to the driver, who looked in the bag and saw it contained a homemade explosive device, at which point he raised the alarm. Police described the device as “viable”. Smith, 19, was Tasered during his arrest on Holloway Road the following day. A street in the Devon town of Newton Abbot was sealed off and residents evacuated as counter-terrorism officers searched his former home on Saturday, finding another “suspicious device” that was later declared “not viable”. Smith lived at the property with his mother until late summer, when he moved to London to attend university. He enrolled at London Metropolitan university three weeks before the bomb alert, a spokesman for the university confirmed. Smith was charged under the Explosive Substances Act 1883 with making or owning an explosive substance with intent to injure or endanger lives. “He has been charged following the discovery of a suspicious item on a tube train at North Greenwich underground station on Thursday 20 October,” the Metropolitan police said. Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot refused bail and said Smith would be remanded in custody until his next hearing at the Old Bailey on 17 November."
2016-10-27T12:49:08Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scottish NHS failing to keep up with rising demand, says watchdog","Scotland’s NHS faces massive cuts as the health service fails to keep pace with increasing demand, rising costs and the needs of an ageing population, according to the public finances watchdog. The damning report from Audit Scotland warns that some NHS boards may not be able to balance their books next year, and reveals that the service met only one of its eight key waiting time targets last year.
But Nicola Sturgeon insisted the health service was performing better against tougher targets, and that there was “nothing unique about the challenges facing the NHS in Scotland”, with the performance of accident and emergency departments 8% higher than those in England and Wales. She told the Holyrood chamber during first minister’s questions: “There is now more than £3bn extra investment in the health service compared to the time we took office. There are 11,000 more medical professionals working in our health service. That’s why Audit Scotland says today that staffing levels are at an all-time high.” During a bruising session, Sturgeon was challenged by the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, about her government’s “outrageous” failure to get a grip on the NHS, while Scottish Labour’s Kezia Dugdale presented individual illustrations of what she described as the “human cost of a decade of SNP mismanagement”. The criticism of government ministers for failing to outline a coherent vision for the healthcare system was echoed by the director of the Royal College of Nursing Scotland, Theresa Fyffe, who said health boards trying to make savings “often find themselves caught in the crossfire of political and public opinion”. She called for a “decisive response” from the health secretary, Shona Robison. “Clarity is needed from government on how they will support health boards to deliver the changes needed, and also how all the various health strategies and reforms currently under way will be delivered coherently across Scotland. All politicians need to set aside their differences and work together in order to get this right.” Audit Scotland reports that the country’s 14 health boards made total savings of £291m last year, which left some needing to use short-term measures to break even. It forecast that the figure would nearly double to £492m in the current financial year. The report says there is a “need for NHS boards to make unprecedented levels of savings in 2016-17, and a risk that some will not achieve financial balance”.
The total health budget in 2015-16 was £12.2bn. Although this increased by 2.7% in real terms from the previous year, major expenses have risen more sharply, with staff costs increasing by 6.4% and pension costs up by 18.6% in the past six years.
Failure to keep pace with rising demand and costs strengthened the case for changing the way services are delivered, according to the auditor general for Scotland. Caroline Gardner said: “The Scottish government has had a policy to shift the balance of care for over a decade but, despite multiple strategies for reform, NHS funding has not changed course. “Before that shift can occur, there needs to be a clear and detailed plan for change, setting out what the future of the NHS looks like, what it will cost to deliver and the workforce numbers and skills needed to make it a reality.” The report also highlighted increasing spending by boards on costly agency workers because of significant problems with recruitment and retention of staff, as well as a lack of workforce planning for new models of care to deliver more community-based services. It gave one example of some agency doctors earning £400,000 for less than a year’s work. The health secretary insisted the Scottish government had made “significant improvements” and had a strategy to change the way services are delivered. Robison told BBC Radio Scotland the report presented “a very fair and balanced view, confirming that we have record levels of investment and acknowledging that our NHS performs very well compared to the rest of the UK”. A report for the General Medical Council, also published on Thursday morning, warned that poor morale among doctors could put patients at risk. The regulator said there was “a state of unease within the medical profession across the UK that risks affecting patients as well as doctors”. In its annual report into the state of medical education and practice in the UK, the GMC also noted that after the anger and frustration in the dispute between junior doctors and the Department of Health, levels of alienation “should cause everyone to pause and reflect”."
2016-10-27T14:06:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Will Jeremy Corbyn's admirers change Labour's fortunes in London?,"Labour List, that authoritative source of news and opinion about Labour Party affairs, has reported that “London is becoming a key battleground in Labour’s internal struggles for power” and that the left of the party in the capital has “stepped up its organisation for internal elections” to the London regional board next month. The board’s membership is important because, among other things, it will play a substantial role in Labour’s response to the parliamentary constituency boundary review - which, as Labour List puts it, “will likely see Labour MPs from different wings of the party go up against each other in [candidate] selections” – and has a big influence over who gets picked to run for council seats. Thoughts are already turning to the borough elections of 2018. Labour List says that Momentum, the activist group that supports Jeremy Corbyn, is working hard to promote candidates for the board that are to its liking, but that a rival alignment, which “includes elements of the party’s soft left” as well as its centre and right, is doing the same. Labour people I’ve sounded out fully recognise this nuanced description of the party’s activist landscape in the capital. Could there be significant shifts in the political disposition of Labour candidates and elected politicians in London over the next few years? Might senior figures be brought down? What might be the implications for Labour and for the city, where about 20% of Labour’s total membership lives and where the party has consistently gained ground in recent years, notwithstanding the mayoralties of Boris Johnson? Early inquiries around Labour-run boroughs have produced an interesting range of answers. They have suggested wide variations across the capital from borough to borough but also from ward to ward, sometimes depending on who the sitting MP is or attitudes to particular local issues and often on how well organised (or otherwise) different tendencies within local memberships are. For example, contacts in Ealing and Hammersmith and Fulham report no impending disturbance of the status quo. From Lewisham, one of the boroughs where Labour membership has grown a lot, it is observed that many of the newcomers have been enthused by Corbyn but aren’t necessarily all-out Corbynites or involved in full-on organising for Momentum. It may be instructive to see how aspiring successors to Lewisham mayor Sir Steve Bullock, who is to retire and will therefore not seek re-election in 18 months’ time, approach the challenge. In other parts of London there are indications that the jostling is intense. I gather that in Croydon there is lively competition among differing factions to secure local party posts and exert influence on the London region, while in Haringey, according to one source, there are threats of councillor deselection right across the borough from new members on the left. There are definitely worries within Labour Lambeth’s corridors of power that some current councillors could be ousted. The above is, I emphasise, just a tentative initial sketch of what looks to be a finely-shaded picture of grassroots Labour activism in the capital. It would be both premature and crude to predict some monolithic, “hard left” ascendancy, let alone pontificate about what such a thing might mean for Labour fortunes. It may turn out that not a huge amount will change: as one experienced Labourite put it “it would take an awful lot of time and energy to engineer the sort of huge shift to the left that some of Jeremy’s admirers would like.” That said, all and any significant changes in the city’s political complexion are relevant to its people and its future. They are therefore also of interest to this column. Readers who can help me track them in fuller detail are welcome to comment below or to email dave.hill@theguardian.com. Thank you.

2016-10-27T14:57:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"Army tried to destroy my career, says 'whistleblower' doctor","A “whistleblowing” army doctor with an unblemished service record was sacked because he discovered potentially criminal appropriation of morphine at a military base in the north-west of England, a tribunal has heard. Senior army officers allegedly tried to smear Dr Stephen Frost by calling him a conspiracy theorist and a Kremlin sympathiser when he challenged his dismissal at an employment tribunal, court documents show. The 69-year-old, who led the campaign to reopen the inquest into the death of the weapons expert Dr David Kelly, was dismissed in September 2013 by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after a war veteran was wrongly given morphine tablets six times the strength he had been prescribed. The MoD accepts Frost neither wrote the prescription nor dispensed the superstrength painkillers at Weeton barracks near Blackpool. But he was nonetheless sacked for not telling the veteran that he had been issued with the wrong tablets and was at risk of overdosing. Frost denies responsibility for the error. He believes MoD officers deliberately tried to discredit and “maliciously libel” him before his employment tribunal. Giving evidence before a panel in Manchester on Thursday, Frost said he found himself in a “Kafkaesque” situation when he was suddenly sacked with no explanation on 6 September 2013. Comparing himself to Josef K, a character in Kafka’s The Trial, Frost said: “He was arrested but he didn’t know what he had been charged with, but at least he knew he was under threat. I didn’t know I was under threat.” The tribunal has been told that the officer who sacked Frost decided to Google him after learning that the doctor planned to challenge his dismissal in the courts. Col Carson Black sent an email to an MoD official saying of Frost’s online presence: “A number of tweets refer to the ‘illegal war in Iraq’. His main internet vehicle is the website Global Research, which is a leftwing ‘conspiracy theorist’ site … it is clear to me that Dr Frost has an axe to grind and it surprises me that he has chosen to work for the MoD environment when his views are so strong.” In another email, Black, who was then in charge of Army Primary Healthcare Services (North), notes that Frost’s Facebook page “uses a Moscow scene as its header. I think his love of Russia is sparked by his interest in ballet and culture in general but … we have seen this with well-meaning intellectuals and idealists in the past.” According to the MoD’s response to Frost’s claim, these emails were sent to Frost’s primary healthcare trust in Wales. In his claim Frost says the emails were forwarded with the intention of “destroying his reputation such that he could not practice as a doctor again”. The MoD denies that it sought to maliciously discredit or libel Frost or damage his hope of working as a GP. Frost has not worked or been paid since and says he has suffered depression and anxiety as a result of the experience. He is claiming undisclosed aggravated and exemplary damages for loss of contract, earnings and injury to his health and feelings. Frost worked full-time as a locum at Weeton from 22 July 2013, covering for a doctor who had been deployed to Afghanistan. His contract was due to end on 30 December 2013, but was abruptly terminated via email and text message from his agency, Castlerock Recruitment Group, on 6 September that year. He was subsequently told that the MoD believed he had failed in his duty of “candour” to tell the war veteran patient that a pharmacist had given him the wrong strength morphine tablets by mistake. The pharmacist, Elaine Gould, told Frost she had mistakenly labelled 60mg tablets as 10mg and wrongly dispensed them to the patient. Frost says in his claim that after a consultation with the patient he was confident the patient had not taken the super-strength morphine, because he was not showing withdrawal symptoms despite his supply having run out at least a week previously. He made notes in the patient’s medical records to that effect, which he now claims amount to a “protected disclosure”, ie evidence of whistleblowing, which affords an employee special legal protection. The MoD denies that the notes qualify as protected disclosures. In Frost’s claim he says he began to suspect “unlawful criminal activities had taken place and that there was a need for police investigation” after the patient insisted he had never been given the 60mg tablets, which are orange, a different colour from the 10mg pills he had been prescribed by another doctor. His claim form also alleges he raised concerns about “serious health and safety concerns in respect of the way in which the pharmacy operated”. Frost says he raised concerns with MoD staff at Weeton “expressing his concern that the dispensing error was highly unlikely to have been a mistake and that he considered Mrs Gould to have been coerced into illegal activity, be it by threats or blackmail.” He says his suggestion that police be called was met with “silence and apparent disinterest”. Neither civilian nor military police were informed. Responding to Frost’s claim, the MoD asserts that “nowhere in the contemporaneous documents is it recorded that the claimant believed that the overdose incident was related to a deliberate criminal act or that he communicated this to anybody.” The tribunal continues."
2016-10-27T16:27:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Kettering left in dark over Lindsay Lohan's offer to light up Xmas,"It was set to be a highlight of the Northamptonshire festive calendar. But the people of Kettering have been left in the dark after Lindsay Lohan went silent on her offer to turn on their Christmas lights. The Mean Girls actor accepted the unusual invitation from local Conservative MP Philip Hollobone after she criticised the town’s residents on Twitter for voting for Brexit. The tweet in which she said “Sorry Kettering but where are you?” was described as “fierce and offensive”. “Everyone knows where Kettering is, it’s famous as the home of Weetabix,” said Hollobone, inviting Lohan to switch on the Christmas lights to “redeem her political reputation”.
To the town’s surprise, Lohan said she would be “happy to switch on the Christmas tree”. However, in the four months that have passed, the actor has gone quiet on the invitation and has not responded to messages from the organisers. With the 24 November ceremony to switch on the lights approaching, the council has still to confirm her attendance. Hollobone said: “She said she would come and switch on the Christmas lights at Kettering but, despite everyone’s best efforts, it’s simply not been possible to track her down. “She needs to know when and where she needs to be.” Previous figures who have switched on Kettering’s festive lights include local panto stars and schoolchildren. Hollobone said Lohan should follow through on her promise to the town. “I take the simple view that if you undertake to do something, you should do it,” he said. “The message is, ‘Lindsay Lohan please get in touch, your public awaits’.”"
2016-10-27T17:36:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged serial killer 'panicked' when he woke next to dead male escort,"Stephen Port, an alleged serial killer, told a jury he panicked when he woke to find a male escort, whom he had hired for the night, cold and rigid in his bed and did not want to believe he could be dead. Describing how he moved fashion student Anthony Walgate, 23, from his east London flat, Port, 41, said he had initially lied to police because the shock “had hit me hard”. Port, a former chef, is charged with murdering four young men at his flat by allegedly administering fatal doses of the date-rape drug GHB to them, to feed his fetish for sex with unconscious young males. It is alleged he dumped their bodies near his home in Barking, east London: three in a churchyard and one just outside the communal entrance to his one-bedroomed flat. He denies four charges of murder as well as charges of drugging and raping other men he met through gay dating websites. The jury has heard that the body of Walgate, the first of the men to die, was found in June 2014. Giving evidence, quietly spoken Port, who also worked as a male escort to earn extra money, said he had agreed to pay the student £800 to stay overnight while his partner was away. Port told an Old Bailey court that before sex, Walgate wanted to “take something” although Port did not know what he took. “He said he was on antidepressants and that had killed his sex drive completely.” Later Walgate again took something “because he was losing his high and wanted to get some more stuff,” Port said. Port added Walgate was sick and became “very high, very agitated, kind of hyper”. He said he left him fully clothed in bed and went to work, but he was still there in the bed when he returned later that night. He said Walgate was making a “gurgling” noise. “I thought he was in a deep sleep still, so I left him.” Port said he also got into the bed but woke up in the night. “He was really cold. His arm was still and rigid … I didn’t want to think about him being dead,” he said. He said he had called an ambulance and carried Walgate outside. Asked why, he replied it was easier for the ambulance to see him and Port did not want his boyfriend, who was shortly due to return to the flat, to discover he had hired an escort. He admitted he had lied to police about finding Walgate outside his flat because when police told him he was dead “that hit me – the shock – that hit hard”. He denied administering any drugs to Walgate. The prosecution has alleged that Port had a fetish for boyish men – known as “twinks” – and for having sex with drugged young men. Asked by his lawyer, David Etherington QC, if he enjoyed sex with men while they were asleep, Port replied. “It’s nice at first, less moving about, you can take your time. “It gets a bit boring and gets a bit lonely: like having sex on your own, I suppose.” He would have consensual sex with an unconscious boyfriend but not with a stranger, he said, because they might “wake up and punch me or something”. He said he was attracted to “twinks” because of “their energy, their life, their youth, beautiful, just nice to be with”. Asked why he wore a toupee, he said “just to be better looking, for confidence”. He told the jury he had taken poppers but started experimenting with drugs in 2013 with a boyfriend, first taking “meow meow” – or mephedrone – and later combining it with G – or GHB. “It was the feeling you could go on for hours and hours having sex. You didn’t want to stop. It was continuous,” he said. Of GHB he said: “To start with it could knock you out for an hour but you would wake up feeling horny and wanting to have sex for hours.” The combination of the two gave him a “hyper high for about an hour,” he said and he started taking drugs every weekend. He described getting into casual sex though “the ease of internet access” when he moved out of his parents’ home – where he had had no internet access – into his own flat in 2006. He said he enjoyed watching group sex pornography with consenting “twinks” “but not necessarily doing it … I prefer one-on-one, always have.” The case continues."
2016-10-27T18:44:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Depleted police forces 'failing to curb use of phones by drivers',"Drivers using mobile phones at the wheel are regularly escaping punishment, with police now imposing a fraction of the number of fines given five years ago. Although mobile phone use has been linked to a string of traffic accidents, official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices issued by police in England and Wales for the offence has fallen from 123,100 in 2011 to just 16,900 in 2015. The total fell by 43% in 2014-15, the last recorded year.
The RAC said the figures showed an epidemic of handheld mobile use going unchallenged. Its road safety spokesman, Pete Williams, said: “The number of fixed penalty notices issued by police forces in England and Wales for illegal handheld phone use at the wheel has, frankly, fallen off a cliff. “The figures lay bare the scale of the handheld mobile phone epidemic that has been allowed to sweep across the country largely unchallenged. The simple truth is the problem of illegal handheld phone use at the wheel is undeniably getting worse, with fewer and fewer people being caught.” The Department for Transport (DfT) has vowed to crack down on the use of mobiles at the wheel – a factor cited in 22 fatal accidents last year – by doubling fines. But government statistics released on Thursday suggest depleted police forces are no longer willing or able to enforce the rules. Some of the drop in fixed penalties has been ascribed to drivers being more aware of the law or police sending drivers on education courses, but the number of fines issued for offences caught automatically by cameras, such as speeding, have increased. Other infringements are being ignored, motoring organisations believe. The data shows that the number of fines issued for seatbelt offences has dropped dramatically, from 140,900 in 2011 to 19,800 last year. RAC research released in September showed that the proportion of motorists who believe calling while driving is acceptable has doubled to 14%, from 7% in 2014, and one in five drivers believes it is safe to check social media on their phone while stopped in traffic. Williams said: “Attitudes are clearly relaxing as a result of drivers no longer fearing punishment.” Last month the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, announced that tougher penalties would be introduced from 2017, likely to raise fixed penalty fines from £100 to at least £150, and the number of points added to the driving licence of offenders from three to four or six, potentially with higher sanctions for HGV drivers. But the RAC said fewer traffic police meant that motorists had decreasing confidence that the law would be enforced. According to the RAC, there has been a 27% decline in full-time roads policing officers since 2010. The DfT said it would also be starting a “hard-hitting campaign” to make phone use at the wheel socially unacceptable. Chief constable Suzette Davenport, of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: “Police have adapted to significant increases in motorists’ use of mobile phones at the wheel, as well as phones themselves becoming much smarter. “In recent years, officers have had more tactics available them, such as sending offenders on courses to learn about the impact and consequences of driving when distracted and the key principles of road safety, and our approach is a blend of enforcement and education. “Like drink-driving, we have to work towards changing people’s attitudes. We measure success not only in terms of the number of offenders caught, but also by driving behaviours changed.” But Brake, the road safety charity, said police were under-resourced to stop offences. Spokeswoman Lucy Amos said: “Research has shown this to be a rapidly growing problem on the roads, but this is not reflected in the number fixed penalty notices issued for mobile phone use in the figures released today. “Instead, these figures are evidence of the lack of resources and manpower available to the police.” She added: “We urge the government to make roads policing a national policing priority to prevent illegal, risk-taking behaviour behind the wheel.” According to the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, 3,611 reported road accidents from 2009-2014 involved a driver using a mobile phone, and there is clear evidence linking mobiles to an increased risk of accident. A government spokesman said: “While enforcement of road traffic offences is an operational matter for the police, we are clear that the illegal use of handheld devices while driving is totally unacceptable. “We take this extremely seriously and will be shortly announcing tougher penalties for using mobile phones at the wheel.” ‘People just don’t know how dangerous it is’
Paul Carvin, 59, is a retired school inspector from Morpeth, Northumberland. In February 2006 his wife, Zoë, 42, was killed by a driver who was texting on a mobile phone. “Zoë and her mother were taking their dogs to the beach for a walk, and were parked at traffic lights on the A1, when a lorry driver doing 50mph and texting ploughed into the back of their car. She was killed outright and her mum was badly injured. “My daughter Emily was 11 and my son Ben was 13. I can still remember everything that happened that day – looking out the window, seeing them laughing and playing with their friends, knowing something I was about to tell them would change their lives forever. “I remember the scream my daughter let out. I can’t think of anything worse than telling your children their mum has been killed. “Zoë was killed at 10.42am on a Thursday. For years afterwards I would know that time and day was approaching and it would cause me huge anxiety and palpitations. “From that moment our lives changed forever – all sorts of things like anxiety, depression, bereavement – just because someone did something stupid like using a phone. “Zoë was a teacher, so she tended to be the person who was home at the end of the day for the children after school. Suddenly it was me, bereaved, with two bereaved children to look after alone. “And also, in a sense, her whole class was bereaved. She taught seven-year-olds. When they came back after half term there was no teacher for them: in the community that’s hundreds of people affected. “The driver was sentenced to four and a half years, released after two, handed a ban but was caught driving again. We’ve tried to never harbour ill-feeling, because we think it would only hurt us. “We’ve tried to rebuild our lives, Emily still suffers a bit from depression and anxiety – but we’re all changed inside. We all feel very deeply about dangerous driving, but the use of mobile phones in particular. Research shows that it is the distraction: I’d ban hands-free phones too.
“They’re increasing the penalties but to my mind it should be a straight ban, like drink driving, but more so – it’s just as dangerous. Then people would know someone who was banned, the perception would change, word would get around that it is wrong. “People don’t realise just how dangerous it is. The number of fines has gone down but mobile use in cars has clearly gone up. “You see it all the time: in slow-moving traffic you can see people looking down, it’s obvious they’re texting. If they do it then, they will do it when they’re driving fast too. “There aren’t enough police officers to catch everybody. It’s not a question of less usage – it’s fewer people being caught.The chances of getting caught are negligible and the fine is negligible, even if goes up to £200. You can’t even buy most mobile phones for that.”"
2016-10-27T19:03:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Police satisfied with stop and search reform despite racial inequality,"Police believe they have done enough to avert the government’s threat to pass new laws outlawing the abuse of stop and search powers, despite new figures showing that black people are six times more likely to be targeted by officers than white people. The official figures show a big fall in police use of stop and search for all ethnic groups. While more than eight in 10 incidents still lead to no arrest, changes appear to have reduced the police time wasted and infringements on the rights of innocent people. However, the power is being used more disproportionately against black people than white people and that disparity grew in the past year. A black person was six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than a white person, up from four times more likely the year before. The government has threatened to pass new laws if the police do not reform sufficiently, but the issue now is whether ministers view the progress as sufficient. Adrian Hanstock, the national police lead on stop and search, told the Guardian that enough had been done. “I think we’ve started to demonstrate the changes that the government had asked for,” he said. “Have we done enough to demonstrate commitment, the will to change and ability to change? Yes, I think we have, because the legislation would be being laid now, they would not have waited four years.” During her time as home secretary, Theresa May castigated the police over the issue. A review on racial inequality in the justice system, which is being led by MP David Lammy and will report to the prime minister, is under way. In 2015-16, the number of stops fell 28%, to 386,474, with 16% leading to an arrest, suggesting that officers are using the powers in a more focused way than in previous years. However, people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups as a whole were almost three times more likely to be stopped than white people. The Home Office commentary accompanying the statistics pointed out that the Metropolitan police’s higher use of stop and search than any other force skewed the figures, because much of Britain’s BME population lives in London. The Met stopped 18 out of every 1,000 people in their policing area, more than twice the England and Wales average of seven stops per 1,000. “MPS [the Met] account for a large proportion (40%) of stops and searches in England and Wales. As the force has a considerably larger BME population than other parts of the county, data for MPS can skew the data at a national level when considering the ethnicity of those stopped,” the report said. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the disproportionate stops directed against black people were due to prejudice. “While today’s statistics show that our stop and search reforms are working, with a continuing fall in the overall number of stops and the highest ever recorded arrest rate, it is completely unacceptable that you are six times more likely to be stopped and searched if you are black than if you are white,” she said. “I am clear that, in a Britain that works for everyone, no one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.” The Home Office did not answer whether it believed police had achieved enough to lift the threat of legislation, but it did say the police inspectorate would examine forces next year on stop and search. The Conservatives hope one byproduct of their words and actions on race and the criminal justice system will be an increase in their low share of the increasingly important BME vote. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and one of Britain’s most senior black politicians, said: “BME people have long been disproportionately subjected to stop and search. There is no objection to evidence-based stops, but what inflames the relationship between the community and the police is the abuse of stop and search. “It poisons relationships between young people in inner cities and the police. Unless you have a young male family member who is repeatedly stopped and searched, it is difficult to appreciate the damage it can do. “Tensions between the community and police led to the riots of the 80s and were cited as a reason for more recent public disturbances.” A spokesperson for Black Lives Matter UK said the latest figures showed the ineffectiveness of stop and search reform. “These stats show that the new ‘intelligence-led’ stop and searches are really just prejudice-led. This is institutional racism, not just bad apples. We want this power scrapped and police forces held properly accountable.” Stafford Scott, the coordinator of Tottenham Rights, which challenges institutional racism, said this interpretation chimed with the experience of the young people he worked with in north London. “This is part of the power that police have used like a blunt instrument to contain and control our community,” he said. Scott said the increase in stop and search disproportionality showed that police intelligence, the supposed basis for the use of stop and search in London, unfairly targeted black youths while letting suspects from other communities off the hook. “In a borough like Haringey, where the Turkish gangs are, it’s only black kids that are on the Matrix [the Met’s gangs database]. [The police] say they are gangsters and then stop and search them all the time,” Scott said."
2016-10-28T09:14:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Tributes paid to boy, 13, found dead in Doncaster shed fire","The great-grandmother of a teenager who was found dead after a fire in a shed has paid tribute to the “clever and right warm-hearted” boy. The 13-year-old, named locally as Jack Sheldon, was discovered after firefighters extinguished the fire in the outbuilding in Campsall, Doncaster, on Thursday night. On Friday, a police car and a fire investigation van were parked outside the family’s semi-detached house. A black tarpaulin covered the shed in the back garden. It is believed Jack had been filling his motorbike with petrol when the fire started in the shed. His great-grandmother Irene Bennett, 74, described him as “clever and right warm-hearted”. She added: “He was always asking me if he could take bits from my shed, tools and things like that. “He wanted to be a plumber when he left school, but I knew he had something in his shed but I didn’t know what it was. I knew he had gone mad on engines and bikes in the past few months.” Bennett said she did not know the full details of what took place. She said: “All I know is that he burnt to death in a shed. “His mum’s partner came round to my house last night and told me that Jack had died. He told me that Jack had been in the shed and was fiddling around with a petrol engine. I think he locked himself in and couldn’t get out. “He had a thing for locking doors and would always say to me ‘Nanna lock your doors’ whenever he came round. I can’t believe it has happened.” She said Jack had been to her house and sorted through her recycling earlier in the day on Thursday before visiting a youth club and then heading home. She added: “I just keep thinking to myself if only I had been here because then he would have stayed the night and this never would have happened. “I just wish I could turn the clocks back.” It is understood Jack lived with his mother, Carlie Swatten, 32, and younger brother Lewis. A South Yorkshire police spokesman said two fire crews attended the blaze after being called at about 9pm. He added: “Once the fire was extinguished a body was found within the shed, believed to be that of a 13-year-old male. “Formal identification has not yet taken place and a joint investigation by South Yorkshire fire and rescue and South Yorkshire police is under way to establish the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.” A floral tribute outside the property read: “We are all thinking of you. There are no words that can be spoken. Just know that we share your sorrow.” A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: “I was out last night when it happened. I know they kept a motorbike and petrol in the shed. I spoke to his mum last night and they aren’t coping with what happened.” Another neighbour described seeing flames. “It was my dogs that alerted the fire to me first around 8.30pm. The flames were above the trees and I could hear all this crackling and popping. I didn’t hear any screaming but I heard voices later on that I assume was the police or fire investigators.” Jack’s friends paid tribute to him on social media. One wrote: “RIP jack son you meant the world to me and many others, things just aren’t going to be the same without you. You were taken way too soon and you will always be missed I love you son.” The same friend later posted: “Basically was filling his bike up with petrol in a shed and sommets happened lit it on fire and he couldn’t get out x.” A female friend wrote: “Rest in paradise jack, known you soooo long and thats the worst news ever, one of my best friends ever – gone but never forgotten, taken too young. love you always xxxxx.” Another friend posted: “Will be missed dearly.”"
2016-10-28T09:56:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Child abuse inquiry hit by sexual assault claim,"The head of the national inquiry into child abuse has been urged to publicly address claims that it covered up an alleged sexual assault by its most senior lawyer. An inquiry worker alleged that Ben Emmerson QC sexually assaulted her in a lift at the inquiry’s offices in Millbank in central London in early September, according to BBC Newsnight. He was suspended that month, over what the inquiry said at the time were leadership concerns, but the suspension was lifted the next day when he resigned, allowing him to keep working for the inquiry for two months. Emmerson’s lawyers have said the allegation of sexual assaultis “completely false” but the claim has added to the turbulence afflicting the inquiry. Tim Loughton, a Conservative MP who was chair of the home affairs select committee when it questioned the inquiry chair, Prof Alexis Jay, and other panel members last week, said Jay needed to address the allegations and restore confidence in its work. “It is slightly ironic that an inquiry into cover-ups about historic child sexual abuse is handling things in this way and [it] does need to be much more transparent to give assurances to those many thousands of people who were affected that this is being looked at properly and it’s fit for purpose,” Loughton told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “She [Jay] really does need to put on the public record the assurances that this is being dealt with properly and that the inquiry is doing its important work properly to the satisfaction of the survivors who are the most important people in this.” The committee asked Jay a direct question about Emmerson’s suspension last week but the allegations aired by Newsnight were not mentioned by Jay. When it was put to him that they should have been, Loughton stressed the independence of the inquiry from political interference and said there may have been legal issues at work. But he insisted that the inquiry must “step up its game”. On 28 September, Emmerson was suspended and the next day he quit. Referring to Jay’s plans for a review of the approach of the inquiry, he said: “I had my personal doubts about whether I was genuinely the right person to steer that review process. Since then, it has become clear to me that I am not the person to take this review forward on your behalf.” At the time Jay paid tribute to his “enormous contribution to the inquiry”. His suspension was lifted and, at last week’s meeting, Jay told the committee that Emmerson was continuing to work for the inquiry from home, writing a handover document for his successor, who is yet to be announced. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy told Newsnight that the claims surrounding Emmerson and a possible cover-up were “the latest and most serious to date in a series of allegations that have emerged into the public domain in recent weeks”. Including Emmerson, three senior lawyers have quit the inquiry since Jay took over as chair from Dame Lowell Goddard, who resigned in August. Earlier this month, it was alleged that Goddard was racist and abusive to staff on the inquiry. She has denounced the claims as “completely false”. A lawyer for Emmerson said: “Mr Emmerson categorically denies any allegation of sexual assault, or bullying or other misconduct at the inquiry.”"
2016-10-28T10:45:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Belfast court rejects two challenges to Brexit,"Two of the first legal challenges to Brexit have been rejected by a Belfast court. A high court judge ruled that the Good Friday agreement in 1998 could not be used to grant Northern Ireland exemption from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. A victim of loyalist terrorism, Ulster politicians and community groups argued in court that because 56% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted to remain in the EU, the region’s devolved parliament should have the right to vote on staying in Europe. But Mr Justice Paul Maguire dismissed this argument, pointing out that the Good Friday agreement was constitutionally relevant only “in the particular context of whether Northern Ireland should remain as part of the UK or unite with Ireland.” Delivering his judgment in the high court on Friday morning, Mr Justice Maguire said the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland were still unclear after the prime minister indicated she would start negotiations to leave the EU before March 2017.
“While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blow cannot yet be determined, so there is a level of uncertainty, as evidenced by the discussion about how the Northern Ireland land border with Ireland was affected by withdrawal from the EU,” he said. Maguire said it was not in the court’s power to overturn a political decision but the judgment in Belfast would not prejudice other challenges to Brexit in English courts. “It is the court’s view the prerogative power is still operative and can be used for the purpose of the executive giving notification for the purpose of article 50. This, however, is said without prejudice to the issues which have been stayed and which are under consideration in the English courts,” the judge said. “In respect of all issues, the court dismissed the applications.” Among those who took the legal challenge to Brexit was Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries. He had argued that Brexit would endanger the peace process and undermine the Good Friday agreement. After the judgment, McCord said he was disappointed, adding that he would take his case to the supreme court in London. ”We live in a democratic system,” he said. “56% of the people of this country voted to remain.” A separate case to grant Northern Ireland the right to be exempt from Brexit was taken by a cross-party group of Stormont assembly members, including Sinn Fein’s former regional education minister John O’Dowd and the former justice minister David Ford. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the court’s judgment, which agrees with us that the government can proceed to trigger article 50 as planned. “As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn’t change this. We will now await the outcome of the parallel cases under consideration by the England and Wales high court before setting out our next steps.” The Ulster Unionist party said the judgment in Belfast meant that “the days of Brexiteers and remainers are over”. Stephen Aiken, an Ulster Unionist member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said: “Whether people like it or not, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. “What the people now need is a united front, battling for the best deal possible for Northern Ireland. We would appeal for everyone’s energy to now be dedicated to that cause.”"

A 34-year-old woman, two 18-year-old men and a 17-year-old boy are in police custody after a man was knifed in the Southsea area of the city on Thursday evening. The 28-year-old victim was treated by paramedics at the scene following the altercation in Sedgley Close at about 8.30pm. He was taken to Queen Alexandra hospital and treated for his injuries, which were not life-threatening, and has since been discharged. Witnesses say the stabbing followed a row involving a girl wearing a clown mask who had been returning with her family from a Halloween party at a local community centre. A local resident reported hearing a woman screaming the young girl’s name after the man apparently lashed out at the youngster. It is claimed the mother fled with her children before returning with two men, who allegedly stabbed the victim. DI Linda Howard of Hampshire constabulary said: “It has been reported in the media that this incident was sparked by an earlier altercation involving a child wearing a clown mask. This is one of the lines of inquiry being followed. But at this time we would ask people not to speculate further and instead contact the investigation team if you have any information about what happened.” A series of incidents in which people wearing clown masks have frightened children have been reported to police in the UK following a scary clown craze that has been sweeping the US.

2016-10-28T13:49:05Z,uk-news,UK news,BA owner 'doubts' Heathrow can build runway within budget,"The boss of British Airways’ parent company has said he has no confidence in the Heathrow management to build a third runway within budget. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, said Heathrow had been premature in celebrating government approval of the project and warned that it would be “a significant challenge” for the airport to deliver a runway while keeping charges flat, as stipulated by the government. “Do I have confidence that the current team at Heathrow can do it? No I don’t,” said Walsh
IAG, which includes the airlines Vueling, Aer Lingus and Iberia, is Heathrow’s biggest customer, operating about half of all flights at the west London airport The government said the new runway had to be “delivered without hitting passengers in the pocket”, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, wrote to the airport to confirm it expected Heathrow to keep the charges low. Walsh said Heathrow’s current plan could not be delivered without increasing charges. “Among other things, the airport will have to confirm that the [project] can be built without raising passenger charges. Can the proposal given by Heathrow to the airports commission be built and keep charges flat, no it can’t,” he said. The IAG boss added that a runway could be built by Heathrow if there was “some radical change in their [the management’s] behaviour and thinking”, but repeated: “I’m personally not confident they can do it.” Insisting that “there will be no ability for Heathrow to hike charges”, Walsh said: “It’s a significant new challenge for the airport and not one they have had to face up to in the past.“If the argument is that the third runway is positive for the UK economy we’ve got to make sure that it is for the benefit of customers and not for the shareholders.” Heathrow is owned by Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial and the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China, along with two pension funds. The airport said it intended to keep charges low. “As our biggest customer, Heathrow has been listening to IAG about the cost of the current proposal for expansion. Heathrow is determined to work with all our airline partners to deliver expansion as cost efficiently as possible – keeping landing charges low and delivering value for our passengers,” said a spokesperson. Walsh once championed a third runway but refused to be involved in the latest lobbying after the coalition government scrapped expansion plans in 2010. But, he said: “It represents an opportunity for BA as clearly its current schedule would operate better if operated over three runways and it gives BA and other airlines an opportunity for expansion which we don’t have today.” He suggested BA could maintain or increase its dominant position at the London hub because of a relaxation of rules after Brexit. While it could only have received a minority of new slots under EU rules, Walsh said that by the time a runway was built, “slot allocation rules will have to be determined” and government “will have more flexibility”. Walsh said air fares could rise in near future because of the effect the Brexit vote had on the value of the pound. “Consumers are looking at price increases. Ticket prices have been declining and will continue into Q4 [the rest of 2016]. But in time if sterling continues to be weak, you are looking at increases in fares,” he said. The drop in sterling contributed to a 3.6% decline in profits for IAG in its last quarter, which covers the most lucrative summer season. In the months to September, operating profits dropped to €1.2bn (£1.1bn), as revenues fell 4% to €6.5bn. €162m of that was directly attributed to the currency fall for IAG, whose revenues mainly accrue through pounds spent on BA fares. Although the short-term impact of the EU referendum was a dent to profits, he said: “Longer-term a weaker pound will mean the BA cost base is better. Our principal competition is US carriers on the transatlantic routes and we’ll have a lower cost base. It’s swings and roundabouts.” An uncertain operating environment, terror attacks and air control strikes were also blamed by IAG as it downgraded its 2016 profit forecast once again, this time to €2.5bn, a figure that would still represent year-on-year growth of between 7% and 8%."
2016-10-28T14:20:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Police to question father of two children who died in Birmingham fire,"The father of two children who died in a suspected arson attack at a house in Birmingham will be questioned about the blaze. The siblings died after the fire broke out in the early hours of Friday. The eight-year-old boy and six-year-old girl were taken to hospital but were subsequently pronounced dead. Their mother was also taken to hospital with minor injuries. The children’s father is expected to be questioned but is in a critical condition in hospital. Witnesses said neighbours helped to carry the two children out of the house and on to the front garden. Brian Ball, 66, told the Birmingham Mail he was woken in the early hours. ”About 4.30am, the place was totally packed with police and the fire brigade,” he said. “I saw two firemen put up a ladder at the bottom window, there was a fire hose at the back. It was a hive of police activity. The roads were cut off.” Following the deaths of the children, police began a criminal investigation and have linked it to a car blaze in Staffordshire. The children’s father was found with serious burns in a black Vauxhall Insignia in Newcastle-under-Lyme hours after the house fire. The man in his 30s had suffered life-threatening injuries when he was found by police. Officers were called to the scene on Whitmore Road in the Butterton area of Newcastle-under-Lyme at about 7.15am on Friday. Police said the father was connected to the events at the property in Holland Road in Hamstead, Birmingham, in the early hours. Firefighters were first on the scene and extinguished a fire in the hallway of the house at about 3.40am. Neighbours tried to save the children and had started emergency resuscitation when ambulance crews arrived and took over. Treatment continued en route to hospital with the boy being taken to Sandwell hospital and the girl to Birmingham children’s hospital. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: “Unfortunately, shortly after their arrival at the hospitals, it became clear that nothing could be done to save either child and they were confirmed deceased.” Their mother, 36, is being treated as a witness and is being supported by specially trained officers. On Friday morning, bouquets had been placed on one side of the police cordon. DCI Martin Slevin, from West Midlands police, said: “This is an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected. We are still at the early stages of understanding exactly what happened and why – but I can confirm we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation. “I am still keen to hear from anyone who was in the area in the early hours of this morning and who has not yet spoken to us. I also want to urge anyone who saw a Vauxhall Insignia in or around the area this morning to contact my team.”"
2016-10-29T00:48:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Exeter blaze destroys hotel said to be oldest in England,"A hotel that lays a claim to be England’s oldest has been destroyed in a huge fire in Exeter, firefighters have said. More than 100 emergency workers battled unsuccessfully to save the timber-framed Royal Clarence after a blaze started in a nearby building. The flames also claimed other buildings in the centre of the city, despite firefighters working all day to contain them. “Crews will be at the scene overnight and into tomorrow [Saturday] trying to stop the fire spreading to other historic buildings. The Clarence has been completely destroyed,” a spokesman for Devon and Somerset fire service said late on Friday night. About 120 firefighters were called to the scene to try to stop the blaze, which started early on Friday morning. Reserve firefighters were among those mobilised to operate the 27 regular pumps and a high-volume pump, with four aerial ladder platforms also deployed.
Earlier on Friday a fire brigade spokesman said the fire had started in the art gallery Exeter Gallery, opposite the cathedral. “That has [also] been completely destroyed,”he said, adding that it spread to the Clarence from there. The local historian Dr Todd Gray said the hotel was “in the heart of what was not just the medieval city, but within the precincts of Roman Exeter”. He said: “For 2,000 years this area has been the focus of the city’s religious and commercial life.” The ground and first floors of the hotel were medieval and the upper floors were added in the late 1700s when the building was renamed a hotel. Gray told the BBC that the Clarence was “the building where they first declared themselves as a hotel. Before that happened [in the 1770s] we had inns, but they took the new French word and applied it to their building … this was the place to stay”. He added: “What is so particularly heartbreaking about this loss is that these buildings escaped the blitz of 1942 when so much of Exeter was destroyed.” The hotel was built in 1769 as the Assembly Rooms and renamed the Royal Clarence in 1827 after a visit by Adelaide, Duchess of Clarence. The duchess was queen consort of King William IV – the monarch succeeded on the British throne by Queen Victoria in 1837. Earlier in the day firefighters said: “Because of the complex structure of the old buildings here we haven’t been able to put firefighters on the inside, so we’re fighting it from the outside. “We’ve got the aerial ladder platforms so we are pouring water on top of it. We are trying to contain it but there are signs now of damage to the bedroom floors of the hotel.” Efforts to fight the fire were consuming much of Exeter’s water supply. South West Water told customers in the city centre it had been forced to make alterations to its mains network to support the fire service. “As a result some customers in the city centre, and potentially in the Wonford area, may experience low pressure or discolouration of their water supply,” the company said in a statement. “The Royal Devon and Exeter and Nuffield hospitals will not be affected.” The fire began just after 5am. By Friday afternoon large crowds had gathered at police cordons surrounding Cathedral Green, the fire service spokesman said. “There is a large amount of smoke coming off the building,” he said. “It’s right in the centre of Exeter so it’s getting a lot of attention from people watching what’s happening.” Concealed voids and passageways within burning buildings, as well as their timber construction made the fire difficult to deal with, he said. There were thought to be no injuries and everyone believed to have been in the buildings had been accounted for, according to Devon and Cornwall police. The cause of the fire was not believed to be suspicious."
2016-10-29T06:34:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Marshalsea Mansions of Misery,"In 18th century London and the first half of the 19th, debt and its effects ate at the soul of society, as they do now. The difference was that in those days, debt was always personal. Those who owed did not fear credit card demands or banks, but people, streets and areas they knew. “It impacted on personal space,” explains distinguished London historian Jerry White. “People were moving around London all the time to avoid their creditors – moving rooms, avoiding certain streets or areas.” And failure to avoid could be disastrous: for want of as little as a few shillings, you could be thrown into a death pit of a jail. The subject of White’s new book is London’s most notorious debtors’ prison, the Marshalsea in Southwark. Mansions of Misery, his biography of the institution, which stood on two different sites on what is now Borough High Street, begins by describing London’s vast landscape of debt and its ubiquity in everyday life. Fearful debtors were everywhere. So were places for locking them up – London had more jails than any other city in Europe. Those dodging incarceration up could take refuge in The Mint, an area near the Marshalsea, which enjoyed an anomalous legal status protecting them from arrest. The Mint took its name from a coin-making facility founded by Henry VIII. That irony may have seemed the more crushing given that the debt problem was worsened by an undersupply of ready cash. “There was a shortage of copper coin and silver throughout all of the 18th century, particularly at the beginning,” says White. “So bills tended to accumulate. If you were very poor, a bill of two shillings and sixpence, if you didn’t have the coppers to pay it, could become a big amount to find.” The Marshalsea, originally located by the present-day Mermaid Court, began as holding cells for the ancient Marshalsea Court, narrowly avoided being razed by the Great Fire of Southwark in 1676 and in 1727 was leased to one of its former turnkeys, William Acton, a local butcher who, until he was removed in 1730, ran it as a cruel and extortionate private enterprise. By that time, debtors, both women and men, formed the core clientele. In the Marshalsea, they ran up more debts, as they failed to pay their rent or lawyers’ fees. Prisoners were fleeced, starved and tortured with instruments of medieval vintage. There was, though, a physical class divide between those on “the common side” of the jail, who were crammed like sardines in filth, and those on the master’s side, whose existence was privileged by comparison. White devotes a chapter to the extraordinary prison diary of successful musician John Baptist Grano, a chancer and social climber who was detained at the Marhsalsea for 16 months. He wrote his journal every day, paying particular attention to the meals he ate, some of them lavish, while others starved to death next door – 300 of them in the space of three months in 1729. “Today, we’d call Grano a foodie,” White says. Grano had deals with Acton, which enabled him to give lessons and even leave the jail to visit bars and to perform. He got his own room, a derelict one he had done up by other prisoners - debtor craftsmen who sold him their skills as part of jail’s often desperate internal economy. “Grano had money, he just wouldn’t pay people,” White says. But his prison life was not all roasts and songs. There were rows and vendettas against him. He was a closet Roman Catholic. He lived in fear of banishment to the common side. White documents the Marshalsea being run by dual power structures: the official one and that devised by the prisoners. The latter was so established and overt that when inmates were marched down the road to the new Marshalsea on Christmas Eve 1811, they carried a rulebook with them. Prisoners called the jail a college. The rulebook was redrafted by a lawyer collegian and is now lodged in the national archives. Discipline was enforced by an executive committee. Offences including soiling toilet seats, urinating in the wrong parts of the outdoor area, stealing and violence, though committee sanctions could be violent too. One chair of the executive was the new Marhshalsea’s most famous prisoner, John Dickens, father of Charles, whose writings, notably Little Dorrit, are infused with sober insights gained from the incarceration of his dad. Dickens Snr was sent down thanks to the legal action of a Camden baker, to whom he owed £40. Still receiving his full salary from the Royal Navy Pay Office, he could have coughed up and been released, but, as White writes, this would have “put him at the mercy of a pack of others, eager for a bite at his person”. He got out thanks to the 1824 Insolvent Debtors Act. This basically enabled all his creditors to cut their losses by accepting a portion of his total assets. There are many other remarkable characters in White’s book. In 1840, optician Joshua Reeve Lowe seized and disarmed a would-be assassin of Queen Victoria. A year and a half later, he entered the Marshalsea having mistakenly believed his heroism would endear him to a more upmarket clientele. In 1742, Irish writer Laetitia Pilkington was arrested in Duke Street for owing her landlady rent, called a “Papist bitch” by the bailiffs who came for her, and was soon rehoused in what was named “the worst prison in England”. Prizefighter Bishop “The Bishop” Sharpe’s descent from glory took him there after his failure to adjust to a more mundane way of life after losing a 90-minute, 91-round bout to Alec Reid, the “Chelsea Snob”, in 1828. It is primarily through the stories of the prisoners that White skilfully and meticulously recounts the prison’s history. In doing so he shines a wider light on London in those times. “The debtor’s prison overshadowed the lives of working people and the middle classes in London,” he says. “What I think is so interesting is that the whole regime of capitalism thought it needed this draconian measure of arrest and imprisonment, sometimes for a long time, as a way of disciplining the whole world of credit. They thought that without it, the whole system of credit, trust and borrowing would collapse, and with it the value of money and trade.” Jailed debtors were casualties of those anxieties. All paid a heavy price, many of the poorest with their lives. Jerry White’s Mansions of Misery is published by The Bodley Head, price £20. A surviving wall of the “new” Marshalsea prison stands in Angel Place, SE1."
2016-10-29T07:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,The great Britain I love has fallen apart – it's an ex-parrot,"I love Great Britain. I’ve always loved it: the mysteries by PD James, the pop songs by Oasis and Pulp, the comedy of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. But the Great Britain I love seems to have fallen apart. Much like Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue, it has ceased to be. The founding nation of the Commonwealth with its multinational population has closed its gates to immigrants and will be the first country to leave the European Union. But before it does, I have come to the UK – thanks to the George Weidenfeld Bursary, an international journalists’ exchange scheme – to watch the British stumble their way out of the EU from close up, and to witness this big experiment. My idyllic view of the UK might be shared by many Germans – how else do you explain the disappointment with which leading German politicians, as well as citizens, reacted to the outcome of the referendum? The day after the result was announced, the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, sounding like a betrayed husband, said that London should put the vote to leave into practice as soon as possible. The national newspaper I work for, Die Tageszeitung, published spontaneous readers’ reactions such as: “Fuck you very much!”
In the aftermath of the vote, some predicted that Great Britain would become Little Britain, with Scotland and Northern Ireland declaring independence as soon as No 10 triggered article 50 of the EU constitution and formally applied to leave. But it’s not that clear cut. Scotland won’t hold a referendum immediately and a court ruling in Belfast rejected a bid to challenge the legality of Brexit. So it would seem the process of leaving the EU is more complicated than imagined and that there is more than one way out. And although the prime minister, Theresa May, said Brexit means Brexit, we’re beginning to see that Brexit might be a movable feast. It’s not only in Great Britain that rightwing and Eurosceptic forces have become substantially stronger. There is a possibility that they might take control in other countries as well: the Front National in France, with Marine Le Pen running for president, has always praised the nation state and complained about mass immigration, as well as the Dutch Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders, who said this week on Breitbart News: “Britain is the Brexit pioneer and others will follow.” Polls show that Le Pen will make it into the final round of the presidential election in May. Wilders’s party is the second biggest , according to October polls (released by the research agency Kantar TNS). The Netherlands will elect a new government in March.
In Germany, the party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which was founded initially as a Eurosceptic party, now turns out to be a nationalist and anti-muslim party. It has made it into every federal parliament elected since 2013, with well over 20% in two recent eastern German state elections and 14% in Berlin. Great Britain could set a precedent with Brexit: the beginning of the end of the European Union. During my seven weeks here to study the UK, I am hoping it will help me to understand what’s going on in other European countries and what they might face. What are the concerns of UK citizens, and how do they assess the future? And as a German I’m interested in how the German community in the UK – there are around 300,000 German-born residents living and working here – feels about its situation. Is there a new “German angst” arising about becoming aliens in the UK? There are Germans living in Britain who told me they were seriously thinking about going back to Germany and starting to look for jobs there. “The atmosphere has changed,” they say. “We are now more often reminded of the fact that we are foreigners.” They are worried about the future of their children, who maybe won’t feel free to speak their mother tongue in public any more.
Germans in the UK are one of the biggest minorities. Among the teaching staff in British universities are 5,250 academics from Germany – the largest group of foreigners teaching and researching in the UK. Every tenth student enrolled in British universities has a German passport. German manufacturers contribute substantially to the UK economy, says the German-British Chamber of Commerce. Will companies like Siemens, BMW and Deutsche Bahn Schenker, who have large subsidiaries all over the UK, pull back if the country is no longer a member of the European single market? Or will they stay whatever it costs? What do the British think about all this? Are some of those who voted to leave getting cold feet? And who are the British? The result of the referendum showed that the country is heavily polarised. What kind of Brexit do people want? Does it differ for those in Birmingham to those in Edinburgh? Or Liverpool and Belfast? There is a lot for me to look at, and much I want to explore. Feel free to send me your thoughts on what might be interesting aspects to look at from an outsider’s viewpoint at anna.lehmann@guardian.co.uk. The UK I marvelled at with my continental view might never have existed outside those pop songs and literature, but there is another one to explore, and who knows? I might yet fall in love with it again."
2016-10-29T07:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Kindertransport hero’s daughter urges UK to welcome Calais refugees,"The daughter of the British humanitarian who organised the Czech Kindertransport operation that saved 669 children on the eve of the second world war has written to the home secretary to urge that Britain extend the same “compassion and warmth” to the child refugees of Calais. In an open letter to Amber Rudd, Barbara Winton, whose father became known as “the British Oskar Schindler”, writes: “My father, Nicholas Winton, witnessed the appalling conditions children were enduring in the refugee camps in Czechoslovakia in 1939 and was determined to give them the chance of a better, safer life by bringing them to Britain.” While many children returned to Czechoslovakia after the war, others, whose families had been murdered by the Nazis, remained in Britain and “became valuable, integrated citizens”, she says.
It is estimated there are 6,000 people across the world alive today thanks to the rescue. She wrote: “Despite some disgruntled voices, much like today, protesting the dangers of allowing into our country those from such foreign cultures, the overwhelming response was one of compassion and warmth … Even at a time when city evacuations were being planned for British children, homes were found for these vulnerable young refugees.” Now Winton is calling on the government to do the same for hundreds of unaccompanied child refugees stranded in Calais after the demolition of the makeshift camp. In a letter published on the charity Help Refugees website, she said: “Those who have travelled across Europe to Calais, to escape the life-threatening dangers of their home country, are hoping desperately to find the sanctuary their parents dared to believe Britain would once again offer.”
The story of what Nicholas Winton achieved did not become public until 40 years after the event, and in 2003 he was knighted for “services to humanity in saving Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia”. Two women, now in their 80s, who were among those rescued from the Nazis by Winton’s initiative, have also written to the government urging that the children stranded in Calais be brought to the UK. Eve Leadbeater, 85, was brought to Britain in July 1939 as an unaccompanied minor and taken in by a primary schoolteacher who had responded to an appeal put out by Winton. She wrote: “In the last few months I have been putting myself in the place of those unaccompanied children in Calais fleeing their own horrors; the contrast with my own experience has left me distressed and in tears.” She said the increased animosity toward immigrants since the referendum has left her in shock: “In 2016 do we live in the same country that welcomed me in 1939?“I keep thinking what those children could contribute to the UK. As an honest, hard-working British citizen since 1945, I hope I have repaid some of my debt to this country by teaching children in secondary schools and working as a charity volunteer in my retirement.” Another Kindertransport child, Dr Lisa Midwinter, said she would have perished in the Auschwitz concentration camp with the rest of her family had it not been for the “generosity of the British government”. In a separate letter she wrote that “we must now urgently help the Calais refugee children”. Between 1938 and 1939, a large-scale British humanitarian operation brought 10,000 mostly Jewish children fleeing Hitler’s growing threat from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to safe homes in the UK."
2016-10-29T12:06:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Exeter fire: little of historic Royal Clarence Hotel remains,"Little more than the facade of a hotel in Exeter thought to be the oldest in England remains following a huge fire that continues to burn more than 24 hours after it broke out. Engineers have now turned off a ruptured gas main that had fuelled the blaze, which began early on Friday morning. Joe Hassell of Devon & Somerset fire and rescue said on Saturday afternoon that the fire opposite Exeter cathedral in the centre of the city did not appear to be spreading. It has gutted the historic Royal Clarence Hotel and ravaged a number of neighbouring historic buildings.
Firefighters have been on the scene at Cathedral Yard since 5am on Friday. At its height, there were 150 firefighters at the scene and four aerial ladder platforms were being used to pump water from the river Exe on to the blaze. Fire initially broke out above the Castle Fine Art gallery, where renovation work was under way, before spreading to the Well House Tavern, a cafe and the Royal Clarence Hotel. The fire service said the gallery and hotel had been destroyed by the fire. Crews were unable to enter the hotel because it was too unstable and were instead using aerial ladder platforms to tackle the remaining pockets of fire, he added. They are expected to remain on the scene until Sunday. Chief fire officer Lee Howell said: â€œWeâ€™re grateful no one has been hurt in this incident but the community has lost a historic building, which is a landmark of the city. The fire spread was compounded by the nature of these ancient buildings and their construction with common roof voids, which allowed the fire to spread unseen from the origin of the fire.
â€œWe kept significant resources at the scene to ensure we were able to deal with every eventuality and we will continue to do everything we can to protect the heritage of this city.â€� Twenty fresh fire engines were needed to relieve crews working overnight, the fire service said. At one point, all personnel were forced to retreat from the fire over fears of a collapse. Stephen Pitman, south-west England area engineering manager for Wales & West Utilities, said switching off the gas supply to the burning buildings was proving to be difficult. Engineers had been on the scene since Friday afternoon.
â€œThe fire has damaged gas service pipes supplying the affected properties. Our engineers are working to turn the gas supplies to those properties off,â€� Pitman said. â€œThis is a complex job due to the severity of the fire and the condition of the affected buildings. Our engineers have worked through the night and we will continue to support the fire and rescue service as required until the fire is out,â€� he said.
Local historian Todd Gray said the hotel was â€œin the heart of what was not just the medieval city, but within the precincts of Roman Exeterâ€�. He said: â€œFor 2,000 years this area has been the focus of the cityâ€™s religious and commercial life.â€� The ground and first floors of the hotel were medieval and the upper floors were added in the late 1700s, when the building was renamed a hotel. Gray told the BBC that the Clarence was â€œthe building where they first declared themselves as a hotel. Before that happened [in the 1770s] we had inns, but they took the new French word and applied it to their building â€¦ this was the place to stay.â€� He added: â€œWhat is so particularly heartbreaking about this loss is that these buildings escaped the Blitz of 1942 when so much of Exeter was destroyed.â€� Efforts to fight the fire were consuming much of Exeterâ€™s water supply.

The cause of the fire was not believed to be suspicious."
2016-10-29T12:50:47Z,uk-news,UK news,"Home Office requested schools census data on nearly 2,500 children","Home Office officials requested information from the national pupil database on nearly 2,500 children for immigration enforcement over 15 months, it has emerged. Peers are expected to challenge the collection, undertaken for the first time this year as part of the schools census, in a Lords debate on Monday, after Liberal Democrat education spokesman Michael Storey tabled a motion of regret over the policy. Human rights groups have urged parents to boycott the questions, amid fears that they would turn teachers into de facto border guards. Answers were not compulsory, but it emerged that schools had been misinterpreting the guidance by demanding pupils’ passport numbers and specifically targeting non-white children.
The latest revelation on the scale of NPD data requests made by the Home Office, which has previously admitted it used the information for immigration enforcement, came in response to a question from Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, told Lucas the Home Office requested NPD data on 25 occasions between July 2015 and September 2016, two of which were later withdrawn. “During this 15-month period, requests relating to a total of 2,462 individuals have been made by the Home Office to DfE and 520 records have been identified within DfE data and returned to the Home Office,” Gibb said. The DfE was not immediately able to clarify how many individuals were identified in each record. The portion of Gibb’s answer that related to police requests was clearer on the point: data on 21 pupils had been shared with forces after 31 access requests, he said. A DfE spokesperson later said: ”Without evidence and data, we cannot have a clear picture of how the school system is working. We take privacy extremely seriously and access to sensitive data is strictly controlled.” Officials have been at pains to stress that the nationality and country of birth data would not be shared with the Home Office, insisting that an interdepartmental agreement explicitly forbade it. However, the DfE has so far refused to reveal details of the agreement. In a bid to address privacy concerns, the school system minister, John Nash, said in a letter to peers, seen by Schools Week, the new data would be held separately from the national pupil database, and claimed this would prevent other departments from accessing it. But Jen Persson, of defenddigitalme, who has campaigned strongly for an end to the collection, said the move did not constitute a victory for campaigners. “Lord Nash only rightly confirms the fact that the database is not safe for the intensely sensitive data they already hold on 20 million people,” she said. “The DfE have already given and continue to give out children’s home address collected in school census data. The Home Office has asked for nearly 2,500 people’s data since July 2015 alone. “What else is it used for that we don’t yet know? It doesn’t matter what the DfE call where they store it; it’s what they do with it that matters and what they are doing is shocking, without any intention of being publicly transparent or accountable.” Bella Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, said: “The government is starting to face a serious backlash against its poisonous ‘hostile environment’ policies. First ministers had to pull their misguided plans for foreign worker lists – now their creation of a foreign national children list could be thwarted too. “In recent months we have seen migrant communities vilified and treated as bargaining chips. Instead of sowing yet more division and mistrust, we urge the Lords to uphold the safety and dignity of children and send a message to government that this divisive and unnecessary policy must scrapped.”"
2016-10-29T16:06:35Z,uk-news,UK news,CCTV image released as police put squeeze on accordion thieves,"A family-run music shop has been targeted by thieves, who stole 40 Italian-made accordions worth £130,000 in what police believe was a planned raid. The Accordion Shop in Sunningdale, Berkshire, is one of a handful of dedicated accordion shops in the UK. On the night of 7 August, a gang broke into the store and made off with about a third of the business’s stock. The thieves deliberately selected high-end, Italian-made accordions, ignoring all the cheaper instruments made by less well-known producers. The looted accordions were worth thousands of pounds each, with one, an Exclesior, retailing for £6,995. Bev Lovell, whose grandfather founded the shop in 1927, believes the raid was planned and carried out by criminals intent on selling the highly prized items on the black market in mainland Europe, where the instrument is more widely played than in the UK. “They left all the cheaper accordions here,” he said. “They knew what they were doing.” Lovell said that Italian-made instruments were particularly sought after in eastern and southern Europe, where the instrument remains popular with folk musicians and is still taught in schools. “In this country, accordions aren’t recognised as a musical instrument in schools, but in mainland Europe, they are. The demand for these items will certainly be higher in those countries.” Within the industry, Italian-made accordions were regarded as the best. “Bear in mind that at one stage, accordions were Italy’s biggest export,” Lovell said. Lovell has not been contacted by Thames Valley police investigating the case since the raid in August, but officers have now released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the robbery. Investigating officer PC Andrew Corbett said: “I am appealing for the man pictured in these images, or anyone who knows him, to please contact Thames Valley police immediately as we believe he might have vital information about the burglary. “We believe the man might have links to Port Talbot, so I would encourage communities in that area of south Wales to share our appeal and these pictures. If you know this man or have any other information about this burglary, please call 101 and ask for Thames Valley police, quoting reference number 43160218225.” Although Lovell believes the instruments were shipped out of the country soon after the crime, he is urging accordion players to be on the lookout for suspicious sellers on the black market. He has uploaded a list of the items stolen to the shop’s website in the hope that someone might spot one of the valuable items."
2016-10-29T18:14:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Former IRA informer found dead at his home in England,"An IRA informer who spied for the British at the height of the Troubles has been found dead in his flat in England after living for 30 years under a fake identity. Supergrass Raymond Gilmour’s badly decomposed body was found by his 18-year-old son on Friday. Police are not treating the death of the 57-year-old as suspicious. Originally from Derry, Gilmour was recruited by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1976 to inform from within the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a republican paramilitary group. In 1980 he moved into the ranks of the IRA and started feeding information to British intelligence services. His cover was blown in 1982 when police used information he supplied to recover a machine gun. Two years later, Gilmour became the focal point of one of the so-called “show trials” of the early 1980s in Northern Ireland. The series of high-profile, large-scale trials saw dozens of suspected terrorists charged and tried based on evidence from individual spies known as “supergrasses”. At the time, there was widespread belief within republican communities that the trials were based on evidence from witnesses who had been offered deals and cash incentives by the British to spur them into spying. In 1984 Gilmour was the only witness in a trial of 31 suspected republican terrorists – a trial that became notorious when the then lord chief justice dismissed the informer’s evidence as “unworthy of belief”. Once his evidence was deemed useless, Gilmour fled Northern Ireland, and was given a new life and identity in England by his handlers, MI5. Gilmour is believed to have suffered from alcoholism and battled mental health problems in the years prior to his death. One of his friends and a fellow spy, Martin McGartland, has slammed MI5’s handling of Gilmour. Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, he said: “It is disgraceful that Ray died in these circumstances. He spent years begging MI5 for financial and psychological help. Instead they turned their backs on him. He was a broken man, a wreck of a human being, and they left him to die in the gutter.”"
2016-10-29T22:54:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Orgreave families: we want full, Hillsborough-style inquiry","People from former mining areas may never trust the police again unless the home secretary, Amber Rudd, announces a full Hillsborough-style investigation into allegations of police brutality at Orgreave in 1984, one of those caught up in the violence has warned.
Writing in the Observer, former miner Kevin Horne describes how he was arrested on 18 June 1984, along with other men “bleeding from broken limbs, cracked skulls and [others] bandaging their own wounds with T-shirts”. Even after charges against him were dropped, Horne says the damage endured. “My family became infected with what I have called a disease – a distrust of the police that spans generations. But this week, the government has the opportunity to turn the page on these years.” Rudd is expected to lay out her plans for an inquiry, to be led by a single judge, into one of the most notorious events in the miners’ strike, when about 6,000 police clashed with pickets in the South Yorkshire coalfield. A total of 95 miners were charged following the confrontation at the plant south of Rotherham. Evidence later emerged that South Yorkshire police deliberately fabricated evidence and exaggerated the cases against the pickets. The so-called Battle of Orgreave became a defining moment in the miners’ strike and in the arguments that raged between those in mining communities who were fighting for their livelihoods and the authorities working for the Thatcher government. Demands for a wide-ranging investigation have grown since officers in the same South Yorkshire force of the 1980s were left discredited earlier this year by the inquests into the people who died in the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, which followed a 27-year fight by the families for justice. Now those seeking justice over Orgreave, who are backed by many Hillsborough campaigners, fear Rudd will merely announce a limited inquiry of the kind led by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that was first established into the deaths of the 96 Liverpool fans a decade after the event. That inquiry failed to establish the truth about police behaviour and culpability and would be “completely unacceptable”, say the campaigners. Horne says: “Former miners and our families fear that an inquiry sitting behind closed doors, led by a single establishment figure, will not get to the truth. If she chooses a scaled-down approach, the home secretary will make the same mistake that left the Hillsborough families fighting for an extra decade.” Barbara Jackson, secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said that what was needed was a full investigation involving an independent panel of experts who could look at all the evidence, similar to that set up in 2012, following years of pressure into the Hillsborough disaster. “We trust that Amber Rudd will announce the only right decision, namely that there must be an inquiry into what happened at Orgreave and after it. These events are too serious to let them lie. However, we have real concerns about what sort of inquiry the home secretary will establish: history is littered with examples of inquiries that have disappointed, such as the ‘establishment-led’ Stuart-Smith scrutiny into Hillsborough, which completely failed to get to the truth. “We are keen to ensure that the home secretary does not make similar mistakes over Orgreave.” Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said the fight for an appropriate inquiry would go on if Rudd announced a scaled-down investigation. “There are suggestions that the home secretary will offer the Orgreave campaigners a judicial inquiry similar to the one set up in 1998 into the disaster at Hillsborough. This, in our view, would be completely unacceptable as history shows in our case it only served to lengthen the cover-up.” Former Labour cabinet minister Andy Burnham played a leading role in forging the 2012 Hillsborough investigation, setting in train events that led to the inquest verdicts of accidental death being overturned in favour of a judgment that the 96 Liverpool fans were “unlawfully killed”. He said: “I have nothing but praise for the way Theresa May handled Hillsborough, but all politicians must be prepared to go wherever the evidence trail takes us. After Hillsborough, that trail led very directly to Orgreave. “The case for an inquiry is overwhelming and undeniable. In recent weeks, new evidence has emerged about excessive violence on the day itself and mass manufacture of police statements. Unless these allegations are properly investigated, it will damage trust in the government and the police. “Theresa May came to office promising to heal divides and she must now show that those words have real meaning.”"
2016-10-29T23:24:00Z,uk-news,UK news,UK court to hear appeal about civil partnerships for straight couples,"A couple who have been living together for the past six years will this week demand the right to a civil partnership, arguing that they face discrimination under the present law, which gives gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership but denies the latter to heterosexual couples. Earlier this year the high court ruled against a legal challenge to the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan. On Wednesday their appeal against that ruling will be heard in the high court, with judgment expected to be reserved. The couple say they are prepared to take their case to the supreme court and the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. “A civil partnership would reflect who we are,” Keidan told the Observer. “It’s a modern social contract that doesn’t have the associations of marriage but would give the protection that we and other cohabiting couples crave.” The act states that civil partnerships that provide legal rights and obligations to couples regarding children, property and pensions would be available to “two people of the same sex”. It was passed in 2004 in response to demands from gay rights campaigners for legal recognition for unions between same-sex couples. Then in 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised, giving gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership. The latter continues to be denied to heterosexual couples. There are almost three million opposite sex couples living together in the UK, and almost four in 10 have dependent children, according to the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign. Although many people believe that people in “common law marriages” have rights over children and property protection, there is no such provision in law. “The fastest growing families in the UK are people who choose not to get married,” said Keidan, who has a 17-month-old daughter, Eden, with Steinfeld. “It would be a really straightforward thing for the government to extend civil partnerships to couples like us.” Steinfeld added: “For many people, marriage is a very meaningful way to express their love. But there are also many reasons why people don’t want to get married. It’s not for the government to dictate, but to ensure that couples are legally protected.” The couple have made wills, but will not have automatic rights to pensions or couples’ inheritance tax allowances. Their legal battle has been funded by their own savings, donations from philanthropic organisations and crowdfunding which raised £35,000. They are being represented in the court of appeal by lawyers acting on a pro bono basis. At the high court hearing in January, the government argued that changing legislation would be “costly and complex”, and that following same-sex marriage legislation, civil partnerships may be phased out or abolished in the future. Following the ruling, a government spokesperson said that the “current regime of marriage and civil partnership does not disadvantage opposite sex couples”. Steinfeld said it was untenable for the government to maintain the “unfair status quo”. The arguments regarding costs were shortsighted, she added. “The costs of changing the law pale into insignificance compared to the costs of dealing with the consequences of relationship breakdown where there is no legal protection.” She and Keidan said there was growing support for a change in the law. More than 70,000 people have signed an online petition, and Conservative MP Tim Loughton has introduced a private member’s bill in parliament. The only place in the British Isles where civil partnerships are available to different sex couples is the Isle of Man. After homosexuality was decriminalised on the island in the 1990s, a new law came into force earlier this year permitting marriage and civil partnerships to all couples. Adeline Cosson and Kieran Hodgson became the first opposite-sex couple in the UK to enter into a civil partnership earlier this month, swiftly followed by Claire Beale and Martin Loat, who travelled from London for their ceremony. The Isle of Man is a crown dependency, but not part of the UK.After the new law was passed, Peter Tatchell, a campaigner for marriage equality, said: “Their new legislation is even more progressive than the UK. Instead of segregated marriage laws for gay and straight couples, they have a single civil marriage law that applies to everyone regardless of sexual orientation. “The Isle of Man has also opened up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples; in contrast to the ban that exists in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These changes catapult the Isle of Man to the forefront of legal equality for straight and gay couples.”"
2016-10-30T06:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Secret government papers show taxpayers will pick up costs of Hinkley nuclear waste storage,"Taxpayers will pick up the bill should the cost of storing radioactive waste produced by Britain’s newest nuclear power station soar, according to confidential documents which the government has battled to keep secret for more than a year. The papers confirm the steps the government took to reassure French energy firm EDF and Chinese investors behind the £24bn Hinkley Point C plant that the amount they would have to pay for the storage would be capped. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy – in its previous incarnation as the Department for Energy and Climate Change – resisted repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the release of the documents which were submitted to the European commission. “The government has attempted to keep the costs to the taxpayer of Hinkley under wraps from the start,” said Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace chief scientist. “It’s hardly surprising as it doesn’t look good for the government’s claim that they are trying to keep costs down for hardworking families.”
But, earlier this month, on the very last day before government officials had to submit their defence against an appeal for disclosure of the information, the department released a “Nuclear Waste Transfer Pricing Methodology Notification Paper”. Marked “commercial in confidence”, it states that “unlimited exposure to risks relating to the costs of disposing of their waste in a GDF [geological disposal facility], could not be accepted by the operator as they would prevent the operator from securing the finance necessary to undertake the project”. Instead the document explains that there will be a “cap on the liability of the operator of the nuclear power station which would apply in a worst-case scenario”. It adds: “The UK government accepts that, in setting a cap, the residual risk, of the very worst-case scenarios where actual cost might exceed the cap, is being borne by the government.” Separate documents confirm that the cap also applies should the cost of decommissioning the reactor at the end of its life balloon.
The level of the cap is unclear. But Dr David Lowry, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who made the FoI request, said it was clear that the risk of footing the bill for a significant cost overrun had been transferred from Hinkley’s operator to the taxpayer. “This shows that the government cares more about the economic future of a foreign power generator than British taxpayers,” Lowry said. In return for the cap, the document reveals that Hinkley’s operator will pay the government a risk fee which “is expected to be relatively low, reflecting the high level of confidence that the cap will not be breached”. But Lowry pointed out that the nuclear industry had form when it came to sizable cost over-runs. He warned that an accident that could force the closure of the reactor, either because of problems with it or at another plant, as happened in Japan, would leave the taxpayer having to pay billions of pounds for the clear-up years after it ceased generating revenues. A government spokesman said: “All operators of new nuclear power stations in the UK are legally obliged to meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs. They will also pay the UK government to dispose of the waste produced at the end of a plant’s life.”"
2016-10-30T16:46:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunderland looks to city of culture bid to reunite after Brexit vote,"The result of the EU referendum has galvanised remain voters in Sunderland around a bid to secure city of culture status in 2021, its campaign chief has said, heralding an opportunity to unite “disconnected and isolated” communities after the vote for Brexit. Rebecca Ball, the director of Sunderland’s city of culture 2021 bid, said it was determined to correct the “one-sided” portrayal of Wearside as a “lost city” after the EU referendum on 23 June. She said: “It feels like Brexit has made the 2021 bid more urgent. Brexit has galvanised us even more because it feels like there’s more of a need to spend that investment, bring people together and change the profile of the city.” A resounding 61.3% of Sunderland’s voters chose to leave the European Union despite the possibility that tens of thousands of jobs would be at risk if Nissan, the north-east’s biggest private sector employer, abandoned its highly efficient plant in the city. Last week, Nissan, which employs 6,000 people at its Washington plant and supports 27,000 more jobs in the local supply chain, pledged to stay in the UK after private assurances from the business secretary, Greg Clark. Politicians and business leaders have been privately considering ways to bring the city together following the vote, including stepping up the city of culture bid that officially launched in September last year. A city-wide survey by campaign officials found concerns among Sunderland voters about a “poverty of aspiration” among young people and that communities were “disconnected and isolated” by geography and ethnicity. It also found that people wanted to change the profile of the city. Ball, who was previously the director of an arts programme in the region, said the city had been unfairly portrayed as a “lost city” in the wake of the Brexit vote. “When Brexit happened there was a sense in which the city was in the limelight. Some of the reporting was very black and white and it really depicted a one sided story of Sunderland. It was a story of a lost city,” she said. “But there’s a huge amount of energy and momentum around the city as well. You can’t allow yourself to get too disheartened – you have to get on with it. The 2021 bid wouldn’t be an empty project – it is about ambition and showing what we can achieve with some help.” Julie Elliott, the Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: “The 2021 city of culture bid gives us the opportunity to showcase everything that is great about Sunderland – our culture, community and creativity. It will bring a much-needed focus on the inventiveness of our people bringing investment and regeneration.” The winner of the prize, which was established in 2009, is usually nominated to host major cultural events including the Turner prize, Brit awards, Man Booker prize and the Stirling prize. Derry-Londonderry was the inaugural winner of the award in 2013, with Hull taking the prize the following year. The Scottish city of Perth is favourite with the bookmakers to win city of culture 2021, with odds of 3/1, ahead of Sunderland and Cardiff on 4/1. The other competing cities are Paisley, Coventry, Stoke on Trent, Milton Keynes, Hereford and Warrington."
2016-10-30T18:46:47Z,uk-news,UK news,'Creepy clown' craze: NSPCC in warning to be vigilant at Halloween,"Along with pumpkins, apple-bobbing and trick-or-treating, there are fears a more recent US import could blight this year’s Halloween festivities. As fancy-dress stores are emptied of witch and werewolf costumes, there are concerns that the troubling clown craze will continue, with people dressing up in costumes to threaten or harm passersby. The NSPCC said in the run-up to Halloween that Childline counsellors have been deluged with calls from children expressing their fears about clowns. In the last three weeks it has been contacted 462 times about scary clowns, providing 84 clown-related counselling sessions in one day alone. Almost a third of counselling sessions on the subject of clowns were with children under 11 – and three-quarters of all those who got in touch over clown fears were girls. An NSPCC spokesman said: “Wearing spooky fancy dress for Halloween is a time-honoured tradition, but we fear the recent creepy-clowns craze could see Halloween used as an opportunity to molest, intimidate or harm children.
“Creepy clowns are all trick and no treat; those dressing up with the intention of threatening children need to be aware that they could be breaking the law – particularly if they are carrying weapons.” Children trick-or-treating could be the most vulnerable. The charity advises children who feel threatened in the street or near their school to tell their parents, or another responsible adult, and report it to the police if necessary.
Some of the children who had contacted the charity had been alarmed after seeing incidents on social media where clowns had hurt people. Reports of clowns terrifying members of the public, and armed with weapons, started in the US. Some places have banned clown costumes. Plymouth’s Pubwatch said it had advised clubs and pubs across the city to be cautious about admitting anyone in a clown costume. In the past month police forces across the UK have recorded a wave of clown-related incidents, with forces warning that jokers or criminals using the costumes to deliberately scare people face arrest. A 10-year-old boy in Plymouth was threatened by a clown who jumped out of a bush carrying a hammer, while in Workington, Cumbria, a clown brandishing an axe chased an 11-year-old girl. The NSPCC urged worried children to talk to parents or teachers, to call police if they felt threatened in the street, or to contact Childline on 0800 1111 or at childline.org.uk."
2016-10-31T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Rail passengers face less than merry Christmas with travel disruptions,"Rail passengers are facing travel disruption over the Christmas period because of engineering works on lines in and out of London, Manchester and Cardiff as well as on the line for the Heathrow Express. Since Christmas falls on a Sunday this year, the travel rush is expected to be on the Thursday and Friday before. Those leaving it till the last minute will find their getaway hindered because many works will begin on Christmas Eve – including at one that affects hundreds of services in and out of London Paddington, such as the Heathrow Express. The station will close from December 24 because of work on the Crossrail link. The Heathrow Express will be completely suspended for those six days, while Great Western Railway trains, including trains to Bristol and Cardiff, will be running from Ealing Broadway, with exception of Christmas Day and Boxing Day when there are no services. A free shuttle service will connect the Heathrow terminals during the shutdown. London Liverpool Street and lines to East Anglia will be affected for even longer, from December 24 until January 2, with rail diversions and the replacement buses in place to allow for work on signalling, track and overhead power lines. South of the capital travellers, who have already tormented by months of train cancellations and delays because of the long-running industrial dispute on Southern rail, face further problems because of work at New Cross as part of the Thameslink improvement programme. No Southeastern trains will run into London Bridge or Charing Cross from December 24 to 28, apart from the Hastings service which will be diverted to London Bridge. South West train services will be affected by work at Clapham Junction. In Wales on Christmas Eve there will be no late night services between Cardiff Central and Bridgend, Newport and the Valleys because of track and signalling work, and further disruption over the New Year weekend. In Manchester work on creating the new link between the city’s main rail stations will mean diversions and replacement buses on Oxford Road services between December 18 and 28. All travellers are urged to plan their journeys in advance, through the National Rail Enquiries website. The Highways Agency has not yet issued a list of Christmas roadworks, but work is scheduled to continue over the period on stretches of the M1 and M6 among other motorways. Phil Hufton, National Rail’s managing director for England and Wales, said the larger upgrade works were scheduled over bank holiday weekends, when passenger numbers fall by 50%.” “There’s never a good time to impact on journeys and I’d like to thank passengers in advance for their patience.” He added: “Despite our essential upgrades, the vast majority of the rail network - more than 95% - remains unaffected and will be open for business as usual. This vital investment will make the railway more reliable for years to come, while improving journeys for thousands of passengers. “ Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “In opposition the Tories slammed the closure of lines over Christmas for engineering works, but now they’re in a position to do something about it they don’t seem to care. The hypocrisy is astounding. “Engineering works are a necessity and they have to happen sometime, but the government must ensure we don’t see a repeat of the chaos and overruns of previous years.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Christmas disruption would be an “utter nightmare” for travellers. “This is a time of year when people want to be with family and travel long distances to be with loved ones,” he said. “These works threaten to put this at risk and leave passengers stranded on platforms around Christmas for hours. The government needs to get a grip.”"
2016-10-31T12:50:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Man admits murdering his elderly mother with chainsaw,"A son murdered his elderly mother with a chainsaw at the home they shared and initially told police she had fallen on to the tool as he cut up pallets for their wood-burning stove. Robert Owens killed 75-year-old Iris Owens, a retired history lecturer and charity worker, in the garden of their home in Caerphilly, south Wales. Cardiff crown court was told that Owens, 47, dialled 999 after the attack, and when paramedics arrived they found Ms Owens lying on her back and her son with blood on his hands. She had a laceration to her neck and head and a black eye. There was also blood on a wall and on a tree stump. Christopher Clee, prosecuting, said Ms Owens had been spotted hanging out her washing in the garden just after 5pm on 3 May. A neighbour then heard the sound of a chainsaw. Owens called for an ambulance at 5.21pm, claiming: “My mother went mad. I was chainsawing some wood and my mother went mad.” She was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Owens was arrested on suspicion of murder at 6pm. He said: “I know, I’m going to jail. I can’t believe this has happened. I was just chopping wood. Why did this have to happen?” The prosecutor said he later told officers: “I didn’t mean to kill my mother. I was chopping wood pallets and she fell off on to my saw.” But at a hearing in September he admitted murder. As well as attacking her with the chainsaw, Owens strangled and kicked his mother. In witness statements read to the court, Owens was said to be close to his mother. One woman who knew them said he seemed “odd, but not scary odd” and sometimes acted “like a child who wanted attention”. The court was told they began to live together after Ms Owens’ husband died. Owens had a drug problem and was found to have had heroin and cocaine in his body at the time of the killing. Simon Laws QC, defending, said: “He accepts he used the chainsaw to strike his mother. There’s no attempt to minimise what he did, he is responsible for these injuries. “He is devastated by what happened in those few moments of anger in the garden and must live with the consequences.” Laws said the relationship between mother and son had been “close, loving and supportive”. The judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, said she would retire to think about the case, and would sentence Owens on Tuesday."
2016-10-31T13:48:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Royal Clarence fire: demolition to begin as firefighters thank Exeter public,"Demolition work is likely to start this week on the fire-ravaged remains of the historic Royal Clarence hotel in Exeter. The 18th-century hotel, said to be one of the oldest in England, was gutted when a blaze spread from an adjacent building on Friday morning. The fire wrecked the inside of the landmark building and left the frontage on the brink of collapse.
Crews have been unable to enter the building on Cathedral Yard because it is too unstable and have instead been using aerial ladder platforms to tackle the remaining pockets of fire. Structural engineers are carrying out site inspections and demolition work on the remainder of the hotel is likely to start within days. On Monday Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service thanked residents and business owners for their support. Since the fire started, roads have been closed, cordons put in place and businesses closed to protect public safety. Despite the inconvenience, firefighters said they were overwhelmed by messages of support, offers of assistance and free food and drink to help sustain the crews working around the clock to bring the fire under control. Mark Healey, chair of the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue authority, said: “The support of the public has been amazing. I visited the scene with the chief fire officer and we spoke with a number of local business owners to say thank you for their support to our crews. “In difficult times, communities come together and the events of the last few days has seen this happen on a large scale. Despite the loss of a number of buildings, it could have been so much worse. I’m just so pleased no one has been injured.” At the height of the incident, 150 firefighters were at the scene to prevent the fire spreading to other historic buildings.
The chief fire officer, Lee Howell, said: “This was an intense fire affecting several historically important buildings in the heart of the city. The complex nature of the building construction, especially the roof structure, made this a very difficult incident to deal with. “I am very proud of the efforts of our firefighting, control, officer and support staff, many of whom worked extremely hard for extended periods of time without complaining during what were very challenging circumstances. “It was an incredible effort by firefighters to stop the fire spreading to other heritage buildings. Due to the period in which the buildings were constructed, the gap between the back of the hotel and the adjacent properties was very narrow and the fire was threatening to bridge the gap and spread further. “To prevent that from happening took courage and skill and they should all take credit that they did everything they could to stop the spread of the fire.” Firefighters from across Devon, Cornwall and Somerset tackled the blaze, pumping water in from the river Exe. Residents were asked to restrict their water use to make as much as possible available for use by emergency services.
Howell said: “We have had crews at the site now for more than three days but we cannot be complacent. We will continue to dampen down hotspots, check for potential reignition and support the demolition process for as long as necessary. “It is important that we get Exeter back to normal as quickly as possible and we will be working with other agencies to make that happen.” On Sunday the bishop of Exeter, Robert Atwell, praised the “heroic” firefighters who tackled the blaze for helping to save the city’s Norman cathedral. He said crews had worked “overboard” to protect buildings on the cathedral green from the inferno. Atwell said he hoped the frontage would be rebuilt. “All the historic stuff inside has gone, you can’t replace it, but at least I hope and pray that they rebuild the frontage as it was because it deserves to be there because that’s what will preserve at least the veneer of the architectural continuity,” he said. Todd Gray, a local historian, said the Clarence could claim to be the oldest hotel in England as it was the first to use the French word. The hotel is part of the Andrew Brownsword group and trades under the name Abode Exeter. Brownsword said: “We have every intention to rebuild the hotel with enormous sympathy to its importance and heritage.”"
2016-10-31T15:03:01Z,uk-news,UK news,UK golf resort owned by Trump summonsed for alleged privacy breach,"A Scottish golf resort owned by Donald Trump is being taken to court for allegedly breaching the privacy of a rambler photographed by staff without her consent or knowledge. The resort in Aberdeenshire was served with a court summons on Monday after Trump’s Scottish lawyers admitted that two staff members took mobile phone images of Rohan Beyts while she was on the course in April. Trump International Golf Club Scotland, owned by the Republican presidential candidate, has been ordered to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court on 22 December to respond to a civil action lodged in the small claims court by Beyts this month. Beyts is seeking damages of up to £3,000 ($3,650) after TIGCS rejected her initial requests by letter for an apology and damages. Her civil action claims the company is guilty of a criminal offence under the UK’s data protection and privacy legislation, after an investigation by the Guardian revealed the resort was in breach of the Data Protection Act. The resort admitted it was not registered under the act with the Information Commissioner’s Office despite operating at least nine CCTV cameras and holding confidential records on its staff, its thousands of customers and its suppliers. It subsequently registered with the ICO in August. In the US, meanwhile, Trump has threatened to sue any cinema that screens the documentary, You’ve Been Trumped Too. Made by Anthony Baxter, the film is a sequel to You’ve Been Trumped, in which Baxter was seen being forcibly arrested by police as he investigated allegations of intimidatory behaviour against the property tycoon’s neighbours in 2010.
The latest film accuses his staff of cutting off the water to Molly Forbes, an elderly widow living next to his Aberdeenshire course, for five years – a charge Trump has denounced as “highly offensive, defamatory and categorically untrue”. She is the mother of Michael Forbes, the quarry worker and salmon netsman whose small holding, where she also lives, was described as a pigsty by Trump. Beyts, a retired social worker who is active in the campaign group Tripping Up Trump, was filmed by his staff as she apparently squatted down behind a dune to urinate during a walk along the edge of the course with her friend Sue Edwards. Beyts was charged with breaching the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 for causing an annoyance, after course staff used the images to make a complaint. Police told Beyts a golf resort guest had also been a witness. She alleges the staff must have hidden before filming her, because she said both she and Edwards had looked hard to make sure there were no golfers or passersby visible when she squatted down. “They deliberately concealed themselves and followed us,” Beyts said. “I couldn’t see anybody when I ducked down in the dunes. Sue was higher up on the dunes and she couldn’t see anybody.” The charges against Beyts were dropped by prosecutors after she refused to accept a warning letter under the 1982 act and said she had a diagnosed medical condition. Beyts and her lawyer, Mike Dailly, are considering a formal complaint to the ICO in tandem with the civil action. Dailly said: “What’s important is that there is a claim here. What Ms Beyts is seeking to enforce is the right to protect personal data. That is guaranteed by the EU charter of fundamental rights, which requires member states to provide effective remedies when their rights are breached.” The dispute highlights a long-running conflict involving Trump and his resort staff over Scotland’s strong right of access legislation, which gives people the right to walk across private land, such as golf courses and Highland estates, so long as the activity is not disruptive. Dailly said Trump’s company was guilty of “a very cavalier disregard for the rule of law, and acting in a way which is highly oppressive to ordinary members of the public who are going about their lawful business”. Trump admitted he had not heard of Scotland’s right to roam legislation when he gave evidence at a public inquiry in 2008 into whether or not to approve his plans for the resort. After winning that inquiry, Trump has been accused by activists and his neighbours of blocking off the main public path across the course, in breach of the resort’s planning consent. A large locked gate has been installed that forces walkers to squeeze through a narrow gap against a hedge. Beyts, a regular hill walker and outdoor sports enthusiast, said she had been out on the course with Edwards that day because her friend had been confronted by resort staff on previous walks, and needed support. “I see myself as supporting Scotland’s access code, the right to roam,” Beyts said. In a statement on Monday, a TIGCS spokeswoman in Aberdeenshire said: “We have not received a letter from the court but our position remains the same that any claims brought against us by Rohan Beyts are baseless and we will continue to vigorously defend our business from troublemakers like this.” Dailly said the summons was sent to the company’s registered office in Edinburgh."
2016-10-31T16:30:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jihadis planning Paris-style gun attacks on British streets, police say","Terrorists wanted to get firearms to launch gun attacks on Britain’s streets in five extremist plots foiled in the last two years, police have revealed, as they admitted that 800 legally owned guns had gone missing. In a rare joint appeal, the National Crime Agency and Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command urged the public to report fears about lax gun security among legal owners as well as criminals handling firearms. The intensified activity comes as British law enforcement, security and intelligence services try to prevent a marauding terrorist gun attack, such as the one that struck Paris in November 2015, happening in the UK. They fear terrorists getting guns from criminals and are concerned by an apparent upsurge in guns on the streets in London and some other big urban areas. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, who is in charge of counter-terrorism for the police, said: “We know that firearms can enter the criminal market through a variety of means, including thefts from legitimate holders or dealers. Law enforcement, together with security and intelligence services, are working tirelessly to locate these weapons, confront the terrorist threat and keep the public safe.” Rowley said that out of 10 plots disrupted in the last two years, half had involved jihadis wanting to get guns. Britain’s tight gun laws and the fact the country is an island mean availability of guns is relatively low. Rowley said terrorists were most likely to get the guns from criminals in communities they know. The main case that is publicly known is that of a group of west London youths arrested as they planned the most significant jihadi plot targeting Britain in a decade. Police, soldiers and civilians were the intended targets of the conspiracy, and the would-be terrorists acquired a gun, silencer and ammunition from a London-based criminal. Ringleader Tarik Hassane, 22, and his friend Suhaib Majeed, 22, were convicted of terrorism offences in March. Two other men, Nyall Hamlett and Nathan Cuffy, were convicted of firearms offences for sourcing and supplying the weapon. Hassane is suspected of associating with Mohammed Emwazi, who gained worldwide notoriety as Isis’s “Jihadi John”. Since then there has been an increase in gun crime, with the Met in July and August recording 202 firearms discharges in London, compared with 87 in the same months last year. Weapons are believed to be coming from eastern Europe by a variety of methods, and national and regional law enforcement officers believe there are increasing numbers of guns on Britain’s streets. Law enforcement officers seized at least 884 firearms last year including Czech-made Skorpion submachine pistols, Uzis, and Mac-10 weapons. The NCA director general, Lynne Owens, said: “Currently we believe we hold an advantage. There is low availability of illegal firearms in the UK compared with European and international partners, but it is not an advantage that we take for granted, and to maintain that advantage we must not stand still. “Suppressing the availability of illegal firearms in the UK has never been a more significant priority for the law enforcement community. Criminal networks, who think nothing about who they sell firearms to, present a significant route by which extremist groups will try to access the sort of weapons used in recent attacks in Europe.” Rowley is expected to be one of the candidates to apply to be the next commissioner of the Met, to replace Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. Rowley is national head of counter-terrorism and an assistant commissioner for the Met. Prior to that he was chief constable in Surrey, as was Owens after him.

2016-10-31T20:46:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Five Czechs jailed for trafficking vulnerable men into UK,"Five members of a Czech family have been jailed for after being convicted of trafficking vulnerable men into Britain and forcing them to do hard, humiliating work. At least eight victims were made to sleep in a garage, on mattresses on a floor and even in a cupboard, and had to supplement their meagre rations by foraging in bins for leftovers. They were forced to work in local factories, carwashes or as domestic servants and one was compelled to cut a lawn using a knife. Almost all of the money they earned was taken from them and they were beaten, punched and told they would be killed if they tried to escape. Jailing the two men and three women on Monday at Plymouth crown court, Judge Ian Lawrie said they had treated their victims, who were trafficked from the Czech Republic, as “cash cows”. Gang leaders Petr Tancos, 37, and his sister, Ruzena Tancosova, 36, were each jailed for six and a half years. Their cousin, Martin Tancos, 37, was sentenced to three years and his partner, Katerina Kurejova, 37, to two years. Petr Tancos’s partner, Nela Dzurkova, 28, received 30 months in prison. The judge said he would recommend all of them be deported upon release. In court Tancosova was described as the “godmother” of the gang, while Petr Tancos was the “enforcer” who used a baseball bat to assault and threaten the victims. The court heard that the victims had not been locked up but felt trapped because of their lack of money and because they could not speak English. One man was beaten with a chair and a baseball bat, and another was forced to shoplift, pushing trolley-loads of goods from supermarkets. As part of their humiliation they were forced to use the garden as a toilet or pay £1 to use a proper lavatory. The five were convicted of trafficking charges by a jury after a two-month trial. They all lived comfortable lifestyles while their victims were forced to work. Michael Mather-Lees QC, prosecuting, told the court that people-trafficking was a “spider’s web”. Police were alerted to the victims’ plight in February 2014 when two contacted the authorities, trying to escape. Officers began a seven-month surveillance operation – Operation Triage – and carried out a series of raids on homes in Plymouth in September 2014. Police estimate dozens of men with drug and alcohol problems were trafficked over several years, earning the gang hundreds of thousands of pounds."

A forensic tent has been put up at the scene where the man died in Gloucester Road, Croydon, just after 8pm. Two of the injured men, aged 21 and 27, were taken to hospital in a serious condition. A third man, aged 22, took himself to hospital with stab wounds.
The incident happened when the capital’s streets would have been busy with Halloween revellers The dead man has not been formally identified and next of kin were being informed, the Metropolitan police said. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said no arrests had been made in connection with the attack. Officers in Croydon confirmed that a murder investigation had been launched after tweeting reports of “multiple stabbings on Gloucester Road”.
Ch Supt Andy Tarrant, responsible for policing in Croydon, said: “I would personally like to reassure people that attacks of this nature are rare and we are doing everything we can to catch those responsible. “Across London, the Met is running its Autumn Nights campaign - coinciding with Halloween and Bonfire Night - to crackdown on anti-social behaviour. Officers from the Local Policing Teams are available to answer any questions you may have regarding matters of personal safety.”"
2016-11-01T07:00:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Exclusive: 'There will be terrorist attacks in Britain,' says MI5 chief","MI5 has its roots in the run-up to the first world war. In 1909, the targets were suspected agents working for German naval intelligence, the focus was on Germans living in Britain. The Daily Mail, as ever, was alert to the danger, advising readers: “If your waiter is German, refuse to be served by him.” In the 107 years since, there have been 17 director generals of MI5. Until 1993, their identities were a state secret. And even after an emergence of sorts into the public eye, the guiding rule to their life at work was: say as little as possible and what you do say, say discreetly.
None has ever given a newspaper interview. Until now – and to the Guardian, the paper that won a Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the Edward Snowden revelations of 2013, which so angered the British and US governments, and the intelligence agencies, and prompted fierce debate around the world about mass surveillance. Andrew Parker, the current chief, at the time spoke out forcefully about the damage he said Snowden was doing to the intelligence agencies and the help he was giving to our enemies. So has he changed his mind? Does he now recognise that Snowden was a force for good?
“Not at all,” he says. And the Guardian? Can you see why we published the story? “I have no view on that either,” he says, gripping the glass of water in his left hand a little more tightly. “I spoke out at the time about the damage that was done to the work of British and allied intelligence agencies, about having so much about how we operate revealed to our adversaries. Secrecy is not something we need for its own sake. “The Guardian takes a clear interest in the work we do – some of it is well informed, some less so. I am trying to create greater understanding – it matters to us that we have public consent for what we do.” Sitting in the office of the president of the Royal Society, where he has just been the surprise guest speaker at its annual diversity conference, Parker, who has made speeches and appeared once on the BBC Today programme, has a worldview that centres on three areas of threat. The first is Islamic-inspired terror, which he calls enduring and generational. “International terrorism in its latest shape, based on twisted ideology, brings terror to our streets and most of the developed world, including North America, Australia and Turkey,” he says. “Currently, the flavour of it is Daesh, or Isil [Islamic State], and we still have the al-Qaida brand. This is something we have to understand: it’s here to stay. It is an enduring threat and it’s at least a generational challenge for us to deal with.” He says the number of terror plots thwarted in the past three years stands at 12. “That sort of tempo of terrorist plot and attempts is concerning and it’s enduring. Attacks in this country are higher than I have experienced in the rest of my career – and I’ve been working at MI5 for 33 years. The reality is that because of the investment in services like mine, the UK has got good defences. My expectation is that we will find and stop most attempts at terrorism in this country.”
He lets the word “most” sink in before adding: “There will be terrorist attacks in this country. The threat level is severe and that means likely.” The second area of threat is terrorism in Northern Ireland – from what he calls “dissident republicans of various sorts”. The last terrorist-related death was of a prison officer in March. And the third is the covert threat from foreign governments. He is most exercised about Russia, which he says is at work across Europe and in the UK, using military means, propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks to achieve its foreign policy aims. “It’s MI5’s job to get in the way of that.” Parker says the threat from Russia is real – in part because it is so varied. “We see it in places such as Ukraine and the appalling brutalities in Syria.” Parker, 54, keeps most of his background under wraps. The most obvious thing about him is that he is tall – well over 6ft. He must have got into the service before rules were introduced saying that any male over 5ft 11ins – or female over 5ft 8ins – ought not to be taken on as surveillance officers because they would stand out in a crowd. They also say agents should not have any visible tattoos for the same reason. Parker passes that test. But when asked, he tells us that he comes from Newcastle and went to a comprehensive school before getting a degree in natural sciences from Cambridge University.
That is the first ever mention of Newcastle and a comprehensive education. Those origins are in stark contrast to most of his predecessors, who generally glided through top public schools. Even the women. And that is one of the reasons he says he is interested in diversity, because the agency should reflect the country it is working in – for practical reasons. With budget increases that mean 1,000 more officers will be brought in over the next five years, he says his aim is to get the gender balance to 50-50. Recruitment of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) candidates is running at 14%, similar to the national average. Parker says: “We need to be able to do surveillance of terrorists. We have to approach, cultivate and recruit people to be agents to work for us. That does not work so well if everybody looks like me.” He says that because of the sophisticated threat, MI5 needs to operate at the cutting edge of technology. Current jobs on offer include: cyber-risk accreditor, senior business analyst, information architect, problem analyst, covert technical operations specialist, and security architect. But the issue of mass surveillance will not go away. The investigatory powers bill – where Labour has a chequered history – was before the Lords on Monday. Critics, including the Guardian, argue that it goes too far in allowing access to personal data. The Economist put it like this: the government has been caught between the civil liberties lobby and the spies. It has chosen the spies.
Parker said he is troubled by this characterisation. “This suggests MI5 is someway on a seesaw, that we are on one end of the seesaw wanting more and more intrusion and the privacy lobby [is] protecting rights. We have to be balanced by civil rights and we are firmly committed to finding the right balance.” And what about the finding of the investigatory powers tribunal, which said security agencies unlawfully collected personal data for 17 years – from 1998 to 2015? The tribunal concluded this contravened article 8 of the European convention on human rights – the right to privacy for an individual and his or her family. Parker says other independent reviews supported the case for bulk data collection. “It is vital to me that in the internet age we are able to look at the data to find these people who mean this country harm.” He has done three years as director general. The usual term is about five years. So will he pen his autobiography and write novels in the manner of Stella Rimington? “I’ve no such plans,” he says. His sparse biographical notes on the MI5 website identify wildlife photography as a passion. “It’s a good way to unwind.” And what about television portrayals of his profession? Does he watch Hunted, the Channel 4 programme where members of the public go on the run trying to evade surveillance specialists – and where the watchers have most of the cards? “I generally don’t watch those shows,” he says. “They are not usually an accurate depiction of the work we do. But, there again, I’m not sure I want to see one.”"
2016-11-01T07:06:38Z,uk-news,UK news,MI5 head: ‘increasingly aggressive’ Russia a growing threat to UK,"Russia poses an increasing threat to the stability of the UK and is using all the sophisticated tools at its disposal to achieve its aims, the director general of MI5 has told the Guardian. In the first newspaper interview given by an incumbent MI5 chief in the service’s 107-year history, Andrew Parker said that at a time when much of the focus was on Islamic extremism, covert action from other countries was a growing danger. Most prominent was Russia.
“It is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways – involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks. Russia is at work across Europe and in the UK today. It is MI5’s job to get in the way of that.” Parker said Russia still had plenty of intelligence officers on the ground in the UK, but what was different now from the days of the cold war was the advent of cyberwarfare. Russian targets include military secrets, industrial projects, economic information and government and foreign policy. Parker said he was talking to the Guardian rather than any other newspaper despite the publication of the Snowden files and a consistent scepticism about the need for extra powers for the security services. “We recognise that in a changing world we have to change too. We have a responsibility to talk about our work and explain it,” he said. The spy chief also: • Said that 12 jihadi terror plots had been foiled by the security services in the past three years. • Identified the size of the homegrown problem: there are about 3,000 “violent Islamic extremists in the UK, mostly British”. • Said that budget increases would see MI5 expand from 4,000 to 5,000 officers over the next five years. • Rejected criticism that the investigatory powers bill, due before parliament this week, was going too far in enabling intrusive surveillance, arguing that it correctly balances privacy and security. • Dismissed claims that Brexit would affect cooperation with European intelligence services. • Said his aim was to equalise the gender balance in MI5 and recruit many more operatives from ethnic minority backgrounds. “Russia increasingly seems to define itself by opposition to the west and seems to act accordingly,” said Parker. “You can see that on the ground with Russia’s activities in Ukraine and Syria. But there is high-volume activity out of sight with the cyber-threat. Russia has been a covert threat for decades. What’s different these days is that there are more and more methods available.” Relations between the west and Russia have deteriorated since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and with Russia’s bombing of rebel-held positions in Aleppo in support of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Russia, in what was interpreted as a signal to the west, sent a formidable naval detachment through the Channel last week. Parker said the Islamic extremist threat was also enduring and generational. He broke it down into three segments: a large homegrown problem of potentially violent extremists in the UK – most of them British – about 3,000 in number; members of Daesh (Islamic State) in the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq trying to incite terror plots against the UK; and Daesh trying to spread its “toxic ideology” and promote terrorism online. Critics of the controversial investigatory powers bill, which went before the House of Lords on Monday, say it will offer the security services access to personal data, bringing a reality to bulk surveillance. Parker said the data was necessary in the fight against terror and he thought the government had reached the right balance between privacy and security. A recent ruling by the investigatory powers tribunal concluded that UK security agencies had been unlawfully collecting bulk data – which may have included medical and tax records – for 17 years from 1998, in contravention of article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Asked if this vindicated Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations about mass surveillance, Parker replied: “It absolutely does not.” Parker was strongly critical at the time of Snowden – and of the Guardian for publishing the revelations. He said : “I spoke out at the time about the damage that was done to the work of British and allied intelligence agencies, about having so much about how we operate revealed to our adversaries. Secrecy is not something we need for its own sake.” Before the interview, Parker was the surprise guest speaker at the Royal Society’s annual conference on diversity. He told the audience that the agency had practical reasons for needing to reflect the diversity of UK society. “We have to approach, cultivate and recruit people to be agents, to work for us. That does not work so well if everybody looks like me.” Read the full interview with Andrew Parker on Tuesday in the Guardian newspaper or on the website from 7am"
2016-11-01T11:09:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Two Irish rugby stars questioned over alleged sex offences,"Two Ireland rugby internationals have been questioned by the Police Service of Northern Ireland over alleged sex offences in the summer. One of the players, Ulster’s Paddy Jackson, has released a statement through his lawyers denying all of the allegations about an incident at a property in south Belfast in June. His club-mate Stuart Olding was questioned by the PSNI about the same incident. A third man was also arrested. Details of the pair’s arrest came to light followingon Tuesday after a report on BBC Northern Ireland. In a statement, the PSNI said: “Police arrested two men aged 24 and one man aged 23 on Thursday 30 June in relation to a number of sexual offences reported to have taken place at a property in south Belfast, on 28 June. “The men have been interviewed and released from custody. A file will be prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service. A fourth man, aged 24, will be reported to the PPS in relation to this incident for perverting the course of justice.”
Jackson’s legal firm, KRW Law, said he “rejects completely any allegations made against him”. Its statement said: “Patrick has cooperated fully with police in their inquiries and we have been liaising with police on his behalf. We are disappointed and concerned that this information has been leaked to the press before the investigation has concluded and well in advance of any final decision. This has the potential to be prejudicial to our client’s interests. “We will not hesitate to take all necessary steps to protect his legal position as he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. We urge the media to restrain from any damaging speculation.” Jackson had been due to fly to Chicago on Monday with the Ireland squad, who face New Zealand there on Saturday. However a press release from the Irish Rugby Football Union said he was not included for “personal reasons”. The week before the alleged offences in June, Jackson had returned from the Test tour in South Africa. Jackson, 24, has been capped 16 times while Olding, 23, has played four times for his country. The two men, both from Belfast, are established players for Ulster and have featured regularly for the team for most of this season. In a statement, the club said: “Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have been assisting the PSNI with inquiries. “The players deny any wrongdoing and have not been charged with any offence. As no charges have been brought forward, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”"
2016-11-01T11:49:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Police face misconduct hearings over alleged abuse of ex-Clash roadie,"Eight West Midlands police officers and one member of police staff will face misconduct proceedings after the alleged assault and racial abuse of a former roadie for the band The Clash. Donville Lorenzo was arrested at his Edgbaston flat over an assault allegation and detained at Bournville police station in Birmingham in November 2007. Lorenzo claimed he was held in a police cell for more than 23 hours, during which time he was punched, kicked, dragged down five flights of stairs and racially abused by officers. The assault allegation was later withdrawn and a conviction for assaulting an officer in custody was quashed on appeal.
In 2008 West Midlands police’s professional standards department found its officers had no case to answer following accusations of misconduct, but Lorenzo was awarded £17,000 in damages after a civil trial in October 2011. In June 2013, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced it would investigate Lorenzo’s treatment and, on Monday evening, the IPCC commissioner for the West Midlands, Derrick Campbell, announced its decision. “This was a complicated case given the length of time since the original incident, the legal background to it and the nature of the allegations,” he said. “We have conducted a very thorough investigation and having discussed our report with the force it was agreed that a total of nine officers and staff should face misconduct proceedings, and that will take place in due course.” Another two former officers were found to have cases to answer for misconduct and gross misconduct, but no action can be taken against them because they have retired.
There will also be no action taken against a former officer who is now carrying out a civilian role with a different force. The actions of a further eight police officers were investigated and they were found to have no case to answer. Of those who will face procedures, four constables and an inspector will face combined gross misconduct hearings, and one constable will face a separate gross misconduct hearing. A sergeant and a constable will face misconduct hearings and a member of staff has been referred to the police staff disciplinary procedure. Lorenzo, 62, was a roadie with the band The Clash before having a career as an African drummer, which he claims was cut short because of wrist injuries sustained when he was assaulted by police. Lorenzo told the BBC: “The force have tried to defend what was indefensible but I am no longer surprised, as this denial has always been part of their philosophy; ‘never admit anything’, just use a defence to discredit. “Unfortunately the force are still in denial that racism in their ranks is still prevalent so they will use the resources they have to defend that stance and hope that complaints such as mine will just go away.” A West Midlands police spokesperson said: “We are aware of the findings from the Independent Police Complaints Commission’s investigation and will work alongside the IPCC while misconduct proceedings are ongoing.”"
2016-11-01T12:01:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who murdered 75-year-old mother with chainsaw jailed for life,"A man who murdered his elderly mother with a chainsaw at the home they shared has been jailed for life and told he must serve at least 12 years and six months before he can be considered for release. Robert Owens killed 75-year-old Iris Owens, a retired history lecturer and charity worker, in the garden of their home in Caerphilly, south Wales. He initially told police she had fallen on to the tool as he cut up pallets for their wood-burning stove but subsequently admitted murder. Sentencing Owens at Cardiff crown court, the judge, Nicola Davies, said Ms Owens was a good mother and the relationship between her and her son had been “close, loving and supportive”. She said only he knew what had happened that day, adding: “You accept that what you have done was a terrible thing. This was the tragic and senseless murder of a good mother by her son.” The judge acknowledged that there was no suggestion Owens had planned the attack but said it must have been a terrifying ordeal for his victim. Owens, 47, dialled 999 after the attack, and when paramedics arrived they found Ms Owens lying on her back and her son with blood on his hands. She had a laceration to her neck and head and a black eye. There was also blood on a wall and on a tree stump. Christopher Clee, prosecuting, said Ms Owens had been spotted hanging out her washing in the garden just after 5pm on 3 May. A neighbour then heard the sound of a chainsaw. Owens called for an ambulance at 5.21pm, claiming: “My mother went mad. I was chainsawing some wood and my mother went mad.” She was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Owens was arrested on suspicion of murder at 6pm. He said: “I know, I’m going to jail. I can’t believe this has happened. I was just chopping wood. Why did this have to happen?” The prosecutor said he later told officers: “I didn’t mean to kill my mother. I was chopping wood pallets and she fell off on to my saw.” But at a hearing in September he admitted murder. As well as attacking her with the chainsaw, Owens strangled and kicked his mother in the ribs. In witness statements read to the court, Owens was said to be close to his mother. One woman who knew them said he seemed “odd, but not scary odd” and sometimes acted “like a child who wanted attention”. The court was told they began to live together after Ms Owens’ husband died. Owens had a drug problem and heroin, morphine and cocaine was found in his body after the killing. Paying tribute to Ms Owens, the judge said she was full of life and liked to help others. Owens had been before the court on numerous occasions and had been convicted of offences of dishonesty and violence. But he had no history of mental disorders."
2016-11-01T12:02:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Kremlin pours cold water on MI5 chief's claims of Russian threat,"The Kremlin has brushed off claims made to the Guardian by the head of MI5 that Russia is taking various hostile measures against Britain, which together pose a threat to the country. “Those words do not correspond to reality,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday. Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, told the Guardian that despite widespread fears of Islamic extremists, hostile state actors were a growing threat, and Russia was the main concern.
“It [Russia] is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways – involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks,” said Parker. “Russia is at work across Europe and in the UK today. It is MI5’s job to get in the way of that.” He added: “Russia increasingly seems to define itself by opposition to the west and seems to act accordingly. You can see that on the ground with Russia’s activities in Ukraine and Syria. But there is high-volume activity out of sight with the cyber-threat. Russia has been a covert threat for decades. What’s different these days is that there are more and more methods available.” Peskov said: “Until someone produces proof, we will consider those statements unfounded and groundless.” Elsewhere in Moscow, there was an acerbic reaction to the Parker interview. “I would like to ask the head of MI5 if he also sees the hand of the Kremlin in the appointment of Boris Johnson as head of the Foreign Office,” said Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry. She declined to comment further. The Russian embassy in London, meanwhile, posted a message on Twitter saying it was “saddened to see a professional trapped to [sic] his own propaganda-created world.” Alongside the message was a poster for the 1966 film The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.
Russia’s actions have come under scrutiny amid US claims that Moscow was behind attempts to hack the Democratic party’s servers, with the intention of influencing next week’s presidential election. Vladimir Putin last week denied the charge, saying it was absurd. Relations between Russia and Britain have been seriously strained since the murder of Alexander Litvinenko using radioactive poison in London in 2006. They have declined further in recent months due to Russian actions in Syria. Numerous British politicians have voiced worries about Russian espionage and cyber activities in the UK, as well as concern about the Kremlin’s “information war”. A scandal broke out recently when NatWest bank said it was closing the accounts of the Kremlin’s English-language television station, Russia Today. Moscow has promised to retaliate against British media working in Russia if the move goes ahead."

Appearance: It looks like spinach. Hey, this sounds like an Eddie Izzard routine. Well, it isn’t. It’s the endpoint of an extensive biotechnology project at MIT that could potentially alter the course of the war on terror. Are you sure? What’s next, bees with machine guns? No, this involves research published in the respected science journal Nature Materials, detailing mankind’s quest to harness biological material as an enhanced environmental monitor, and there is no place for your tired whimsy here. I’ve got it – a jam bazooka! Stop. Fine. Tell me more about this bomb-detecting spinach that I’m apparently not allowed to joke about. Thank you. Darpa, the organisation that funds military science in the US, has been trying to find a form of vegetation that wilts when exposed to explosive material. Someone should cordon off my fridge then. It must be full of bombs! First, the idea is that these could be planted in areas vulnerable to terrorist attack, potentially saving hundreds of lives in the process. Second, I thought I told you to stop. OK, buzzkill. What’s the technology involved? It’s complicated, but in short it involves allowing fluorescent nanoparticles to be absorbed into a plant’s leaves. If explosives are detected in its water supply, the plant wilts and authorities are notified. And why plants? To quote MIT’s Michael Strano: “Plants have built-in power sources and are able to move fluids around very efficiently. They self-repair, are cheap and abundant, are naturally adapted to survive outdoors and have a negative carbon footprint.” And terrorists won’t notice them … unless they radicalise Alan Titchmarsh! Unless they radicalise Alan Titchmarsh, yes, very good. How many adorable sniffer dogs is this going to put out of action? Who knows? Although, given that they will no longer run the risk of being blown to smithereens by an unseen malevolent force, I can’t see many of them minding. You’re no fun today. This is comedy gold and you’re stamping all over it. What can I say? It’s a skill. Do say: “Please be seated for tonight’s main feature: an all-kale remake of The Hurt Locker.” Don’t say: “Whatever you do, nobody arm Isis with trowels.”"
2016-11-01T13:19:31Z,uk-news,UK news,London housing: Sadiq Khan research brief recognises need for overseas investors,"Many Londoners take it as read that the high cost of housing in the capital is the fault of wealthy foreigners. Assigning blame to speculators from distant lands said to purchase job lots of posh flats in skyline-wrecking towers then coolly leave them empty as their value goes through the roof reveals a Ukip streak in a Remain-voting city where 37% of people were born abroad and over 300 languages are spoken. Everybody wants a piece of this populist narrative, including voices on the left. Mayor Sadiq Khan himself has cheerfully cranked out those crowd-pleasing lines about luxury housing units being stacked up like gold bricks both before and since he got elected back in May. How interesting, then, to report that his recently announced inquiry into the impact of foreign property investment in London recognises that reality might not bear out the rhetoric. “We welcome investment from around the world in building new homes,” reads the first paragraph of a ten-page briefing document sent out by City Hall’s housing and land directorate to universities and other bodies that might be interested in bidding for the £40,000 research job. Paragraph two acknowledges “public concerns about the role that overseas money plays in London’s property market,” but goes on: “The GLA wants to ensure any discussion of policy responses is underpinned by clear evidence and understanding.” Evidence and understanding? Whatever next? The document explains that “set against concerns over empty homes and a predominance of overseas buyers in local markets are reports of the positive role that overseas buyers play in enabling developments to go ahead”. A “positive role”? Good grief! It continues: “Off-plan sales are an important part of development viability. Industry bodies report that development finance can be difficult to obtain until 40% of units have been reserved and that most developers will not start construction on a development until a third of its units have been pre-sold.” In other words, without the filthy rich from Russia and Hong Kong buying non-existent flats on the strength of CGI images of towers yet to be put up, fewer actual homes might get built in a city already delivering barely half the absolute number it needs. Surreal? Yes. Ideal? No. But it’s worth stressing at this point that a considerable amount of London’s new “affordable” homes aimed at people on low and middle incomes are built as a condition of permission being granted for large, foreigner-financed housing schemes to go ahead. Yes, there are big concerns that developers use funny viability numbers to get away with delivering fewer such homes than they could. Even so, the fact remains that with no “rich foreign investors” sinking spare millions into future bricks and mortar, “affordable” supply in London, notably in expensive neighbourhoods, would be even more inadequate than it is. The GLA briefing document says the research it wants done must address four broad questions: one, what proportion of new homes is sold to buyers who are resident overseas?; two, what proportion of new homes is kept empty and how many of these are owned by foreign buyers?; three, how reliant is development viability on sales to overseas buyers?; four, how does overseas financing of development contribute to housing supply? Elaborating on these, it identifies problems of definition. For example, what is an “overseas buyer”, exactly? Is it someone from overseas who buys, or someone who buys from overseas? The document answers this itself: “The intention of the research is not simply to map the nationality of property ownership in London. Rather, it is to assess the extent to which homes bought in London are owned by people not normally resident in the city. Therefore, for the purposes of this research, ‘overseas buyers’ would ideally be defined as people whose principal residence is outside of the UK. This will therefore include UK nationals living abroad for a period of time but exclude foreign nationals who are normally resident in London”. So, rich Britons who’ve settled abroad but purchase property in the British capital might be categorised as “overseas buyers”, while investors from other countries who’ve made London their home will not. City Hall also wants a clearer picture of “the intentions behind the purchases” of overseas buyers. How many of the dwellings they buy really are just left empty as opposed to, say, used intermittently by family members or rented out? Answering this will involve addressing what exactly qualifies as “empty”. How frequently should a unit be unoccupied before that word applies? The document points out that information in this area is limited. Existing data have shown large falls in the numbers of empty homes in London in recent years, though these mostly record properties that have become derelict rather than new ones that aren’t much lived in. There is “no comprehensive assessment” of the extent of the latter phenomenon, the document says. The researchers’ job will be to provide one. Khan wants the research to be the most thorough yet undertaken on the issue. His wish to go beyond the mix of vivid anecdote, emotive assertion and imperfect estimate that inform widespread beliefs about foreign property investment in London is welcome. It also shines a telling sidelight on the impact of Brexit: a “clear understanding” of “the role overseas investment plays in development viability” is deemed “vital” to any policy that “seeks to support Londoners’ access to new homes”. It may be that in these unsteady nationalistic times, London is going to need those much-derided rich foreign investors more and more."
2016-11-01T13:30:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Orgreave inquiry campaigners say the gloves are off,"Campaigners for an inquiry into the “Battle of Orgreave” have declared that the gloves are off as they step up calls for a judge-led investigation into brutal clashes between police and mineworkers during the 1984 miners’ strike. In a defiant press conference at the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) hall in Barnsley, campaigners said they were considering mounting a crowdfunded bid for a judicial review of Amber Rudd’s decision not to hold any kind of inquiry into the episode.
Barbara Jackson, secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, was close to tears as she described feeling “shocked and devastated” by the home secretary’s decision. Addressing the crowd of former pitworkers, their relatives, supporters and union activists in the South Yorkshire town, Jackson said: “As you can all tell this is very difficult and very disappointing but there are options for the future, some of them we will be discussing with the legal people about the possibility of a judicial review. “We have focused on police violence because we thought that was the best way to get our inquiry – now we’re going to focus as well as that on the political side of the strike and the involvement of Margaret Thatcher’s government of the time … We regard the gloves as off on our side.” Jackson told the gathering that she had struggled to contain her emotion when she received the “very calculated and very cold” phone call from Rudd informing her of the government’s decision on Monday afternoon. “When she rang she was completely matter of fact, she said, ‘Listen to me say what I’ve got to say, then you can ask any questions.’ It was all very calculated and very cold. She read me – I didn’t know at the time – but she read me what was her ministerial statement she was going to read to parliament. I was shocked and devastated to find out we were not going to be offered anything.”
Jackson said the campaign had received a flood of support and donations since the announcement, as she revealed that its lawyers were considering a crowdfunded bid for a judicial review.
She said Jeremy Corbyn had promised an Orgreave inquiry if Labour were elected at the next general election, and that the campaign was also looking at a possible “peoples’ inquiry”. The South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, is also exploring ways of opening up the South Yorkshire police archives from the episode. “There’s still lots of mileage to cover but we need you with us, like we’ve always needed you with us, because we can’t do this on our own. The campaign will keep going,” Jackson added.
Andy Burnham, the former shadow home secretary who campaigned for an inquiry into both Orgreave and the Hillsborough disaster, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He described Rudd’s decision as an “establishment stitch-up” and “a purely political act”. Explaining her decision on Monday, Rudd said very few lessons for policing could be learned from a review of the events 30 years ago. She said there had been no deaths and no miscarriages of justice to investigate – claims that prompted jeers of “shame” when mentioned at the NUM rally on Tuesday. Chris Hockney, deputy chair of the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign, said an inquiry would have helped heal the wounds of the 1984 clashes, which he said continued to affect the region today. “There’s a lot of mistrust and bitterness about what they did in 1984 and an inquiry would help get to the bottom of that,” he said. “There’s certainly none or very little trust in a lot of the police, but it’s not against the day-to-day officers – it’s the hierarchy.”"
2016-11-01T15:09:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Italian prince becomes latest cyclist to be killed in London,"An Italian prince has become the eighth cyclist to be killed on the streets of London this year after he was pulled under the wheel of a lorry near Knightsbridge tube station. Filippo Corsini was the heir to one of Florence’s oldest and most illustrious families, with a lineage going back to the middle ages and a family tree that includes Pope Clement XII. Corsini, 21, was caught beneath the wheel of the lorry and dragged 30 yards across a box junction where Brompton Road meets Knightsbridge, just outside Harvey Nichols, witnesses told the Evening Standard. A spokeswoman for the London ambulance service said they were called at 12.37pm on Monday to reports of a road traffic collision. “We sent an ambulance crew, a single responder in a car, a paramedic on a motorcycle and an incident response officer to the scene. We also dispatched London’s air ambulance,” she said. “The first of our medics arrived at the scene in under three minutes. Sadly, despite the extensive efforts of our crews, a man died at the scene.” The Metropolitan police said Corsini was pronounced dead at 1.15pm. The lorry stopped at the scene and the driver, a 42-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, police said. He was taken to a west London police station for questioning, then bailed until December pending further inquiries. A postmortem examination will be carried out on Wednesday at Westminster mortuary. It is understood that Corsini was on his way to a class at Regent’s University London, a small, independent university where he was studying for a degree in international business. A classmate who came to lay flowers at the scene told the Evening Standard: “He was a good guy. I sat next to him in class and I’d see him rushing in with his bags every day. “Everyone was shocked when we got the message last night.” Corsini’s parents, Duccio and Clotilde Corsini, live in San Casciano in Val di Pesa, about 10 miles (16km) south of Florence, according to Italian media. They made their wealth first as wool merchants, then through banking. In 1730, Lorenzo Corsini was elected pope, taking the name Clement XII."
2016-11-01T15:13:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Fifaâ€™s poppy ban: the latest remembrance outrage,"It’s that time of year again, the annual event to commemorate bravery in the face of widespread disapproval – otherwise known as Jon Snow Day. Wearing a poppy is, as most people appear to believe (about 40m are bought every year), an act of remembrance and a small way of supporting the British Legion, but it is not yet compulsory. Someone should remind the vocal and seemingly powerful, self-appointed poppy police. Here is a brief history of poppy outrage. Poppies v Fifa
On 11 November, Armistice Day, England play Scotland in a World Cup qualifier, while Wales face Serbia the following day. Their respective football associations are asking Fifa to allow players to wear poppies on their shirts; Fifa bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts. The teams were allowed to wear black armbands embroidered with poppies in November 2011, after Prince William and David Cameron appealed to the football governing body. Private poppies In a 2006 blog post, the Channel 4 newsreader Jon Snow addressed the criticism of his ongoing refusal to wear a poppy on the programme. “I do not believe in wearing anything which represents any kind of statement,” he wrote. “Additionally, there is a rather unpleasant breed of poppy fascism out there – ‘He damned well must wear a poppy!’ Well, I do, in my private life, but I am not going to wear it or any other symbol on air.”
How patriotic is Jeremy Corbyn? That was the question last year, as some Labour MPs worried about whether their leader would wear a red poppy or the white one, a symbol of peace and pacifism, which he has worn before. Newspaper reports soon confirmed that he would wear a red one, leaving those with unspent poppy outrage to turn their attention to how deeply Corbyn bowed at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. Fake poppies Last year, Downing Street uploaded a picture of David Cameron to its Facebook page before realising with horror that he wasn’t wearing a poppy – a crime so great, it would have caused No 10 less panic had he forgotten to wear trousers. One was quickly Photoshopped on. Pound poppies In 2011, Poundland was forced to allow its workers to wear poppies after receiving a deluge of messages on Facebook and Twitter. Poppies were not, it had said, part of staff uniform. Unlike for prime ministers.
James McClean refuses to wear one The annual “news” that Irish footballer James McClean will again refuse to wear a poppy has hit the papers this week. The West Brom player has been viciously attacked on Twitter for his decision over the years. McClean has said that if the poppy only represented the victims of the two world wars, he wouldn’t have a problem. “But it doesn’t – it stands for all the conflicts that Britain has been involved in. Because of the history of where I come from in Derry, I cannot wear something that represents that.” Premature poppies
In 2010, BBC presenters including Clare Balding, Andrew Marr and Gary Lineker were criticised for wearing their poppies too early, before the British Legion’s official fundraising launch date. ‘Toothless’ poppies The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones, reviewing the art installation at the Tower of London in 2014 – in which 888,246 ceramic poppies were “planted” to mark the deaths of every serviceman in the first world war – described it as nationalistic, “inward-looking” and “prettified and toothless”. He was attacked by some rightwing newspapers and a handful of Twitter users, and the charity Help for Heroes said the piece “tried to politicise a memorial”. In a robust defence, Jones wrote that “an adequate work of art about the war has to show its horror, not sweep the grisly facts under a red carpet of artificial flowers”. Poppy patrol For some, calling out people in the public eye for not wearing poppies has become an enjoyable online pastime. Last year, the actor Sienna Miller was criticised for not wearing one on a chat show; the year before it was Nigel Farage who endured the wrath of the poppy police, who almost certainly enjoy a healthy crossover with Ukip voters. This year, Sky News’s Kay Burley has been quick off the mark, asking why Mirror associate editor Kevin Maguire didn’t wear one on TV. #AngerInHerEyes"
2016-11-01T17:25:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Paediatrician 'raped 14-year-old girl after tying her to couch',"A “well-respected” doctor sexually assaulted 19 young patients, including a 14-year-old girl who was raped after being tied to a couch, a court has heard. Consultant paediatrician Michael Salmon assaulted 18 girls and a boy while working at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire in the 1970s and 80s, a jury at Reading crown court was told. Salmon, 81, of Salisbury, denies 25 counts of indecent assault against complainants as young as eight and also pleads not guilty to the rape of the 14-year-old girl. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury: “The complainants were either screened from their parents or Mr Salmon persuaded their parents to wait outside the room.” He would touch the children intimately, carry out “inappropriate” examinations without a nurse present, and in one case raped a girl, Moore said. “Mr Salmon defends his position by saying he always acted correctly towards young patients and was in line with medical procedure. There is a common thread of him using his status as a very well-respected doctor,” she said. “He would routinely get the child away from the parent, often the child was uncomfortable and sometimes would tell the parent but they would say: ‘Well he’s a doctor’.” Describing the most serious charge against Salmon, Moore said he tied a 14-year-old girl, who cannot be named, to a couch and raped her. “She did not want to return to see him again but she was made to by her mother,” Moore said. “On the third visit she remembers running from the room.” Another alleged victim aged 12 said Salmon would “fondle” her behind a screen. A third said she was assaulted after going to see Salmon about a cyst on her ear. One complainant said he talked to her inappropriately and showed her sexual illustrations in a book. Moore said Salmon accepted he had the book The Joy of Sex in his consulting rooms. Moore said the alleged victims made their complaints after Salmon was put on trial in 2015 for other offences. The jury was told he was convicted of 11 offences. She said: “The complainants came forward after having seen, or heard, or been told about the 2015 case. Many of them thought Michael Salmon was long dead.” The prosecutor said Salmon was struck off the medical register in 1991 after admitting three indecent assaults. The trial continues."
2016-11-01T18:22:54Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hinkley Point C will not cost taxpayers extra, says EDF Energy boss","The chief executive of EDF Energy has vowed that the £24bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant will be built by 2025 and will not result in extra costs to UK taxpayers. In evidence before the House of Lords economic affairs select committee, Vincent de Rivaz dismissed parallels with two nuclear plants EDF is building in France and Finland, which have suffered delays and cost overruns. He said planning of the two projects had been “flawed” and there had been “underestimation” of their costs but insisted EDF had learned lessons from these setbacks. “The assumptions made on cost and schedule were wrong, dead wrong. We have dramatically changed the approach by which we prepared this project,” he said. Asked if taxpayers would have to pay for any unforeseen cost increases, or a decision to abandon the 3.2-gigawatt plant altogether, De Rivaz said: “Categorically not”. The promises come just days after secret government papers revealed that taxpayers would foot the bill if the cost of storing nuclear waste from the plant, which EDF is building in partnership with China General Nuclear, spiralled out of control. Hinkley Point C, which won final approval in September after Theresa May ordered a last-minute review, has also faced criticism over the £92.50 per megawatt hour (MW/h) “strike price” that the government guaranteed to pay EDF for electricity. Members of the committee pointed to a presentation by EDF in 2008 that predicted Hinkley could deliver power at just £45/MWh, citing the forecast as evidence that costs could increase further. De Rivaz said the figure had never been submitted to government but admitted it had been a mistake. “At that time there were flawed assumptions based on the cost of [the French reactor at] Flamanville,” he said. “What interests us today is the cost of Hinkley Point C. It’s a battle of the past.” He said the eventual agreement was a “fair, fair deal” for UK consumers. While Hinkley Point C has proved controversial in the UK, it has also led to deep divisions in EDF Energy’s parent company, EDF, majority owned by the French state. French trade unions have opposed the firm’s role in the plant, while the former finance chief Thomas Piquemal was among executives who quit EDF over concerns about the risks to the company’s finances. “It is his choice to talk down about the company he has just left,” said De Rivaz, adding that Piquemal’s replacement, Xavier Girre, had “no reservations at all”. He added that the project, due to provide 7% of the UK’s power needs, would be ready on time. “In 2025, when the country needs it, it will be up and running.”"
2016-11-01T20:14:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Ministers to review treatment of child refugees by May 2017,"The UK’s treatment of child refugees is to be reviewed after pressure from Labour MPs and campaign groups, who have criticised the process for taking in unaccompanied minors. Edward Timpson, an education minister, announced that the government is to publish a strategy by next May to examine how vulnerable asylum-seeking children can be protected. The new strategy will look at speeding up the process that identifies whether refugee children have a legal right to live in Britain. Funding for local authorities to support and care for refugee children will be regularly reviewed and children’s commissioners across the UK could be given powers to make representations on behalf of minors coming to Britain. Ministers will also consult on what more they can do to prevent these vulnerable children from going missing and look at introducing a standard set of actions for police who encounter an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child. It comes after criticism of the government from France and a number of MPs for the slow processing of refugee children who claim to have family links in the UK. Alf Dubs, the Labour peer, and Stella Creasy, the Labour MP, who have both highlighted the plight of child refugees, issued a joint statement saying it was “very welcome that the government has listened to our case to safeguard refugee children in Europe and recognises their vulnerability as well as the importance of working with the children’s commissioners and local government”.
“Yet we know there is still much to do to help the 1,500 children stuck in containers in Calais right now or who are being moved to other centres by the French authorities,” they said. “With Brexit putting in question our ability to cooperate with other nations in dealing with refugees, we urge the government to ensure this is included in their negotiations so that we can avoid the chaos we have seen in Calais happening again in the future.” Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said the announcement of a strategy was “much needed and welcome” but highlighted the number of child refugees who will need help before the May strategy is published. “At a time when children have become the biggest casualties of the refugee crisis facing abuse, exploitation and abandonment, action is needed by all European governments to support children and teenagers,” she said. “A huge amount of work has been done in the last couple of weeks to assess and transfer children from Calais, and to ensure they have proper support when they arrive, but many children and teenagers are still waiting in very difficult conditions. More work is still needed to help child refugees in Italy and Greece too.” About 200 refugee children have arrived in the UK since the start of the demolition of the camp in Calais and a few hundred more are expected to come in the next few weeks. Charities have warned that there is a risk of children going missing as the camp is bulldozed. The French president, François Hollande, has been pressing the UK to take more of the 1,500 unaccompanied children who were housed in containers and are now being dispersed across France. He called Theresa May on Friday to discuss the situation but the prime minister has not given any extra commitments to take child refugees above those who have the right to come to the UK under existing protocols. Announcing the shakeup of the government’s strategy, Timpson said: “The government is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, and providing help for those in genuine need of international protection. “The UK takes its responsibilities towards children extremely seriously, and we already have a comprehensive approach to safeguarding children, including unaccompanied children. “We recognise that the number of unaccompanied and refugee children arriving in the UK has risen over the last few years, including through the transfer of hundreds of children from Calais. Some of these children can be amongst the most vulnerable in society. “That is why we are, today, committing to publishing a strategy, by 1 May 2017, which will set out further detail on how these children should be safeguarded and their welfare promoted.”"

The Border Force and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency responded to a report of a kayak being spotted by a ferry at about 12.30pm on Saturday. The Border Force cutter HMC Searcher was deployed to pick up the man, who says he is Iranian and was reportedly living in the Calais refugee camp until it was dismantled last week. The man, believed to be about 30, says he was persecuted in Iran after converting to Christianity, Sky News reported. The Home Office said his case would be dealt with in line with immigration rules. More than 5,500 residents of the main refugee camp in Calais were moved out over a number of days last week. French authorities say they have relocated more than 4,000 people."
2016-11-02T00:01:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond urged to shelve tax cuts and help poorer families,"Philip Hammond should cancel planned tax cuts for businesses and wealthy households in his autumn statement this month and instead take action to shield poor families from the impact of Brexit, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has said. With his first major set-piece statement as chancellor due on 23 November, Hammond is under pressure – including from MPs on his own backbenches – to alleviate the looming double blow to living standards from rising inflation and a series of benefits cuts that will bite in the year ahead.
In a detailed analysis of the public finances over the past five years, the Resolution Foundation found that Hammond’s predecessor, George Osborne, could have eliminated the deficit in the public sector finances if he had held back on making a series of tax cuts, including repeated reductions in corporation tax. “The £32bn worth of tax cuts announced since 2010 has been the difference between the government hitting and missing its deficit reduction targets in the last parliament, or indeed in this one,” said Resolution’s chief economist, Matthew Whittaker. He calculated that the £17bn annual cost of raising the personal tax allowance, together with £8bn on cutting corporation tax and £7bn for repeatedly freezing fuel duty, would have more than outweighed the expected £30bn deficit on the current budget this year. Further tax breaks are in the pipeline, including increases in the personal allowance, which is due to rise to £12,500, and more cuts in the corporation tax rate, already among the lowest in industrialised countries. But Whittaker argues that these changes will further narrow the tax base – making revenues more vulnerable to future downturns – and the government should focus instead on helping the “just managing” families Theresa May has said she wants to support. “With the chancellor indicating that he will press the ‘fiscal reset’ button in his autumn statement, now is the time to rethink the government’s tax policy,” said Whittaker. “If he wants to use any fiscal leeway to support the incomes of just-managing families, increasing work allowances in universal credit offer a far more targeted boost to living standards than costly further increases in the personal tax allowance.” The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “This report underlines Labour’s argument that the government’s economic priorities have been wrong, and they must now urgently reconsider their determination to cut corporation tax to benefit big business.”
He added: “The size of these giveaways underlines that slashing employment support allowance, universal credit and local council funding was unnecessary and a clear example of the Tories’ skewed priorities.” Raising the tax-free personal allowance was a Liberal Democrat policy that was enthusiastically embraced by the Conservatives during the 2010-15 coalition. But the gains from successive increases have been felt by households higher up the income scale. The former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has urged Hammond to use the autumn statement to cancel further increases in the personal allowance and use the proceeds to reverse planned cuts to universal credit. Rising inflation, as a result of the sharp decline in sterling on the foreign exchanges after the EU referendum, is likely to exacerbate the impact of planned benefits freezes. Osborne announced in his summer budget last year that working-age benefits would be frozen in cash terms for four more years. Analysis from tax thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies last month suggested that would cost 11.5 million families an average of £360 a year – up from £260 when the policy was first announced.
The IFS said at the time: “While it is perfectly reasonable to argue – as the 2015 Conservative party manifesto did – that the working-age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices.” The corporation tax rate was cut from 28% in 2010 to 20% today, and is due to be reduced to 17% by 2020-21. In the wake of the referendum in the summer, before he was fired by May, Osborne suggested he would cut it still further, to just 15%, to help build a “super-competitive economy” outside the EU. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility will publish its first assessment of the impact of the referendum result on economic growth and the public finances alongside Hammond’s autumn statement, and businesses are likely to comb his statement for clues about how the government will approach the complex negotiations ahead."
2016-11-02T13:20:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May attacks Fifa over 'utterly outrageous' poppy ban,"Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on world football’s governing body, Fifa, which turned down a request from England and Scotland players to wear armbands featuring poppies when the sides meet on Remembrance Day. Speaking at prime minister’s questions, May said the stance taken by Fifa was “utterly outrageous” and the strength of feeling across the House of Commons was clear.
“Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,” she said. “I think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so.” Her response was prompted by a question from Steve McCabe, Labour’s MP for Birmingham Selly Oak who was born in Inverclyde: “Will she tell the respective associations [England and Scotland] that in this country, we decide when to wear poppies and they’ll be wearing them at Wembley?” May said the decision should lie with the respective associations but said “a clear message is going from this house”. Fifa, which has been mired in a long-running corruption scandal, should be more concerned with its own affairs, May said. “I should say to Fifa before they start telling us what to do they jolly well ought to sort their own house out,” she said. Fifa normally bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts. The teams were allowed to wear black armbands embroidered with poppies in November 2011, after Prince William and David Cameron appealed to the football governing body. Scotland and England will play their 2018 World Cup qualifier on 11 November and MP Damian Collins, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, has already written to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, asking him to reconsider the decision. A spokesman for the English FA said: “We are working closely with the Royal British Legion once again this year to honour and remember the sacrifices made by those serving in the armed forces. “In recent weeks, the FA has led remembrance discussions with Fifa to allow the England team to show its support for the poppy appeal during the World Cup qualifier with Scotland.”"
2016-11-02T14:44:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested after police officer stabbed in Lancashire,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a police officer was stabbed in Lancashire. The officer was carrying out a routine check on a Peugeot van in Cleveleys, near Blackpool, when the driver emerged and attacked him at 10am on Wednesday. The officer suffered knife injuries to his torso and face, and was taken to the Royal Preston hospital for treatment. The attacker fled in his vehicle. Lancashire police said the officer’s injuries were not life threatening and that his family had been notified. Officers taped off the scene on Wednesday afternoon, while forensic experts gathered evidence. A 39-year-old man from Blackpool was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder a short time later and is in custody. North West ambulance service said they received a call at 10.02am and arrived at the scene at 10.06am. Paramedics took the patient to hospital by air ambulance. Rachel Baines, the chair of the Lancashire Police Federation, said: “Our thoughts are with this officer, family and colleagues at this time. This is an ongoing investigation. A male has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. We are supporting officers through this.” Writing on Twitter, Steve White, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that more must be done to protect officers on duty. He said he had visited Lancashire police last week and officers had raised the issue of their safety and protection with him. Paul Maynard, MP for Blackpool North and Cleveleys, said the incident demonstrated “all too vividly the risk that police officers run on a daily basis. We should be thankful the officer was not killed but it should mean we never forget the bravery that the police do need to show. This shows it can happen on any street corner in any town.”"
2016-11-02T15:06:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Man and two children found dead at Leicestershire house,"The bodies of a man and two children have been found at a house in Leicestershire after a police standoff outside the property. Police said they were called to a semi-detached house in Hinckley at about 9.30pm on Tuesday after neighbours reported a disturbance on the street. Negotiators made contact with a man and a woman in the property in Welwyn Road but, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, officers gained access to the house and found the body of a man and two children, named locally as David Stokes, 43, and his two sons, Adam, 11, and five-year-old Matthew. An injured woman, named locally as the boys’ mother, Sally Stokes, 44, was taken to hospital, where she was said to be in a stable condition. Police said the next of kin of those who died had been informed. DCS David Sandall, the head of Leicestershire police’s crime and intelligence directorate, said: “A number of inquiries are now under way to understand what caused the three deaths, and the circumstances surrounding the events of last night in the house. “Whilst we are not, at this stage, looking for anyone in connection with what happened, we would like to hear from anyone who may have information for us.” As officers had been in contact with both the man and the woman on Tuesday evening, Leicestershire police have, as required in such circumstances, informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Neighbours told the Hinckley Times they heard screaming. Wendy Aubrey said: “They woke me up at 2.30am. I was in bed. My neighbour could see a woman standing in the street. She phoned the police. I was woken up by screaming.” Forensic examinations were being carried out at the house and officers were carrying out house-to-house inquiries. The road was closed while the investigation continued and Leicestershire police said it was likely to remain so for some time. Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident 748 of 1 November 2016."
2016-11-02T15:55:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Thirty detectives investigate death of soldier at Scottish live fire training base,"About 30 detectives are investigating the death of a member of the armed forces who is thought to have been shot during a live firing exercise at a Scottish training base. The soldier, who has not been named, was taking part in an exercise involving about 20 military personnel after sunset on Tuesday at RAF Tain, a large bomb, strafing and live fire training range 30 miles north of Inverness. Police Scotland has sealed off and shut down the base, which is used by the RAF, army and foreign air forces, after launching a joint investigation with local prosecutors, the Health and Safety Executive and armed forces. Ch Insp Iain MacLelland said there were no other casualties and there was no threat to public safety. He said the victim was not from the area, but their family had been informed. “Both the police and the military are providing them with support at this time and our sympathies are obviously with them in what must be an extremely difficult time for the family,” he said. “We are keeping a very open mind into the cause of the incident. It is the very early stages of the investigation and as the investigation progresses we’ll continue to release further information into the nature of that inquiry.” The police and Ministry of Defence are refusing at this stage to release any further information about the victim, their unit or the cause of death. It is thought the exercise involved personnel from different units and several different services, and may have included foreign armed forces, in a live fire exercise involving small arms. The MoD said it was for the victim’s family to decide what information to release about their identity or unit. Theresa May offered a tribute after the incident was raised at prime minister’s questions by the Scottish National party deputy leader, Angus Robertson. “I, and I’m sure the whole house, would wish to pass on our condolences to the friends and family of the serviceman who has died at the Tain range,” May said. Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, had said: “This is a tragic incident and my deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the person who has died. It is another important reminder of the often difficult and dangerous job our armed forces do every day.” Paul Monaghan, the MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, which includes RAF Tain, said he hoped the MoD would learn lessons from the fatality after concerns were raised about cuts in safety lookouts at the base. Although Alasdair Rhind, deputy leader of Highland council, had said on Wednesday morning there had been very few complaints from locals about safety and disruption at RAF Tain, Monaghan said several constituents had complained about late-night low flying. Monaghan said the base was only three miles from the town, and low-flying jets overflew the town as late as 11.30pm. The US Air Force was now using it for night-time training runs, dropping 500lb concrete bombs on the range. He said there had been 11 deaths during live fire exercises involving UK armed forces personnel since 2000, and 135 British deaths overall during training and military exercises worldwide. While there was no direct link between air force training and this incident, “it does raise broader questions about the management of RAF Tain”, Monaghan said. The most recent British military fatality occurred just over two months ago when a soldier was shot dead during a live firing exercise at Otterburn training area in Northumberland. Pte Conor McPherson, 24, a member of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, sustained a serious head wound on 22 August. Just over a month before McPherson’s death, a soldier died on a training exercise on what was the hottest day of the year in Brecon, south Wales. Joshua Hoole, 26, from Ecclefechan near Lockerbie, Dumfries and Galloway, was on pre-course training for the platoon sergeants’ battle course when he died on 19 July. Hoole, a member of the Rifles regiment, collapsed after taking part in a fitness test near the Dering Lines infantry training centre at about 6.30am. Rhind said the Tain range, which is the only one of its type in the UK, had a very good safety record and it was unlikely the soldier’s death would increase calls for a review of its operations unless something significant emerged from the investigation. “All the time it has been there, I can’t recall any incident at the Tain range,” he told BBC Radio Scotland. “So I think we need to know the full extent of the incident before asking for any clarity or saying things shouldn’t happen.”"
2016-11-02T16:47:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Transparency vital to child abuse inquiry, Yvette Cooper warns chair","Yvette Cooper has clashed with the chair of the national child abuse inquiry, warning her that transparency is crucial to maintain public confidence after two years of problems within the investigation. Cooper, the new chair of the powerful home affairs select committee, has rejected a demand from Prof Alexis Jay – the inquiry’s fourth chair – that MPs desist from calling her or other inquiry members to give evidence before them. In a letter to Cooper published on Wednesday, Jay said it was important for the inquiry to maintain its independence and to be seen to be doing so. “It is for this reason that I would urge the committee to consider carefully before requesting that anyone from the inquiry attends to give further evidence,” she said. But Cooper made clear that transparency was vital, and that the committee would call whoever it wished to give evidence as the £100m public inquiry proceeded with its work. “Given the two-year history of problems in the inquiry, it is vitally important that there is some transparency over the things that have gone wrong in the past and the way it is working now, so people can have confidence that problems are now being resolved and the work is back on track. It will be for the committee to decide when and whom to call on to give further evidence,” Cooper said.
Jay has completed a review of the inquiry’s work and, in an update this week, revealed that further public investigations may not take place. The inquiry has set up 13 investigations that are intended to lead to public hearings with witnesses giving evidence on oath. These include investigations into the Roman Catholic church and Church of England, Lambeth council, Medomsley detention centre, Nottinghamshire council, Westminster and the late Lord Janner. When the inquiry began Goddard promised up to 25 public hearings would take place, but Jay said the inquiry would commission new investigations “only if we consider they are necessary to fulfil our terms of reference”. Investigations which may not now take place include into the BBC and Jimmy Savile, as well as into the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces. On Wednesday Cooper repeated calls for the outgoing chair Justice Lowell Goddard to give oral evidence before her inquiry, something the judge has repeatedly failed to do. Goddard, who resigned in the summer, in written evidence to Cooper published on Wednesday claimed she had been driven out by a media campaign against her, saying no issues of leadership were raised with her by the secretary of the inquiry during her time as chair. “A real and increasing strain particularly for me … was the intensifying media criticism of the inquiry which commenced around March this year. This centred on allegations of unfairness in the investigation of allegations concerning the late Lord Janner … and developed into widening personal attacks on me and my competence,” she said. Goddard has denied claims made in the Times that she was racist and abusive to staff. She said in her letter that the damaging impact of the continued media allegations led to the inquiry team losing its nerve about her ability to continue leading the public investigation into institutional abuse in England and Wales. Goddard said she had agreed with Keith Vaz, the former chair of the home affairs committee, to produce written updates on the inquiry, but Cooper said that had never been the committee’s understanding. She repeated a call for Goddard to give oral evidence, either in person, or via videolink to the committee. “We believe that an oral hearing would greatly assist our understanding of this complex and sensitive issue by allowing us to put precise and specific questions to you.”"
2016-11-02T16:52:43Z,uk-news,UK news,When Harry met Meghan â€“ and dragged the royals into the 21st century,"Name: His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales. Street name: Prince Harry. Age: 32. Appearance: Handsome devil. Occupation: Gadabout. Oh lord, what has he done now? Please tell me there isn’t a video? Don’t worry, it’s nothing like that. It’s just that he’s got a new girlfriend. Phew. I thought he already had one called Tottenham? Do you mean Chelsy? Let’s decide that I do. They split up seven years ago. Then he had another one called Cressida.
That’s a good prince’s girlfriend kind of name. Indeed. But they broke up, too. Now it is being widely reported that he has got together with Meghan Markle. They have been spotted wearing what appear to be matching bracelets. Who she? She’s an actor, very beautiful, 35 years old. You might know her as Rachel Zane from the legal drama Suits. I don’t. Never mind. She’s also … how can I put this? As long as she’s not a divorced American. The royal family has had enough of them after that Wallis Simpson business. Actually, that’s exactly what she is. But I was thinking of something else. Harry’s not going to be king, so maybe it will be OK as long as she behaves herself and offers up her body as a vessel for the royal bloodline. That’s the thing. Markle is dual-heritage. Her father is white and her mother is African American. So? Look, most of the 20th century was a mistake and we want racial superiority back. We had a referendum about it, remember? O … K. Actually, I still find some aspects of that problematic. Typical Remoaner. We’re getting off topic. You’re right. The point is, how can people combine idolising the royals with being racist if the next batch of princes and princesses have a black grandmother?
Tricky. I’m sure the newspapers will provide leadership at this difficult time. They just keep coyly calling Markle “a brunette” and not saying anything about it, even on lists of “everything we know” about her. What has Harry had to say? Nothing. Both he and Markle have kept silent about the whole thing. How are people going to know what to think about his personal relationships if he won’t talk about them? It’s very selfish. I agree. Do say: “I suppose that Nazi costume was ironic, after all.” Don’t say: “Remember that some people claim Harry is half-ginger.”"
2016-11-02T17:03:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Blair's 'psychological dominance' key in UK entering Iraq war, says Chilcot","Tony Blair’s “sheer psychological dominance” played a key role in the run-up to the Iraq war, and meant that flawed evidence justifying the 2003 invasion was never challenged, Sir John Chilcot told MPs on Wednesday. Giving evidence to a parliamentary committee, Chilcot said “sofa government”, in which ministers were not consulted on crucial decisions, reached a high point under Blair. This reflected Blair’s personal preferences, he said.
He said that on several occasions between 2002 and 2007 “things were decided without reference to cabinet”. They included the legal basis on which the UK went to war in 2003 as part of a US-led coalition and the decision, once Saddam Hussein had been toppled, for Britain to take over the administration of four of Iraq’s southern provinces. Referring to the evidence given to his inquiry, Chilcot said he recalled asking the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, why the cabinet had not “provided more of a challenge” to Blair or demanded more information. “The answer that came back was that Tony Blair had, as leader of the opposition and in government, rescued his party from a dire predicament. I had the sense from Straw’s answer that he had achieved a personal and political dominance, a sheer psychological dominance.
“He [Blair] had been right. Was he not right this time? That’s what I took from Mr Straw’s evidence.” Chilcot was testifying for the first time since his devastating report on the Iraq war – seven years in the making – was published in July. The report eviscerated Blair’s style of government and decision-making and said that there was “no imminent threat” from Iraq when Blair decided to invade. It also revealed that in a remarkable private note sent on 28 July 2002 Blair promised the then US president, George W Bush: “I will be with you, whatever.”
Giving evidence on Wednesday, Chilcot said the cabinet was never told about the note. Only Jonathan Powell – Blair’s chief of staff – and David Manning – the UK’s ambassador to the U S– were aware of its existence. “Both tried to persuade him [Blair] not to use those form of words. But he did,” Chilcot said. Straw found out about it after it had been issued, and when it was too late to say “you shouldn’t write it”, Chilcot added. Chilcot said that in future those at the top of Whitehall should challenge ministers, even if their advice was not ultimately taken, and should also make a note of what they said at the time. He told MPs: “It’s vital for serious decisions to be recorded in the public archive, not for immediate release necessarily, but they should be written down. “If someone is in serious disagreement the reason for that decision, and the fact of it, should be recorded. [This] allows different voices to be heard.” Chilcot acknowledged, as he did in his July report, that Saddam’s regime was “barbaric and beyond any kind of defence”. He stressed, however: “That didn’t amount either in international law or other grounds for the invasion of a sovereign country. We haven’t been in that business since 1945.” Speaking to the Commons liaison committee, Chilcot said he absolved Blair of the gravest charge frequently made against him: that he had deliberately set out to “deceive parliament and the public”. The former prime minister was to blame in that he used his “very real powers of advocacy and persuasion” in support of a dubious case for war. Blair also “overestimated” his ability to influence US decision-making on Iraq, Chilcot said. In September 2002 Blair did manage to persuade Bush to turn to the UN and seek international support for military action. But by the end of that year it was clear that the military timetable had taken control of the diplomatic process, Chilcot said. From the outset the Bush administration was set on regime change, Chilcot told MPs. Blair, by contrast, sought to reconcile the US’s goal with Britain’s objective, which was to disarm Saddam. Chilcot accepted that on the eve of his crucial speech to parliament in March 2003, seeking approval for invasion, Blair genuinely believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The government’s joint intelligence committee had wrongly told him this, Chilcot said. At that point, however, there was “no evidence” Saddam intended to deploy such weapons against UK interests, he added. There was no imminent threat, Chilcot said. It later emerged that Saddam had secretly destroyed his chemical and biological weapons after the Gulf war, and before international inspectors were allowed back into the country. Asked who was most responsible for the Iraq disaster, Chilcot answered: Blair, Straw, and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. Blair and Straw were more experienced and therefore most at fault, he suggested. Chilcot said he was satisfied with the positive public reaction to his report. He said it was “particularly welcome” that it had been accepted by the bereaved families of the 179 British service personnel killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. “As things stand I’m reasonably encouraged that there is an attempt in government to address those lessons,” he added. Chilcot said he was often asked what his most important finding was, at the end of a marathon exercise which eventually ran to 2.6m words, and 12 volumes. After saying it was a “whole range of things” he offered an answer: “Failure to exert and exercise sufficient collective responsibility for a very big decision.” Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said the parliamentary hearing had been a useful exercise. “Sir John has started to put the final pieces of his conclusions into the public domain,” he said. Tyrie added that Blair “did not feel the need to be constrained by facts when putting his case to parliament”."
2016-11-02T17:20:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour MP cleared of kicking Scottish independence campaigner,"A Labour MP has walked free from court after a sheriff described allegations that she had assaulted a Scottish independence campaigner as “a storm in a teacup”. Sheriff Kenneth Hogg found the charge that Marie Rimmer had kicked yes campaigner Patricia McLeish on the day of the independence referendum in September 2014 was not proven, a verdict under Scottish law short of being found not guilty. The sheriff said he was not convinced that either party was telling the full truth, but wished the police had greater discretion in such cases. This was a “storm in a teacup”, he said, and a “yellow card would have been preferable to a red”. Rimmer, the MP for St Helens South and Whiston, had been cleared of a second charge of acting in a threatening or abusive manner on Tuesday after prosecutors agreed she had no case to answer as there was insufficient evidence to prove she had been abusive. The case focused on an apparent confrontation between Rimmer, then a Labour councillor who was in Scotland to support the no vote, and McLeish, a trade union member and activist in the Solidarity party, as they canvassed outside a referendum polling station in Shettleston, Glasgow on 18 September. McLeish alleged that Rimmer had been aggressive and kicked her in the shin after stepping up to her in an intimidatory manner. Rimmer said she was astonished by the accusations, which she vehemently denied. The MP said she had tried to engage McLeish in conversation after the independence activist had verbally attacked her, calling her a “red Tory” and claiming Labour had wrecked the NHS. “I would never dream of hurting anyone or kicking anyone,” Rimmer had told the court. “I wasn’t aggressive, anything but. If anyone was aggressive, it was Ms McLeish against me.” Hogg said that he had been astonished at some of the evidence he had heard. “I am not clear any party in this case, apart from the lady police officer, has told me what really happened on that day. I have unease with the whole evidence and am still unable to form a clear picture,” he said. The court heard lawyers for both sides arguing about the validity of the case. Liam Ewing, Rimmer’s defence solicitor, said there was “an inescapable” political context to the case which made it more significant than it might otherwise have been. Adele MacDonald, a fiscal depute, insisted the evidence had made clear it was not a malicious allegation but had actually happened."
2016-11-02T19:10:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Military officials accused of using Stasi-like tactics against 'whistleblower',"Military officials used Stasi-like tactics to try to “sink” a “whistleblowing” army doctor by suggesting that his opposition to the Iraq war made him a dangerous influence, a tribunal has heard. Dr Stephen Frost was sacked by the Ministry of Defence with no notice and no explanation in September 2013 after an incident in which a pharmacist wrongly dispensed super-strength morphine to a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. Frost, who had 20 years of “blameless service” in the MoD, was never given a chance to plead his case at a performance review panel and was banned from working as a locum with the MoD, a tribunal in Manchester heard on Wednesday. He insists he was sacked because he suggested that the morphine, six times stronger than that prescribed to the patient by another doctor, may have been siphoned off in a potentially criminal operation. Frost says he turned whistleblower after becoming convinced that the patient never took the drugs he was given, and was ignored and then sacked when he suggested police should be called. This is disputed by the MoD, which says Frost never called for a police investigation and was sacked because he failed to tell the patient he may have been given the wrong drugs and was at risk of an overdose. Several months after Frost decided to challenge his dismissal at a tribunal, one of the officers who terminated his employment did some internet research on Frost that his lawyers described as “intemperate, ill-advised and ill-judged”, and aimed at destroying his career. Col Carson Black’s research was then forwarded to Frost’s hospital trust, which was deciding whether to strike him off its list of approved doctors. Black had noted that Frost was a “leading light in the group of doctors who wish to reopen the case of Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose suicide in 2003 resulted in the Hutton inquiry. He is vociferously critical of government in the press and on social media ... a number of tweets refer to the ‘illegal war in Iraq’.” Black had also drawn attention to Frost’s association with Dr David Halpin, a retired surgeon from the West Country who Black compared unfavourably to the conspiracy theorist David Icke. Both men signed a letter to the Guardian in 2013 suggesting that Kelly had not killed himself. In 2008, Frost and Halpin wrote a letter to medical journal the Lancet, complaining about the “injustice ... meted out to the British air force medical officer Malcolm Kendall-Smith, who faced criminal charges for challenging the legality of the war against Iraq”. Frost’s barrister, John Hendy QC, accused Black of using tactics reminiscent of the Stasi, the East German secret police, only mentioning Halpin in order to smear Frost with “guilt by association”. Black said he never intended to do so, but conceded: “Yeah, I do see what you mean.” Hendy told Black the emails “were designed to sink [Frost] without a trace”, prompting Black to reply: “No, not at all.” Black then told the tribunal he was concerned that Frost could be a destabilising influence on younger doctors. “When I read [the Lancet letter] I wondered if it could be that Dr Frost would pass his views on this to the young doctors who are around him, because that wouldn’t be acceptable,” he said, adding that it was “obvious that if a doctor deserts and doesn’t do his job, he will be harshly treated by the courts”. Hendy told the panel Frost “actually loved working with soldiers” and his views on the legality of the Iraq war were “very widely shared”. The tribunal continues."
2016-11-02T20:43:07Z,uk-news,UK news,England and Scotland players to defy Fifa and wear poppies in Armistice Day match,"The England and Scotland football teams will wear black armbands with poppies on when they meet on Armistice Day at Wembley, after their respective associations said they would defy any attempt by Fifa to ban them. An increasingly febrile day of debate over the issue, including the prime minister, Theresa May, telling parliament that Fifa’s stance was “utterly outrageous” and football’s world governing body making it clear that it would not acquiesce, ended with both FAs making it clear that they planned to wear the symbol. Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura told the BBC that the English and Scottish FAs should be ready to face sanctions if they broke rules on what it considers to be the display of a political symbol. “Britain is not the only country that has been suffering from the result of war. Syria is an example,” said Samoura, the Senegalese former United Nations official who was appointed Fifa general secretary earlier this year. “My own continent has been torn by war for years. And the only question is why are we doing exceptions for just one country and not the rest of the world?”
Coincidentally, Samoura was in London along with the heads of all the home nation FAs for a series of meetings on the laws of the game, and was due to be hosted at Wembley on Thursday night by English FA chief executive Martin Glenn. The FA had hoped to stage further talks over the matter, having originally written to Fifa several weeks ago to inform it that England players intended to wear the poppy on black armbands – as they had been allowed to do in 2011 for a friendly against Spain when the same issue arose. But after Fifa indicated in a statement that it was not open to negotiation, the FA issued its own response in which it clarified its position. “The poppy is an important symbol of remembrance and we do not believe it represents a political, religious or commercial message, nor does it relate to any one historical event,” it said. “In keeping with the position agreed with Fifa back in 2011 and in what we believe is in accordance with Law 4, para 4, the FA intend to pay appropriate tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice by having the England team wear black armbands bearing poppies in our fixture on Armistice Day.” The Scottish FA released a similar statement. Both will argue that they do not believe they are breaking the laws of the game because they do not consider the poppy a political symbol, as well as pointing to the precedent set in 2011. Earlier, May had told MPs that it was right that England and Scotland players, who will meet on the evening of Friday 11 November in a World Cup qualifier, should be allowed to wear poppies. “Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security. I think it is absolutely right that they should be able to do so,” said May. She said it was a matter for the English and Scottish football associations, but there was a “clear message” from the House of Commons that “we want our players to be able to wear those poppies”. And in a direct message to world football’s governing body, which has been plagued by corruption allegations, she said: “Before they start telling us what to do, they jolly well ought to sort their own house out.” Samoura, one of a new wave of appointees who claim they will reform Fifa and rescue its scandal-hit reputation, refrained from responding directly but said that May should beware of political interference – which also contravenes Fifa rules."
2016-11-03T00:01:33Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police failures over digital evidence are unacceptable, says watchdog","Police failings are subjecting crime victims to “unacceptable delays” of up to eight months to secure the crucial digital evidence needed to prosecute a wave of modern-day offenders, the police watchdog has said. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said too many forces had failed to keep up with changes in the nature of offending. As a result, some victims of digital harassment or domestic abuse are “giving up” on the police and some suspects are reoffending. Some police forces are unable to get the basics of digital crime fighting right, such as downloading evidence from mobile phones, HMIC said. It also said some forces could manage. The claims came as the police inspectorate published its annual assessment of force efficiency. Zoe Billingham, from HMIC, said: “It is taking quite literally months on occasions to get a digital download off a mobile phone of an alleged offender”. She said she knew of cases where it had taken eight months, including in an allegation of domestic abuse. Billingham added: “That time and delay cannot be afforded to bring the perpetrator to justice. They may be reoffending, the victim may simply give up on supporting police action.” Mike Cunningham from HMIC said the best forces were partnering up with universities to get extra digital capacity. He said the failing had to be fixed urgently: “They are real here-and-now threats. They range from the most serious kind of national terrorism threats down to ... an attempt to get you to part with your money through an email. “The urgency of the issue is not matched by the urgency with which the service is responding.” Essentially, crime has changed and much offending is now linked to digital devices or computers. Thus with traditional crime types, forces needed people to collect forensic evidence such as fingerprints and DNA. For new crime types, officers need to be able to seize data from electronic devices such as smartphones, and then secure that in a form suitable for presenting in a court case, as well as be able to sift through what is relevant and what is not. Cunningham added: “What we are saying is that they are being overwhelmed. There is evidence that there is far too much of this evidence coming in for forces to meet that demand.” HMIC’s findings on efficiency rated eight out of 43 forces as substandard. They were Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, City of London, Devon and Cornwall, Dyfed-Powys, Humberside, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire. Two were rated as excellent: Durham and West Midlands."
2016-11-03T10:09:34Z,uk-news,UK news,St Helena airport will require an 'open chequebook',"A £285m airport built on a remote South Atlantic island with UK government cash will require “an open chequebook” if it is to ever welcome commercial airlines as planned, a select committee hearing has been told. Plans to build a clifftop runway on St Helena were approved in 2010 by then ministers Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, making it the single largest investment made in an overseas territory. But its inauguration ceremony for commercial flights was suspended indefinitely in May after tests showed that planes could be blown off course.
On Wednesday, civil servants from the Department for International Development (DfID) were unable to tell the public accounts committee why they had not tested for wind shear – a sudden powerful change in wind direction that can destabilise large aircraft – before the airport was built. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said more public money would have to be spent if the airport was to ever function for the island’s 4,000 inhabitants. One of the more drastic options that has been considered and rejected by officials was to blow the top off two mountains adjoining the airfield, the committee was told. The more likely option to make the airport useable would be to allow smaller planes to fly to the island instead of the planned Boeing 737s. Hillier said civil servants had already spent money allocated to them to make the airport useable. “Given that there is a UK commitment to the Saints [inhabitants of St Helena] and they are UK citizens, given that it is your responsibility and DfID’s to make that happen, and given that there is an airport there, it does seem that there is frankly an open chequebook because you have spent all that good money and you aren’t going to get anything for it,” she said. Mark Lowcock, DfID’s permanent secretary, told the committee repeatedly that he would prefer not to say who might be to blame for failing to discover the strong winds at the airport because of an ongoing internal review. He said officials were in talks with carriers about launching flights, but it would involve much smaller planes than previously envisaged. Stephen Phillips, a Conservative committee member, pointed out to Lowcock that in the 19th century the anthropologist Charles Darwin in his travel journal The Voyage of the Beagle referred to the wind shear on St Helena. “Darwin wrote this: ‘The only inconveniences I experienced on my walks [on St Helena] were from the impetuous winds. One day I noticed a curious circumstance: standing on the edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand feet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward, some tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I stood, the air was quite calm.’ “If Charles Darwin, as he does in this passage, gives a very good example of wind shear in St Helena in 1836, how have we got a position where DfID commissioned a £285.5m airport, paid for by the British taxpayer, without appreciating the danger of wind shear?” Lowcock replied: “That is a very good question, and one I will attempt to answer in my review.” Phillips also raised the possible option, mentioned in previous media reports, of blowing up the tops of two mountains. “I have the greatest respect for the civil service but I did not realise that it could move mountains,” he said. Lowcock replied: “It is not my plan currently to spend a lot of money exploring that option. My plan is to put in place a safe air service.” Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister, asked Lowcock if he was aware that the businessman and former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft had argued in favour of the airport weeks before it was approved by ministers. Lowcock replied that he had not been approached by Ashcroft. Ministers are resisting offering any compensation to those who made investments on the basis that up to 30,000 tourists would fly to visit the remote island. At present, it takes a five-day trip by ship to reach St Helena from southern Africa. One airline, Atlantic Star, on Wednesday urged the government to discuss a rapid introduction of “a much-needed air service” in and out of St Helena. Its proposal would involve using a specialist Avro RJ100 jet, with the airline able to begin flights next spring. The airline ran a test flight to St Helena on 21 October. The island, which is about 1,200 miles west of Angola, was where Napoleon was exiled in 1815 after his defeat at Waterloo. He died there in 1821."
2016-11-03T12:05:44Z,uk-news,UK news,US millionaire jailed for at least 17 years for murdering Cardiff student,"A millionaire New York businessman who murdered a British student in a Cardiff hotel room after meeting her on a dating website has been told he must serve at least 17 years in prison before being considered for release. Sammy Almahri, 44, strangled Nadine Aburas, 28, on New Year’s Eve 2014, then hung a “do not disturb” sign on the door of the hotel room before driving to Heathrow and fleeing to the Middle East. Almahri, who lied to Aburas about being an FBI agent, was eventually located in Tanzania and arrested on an Interpol arrest warrant before being returned to Britain. He initially denied murder, claiming that he had been driven to kill by voices in his head but on the second day of his trial changed his plea. Jailing Almahri for life, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said: “You showed both jealously and possessiveness of Nadine. I am satisfied that your killing of Nadine was prompted by jealousy and anger.
“Her death has left a huge void in the lives of all the family that can never be replaced. Your actions will impact upon Nadine’s family for the rest of their lives, their loss is immeasurable.” In a victim impact statement, Aburas’s mother, Andrea Aburas, 59, said Almahri had destroyed the family. She said: “She was such a beautiful girl, in both looks and personality. She was a ray of sunshine in everyone’s lives. “She was an inspiration to us all. She made you feel like you wanted to be a better person. Although she was strong and could hold her own, she also had a delicate heart.” She added: “I will never forget when police came to tell us Nadine had been taken away from us. My life ended. We have all lived our lives ever since in a complete haze. Almahri knew what he was doing. By taking Nadine, Almahri has taken the glue that made this family. We allowed him to come into our family and instead he took from us my child. “Life will never, ever be the same. No sentence that could be given to this man could compare to the sentence he has given to us. He has destroyed us.” Cardiff crown court heard Aburas, who lived alone in her own flat in the Welsh capital, met Almahri on an internet dating site. Almahri was “besotted” with Aburas, showering her with money and expensive presents. But the court heard that Aburas – described as “slim and petite” – suffered violence during the relationship. She once called police to say she had been raped by Almahri when she visited him in New York and claimed he had also attempted to strangle her. Almahri became “increasingly jealous” when she began to see other men in Cardiff and bombarded her with abusive messages, warning her: “You will be in hell.” He also threatened to post a naked photograph of Aburas on Facebook and sent her a message just days before the death saying: “You will be so sorry ... I know your (sic) with someone else.” He began to compile a “minute by minute” account of what she was doing – monitoring her movements from the other side of the Atlantic. Almahri travelled from the US to see Aburas and booked into the Future Inn hotel near her home on 30 December 2014. Shortly after 3am on 31 December, Almahri left the hotel, travelled in Aburas’s car to Heathrow airport and took a flight to Doha in Qatar. Aburas’s body was found at about 12.20pm on New Year’s Day by the duty manager and police were called. Almahri tried to pretend she had killed herself – and that he had assisted her suicide, the jury was told. A forged note found in the room was addressed to Almahri and began: “Sorry, have come to an end, I love you” – and was signed “Nadine”."
2016-11-03T13:46:31Z,uk-news,UK news,"Asian firearms officer wins Â£457,000 payout for years of racist abuse","A firearms officer who guarded Tony Blair and members of the royal family has won a £457,000 payout after he was called “just a Paki” during years of racist abuse by fellow officers. PC Nadeem Saddique, 45, has been unable to return to work after a long-running battle with his employers, Cleveland police. An employment tribunal was told last year that senior officers wanted Saddique, the only Asian in the unit, thrown out and that he was labelled “just a Paki” and a “black cunt” by superiors on a night out. One colleague had an English Defence League sticker, which made reference to Muslims and a crusade, on their holster, but this was not properly investigated. A remedy hearing in Middlesbrough ruled he should receive more than £457,000 for his ordeal, which meant he could no longer be a police officer. Speaking after the ruling, Saddique said: “This has been a lengthy and extremely difficult process, which has taken a serious toll on my health and my family. “I never wanted it to go as far as a tribunal, but after experiencing problems with discrimination for a number of years within the force and exhausting all avenues internally without success, I had to do something. “I hope the hearing this week will finally enable me to put the whole episode behind me.” Saddique trained as an authorised firearms officer in 2001 and five years later he became a VIP close protection officer. He was the only Asian member of the force’s firearms unit and felt he was unfairly treated when he was removed from VIP duties. Saddique claimed a sergeant confided in him at a gym in 2008 or 2009 that an inspector had told another officer: “I’ll get that black cunt out of firearms, watch.” The officer apparently agreed and allegedly replied: “Who does he think he is, he is just a Paki.” The comments were overheard during a night out in the Black Bull pub in Yarm, Teesside, when Saddique was not present. The tribunal panel said that evidence was hearsay, but that they believed Saddique was telling the truth. His lawyer, Clare Armstrong, from Slater and Gordon, said: “This outcome reflects the seriousness of the offences and the impact it has had on Pc Saddique and his career. “Pc Saddique was a dedicated police officer in the force but he was subjected to terrible treatment for years and his career derailed simply because of the colour of his skin. “It is very clear that the force needs to take steps in order to give the public confidence this will not happen again.” Saddique, from Ingleby Barwick, Teesside, began an employment tribunal against the force in 2011, claiming race discrimination, harassment and bullying. He settled with his employer without receiving any money on the understanding that he would be given access to training and would regain his VIP protection status, which he felt he had lost unfairly, when he returned to work. But since then a personal development plan had not been properly implemented, and his career had stalled. Cleveland police said it had apologised and made changes. A spokeswoman said: “We have reviewed many of our policies as a result of this case and, as part of our Everyone Matters project, have delivered training sessions on equality, diversity and human rights and cultural awareness to the wider organisation. “We are saddened that Mr Saddique is unable to progress his career as a police officer and wish him well for the future. “The IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] investigation into the case is continuing, therefore it would be inappropriate to comment on this aspect of the case at this stage.”"
2016-11-03T15:16:18Z,uk-news,UK news,How Sadiq Khan has been tackling London's housing crisis so far,"It’s almost six months since Sadiq Khan became London mayor and opinion polls suggest that Londoners are pleased with him so far. He’s had a high public profile, addressing the capital’s security concerns, making friends with Hillary Clinton and even being lauded by the Evening Standard. Khan has allied with London business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers. Brexit, which he and most London voters opposed, has added edge and urgency to this campaign. He’s also made starts on tackling London’s harmful air quality, sizing up barriers to social inclusion and recalibrating Transport for London to meet some of his bolder policy goals. But his biggest challenge is what is now routinely called the London housing crisis. This is the issue Londoners are most concerned about. Accordingly, Khan dubbed the mayoral election a housing policy referendum. A large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes. Khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls “genuinely affordable” homes to be built in his four-year term, but he has committed to a long term goal of 50% of all new London dwellings meeting that definition. How well is he doing so far? What progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in his manifesto? A lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes. There is a widely shared view that Khan’s deputy for housing and residential development, James Murray, has applied himself to the vast task with an energy, an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in Boris Johnson’s time as mayor. He has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless London makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need, everyone stands to lose - including the rest of the country. The goodwill of housing associations, boroughs of all political complexions, employers and commercial property developers has been sought. A dinner Murray had with new housing minister Gavin Barwell, who is also minister for London and MP for a marginal London constituency, appears to have gone swimmingly. Khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the London housing equation so that it generates better results won’t happen quickly or easily. Sooner or later, though, Londoners will want to start seeing solid results. What follows is a round-up of Khan’s housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come. A trade-off with property developers Later this year, after the government’s autumn public spending statement on 23 November, City Hall will issue its long-brewing supplementary planning guidance (SPG) designed to encourage higher “affordable” housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city. Like it or not, London depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs - including much of its affordable housing. Inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but, the ways things are now, won’t help put roofs over people’s heads. Khan’s SPG will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level, expected to be 35%. London mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level. The SPG will show Khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage, but take a long, hard look at those that don’t. The trade-off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides – they may have mastered the dark arts of viability, but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too. The SPG will also set out what types of home called “affordable” by national government meet Khan’s more stringent definition of being “genuinely” so. Increasing “affordable” supply with public money Khan has spent some of what’s left of the £1.25bn provided to Boris Johnson for 2015-2018 to increase the “affordable” housing component of housing planned for the first section of the vast Old Oak and Park Royal regeneration project in west London (whose overall stewardship under Johnson he’s described as “a mess”). He will soon produce a successor to Johnson’s funding prospectus, outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him. This will be published following the autumn statement. City Hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes. Building “affordable” homes on public land Prior to Khan’s election, Transport for London (TfL) had named a panel of developer partners to work with on jointly profiting from building on over 300 acres on 75 sites in its large land portfolio. Its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the city’s transport systems. Khan, though, wants an overall 50% of homes built on these sites to be “genuinely affordable”. His manifesto specified that these would be part-buy, part-rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first-time buyers who’ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply. Since the election, Khan has put in place arrangements for 200 out of 400 homes he wants built on TfL land at Kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere. An announcement earlier this week concerned two of these. One is called Landmark Court near London Bridge station, which has been lined up for more than 100 homes, of which “at least 35%” will be affordable. The other is called Fenwick South, which is actually owned by Lambeth Council. The building of 55 social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the Northern Line into Nine Elms will now begin early next year - sooner than expected. TfL will be responsible for delivering the homes, which will be owned and managed by Lambeth. A best practice guide for estate regeneration Another way Khan could increase the supply of affordable homes would be by helping boroughs to add to the number on council-owned housing estates. Recent research has emphasised that many of the biggest Inner London estates have already been rebuilt or replaced, but that the potential exists to “densify” others to the tune of an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 homes a year. The problem is that such “regenerations” have the potential to be contentious, contested and to go very wrong – not least for people living on them. One positive route through this difficult terrain is to find ways of “densifying” without extensive demolition and temporary rehousing, with current residents directly benefiting from the results. When he was Islington Council’s housing lead, James Murray firmly favoured the latter approach. A “best practice” document, setting out the mayor’s principles for getting estate regeneration right, is expected to be published by the end of this month. Introducing the London Living Rent Khan’s plan to bring in a new private sector tenure with rents set at one third of average local household incomes – thereby fitting his definition of “genuinely affordable” - was a major element of his housing manifesto. In September, he said London households typically earning between £35,000 and £45,000 a year - which would cover couples each earning substantially less than the average London incomes - would qualify for these new homes and be able to rent a two-bedroom flat for less than £1,000 per month, compared with the London average of £1,450. Subsequent published details indicate that the eligible household income range could be as wide as £25,000 to £60,000, depending on the area of London. The mayor’s intention is that this new form of tenure would enable tenants to save for mortgage deposits and move on to home ownership. It best described as “rent-indexing” rather than rent controlled according to one housing expert, though at City Hall they prefer to describe it as a form of rent regulation applied to a specific type of affordable home. Housing providers have said they would be able to supply London Living Rent properties, though some political debate has centred on how far they’d be affordable to renters earning the London Living Wage. The tenure period under London Living Rent terms will be “generally of up to five years”, says City Hall. Hackney Council, which is eager to help young, middle income residents remain in the borough as well as sustaining its social housing delivery, has pledged to be the first to see 500 London Living Rent homes built. It is thought that the very first London Living Rent homes could start to be built next year. Understanding the impacts of foreign buyers Much blame for London’s high housing costs is routinely aimed at foreign buyers investing in absurdly expensive “prime central” flats, but the true impacts of such finance and the use to which resulting properties are put are varied and unclear. Khan is commissioning independent research into the phenomenon, hoping to get a fuller picture so that housing policy can be developed accordingly. Significantly, the remit for this research recognises that, for good or ill, overseas buyers continue to play a big part in enabling development in London to happen. Khan wants the final report delivered next spring. Lessening the ill-effects of the Housing and Planning Act During the mayoral election campaign, Khan’s Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith made much of an amendment to a piece of legislation that even fellow Tories thought very bad for London and which Goldsmith claimed would enable the forced sale of council homes to result in twice as many “affordable” homes being built in the capital as would be lost. But the true impact of the Act in London cannot be fully assessed until its accompanying regulations are published, interpreting the various elements that leave room for discretion. The EU referendum and its turbulent aftermath have meant progress on this task has been slow. The appointment of Gavin Barwell as housing minister (see above) and his suggestion of a shift away from controversial “starter homes”, thought largely useless as an “affordable’ product in London, towards supporting a wider range of relatively low cost homes, including for rent, have raised tentative hopes that the worst aspects of the Act as they could affect the capital might be reduced. Protecting the green belt Housing supply analysis published during the election campaign underlined how difficult it will be to increase the number of homes built in London to the overall 50,000 a year it is generally held to need - a figure Khan has acknowledged but not committed to - without boroughs bringing forward some of their green belt land for building on. But the issue is politically explosive and Khan has gone to considerable lengths not to ignite it, both during the campaign and since, making much of his rejection of Tory Bromley Council’s plans for a football stadium and flats to go on green belt land in Chislehurst. A not-for-profit lettings agency In his manifesto, Khan promised to set up “a London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for good landlords, building on the work that councils have started, and ending rip-off fees for renters”. Word is that work has begun on this at City Hall, but it is at an early stage. Stopping “affordable rent” conversions A policy introduced by the Tory-led coalition government encouraged housing associations and councils to convert social rented homes to new, more expensive “affordable rent” tenures when they became vacant and were re-let to new people on waiting lists (with the strain often taken by housing benefit, the bill for which the government is actually trying to reduce). This was correctly seen as a threat to social housing numbers at a time when more, not fewer, are needed. Khan, committed to protecting social housing in London as “a vital asset”, has moved to block these conversions. City Hall says that under Boris Johnson’s’s 2011-2015 affordable homes programme, a total of 19,000 were approved (see “notes to editors” here) with 14,000 of those now completed. The rate of conversions has slowed recently, but Khan says he will work with housing associations through his affordable homes programme to put an end to them. Homes for Londoners team Khan promised to set up a “new and powerful team at the heart of City Hall” to pull together all the mayor’s housing powers and resources and “break the homebuilding logjam”. So far, a Homes of Londoners governance board has been formed, chaired by Khan - it will meet for the first time next month, after the autumn statement - a “skills and capacity audit” is underway and an in-house team of experts on development viability is being assembled with a view to making the provisions of the supplementary planning guidance stick (read more on that here). Perhaps the “Homes for Londoners” title is best understood as a banner flying above various forms of co-ordinated action. Preparing for a new London Plan and housing strategy Mayoral housing policy has to be in line with those enshrined in the London Plan, the name given to the mayor’s statutory “spatial development strategy” for the capital. The current London Plan is Boris Johnson’s. That doesn’t mean Khan is totally hamstrung by it, but it does mean he needs to put it through a full review which will result in a new version in up to three years’ time. That review is underway with the launch of a consultation document called A City for All Londoners. In this, Khan sets out the challenges posed by the capital’s rapid growth and some of the ways he hopes to meet them, including in housing. Themes include some of those mentioned above and homelessness, including rough sleeping. The mayor will also be producing a specific housing strategy to replace Johnson’s. It will come out some time next year. Summary The essential difference between Khan’s approach to housing policy and that of his Tory predecessor is that the Labour mayor is, as you’d expect, taking a more interventionist approach to shaping and regulating the huge, unruly beast that is the London housing market. He appears to be demonstrating far greater drive for getting more homes across the “genuinely affordable” spectrum built. His mayoral team and City Hall officers are of a high calibre and have demonstrated the pragmatic, consensus-building approach that is fundamental to mayors getting things done. London’s housing problems might be characterised as a combination of its booming successes over more than two decades and a consequence of successive national governments’ inadequate responses to the failure of the market to respond in the right way to its demands. Housing shortages and other problems aren’t new to London, and the current ones are beyond the power of any mayor to completely solve alone. But the hope is that Khan can provide strong, successful examples of how to make a start."
2016-11-03T20:45:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland: report to criticise Met's sex abuse inquiry,"Scotland Yard spent too long pursuing the investigation into allegations that prominent establishment figures sexually abused and killed children and should have ended it sooner, the unpublished draft report about Operation Midland has concluded. The Guardian understands that the findings of the inquiry about Operation Midland, which collapsed amid controversy earlier this year, are more critical than police chiefs were expecting and have sent Scotland Yard into crisis mode. The report by Sir Richard Henriques, a retired high court judge, is understood to say that inconsistencies in the account of the main witness, known as Nick, compromised the investigation’s chances of success, which meant it was unlikely a criminal case would reach the threshold needed for a court case against any of the suspects. The report also criticises decisions and actions by officers involved in the high-profile and complex investigation.
Nick’s claims led to allegations against public figures, including a former military chief, Lord Bramall, and a former home secretary, Leon Brittan, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. The report was ordered by the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, after a furore over police actions and decision-making in the case, which saw officers obtain warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their possessions. Operation Midland, which cost £2m, ended in March this year after the Met concluded that there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone, let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge. The findings from Henriques have been studied by senior officers and senior advisers at the Met since they were delivered four weeks ago in draft form. Henriques is understood to have concluded in his draft report that the investigation should have ended sooner and it should have been apparent more quickly to police that Nick’s credibility was too low to form the basis of a prosecution. The Met says there is “no timetable” for the publication of limited excerpts but has said it will withhold the full report because it contains confidential and sensitive information. It is believed this refers to information about and from exonerated suspects and their accusers. Some in policing are understood to be concerned that Henriques has failed to take sufficient account of important factors that may explain decision-making. These would include guidelines that were in place at the time about how officers should investigate sex abuse cases and a need to believe the victim unless evidence undermining their credibility emerged. On Thursday night the Met appeared to confirm that criticised officers have raised objections. Asked if police officers who are criticised have a right of reply before the report is finalised or published, in a so-called “Maxwellisation” process, the Met replied: “This is one of a number of considerations leading up to the publication of the report.” One source with expertise in the issues involved said: “Just because it is someone from the establishment, doesn’t mean you can write it off from the outset. You have to investigate, and if you don’t the victim will go to the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] and it will be three years before you clear your name.” The decision to raid Bramall’s home, distressing his then-ill and now-deceased wife, elicited considerable public sympathy for the D-Day veteran and opprobrium for the Met. The final version of the report is expected to be completed in the coming days. The findings are potentially damaging to the Met’s reputation and the controversy around Operation Midland has been one of the worst episodes of Hogan-Howe’s five-year commissionership, which will end with his retirement in February 2017. The claims made by Nick relate to the period between 1975 and 1984, when he was aged between seven and 16. Launching Operation Midland, the police said: “The credibility of the allegations was assessed after a process involving extended questioning of the complainant by specialist child-protection detectives.” In December 2014 the then head of Operation Midland said Nick’s claims were not just credible but true. The Met later withdrew the assertion that the claims are true, as it faced allegations that it had subjected former public servants to a “baseless witch hunt”. Operation Midland was launched following the Jimmy Savile scandal which shook up the criminal justice system and showed it failing victims, resulting in the shielding of a prolific offender. But the way the investigation was conducted led to vehement criticism of the Met from parts of the media. The negative findings in Henriques’s review may lead to more attacks on the force and Hogan-Howe, who insists his retirement is not linked to the controversy. Since receiving the draft report, Hogan-Howe has met with Bramall to apologise. Lady Brittan is refusing to meet Hogan-Howe until the Met shares with her in confidence the portions of the report covering her late husband, who served as home secretary under Margaret Thatcher. Lady Brittan feels it unfair that Hogan-Howe would have full knowledge of the report while she is in the dark. The Met said in a statement: “We are giving the report very thorough consideration to ensure that the publication of any material does not compromise any legal process, responsibilities or duties of care to any party.” The force added: “There are no ongoing proceedings that may delay publication of the report.” In October 2014 claims were made to the Met that a group of VIPs who were alleged to have sexually abused children had also murdered some of their victims. By November 2014 the Met announced that Operation Midland would investigate the claims and involved detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. In December 2014 the then head of Operation Midland, Det Supt Kenny McDonald, said experienced detectives from two teams had spoken to Nick at length and concluded his accounts were true. McDonald said in December 2014: “Nick has been spoken to by experienced officers from the child abuse team and experienced officers from the murder investigation team. They and I believe what Nick is saying is credible and true.” The Scotland Yard investigation found evidence that they believed pointed to the credibility of aspects of the account given by Nick. Nick correctly described the interior of a military premises in southern England, where he claimed abuse had taken place. The details he provided were not publicly available and the premises are not open to the public, making it likely he had been there at some stage, police concluded. A review, conducted six months into the investigation by a senior Met detective superintendent with no previous connection to the team, concluded there was sufficient substance to continue the homicide and sexual abuse inquiries. It suggested further lines of inquiry. Investigations into Bramall and Brittan were dropped and, by March 2016, Operation Midland was closed, after it was decided there was no evidence worthy of asking the Crown Prosecution Service to consider against Proctor. While being accused of being overzealous in Operation Midland, the Met is still facing investigation over multiple claims that it has covered up sex-abuse claims."
2016-11-04T11:53:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police officer to swim from Senegal to Brazil in shark invisibility wetsuit,"On Sunday morning, Ben Hooper will don a wetsuit specially designed to make him invisible to sharks, trot down a beach in Senegal and start to swim. Hooper, a 38-year-old father and former police officer from Gloucestershire with a deceptively languid-looking front crawl, aims to keep swimming until he reaches Brazil in about four months’ time. If he succeeds, he will have covered approximately 2,000 miles (3,220km) to be the first person to have swum the breadth of the Atlantic Ocean. “I am feeling so many different things right now,” Hooper told the Guardian hours before his scheduled departure. “Slowly the emotion is creeping in about the enormity of what I am embarking on, the three years of struggle to get here and the fact we are on the eve of something extraordinary. “I fear failure, but believe in our expedition. I feel that this is something I was born to do. I have a water instinct and am ready to prove that anything is possible when you put your mind and spirit to it.” Hooper’s journey to this starting point has been challenging. He was a sick child, clinically dying three times during his first days of life. At five, Hooper nearly drowned in a swimming pool when he got out of his depth. Rather than prompting him to stay away from the water, the experience led him to vow to swim an ocean one day. In the meantime, Hooper served in the army and then the police force, but when he retired he had depression and decided that a way out of it was to embark on a new challenge. Rather than take up golf or cycling, he focused on his childhood dream.
“I realised I needed to turn my life around,” he said. “I checked with Guinness World Records and they confirmed no human has ever swum every single mile of an ocean, and that was it.” Much of Hooper’s training has taken place in a swimming pool in Cheltenham, where the sight of him ploughing up and down has become a familiar one to users and staff. He has also trained in open water in Florida and in the Mediterranean, notching up 7,450 miles (12,000km) of training in pool and ocean. Such is his attention to detail that he worked with Hartpury College in Gloucestershire to find out what music – played on a waterproof MP3 player – helped him most. It turned out that if he listened to Eminem his performance was bolstered by up to 10%, though he will leaven the American rapper with tunes by the Prodigy and Faithless. He cites his fears as being failure and not reaching his £1m fundraising target. But the marine creatures he will encounter also come into the reckoning. It is possible he will swim close to great white sharks – though he is more worried about the smaller oceanic whitetip, described by the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau as the most dangerous of all sharks. The swimwear specialist Arena has designed a Sams (shark attack mitigation systems) wetsuit with Hooper in mind. It features a camouflage print that makes the wearer harder for sharks to spot. Hooper sounds stoical. “I am not too worried about marine life, I am going into their world, so I need to be respectful. I’ve already met sharks and jellyfish and nothing has eaten me yet.” He will not be completely alone. Hooper will have a support boat in which he will sleep and eat. The plan is to swim 12 of the 14 daylight hours – he will spend six hours swimming, two hours resting and another six swimming. During the night the boat will be kept in position, ensuring that it does not drift in Hooper’s favour while he is asleep. Any movement will be accounted for and made up towards the end of the expedition.
“The biggest challenges are marine life, weather and being able to consume 10,000 calories per day as well as mentally staying in one piece,” said Hooper. “This also applies to the crew for they will need to remain sharp, busy, maintaining vessels and morale. However, I know this is possible and believe we will do it.” There have been other mammoth swims of the Atlantic. In 1998, Benoît Lecomte took 73 days to swim from the US to France but his achievement was not verified by Guinness. Hooper’s team argues it would have been impossible for any human to swim the miles claimed in the time achieved. The explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes called Hooper’s attempt remarkable, adding: “The expedition has the potential of becoming the modern-day equivalent of Sir Edmund Hillary’s conquest of Everest.” • To donate to Hooper’s charities go to: www.swimthebigblue.com/charities • He can be followed on followed on: www.followmychallenge.com/live/swimthebigblue"
2016-11-04T13:25:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Rotherham rape victim: 'Justice could have been done 13 years ago',"When Sageer Hussain and seven other men from Rotherham were sentenced to prison, the woman they had raped and sexually abused as a teenager was determined to be in the public gallery.
Emma Jackson (not her real name) had given evidence behind a screen over three painful days in the witness box at Sheffield crown court. But on Friday she was ready to face her abusers when the judge jailed them. “I want to see their eyes when they get their sentences,” said Jackson, who was branded a “white slag” by her abusers, seven of whom are of British Pakistani origin. “I’ve been living with what they did to me for the last 13 years. Now they will know what it’s like to suffer.” Jackson is now 27 and the mother of a young son. She was 13 and 14 when Hussain used drugs and alcohol to groom her for sex. He raped her behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham and at other locations around the South Yorkshire town, before passing her on to one of his brothers, Basharat, two of his cousins and various friends. She reported her abusers at the time, having saved all the clothes she was raped in as evidence. The police lost them. Social workers closed her file because she came from a supportive family in a middle-class area. She once claimed a detective told her: “We just think it is little white slappers running around with Asians.” At school other pupils branded her a “Paki shagger”. Jackson thinks the ethnicity of her abusers is relevant. “I know that there are Asian girls who have been exploited,” she said, “but I never saw my abusers with any Pakistani girls. It was always white girls. There is a pattern there that you can’t ignore and it is something we need to tackle.” Jackson’s parents begged for help from their local MP, Kevin Barron; the then home secretary, David Blunkett; and the children’s commissioner, the court was told. But her abusers continued to swagger around Rotherham, threatening her family with violence, to the point that the Jacksons briefly moved abroad to try to start a new life. The unanimous guilty verdicts delivered last month came as a tremendous relief, but also brought frustration. “I just couldn’t quite believe it. I felt vindicated. Yet when the verdicts came in, it proved to me that justice could have been done 13 years ago. That could have saved me a lot of heartache.” Now a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, Jackson wants an official apology from South Yorkshire police. Though she praises the officers who brought her case to court, she would like a letter acknowledging that the force failed her as a teenager. “It would mean a lot to me to receive an official apology,” she said. Six years before the court case, Jackson wrote a book, Exploited, about her experiences, and had given evidence to the home affairs select committee. When the prominent social worker Alexis Jay published her report on sexual exploitation in Rotherham, saying at least 1,400 children had been abused in the town over a 16-year period, Jackson went public to say she was one of them. But nothing could quite prepare her for the ordeal of giving evidence. Walking into court on the first day, she couldn’t see Hussain but immediately caught a whiff of his aftershave from behind the screen. Now 30, he was wearing the same brand as he had in his teenage years. “His smell was a big thing for me. It made me feel a bit sick,” she said. Jackson was infuriated at her cross-examination in the witness box. “The barristers just dragged everything up. It was a load of old crap. I was warned in advance that it wasn’t personal and the barristers were just doing their jobs, but it felt personal. It was quite maddening. “It’s not a nice experience because they literally rip you to pieces. They try to trip you up; it’s as though they try and manipulate your words. To me it seems that it’s the victim who is the one who is put through the mill. That makes me quite angry.” With her abusers now in jail for the foreseeable future, Jackson plans to move on with her life. She is catching up on the education she missed out on as a teenager and plans to go to university next year to study social work. But she will never be able to forget what happened to her. “They took my education – that has set me back. It’s affected my relationships because I can’t fully trust people. I have mental health issues and suffer a lot from depression. But it’s not just my mental health that has been affected: my immune system is weak too. I pick up bugs really easily and have had glandular fever and shingles. It’s affected my life massively.”"
2016-11-04T13:42:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Rotherham: eight men jailed for sexually exploiting teenage girls,"Eight members of a Rotherham grooming ring have been jailed for between five and 19 years for sexually exploiting and causing “immeasurable and far-reaching harm” to a teenage girl. The eight men had been found guilty of 19 charges, including rape, indecent assault and false imprisonment of girls as young as 13 between 1999 and 2003. A Sheffield crown court trial, which ended in October, heard how the men “sexually degraded” their victims, subjecting them “to acts of a degrading and violent nature”. The men jailed on Friday were Sageer Hussain, 30; Mohammed Whied, 32; Ishtiaq Khaliq, 33; Waleed Ali, 34; Asif Ali, 30; Masoued Malik, 32; Basharat Hussain, 40; and Naeem Rafiq, 33. The judge, Sarah Wright, said they had caused “severe psychological harm” to their three victims.
The main complainant, now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, told the Guardian she felt vindicated after the men were convicted. “I just couldn’t quite believe it. I felt vindicated. Yet when the verdicts came in, it proved to me that justice could have been done 13 years ago. That could have saved me a lot of heartache,” she said. The woman, who uses the pseudonym Emma Jackson, said her abusers threatened to “gang rape” her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a park and in bushes near a museum. Her family were so afraid they moved to Spain after complaining to the police, social services, their MP and the then home secretary, David Blunkett, the court was told. The woman told jurors that Sageer Hussain – who is of British-Pakistani origin, along with all but one of the other men in the dock – first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a “white slag” when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch. He was found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. After the convictions, the National Crime Agency said it was separately investigating more than 11,100 lines of inquiry relating to non-familial child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2003. Thirty-eight people had been designated “suspects” with many more under investigation, according to the NCA, which is carrying out the independent investigation at the request of South Yorkshire police. NCA staff have been talking to 133 alleged victims and survivors and have recorded 163 crimes. They have identified 17 distinct investigations under the overall inquiry. Nine people have been arrested as part of the operation, codenamed Stovewood, with all suspects bailed until November and December, and one organised crime group has been mapped, identifying the nature and scale of its offending. Money laundering, other financial crime and drug-related offences have also been identified. The operation began after the publication in August 2014 of the Jay report, which said at least 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited over a 16-year period from 1997. Sageer Hussain, of Goole, was jailed for 19 years for waging a “campaign of violent rape” and intimidation against a girl who was only 13 at the time. He had been found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. His brother Basharat, also of Goole, was jailed for seven years for indecent assault, to run concurrent with the 25-year jail term he is serving after being convicted of other sexual offences earlier this year. The brothers’ cousin and Sageer’s driver, Mohammed Whied, of Kimberworth, was jailed for five years for aiding and abetting rape. Ishtiaq Khaliq, of Eastwood, was jailed for 17 years for rape and three counts of indecent assault. Waleed Ali, of Rotherham, was jailed for 13 years for rape and indecent assault. Another of the Hussains’ cousins, Asif Ali, of Rotherham, was jailed for 12 years for rape. Masoued Malik, of Rotherham, was jailed for 15 years for rape, false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit indecent assault. Naeem Rafiq, 33, of Bradgate, was jailed for eight years for conspiracy to commit indecent assault and false imprisonment. In a moving victim impact statement read to court, Jackson described how she has panic attacks, anxiety and eating disorders as a result of the abuse. “There are things and experiences I will never get back or ever have. Things such as going to my school prom, experiencing my last day of school and getting my shirt signed, going on my first holiday with my friends and picking out universities,” the statement said. “Those are things I should have done but they were ripped away from me. I don’t know what it is to be a teenager. I will never have memories to look back on and laugh at from that time.”Jackson and the two other victims were in court as Wright jailed their abusers. They sobbed and wiped away tears as their victim impact statements were read to the court. Their abusers showed no emotion as they were jailed. Sageer Hussain appeared to smirk as he was led away. Wright said each of their victims were “groomed, coerced and intimidated”. Their abuse was “carefully planned”, she said, adding: “An abuser would build up their trust and it is a common feature of this case that abusers are often described as initially caring and loving but then turning to becoming controlling and domineering. “Some victims were given alcohol and/or drugs and each of them was given attention. The power that you, the abusers, were then able to have over them meant that the girls distanced themselves from their parents or carers.” Wright praised the dignity and bravery of the victims and their families. In a statement read by police outside court, one of the victims urged others to report grooming: “I know grooming still goes on but I feel that the help is available now if you speak out. Groomers thrive in the silence of others. Speak out and someone will listen.” She added: “If you see a child in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable please report it, [child sexual abuse] is everyone’s issue and we all play a part in stamping it out.” DCI Martin Tate, senior investigating officer, said: “The rape and sexual abuse of children is completely abhorrent and this group have shown no remorse for their crimes, forcing the young women who came forward to report this awful abuse to relive traumatic experiences before the court. “We are indebted to the victims, who have supported our investigation and have shown remarkable strength in attending court to give evidence.” It can now be reported that four brothers have been involved in, and jailed for, running the Rotherham grooming ring. Sageer and Basharat Hussain are the brothers of two men jailed for 19 years and 35 years respectively in February. They were among 12 men and two women, including Basharat, who were jailed for exploiting vulnerable girls in Rotherham. It can also be reported that Sageer Hussain blamed the Rotherham abuse scandal on young girls wearing miniskirts who were “screaming rape”, in a television interview two years ago. “The biggest problem you have these days is you have young girls, that are dressed up ie miniskirts, stuff like that, they’re going into the clubs and they’re ending up going with blokes, stuff like that, and they’re waking up the next morning and they scream rape,” he claimed in a Channel 4 News interview in 2014."
2016-11-04T14:31:47Z,uk-news,UK news,The great 'poppy war': how did we get here?,"Is this year’s poppy row anything new? Well, no. It has become a strange seasonal harbinger that some sort of argument about the wearing of paper flowers will break out as we prepare to remember millions of fallen soldiers. This time, Fifa has refused to bend its ban on the display of political symbols on kits for the England and Scotland teams, whose World Cup qualifier next Friday falls on Armistice Day. Wales also want to wear poppies for their tie against Serbia the next day. Theresa May called the ban “utterly outrageous”. Rules are rules, Fifa said. The teams now plan to ignore them and wear poppies on black armbands. Have British teams always worn poppies at this time of year? No, although this is a rematch of sorts. In 2011, Fifa threatened to stop play if England wore embroidered poppies for a friendly against Spain. Prince William gave royal assent to the outrage and an armband compromise was agreed, creating a precedent, poppy champions now argue. But in previous England matches at this time of year, against Sweden in 2001 and Yugoslavia in 1987, there were no poppies or outrage. In 1946, England played Wales on 12 November, a little over a year after the end of the second world war, in which several top-flight footballers had been killed. There were no poppies, and no fuss about it. So what has changed? Somehow a voluntary, individual act of remembrance has become an obligation and test of patriotism for public figures. Conscientious objectors and thwarters, be they newsreaders or sports governing bodies, can expect to be attacked. Ten years ago, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow described an “unpleasant breed of poppy fascism” (beyond his socks, he won’t wear anything that makes a statement on air, he said). The angriest poppy purists have framed the argument as a war, of all things. (“POPPY WAR!” the Daily Mail front page cried on Thursday.) When did poppies become so political? Very soon after the origins of what might feel like a British tradition. After the first world war, Moina Michael, an American academic in France, was moved to make silk poppies by In Flanders Fields, the poem by the Canadian doctor and soldier John McCrae (“In Flanders fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row …”). Michael in turn inspired a Frenchwoman, Anna Guérin, to mass-produce poppies and sell them in America in 1920. Guérin persuaded Field Marshal Haig, founder of the Royal British Legion, to launch the first “Poppy day” appeal in Britain in 1921. This year the charity plans to distribute 45m poppies. Yet controversy has clung like aphids to the little flowers for decades. In 1926, the No More War movement, founded in 1921, proposed a white poppy as an alternative or companion to the red flower, which many pacifists felt glorified war. They also called for the addition of the words “no more war” at the centre of the red poppy. It did not happen, but the movement later rolled into the Peace Pledge Union, which in 1936 began making white poppies. The movement reflected and fuelled simmering tension and debate about the legacy of war, the effects of the Great Depression, the nature of patriotism – and the rise of Hitler. Red poppies remain political in many parts of the world. Many Irish nationalists regard them as symbols of British militarism. In 2014, the Irish footballer James McClean declined to wear one on his shirt when he played for Wigan. Doing so would “be seen as an act of disrespect to my people”, he said, referring to Bloody Sunday. McClean was booed by some fans, and received a death threat in 2012 when he made the same decision at Sunderland. What does the Royal British Legion say? It insists poppies are not political. “Wearing a poppy is a personal choice,” it adds. “It is not compulsory, but is greatly appreciated by those it helps.” Despite assumptions to the contrary, the BBC shares this pro-choice approach, at least at home. While the corporation asks its international presenters not to wear poppies because they are not universally recognised, domestic presenters can go either way. It’s a symbol of the conformity required after decades of debate that none demur. As David Jordan, the BBC’s editorial policy chief, wrote in 2006, while there is no rule, “there is clearly the potential that not wearing one might cause some controversy”."
2016-11-04T15:16:30Z,uk-news,UK news,A night tsar is born: who is Amy Lamé?,"Name: Amy Lamé. Real name: Amy Caddle. Age: 45. Appearance: About as far removed from Tsar Nicholas II as you can imagine. Why mention him? Because Lamé has just been made a governmental tsar. After tsars for families, social mobility, pensions and hundreds of other subjects, she is the latest to be given this odd title. A tsar is born? The old ones are the best. And what is she going to be tsar of? Going out and getting pissed in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan has made her “night tsar”, tasked (as they invariably say) with turning the capital into a 24-hour city. I thought London already was a 24-hour city. Don’t quibble. Khan reckons proper planning can add up to £3bn to the night-time economy. Nice job. Indeed. The salary is about £35,000 for a two-and-a-half-day week. Shouldn’t she be working nights? I thought that too. She has said the first thing she’ll do is go on a fact-finding mission in the bars and clubs of London. On expenses? How dare you! What qualifies her for the job? “Amy has a long and successful track record as a leader and collaborator in the cultural and creative industries,” says the mayor’s office. She likes a good night out. Your words, not mine. Born in New Jersey but based in the UK since she was 21, she’s a Labour activist and was mayor of Camden in 2010-11. She is best known as a comedian, with one-woman shows including Gay Man Trapped in a Lesbian’s Body and Cum Manifesto. She was a presenter on the seminal BBC2 show Gaytime TV, co-founded the Duckie arts collective that performs at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in south London, and has written what she claims is the first gay history book aimed at children. She’s not gay, is she? Not much is getting past you today. Does the Daily Mail know about this? Let’s hope not. Not to be confused with: Sir Philip Green, the former government efficiency tsar. A fallen tsar? Oh, go away. Do say: “Great news. At last, someone will stand up [sic] for London’s beleaguered nightclubs.” Don’t say: “Ridiculous stunt. What about a tsar for affordable housing?”"
2016-11-04T15:37:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish ministers ban police from searching children for alcohol,"Scottish ministers have banned police from stopping and searching children for alcohol without legal cause after they found little evidence to support its use. To the irritation of some rank and file officers, Michael Matheson, the Scottish justice secretary, said the government would instead focus on introducing a new statutory code of practice to cover searches of adults next year. “We know stop and search can be a valuable tool on combating crime, but it is important that we get the balance right between protecting the public and the rights of individuals,” Matheson said. Scottish police will still have the legal power to require an underage child to hand over alcohol if they can see it on them but, after this new bar on non-statutory searches, would need to arrest them if they refuse to hand it over. The decision follows lengthy reviews into the once heavy use of non-statutory stop and searches in Scotland including children younger than 10, which became particularly widespread in Strathclyde under the then chief constable Sir Stephen House. Unlike in England and Wales, where the practice is heavily regulated, Scottish police were repeatedly using common law powers for “consensual” searches of children without oversight and legal cause. At its peak, Scotland’s overall stop and search rate was four times higher than in England and Wales. A study by academic researcher Kath Murray, with the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, found under-14s were searched 26,000 times in 2010 without the specific statutory power to do so. That included 500 searches of children under-10s. In Strathclyde, there were more recorded searches of 16-year-olds than the number of people that age living in the force area, at a rate of 1,406 searches per 1,000 people. The police and the then justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, insisted that non-statutory stop and searches were an essential weapon in the wider strategy of combating underage drinking and antisocial behaviour. Few children objected and many adults supported it, they said. In 2015, the UN human rights committee said the practice was “allegedly unlawful and disproportionate” and should be scrapped. But an expert panel set up by Scottish ministers to review all stop and search policies could not agree on whether to do so or not, leading to the latest review. However, the Scottish government’s review, published on Friday, found that after stricter oversight was introduced in the summer of 2015, there were still few successful discoveries of alcohol on children. Of 1,629 consensual searches of children, only 158 – or less than one search in 10 – found alcohol. For searches involving adults aged 18 or over, the figure reached 16.3%. There were far more cases – 2,551 in total – where children voluntarily handed over alcohol without being searched. Matheson said the question of non-statutory search powers of children would be revisited 12 months after a new code of conduct comes into force next year, to see if there was clear evidence the power was needed. Murray said this was a measured and welcome decision by ministers. “Any increase in the powers of the police should be evidence based, and as the Scottish government and Police Scotland have acknowledged, there is currently insufficient evidence to support such a move.” The Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, would not comment directly on the government’s decision. Calum Steele, its general secretary, tweeted:"
2016-11-04T16:13:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police chief Gordon Anglesea jailed for child sexual abuse,"A former police superintendent has been jailed for 12 years for sexually abusing vulnerable boys in the 1980s at a Home Office attendance centre for young offenders and at a children’s home. Gordon Anglesea, 79, is the highest-profile offender brought to justice through the National Crime Agency’s Operation Pallial, which has been investigating allegations of widespread and organised child abuse in north Wales. Anglesea has faced claims for a quarter of a century that he preyed on young boys, and in the mid-90s was awarded £375,000 in damages after successfully suing news organisations including the Observer that had linked him to abuse. At that time he depicted himself as an old-fashioned north Wales officer who had been inspired by the fictional neighbourhood policeman Dixon of Dock Green. But in victims’ impact statements put before Mold crown court in north Wales on Friday, one victim said: “Anglesea was the worst. He was the man I feared most.” A second said he had several times tried to kill himself because he couldn’t live with the memories of what “that man” had done to him. Anglesea, a father of five, continued to protest his innocence. His barrister, Tania Griffiths QC, said the verdicts were “perverse” and unsuccessfully applied for her client to be freed on bail while he sought an appeal. Griffiths said Anglesea and his family could lose his police pension and asked the judge to be as “humane” as possible because jail would be so difficult for him. There were cheers from the public gallery as the judge Geraint Walters passed sentence and told Anglesea his victims had been vulnerable young people with nobody to turn to for help. Walters said: “You do not need me to say that as a person whose obligation it was to uphold the law and protect the vulnerable, your offences against those vulnerable boys grossly abused the trust placed in you. The consequences for them has been profound, indeed life-changing.” Anglesea was found guilty of indecent assaults on two boys aged 14 and 15. One said he had been assaulted by Anglesea in the shower and a changing room at the attendance centre he ran in Wrexham. Such centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for youths, and provided physical training and woodwork lessons. The second victim lived at a children’s home called Bryn Estyn in Wrexham. He claimed he was taken from there to various addresses and passed around “like a handbag” to men including Anglesea. North Wales police has apologised for Anglesea’s actions and said it has changed the way it investigates such offences. In 1994, Anglesea sued the Observer, Private Eye, the Independent on Sunday and the Welsh broadcaster HTV over allegations connecting him to abuse. During libel hearings at the high court, Anglesea, then in his late 50s and living in a seaside town in north Wales, was portrayed as a stalwart of the community, a Freemason, Rotarian, Methodist and a school governor. The news organisations called evidence from three young men who claimed to have been Anglesea’s victims while they were teenagers at Bryn Estyn. Anglesea persuaded the jury of his innocence and he was awarded damages. The papers and broadcaster were left with a £1m legal bill. One of the libel trial witnesses, Mark Humphries, 30, killed himself two months after giving evidence against Anglesea. In 2012, the National Crime Agency launched Pallial at the height of the swirl of false allegations linking the Tory peer Lord McAlpine to child abuse in the Wrexham area. Its mission was to look at the allegations of sexual abuse within the care system in north Wales that once again surfaced during the scandal, which was triggered by a Newsnight report. More than 300 people made contact with the investigation, dozens have been arrested and scores of complaints are being investigated. It is no surprise that so many people came forward. During the Sir Ronald Waterhouse inquiry in 1997, almost 300 men and women named 148 abusers including police officers, social workers, local authority executives, senior businessmen and politicians. Waterhouse ordered that they could not be identified by the media. Among those who have been convicted through Pallial are John Allen, a care home owner who was jailed for life, and a gang of five including a former professional wrestler, a radio presenter and a civil servant, who were found to be members of a predatory paedophile ring that abused vulnerable boys. A number of former residents of the Bryn Estyn children’s home in Wrexham were in court to see Anglesea sentenced."
2016-11-04T18:39:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Four Wahaca branches remain closed after suspected norovirus cases,"Four London branches of the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca remain closed after a suspected outbreak of norovirus affected more than 350 customers and staff. Environmental health officers and officials from Public Health England (PHE) were called in after a suspected outbreak of the winter vomiting bug struck nine branches last week. All were shut down; five have since reopened. “The majority of our restaurants are open and we hope to reopen the four remaining sites, on a case-by-case basis, as soon as we feel we are ready to do so,” said co-founders Mark Selby and Thomasina Miers in a statement published on the chain’s website. The branches that are still closed are all in London: Canary Wharf, Covent Garden, Oxford Circus and Soho. a spokesperson for the company said there would be an update on the situation on Monday. Norovirus, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting, is one of the most common stomach bugs and, while it is more common in winter, can be caught at any time of the year. It usually clears up by itself in a few days. The virus can rapidly spread in public places and can be caught through close contact with someone with the virus (if they breathe out particles containing the virus), touching contaminated surfaces or eating contaminated food that has been handled by an affected person who has not washed their hands. Deborah Turbitt, London deputy director for health protection for PHE, advised people affected to drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration, and to avoid going to their GP in case they spread it to others. The statement by Miers, a former MasterChef winner, and Selby said: “We are incredibly sorry that people have been unwell. In the nine years since we first opened Wahaca we have never had such an unprecedented incident, and we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of how this may have happened.” A Day of the Dead event planned for Thursday evening was cancelled as a result of the outbreak, and ticket buyers were refunded. Selby and Miers added: “We want to make sure that our time and efforts are being spent with our teams so that we can get the restaurants affected back up and running as soon as possible, and that any staff and customers affected can make a speedy recovery.”"
2016-11-05T10:00:44Z,uk-news,UK news,You look familiar: on patrol with the Met’s super-recognisers,"When Gary Collins arrived at work in Stoke Newington police station, east London, in January last year he was told a teenage boy had been stabbed to death. Jeremie Malenge, 17, was found slumped on the road with stab wounds in his chest. There was CCTV footage of the boy being chased by three figures wearing sports clothes. After they saw the video, the murder investigation team called Collins. The 48-year-old police officer is wirily framed and casually dressed. He grew up in Hackney; as a teenager he never imagined he was going to end up in the police force, but he has been an officer for 21 years. His speciality is identification. “I get called up all the time,” he says. “I’m usually the person who is shown images first.” We are in a bland-looking council building near the town hall where Collins works as part of the Gang Unit. After the Malenge murder the investigation team drove him to Hackney Central station. They led him into a cubicle and showed him CCTV footage of the suspects running through the station. It was poorly lit and the attackers were a shadowy blur, their faces largely obscured. Collins studied the video and immediately identified two of the figures, from memory, based on the few facial features he could make out. The third figure also looked familiar. Later that weekend, Collins was watching a rap video on his mobile phone (many of the characters he ran into on the street made rap videos) and realised one of the men in the video was the third figure in the footage. When he returned to work he supplied the third name. Detectives quickly found and charged the three men Collins had identified – and a woman who had not appeared in the CCTV footage – with murder. They went on trial at the Old Bailey that July. Collins gave evidence and was cross-examined regarding his identifications. On 21 August 2015, the jury convicted all four suspects of murder; the following month they were all sentenced to between 12 and 18 years. Collins had realised soon after joining the police force in 1995 that he had a particular gift. “I was very good at looking at pictures on walls and going out on patrol and saying, ‘That’s that person.’” He recalls “stopping people once and remembering them years later”. While working with the Gang Unit, Collins would patrol the streets encouraging young people to steer away from crime. “I know burglars, drug addicts, pickpockets; people from all walks of life,” he says. That street knowledge became particularly helpful following the London riots in 2011. “I was off at the time,” he says, “but I was watching Sky News and I immediately recognised some people.” Collins cut short his holiday to go into work and was tasked with identifying the rioters. “I spent six months going through the CCTV,” he says. “The figures in the footage would often have their faces covered – there were lots I identified just by their eyes.” Collins eventually named 190 people, the most identifications by any one officer in the Metropolitan police. Some 90% of these were made from street knowledge and memory.
Most of the people that Collins identifies in Hackney are young men he has never met but seen only on screens. He often sees them in the flesh for the first time when he provides testimony in court. “I was in court the other day and the defendant was sitting close by with his barrister,” he tells me, “and he asked who had identified him. The barrister pointed at me and the guy said, ‘Who the fucking hell is he? I don’t know him!’” The news of Collins’ success brought him to the attention of Mick Neville and Paul Smith at Scotland Yard. Neville had researched the use of CCTV in the court system and discovered that it was very poorly used by the police. This prompted him and Smith to set up a special unit to collate and share images of unidentified criminals. Next they had to find officers who could help them sort through the images. During the riots certain names kept recurring, of officers who were recognising more people than any of their colleagues. Smith and Neville visited police stations, holding open surgeries to ask which officers were making the most identifications. “Some officers were making one or two,” says Smith, “and others were making repeat identifications week after week.” Carla Snook was one of those officers. She is 39, cheerful and bubbly, with straight long blond hair. When she was a young girl and went on holiday with her family, Snook would be convinced she was spotting children who had gone to her school. “But they didn’t,” she says, “it was people I had seen at the airport, or in fleeting glances on the beach or on the plane. I would mention it to my parents and they would think I was crazy.” Snook joined the police force 13 years ago and worked in Belgravia, west London, on the Safer Neighbourhoods intelligence desk. She would often look at Caught On Camera – a Met publication featuring images of unidentified suspects that is released on the intranet and displayed around police buildings. Snook would regularly recognise people on the list. “One day one of my colleagues said, ‘Mate, you’re really good at this – I am going to flag you up to the Met.’” Snook met Smith, who told her he was setting up a special unit of police officers with extraordinary powers of face recognition. Did she want to join?
The Super-recogniser Unit is based on the third floor of a grey stone police building in Lambeth in south London. It is the only unit of its kind in the world. It was set up in May 2015, and moved from Scotland Yard in July; the charts showing the criminals they have identified and cases they are currently working on are still to be unpacked. The team consists of six officers – five men and one woman. Snook is usually at her desk by eight in the morning. “We are all quite driven,” she says. “We would much rather sit there and try to find these people than go home – we’re a bit sad really.” Alongside the super-recognisers working full-time in the unit, there are around 150 working in police departments across London. (Smith wanted Collins to join the unit, but his borough refused to release him: he was too valuable.) Since it was established, the unit has made 2,250 identifications. “We account for just under a quarter of all identifications within the Met,” says Eliot Porritt, the 36-year-old former beat cop who heads the unit, “which is crazy because there are just six of us – and 32,000 officers.” This success has drawn police forces from around the world to London. After hundreds of women were sexually assaulted in a mass attack in Cologne on New Year’s Eve, the German police invited the London super-recognisers to assist them. Porritt and Andy Eyles, who joined the Met 10 years ago and has been with the unit since last winter, spent two weeks in Cologne. They studied the video footage and gave advice on how the authorities could use CCTV more effectively. “They had previously been using the CCTV to find the suspects,” says Eyles, “but our suggestion was to follow the victims – then you would see the suspects coming up to them.” They also identified and mentored three German officers who potentially had enhanced identification skills. Ten super-recognisers were deployed in the inquiry into the murder of Alice Gross. The 14-year-old went missing as she walked along a canal towpath in August 2014. The 600 police officers who joined the search for her made the Met operation the biggest since the 7/7 bombings. One of the team from Neville and Smith’s unit examined the grainy footage of Gross as she walked along a canal. He noticed a man on a bicycle following the same route 12 minutes later. They tracked the man via CCTV as he disappeared into an off-licence and cycled to the river Brent. The next time he was spotted on camera was later in the evening, dressed in different clothes. This prompted a fresh search of where the man had been seen and that eventually led to the discovery of Alice Gross’s body. The man was later identified as Arnis Zalkalns, but by the time police found him he had hanged himself.
One of the key tactics for the team is linking offences together, which they call “snapping”. “We will go into the database and put in a description of, say, a white male with a bald head and glasses,” says unit coordinator Smith, “and then the super-recognisers will go through the images and when they think they have seen the same person they will start linking them together.” The more crimes that can be connected, the longer the potential sentence. For example, Austin Caballero had 40 convictions for shoplifting, totalling more than £100,000 of luxury goods, and also one count of racially aggravated assault. He was sentenced in April to three and a half years for the thefts and an additional three months for the assault. Michael Prabucki was sentenced in August to four years’ imprisonment for 39 convictions for shoplifting. And Neville Stanbury was sentenced in October to four and a half years for 40 offences after the super-recognisers made 31 identifications. Each unsolved crime was a failed case that had been shut down until the unit linked them to the same person. The team also attend major concerts to ensure known thieves do not gain entry. “They have images [of suspects] stored in their brain,” says Smith, “and they go to the concert and stop them from getting in. Arctic Monkeys got hit for 140 phones on one night; in London we did two nights, and during those two nights five phones were stolen.” Pete Williams, a greying, quietly spoken 40-year-old member of the unit, was instructed to attend a Libertines gig. “There was a small, organised gang who had been following the band around Europe and stealing phones,” he says. “We had been given images of those people and were at the front of the security, stopping several people. Crime was pretty much nil that night.”
Andy Eyles was a police officer working in south London, interviewing people in custody, when he was called to join the unit. He is 36, and shaven-headed with a five o’clock shadow. Before he joined the Met, he used to run pubs, clubs and restaurants. “I would remember that someone came into the pub three months ago,” he says. “My wife would say I had a really good memory, but I just thought hers was rubbish.” He says he enjoys staring at a screen for 10 hours a day. “We get obsessed with our jobs. I am quite happy going through 20,000 images looking for a distinctive earlobe.” The ability to never forget a face may be immensely helpful in fighting crime, but it means super-recognisers are never off-duty. “I will be walking with my wife and kids and be saying, ‘He’s a druggie, he’s a shoplifter,’” he says. “And my wife will say, ‘We were having a nice day out and now we are surrounded by criminals.’” Recently, Snook was in King’s Cross station with her children when a man walked past. “He looked a bit iffy, so I said to my children to stay close to me,” she says. One week later she received an alert about a high-risk missing person. She knew from the picture it was the man she had seen. She called the Missing Persons Unit and told them she had seen him the previous week. “The woman on the phone was a bit blase and I am not sure she believed me,” says Snook, “and then I told her I worked at the Super-recogniser Unit.” Within an hour British Transport police had located the man. “I am always jumping off buses and trains because I have seen someone,” Collins says. “I was coming back from court and I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences. Once I had to stop the car three times – I would take one person in and then on the way to the station I saw someone else who was wanted, so I picked them up, and then as we were driving I saw someone else.” This degree of commitment can be mentally draining. “I have found that since doing this my short-term memory is just diabolical,” says Snook. “I guess all my brainpower goes into remembering faces. I was taking the tea and coffee orders recently and by the time I got to the kettle I had forgotten them.”
Is there anything different about the brain of a super-recogniser? One autumn afternoon, James Rabbett, 35, travelled from Scotland Yard’s offices to the University of Greenwich to find out. Rabbett joined the Super-recogniser Unit after winning awards for being the highest arresting officer in the country, making 200 arrests in just one year. Rabbett was met at the university by Dr Josh Davis, who has been researching super-recognisers since 2008. Davis and his assistant led Rabbett into a ground-floor room where they pulled a pale blue rubber hat that looked like a swimming cap over his head. The cap had sensors attached that measured electrical activity from different parts of Rabbett’s brain. He was then shown two series of 20 images and asked if any of the original images were repeated. This was done with seven batches of images. Rabbett then went into another room and sat behind a computer screen. He was shown photographs of eight people with one page per person. On each page the people were shown from various angles and distances, wearing different clothes. The research assistant explained that Rabbett would be shown a series of video clips and should look out for the people on the pages. They might appear once, twice or not at all, and he had to say how sure he was. The video was 18 minutes long. The first scene was people walking along a riverbank towards and away from the camera. Rabbett studied the photographs on the sheets of paper, one by one. He watched attentively and then stopped the video. “I would say this is my first sighting,” he said, “this girl here. I am saying it is her based on her hair, she has quite a long face and a big nose. If you look at the line of her eyebrows, I think her left eye is slightly lower than her right, so for me that is my first call.”
The second clip was from a shopping street. He eventually stopped the film and held up a photograph of a woman against the screen. “The jaw line is very strong, a high hairline combed the opposite way to the photograph, but you can see it is quite high. The eyes are quite close together.” Davis describes what was going on inside Rabbett’s brain: “We are finding differences in brain patterns. It is about the speed of responses.” The brains of super-recognisers appear to process certain information faster than the rest of us. Davis also says that there is some suggestion that “one part of the brain, known as the fusiform gyrus, which seems to be specialised for the processing of faces and to some extent other images – that bit tends to light up for faces more than other objects.” The term “super-recogniser” was first used in a study published in 2009 in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. The authors focused on four case studies who seemed exceptionally good at remembering faces. The study suggested that super-recognisers represented the extreme opposite to prosopagnosics – otherwise known as people with face blindness. The authors suggested that just as prosopagnosia affects 1-2% of the population, it was reasonable to assume that another 1-2% were super-recognisers. Those in the unit that Davis is testing are among the top 1% of that group. At present, the police get only 5% of identifications from members of the public; are there citizens out there with these talents who could help the police? “We may start using a mixture of civilians and officers,” suggests Porritt, “because there may be people out there with wild talents for this. There is no reason they could not come along and make the initial match, and then we do all the stuff that requires a warrant.” One police force has suggested testing those in Neighbourhood Watch schemes. Using more super-recognisers, claims Davis, could “reduce crime in the first place because if you think you are going to get caught on camera there is a massive incentive not to commit a crime.” Collins is not convinced. “Would it stop them committing crime?” he asks. “Possibly, or maybe they would just cover up more.”
Of course, super-recognisers are not super-human: they do sometimes get it wrong. Identifications alone are rarely used as evidence; they are usually a starting point for police to find witnesses or supporting forensic evidence. “We are not infallible,” says Porritt. “But what does seem to be the case is that super-recognisers get it wrong less often.” The success of the super-recognisers relies not only on their innate abilities but also on the ubiquity of CCTV. There are thought to be around 400,000 CCTV cameras in London and more than 4m across Britain – and that doesn’t include private recordings from cameras in businesses and homes. In April, Hampshire police asked for help investigating a brutal hammer attack on a 17-year‑old girl. Snook and Williams were sent to examine CCTV footage. Mobile phone data had led them to a particular street, which then gave them an image of a suspect. What they needed to do was find him in other footage that would help identify him. “It was my first big deployment,” says Snook, “and it was for a really horrific crime by someone who was previously unknown.” Working together, and watching hours and hours of video, they were able to locate the suspect in a car park and track him to his car. This gave the police a registration plate; they managed to arrest him as he was getting into the car. The man, James Hemming, had never been arrested, but his DNA matched that found at the scene. Hemming pleaded guilty in early September to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He will be sentenced in December. “That was really fulfilling,” says Snook. “I get such satisfaction out of identifying someone who thinks they have got away with a crime.” Porritt and Smith would like all new and existing police recruits to be tested for their facial recognition skills. “In 1902, when fingerprints were first used to solve crime, there was a lot of scepticism,” says Smith. “I believe super-recognisers are the way forward.” If about 1-2% of the population have super-recogniser ability, and there are roughly 48,000 officers and police staff in the Met, “we have 480 super-recognisers lurking around that we need to find”. Snook has some ideas about where to find the next generation of people-spotters. As a girl watching television with her family, “I would say, ‘That’s so and so, and he was in the other show,’ and they would say, ‘How do you remember that?’” she recalls, “and I would say, ‘I remember his face.’” She now has two young children aged five and six. “My daughter will point out people we have seen out shopping,” she says. “We might have seen them days earlier in another part of town. And when they are watching the TV they do exactly as I did. It freaks me out.” Snook told Davis, and she has given permission to have her children tested. She knows that one day they will be asked the same question she has been asked so often, and she knows the answer she will advise they give. “When people ask how I do it, I just say I don’t know,” she says. “My brain just does it – does yours not?” • Are you a super-recogniser?

2016-11-05T20:44:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Police urged to reconstruct death fall at Pete Doherty party,"A forensic science expert whose investigation into the death of Mark Blanco indicated that foul play may have been involved has called for the Metropolitan police to cooperate on a new joint investigation that would recreate the events of the night. Blanco, an aspiring actor, died 10 years ago next month after falling from the balcony of a flat in East London where the rock star Pete Doherty was at a party with friends. Police initially suggested that the death was a suicide, but a coroner rejected this explanation. Blanco’s mother, Sheila, believes her son was unlawfully killed. John Kennedy, a forensic video analyst who worked on the Jamie Bulger case, said CCTV footage suggested that Blanco did not go over the balcony railings of his own accord. “If he had vaulted over the railings, his body would have been in an entirely different position,” Kennedy said. “His body was limp, there’s no defensive action as he nears the ground.”
Kennedy believes that recreating the fall in a simulation exercise – and comparing it with the original CCTV footage – would allow all parties to establish if Blanco had been dropped off or pushed off the balcony. “We would have to have the streets sealed off. The best way to do this is a joint exercise with the Met police. Whether it helps the Blanco family’s campaign or the police version of events, so be it. We would replicate exactly what happened on the night and contrast and compare and come up with a plausible explanation that would be accepted by all parties.” The Blanco family’s lawyer, Michael Wolkind, welcomed the proposal. “We have an expert ready to demonstrate that Mark was pushed or thrown off the balcony. If a reconstruction at the scene now takes place, then maybe even a police force apparently allergic to crime will start a full fresh investigation and help a grieving family.” On the night of the fall, Blanco, 30, an accomplished magician and antiquarian bookseller, had attended a party at the East London flat of Paul Roundhill, a friend of Doherty. Blanco was said to have been excited about a play he was putting on, Accidental Death of an Anarchist, in which the protagonist is thrown to his death. After Blanco apparently badgered Doherty to come and see the play, Roundhill and the singer’s minder, Johnny Jeannevol, evicted him from the party. Roundhill has admitted to setting fire to Blanco’s hat and punching him in the process. Soon afterwards Blanco returned to the block of flats. A witness said he heard swearing and shouting in the stairwell in the seconds before Blanco fell. Shortly afterwards, CCTV footage shows Doherty, a female friend and Jeannevol running away. All deny any involvement in Blanco’s death. A confession by Jeannevol that he killed Blanco was retracted. Sheila Blanco is critical of the police investigation into her son’s death. Having insisted that he fell from a first-floor balcony, an expert report commissioned by the Met claims it was the second floor – outside Roundhill’s flat. “Why wasn’t this discovered before?” she asked. “What have they been doing for the last eight years?” The second-floor balcony has limited clearance between the railing and the ceiling of the stairwell from which it looks out. “Mark wouldn’t have been able to climb out there because of his height, he was six foot four,” Sheila Blanco said. Analysis of CCTV images by Kennedy for BBC Newsnight indicated that Blanco’s fall was consistent with someone being carried and dropped over the balcony edge. But the Met report suggests there is no evidence from the CCTV footage that anyone else was present when Blanco fell. A Met spokesman said: “In January 2016, the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] provided a further report to the Blanco family’s legal representative. The report addressed issues highlighted by the Blanco family in October 2013 with regard to CCTV footage relevant to the circumstances surrounding Mr Blanco’s death. To date the MPS has received no response from Mr Blanco’s family in relation to the MPS report finding.” The spokesman added: “We are not prepared to give a running commentary on an ongoing investigation.” Sheila Blanco hopes that the 10th anniversary of her son’s death – to be commemorated with a concert at Westminster cathedral hall later this month – will bring forward fresh information. A decade after her son’s death, his grave still has no headstone. “I won’t have it put up until I get some answers,” she said. “When he was dying I vowed to him I would find out what happened, and I intend to do that.”"
2016-11-06T07:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,"In interesting times, we’re stuck with a dull and cautious chancellor","Philip Hammond will be a cautious chancellor: that much is becoming clear. Not for him the fireworks that became a familiar sight whenever George Osborne presented a budget – some of which went off in his face. Hammond will be less concerned with manufacturing tricks designed to cheer his backbench colleagues than with the fate of manufacturing itself and British industry more widely. In this respect, he is the Conservative party’s answer to Alistair Darling – an unflappable curator of the public finances, steering the economy through choppy waters. This means that on both sides of the house, MPs are braced for one of the dullest chancellorships in their lifetimes. They only have to look at Hammond’s forgettable time as foreign secretary to know that the highs and lows could be indistinguishable. When he stands up to deliver his first autumn statement, on 23 November, Hammond will report that the economy has fared better than had been expected through the Brexit turmoil, so the need for government action was limited. All the signs are that he will announce a smattering of relatively inexpensive infrastructure projects, mostly with repackaged money, and talk about some longer-range business tax reforms. He’ll be keeping his powder dry until the March 2017 budget. By then, the Treasury will be in a better position to judge the impact of imported inflation – from higher costs for petrol, mobile phones, food and cars – and how well or badly the economy is responding. Inflation is the threat to living standards that lurks inside every economic model at the moment. It is the referendum-induced strychnine sent to poison family incomes. So far, the major forecasters vary in their verdict on the extent to which the low pound will push up prices in the shops. The National Institute for Economic & Social Research (NIESR) believes it will be a quick and dirty affair, with inflation rising rapidly to 4% before dropping back by 2019 to the Bank of England’s 2% target. Threadneedle Street has outlined a smoother path, limiting inflation to 3% next year, but easing it back over the next three years and keeping it above the 2% target until at least 2020. Whichever path inflation follows, it will eat into wages and cut households’ disposable incomes. NIESR has pencilled in a 0.5% cut in per capita disposable incomes in 2017, which is the first drop in household spending power for four years and would take the UK back to a time when this was an unhappy country. If wage rises stick at around 2% for the rest of the parliament, the Bank of England’s forecast means there will be effectively no pay increase for the average worker until 2020. Hammond will not have forgotten that it was only in 2011 that several British cities experienced rebellions against austerity that involved riots and arson attacks. He has pledged to loosen Osborne’s spending restrictions, but the suspicion must be that, just like with his tentative support for the economy, households will be forced to manage on a few crumbs. There will be some extra money to top up universal credit payments. And government departments will get some extra cash to prevent their services from falling over. However, the prospect of an £84bn black hole in the government’s finances by 2020 is going to be his main concern. This forecast, from the Resolution Foundation thinktank, represents the widening gap between the Office for Budget Responsibility’s March forecast and the likely outcome, and assumes a hard Brexit, soft austerity outcome. Such a shortfall will leave the budget deficit £23bn shy of where Osborne expected it to be in 2020. So any extra spending will push the deficit even higher, say those urging caution. Last week the boss of NIESR, Jagjit Chadha, said international investors might make a run for the exit, selling UK government securities as they go, should the chancellor appear reckless. The warning, which echoes the post-2008 crash fears that cast Britain as the next Greece, envisages a fall in demand for government bonds and a subsequent increase in the interest rate the Treasury pays on government debt, only adding to the costs of Brexit. But just as in 2008, with the world awash with cash trying to find a safe home, it is difficult to see how the government will face more than a mild jolt to its borrowing costs, especially when Hammond would simply be increasing public investment budgets that were cut so brutally during Osborne’s reign. Trade minister Liam Fox and his allies want to head off a spending splurge that would cement in the public’s mind the costs of leaving the EU. “There’s no reason to panic,” he said last week. “If you go on a spending spree, then people will think there’s a reason to panic.” But Fox is wrong, as he is about most things. Consumer confidence has started to fall again after a brief recovery in August and September. Sales of private car sales, for so long the engine of the economy, have fallen in every month since April. And this, according to official statisticians, is before higher import costs have fed through to the high street. What will Mr Cautious do about that? Take some sort of bold action? Don’t hold your breath."
2016-11-06T10:57:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Germany fears UK may quit spy programme because of Brexit,"Germany fears Britain may pull out of a key intelligence-sharing programme in May next year, a move that it says would create a “moment of weakness” in the fight against terrorism and jeopardise security across the EU. As the continent remains on alert for terrorist attacks, Berlin is understood to view intelligence as Britain’s primary contribution to European collaboration, and fears it could use future cooperation as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Germany is already lobbying the British government to renew its role in Europe’s law enforcement agency, Europol, before its current collaboration runs out on 1 May 2017. In a response to a parliamentary question submitted by Germany’s Left party, Angela Merkel’s government confirmed that it believed the European commission should encourage the UK to remain in Europol. Doing so was in Britain’s interest, the document produced by the German interior ministry said, because “collaborating and sharing information via Europol can help the UK prevent and fight terrorism and serious crime”. After a series of attempted terrorist attacks over the summer and a politically charged debate about the risks of Merkel’s stance during the refugee crisis, German politicians in particular are concerned that Britain could use its large intelligence capacities as a bargaining chip. “Recent attacks and arrests of suspected terrorists have shown that a close collaboration between international security agencies is indispensable,” said Stephan Mayer, the interior policy spokesperson of Merkel’s CDU/CSU party group. “Even after a possible Brexit, the fight against terrorism will remain an enormous challenge for European states; and this naturally applies to Europol’s work too. “All those responsible have to guarantee that this cooperation continues successfully and without friction in spite of a Brexit. The international fight against Islamic extremism and terrorism cannot afford a moment of weakness.”European governments and Brussels officials have been emphasising in public that there can be no pre-negotiations with Britain, however informal, until May officially informs the EU of its intention to leave by triggering article 50. Before October’s European council meeting in Brussels, German government officials vehemently denied that security cooperation would form part of the discussions at the summit. But the EU’s united front has been undermined by some inconvenient timetabling. On 1 May 2017, a month after the deadline May has given herself for triggering article 50, the European Union will adopt a regulation that expands the role of the European parliament and national EU legislatures in supervising Europol’s operations. On Friday, May told EU officials that she would stick to her deadline in spite of the high court’s decision that her government must get parliamentary approval to trigger article 50. Some MPs have suggested the need to draft new legislation may further squeeze the planned timetable. The UK is not part of the border-free Schengen zone and has an opt-in into Europol, which will automatically expire as soon as the new rules come into effect. By dropping out of Europol, the UK would automatically be shut out of a number of other agencies and intelligence cooperation programmes, such as the Schengen-wide information system SIS II. A Home Office spokesman pointed to recent comments made by Brandon Lewis, the policing minister, who said no decision had yet been taken on Europol. “The decision on whether we opt into the further Europol regulations will be announced to parliament shortly. We will take that decision very soon; we are giving good consideration to where we are on that and will make an announcement to parliament in due course,” he said. Last week Lewis confirmed in a letter that the UK would press ahead with an opt-in to the Prüm convention, an EU-wide system for sharing DNA samples, fingerprints and vehicle registration. A report (pdf) by the German parliament’s academic service recently raised alarm over the hole that Brexit could leave in Europe’s security network, and pointed out that the UK would no longer have direct access to Europol’s databases. Europol, which is based in The Hague, started operations in 1999 and is funded through the EU budget. It has a British director, Rob Wainwright, and according to a spokesperson, 40% of its cases have a “British dimension”. German government officials told the Guardian that there was still hope in Berlin that as a former home secretary, May would appreciate the value of cooperating on counter-terrorism measures. In a private speech at Goldman Sachs before the EU referendum, recently leaked to the Guardian, May expressly argued that British security was best served by remaining in Europe. The German Left party MP Andrej Hunko, who submitted the query to the government, said that although the UK had been one of the main drivers behind Europol’s engagement in covert intelligence networking, Britain opting out of the agency could potentially give rise to even more informal and less democratically accountable forms of information-sharing. “After Brexit, the strengthening of informal structures such as the police working group on terrorism and the Club de Berne could become a major cause for concern”, Hunko said. “These institutions don’t form part of the European Union and are thus harder to control by either delegates in the European parliament or our national parliaments, with national governments remaining as secretive about such networks as they can.” From the position of the German Left party, Hunko said, “the question of whether British police should remain part of Europol is therefore a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea”."
2016-11-06T14:08:24Z,uk-news,UK news,"School reports Muslim boy, 7, to police over 'bullet' that was piece of brass","A Catholic primary school in the Midlands reported a seven-year-old Muslim pupil to police after mistaking a piece of brass the boy had for a bullet. The boy was “very distressed and intimidated” when two officers were sent to his home to try to interview him, his mother told Tell Mama, a charity that monitors Islamophobia. St Edward’s school in Birmingham contacted police after the boy claimed a brass cylinder was a bullet for a rifle and told teachers his teenage brother, who had been on an army cadet course, had held a weapon. The boy’s mother, who has not been named but is an academic at a West Midlands university, said her child would not have been reported to police if he were not a Muslim. Angry that the school failed to tell her it had contacted police, she refused to let officers question her son when they visited her home last month.
Speaking to Tell Mama, the mother said: “It immediately became apparent that neither the school nor the police thought it was a real bullet, yet nobody thought to use some common sense. Instead it was unduly escalated and left my seven-year-old very distressed and intimidated that police officers were insisting to question him directly. “It is ridiculous that no one used any common sense and that it was ever taken any further by both the school and the police. “I am also very angry about the way the matter was escalated. They – the school and the police – were heavy-handed and placed undue suspicion on a seven-year-old. They caused him a lot of distress that could have been avoided. They left him mistrusting his teachers after they told him it would be a matter to discuss only with parents and they dealt with us as parents in a way they would not deal with non-Muslim parents.” She told the Sunday Times: “I don’t think the school would have escalated it if we were not Muslim. It was almost as though we needed to prove our innocence rather than they would need to prove that they had a reasonable basis for questioning us or proving our guilt.” She added: “I don’t want to sue the police or the school but I do want my issue highlighted for them and other schools to know that they just can’t do that. They can’t deal with Muslim children in a different way from anybody else and they can’t bypass the parents.” But Joanne Kennett, the headteacher at St Edward’s, insisted the school would have taken the same action for a child of another religion. She told the Sunday Times: “As a Catholic school, all our children are treated equally and we pride ourselves on the diversity of our pupil intake and community. There have been disclosures made of a similar nature from children who were not from Muslim families and the same course of action has been taken.” West Midlands police said officers were called to the school and then the boy’s home after it reported “a pupil had brought a bullet into class”. A spokesman said: “The item was examined and found not to be a bullet and no further action was taken.” DCI Nick Dale said: “Officers will always thoroughly investigate any reports of unlawful guns and ammunition that are reported in the community.”"
2016-11-07T00:08:30Z,uk-news,UK news,NHS seeks to reduce winter deaths as sub-zero weather looms across UK,"Sub-zero temperatures are expected to sweep across Britain this week after the first cold snap of the year, prompting warnings that vulnerable people should prepare for a freezing winter. The chilly weather coincides with the launch of a major NHS campaign urging people with long-term health conditions and the over-65s to take action in an effort to reduce the 25,000 extra deaths that occur each winter. Prof Keith Willett, medical director for acute care at NHS England, said: “It is vital that the most vulnerable people take preventative steps to keep healthy and stay well. We have a high number of A&E attendances over this time that are due to issues that could have been avoided had people sought advice at the first sign of illness.” The Stay Well This Winter campaign will use TV, radio and social media to encourage people to wrap up warm and consult a pharmacist as soon as they feel unwell rather than waiting. It also encourages people, particularly those with long-term illnesses or mobility problems, to heat their homes to at least 18C (65F) and to check on friends and neighbours who may be vulnerable. Prof Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said: “With winter on the way, now is a good time to make sure you, and those you know who may be particularly at risk from the cold, are as prepared as possible. If you qualify for the free flu jab, get it now. “Also remember that eating a healthy, balanced diet and that staying physically active can keep you healthy.” He added that assistance with heating costs is available to those who might need it. “There are a variety of ways you can apply for help to keep your house warm, such as winter fuel payments, warm home discounts and cold weather payments. If you meet the criteria, register for priority service with your energy and water suppliers. “Try to maintain indoor temperatures to at least 18°C (65°F), particularly if you find it hard to get around, have a long-term illness or are 65 or over. You may prefer your living room to be slightly warmer,” he said. Cold weather increases the risk of heart failure, kidney disease, stroke or dementia, as well as making heart attacks and strokes more likely. For each degree centigrade the temperature falls below five degrees, there is a 10% increase in the number of older people seeing their GP about breathing problems, a 0.8% increase in emergency hospital admissions, and a 3.4% increase in deaths, research shows. The UK shivered through a chilly Bonfire night, as temperatures fell below freezing in places, snow fell on higher ground and biting winds made conditions feel colder. On Sunday night temperatures outside the south-east were expected to fall below zero across much of the country. Tom Crocker, a forecaster at the Met Office, said the cold snap is likely to last: “The forecast over the next few days is staying rather chilly.” The BBC expects Monday night to be the coldest so far this winter, leading to widespread frost. Crocker expected Monday to be bright but cold across much of the country.
“Tuesday looks like being another relatively bright day, but we have got quite persistent rain moving in from the west on Tuesday afternoon,” he said. Snow is expected to be widespread on higher ground. The precipitation is likely to make Tuesday night warmer, he said, although it is still likely to be below freezing in rural areas. “It will be turning a little bit milder towards the end of the week, but still chilly and unsettled,” Crocker said. Temperatures are expected to move into the low double figures, especially in the south.

2016-11-07T07:20:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Bedford jail prisoners riot over lockdowns 'caused by staff shortages',"The Prison Service is to launch an investigation after a riot at Bedford Prison which reportedly saw up to 200 inmates go on the rampage. The disturbance was “successfully resolved” late on Sunday night after riot officers spent more than six hours trying to bring the disorder under control. Scores of prisoners flooded the jail’s gangways in chaotic scenes after the disturbance broke out shortly after 5pm. A Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison officers and staff from the emergency services have successfully resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners at HMP Bedford. An investigation into this incident will take place. We are absolutely clear that prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and could spend significantly longer behind bars.” There were no injuries to prison staff but two inmates were treated for injuries that were not thought to be serious.
Richard Fuller, MP for Bedford and Kempston, will put an “urgent question” to justice secretary Liz Truss in parliament on Monday, local media reported. Specialist riot officers were deployed at the category B prison in Bedford town centre after the riot broke out on Sunday afternoon, with police cordoning off an area outside and emergency services on stand-by. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association (POA) said some guards were forced to retreat to a “safe place” while large numbers of prisoners ran amok. Sources told the Press Association the riot spread over more than one wing inside the prison, and footage supposedly from inside the facility – though unverified – posted online revealed chaotic scenes with scores of prisoners shouting and bellowing in walkways and gangways. At around 11pm, about half an hour before the riot was brought under control, there were reports of loud bangs or explosions coming from inside the prison. The disorder comes after the chairman of the POA Mike Rolfe last week warned British jails had been engulfed by a “bloodbath”. Gillan said: “The POA has been warning about this situation of violence in our prisons – it would appear it’s coming to fruition. I just hope there’s no prisoners or indeed prison officers injured in the violence.” HMP Bedford, which has been on its current site since 1801, currently holds around 500 inmates, according to an HM Inspectorate of Prisons report in September. The watchdog’s report found inmates claimed it was easier to get drugs than clothes or bedsheets at a prison where standards had deteriorated to “unacceptable levels”. A survey found the number of prisoners saying it was easy or very easy to get drugs had almost doubled since the last inspection of the jail in February 2014. The number saying they had developed a drug problem while at the prison increased from 4% to 14%. The HMP inspection in May also found that the physical condition of the prison was poor, with many inmates living in cramped conditions. The report detailed damaged furniture, graffiti, shortages of clothing and dirty, unscreened showers. The report also said: “Arrangements for managing violent and bullying behaviour and supporting victims were weak.” The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, tweeted:"
2016-11-07T09:19:33Z,uk-news,UK news,British teacher wanted by Myanmar police after colleague found dead,"A British teacher being sought by police in Myanmar after a fellow expat was found dead in his flat after a night out drinking is believed to have fled the country. Harris Binotti, 25, is wanted by police in Yangon, the country’s former capital, on suspicion of carrying out an attack on Gary Ferguson, 47, also from Britain, with whom he had been drinking on Friday night.
Ferguson was discovered with wounds to the chest and neck on Sunday morning, after calls to his mobile phone by his wife went unanswered, according to a police statement. Myanmar’s ministry of information said Binotti had left the country on Sunday, but gave no further details on his whereabouts. “The defendant of the case left from Yangon international airport by Thai Airways on the evening of 5 November,” it said.
The case was opened at Kyauktada township police station, in the heart of Yangon, the commercial capital, near the Sule Pagoda. According to the police statement, Binotti and Ferguson, who both work for Horizon international school, spent Friday night partying at the Uptown hotel in Yangon before returning to Binotti’s home. Speaking on condition of anonymity, neighbours in three nearby apartments said they heard two men and a woman arguing between midnight and 4.30am on Saturday. “At that time we were sleeping, someone was smashing the walls, smashing the floors,” one said. “At around 4.30am we didn’t hear anything.” A neighbour said: “It sounded like fighting, something like that. Then silence.” They said Binotti and his girlfriend, named by police as fellow teacher Elsie Devolder, had rented the apartment for several months, mostly leaving for work in the early morning and returning late at night. “I can’t speak English and they can’t speak Burmese so we didn’t speak too much, just if they went out somewhere they said ‘bye’,” said one neighbour. Devolder’s Facebook page was active early on Monday but is not accessible now. Over the weekend her profile photo was changed to a black square. Police identified the victim’s wife as Supatchaya Sichompor. She declined to comment when contacted by phone on Monday. The police account is based on interviews with the two women, who told authorities that they discovered the body together on Sunday morning after several phone calls to the victim went unanswered. Police have not detained anyone and a woman believed to be Devolder was seen leaving the apartment on Monday afternoon when she was confronted by journalists waiting outside. “Why did it take you so long to report the body?” the BBC’s Jonah Fisher asked the woman as she shielded her face with a scarf and hurried to a waiting car.
Horizon’s director of studies told Agence France-Presse the school had heard that Ferguson died after he suffered a “hard blow to his chest and his head”. Ferguson had worked there for a year while Binotti had been there for about three months, a school spokesman was quoted as saying by the Press Association. The spokesman said: “We don’t know exactly what happened. They were together and they had been drinking and enjoying the night and after that he was found dead on Sunday morning. They were friends but they had been drinking. He [Mr Binotti] is now missing and there is an investigation. “We send our condolences to Mr Ferguson’s family.” The Foreign Office said it was providing help and support to the family and was in touch with local authorities.Myanmar has experienced an increase in the number of foreigners working in the country since it started opening up to the outside world in 2011 after decades of military rule. A handful of international schools have also opened up in that time, creating opportunities for English-language teachers. A Facebook page for Binotti shows that he had a number of different jobs before taking up a post as an English teacher in Yangon.

The fugitives, who reportedly fooled prison staff by leaving makeshift mannequins in their beds, were named by Scotland Yard as Matthew Baker, 28, convicted two weeks ago of attempted murder, and James Whitlock, 31, who was on remand after being charged with conspiracy to burgle cash machines. Officers advised people not to approach the two men, who they said may be dangerous. Baker was in jail for stabbing a man 25 times in Dagenham, east London. It is understood the pair used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through their cell bars before scaling an outer perimeter wall. A male visitor to the prison, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was told the runaways had folded bedsheets into the shape of mannequins to fool staff into believing they were still asleep. A female visitor, who also wished to remain anonymous, said a prisoner had told her the two men escaped through a cell window on the fifth floor. She said it was rumoured they had used bedsheets to lower themselves down. She said: “They cut one of the bars and then they came down through the window. They are assuming that it was probably bedsheets and it was at night.” A Metropolitan police statement said officers were called to the prison at 11.44am on Monday. It is assumed that the breakout happened during the night and the prison authorities only discovered the mannequins on Monday morning. Whitlock is described as a white man of slim build. He has the word “Tracy” tattooed on his torso. Baker is described as a white man with ginger hair. It is not known what clothing either had with them when escaping. The two escapees had been held in the same cell in Pentonville’s G wing. It is also where Jamal Mahmoud, 21, was fatally stabbed with a “hunting-style knife” last month in an attack that left two other prisoners critically injured. Escapes from inside prisons have become extremely rare in recent years, with only two recorded in 2015-16 and no more than two being recorded in any financial year since 2007-08. But the Pentonville escape comes just two weeks after an escape from a prison in the north-west, adding to the deepening prisons crisis facing the justice secretary, Liz Truss.
The Prison Service had to move more than 200 prisoners from Bedford jail after they severely damaged two wings in a six-hour riot on Sunday. Truss recently outlined her prison safety and reform plans, including the recruitment of 2,500 new prison officers and the imposition of no-fly zones to stop drones dropping drugs and other contraband into jails. The Prison Governors Association said the Pentonville escape marked a new low for the Prison Service as it was “an institutional failure in one of our most core functions – keeping prisoners in custody”. Before the Pentonville escape became known, prison governors warned on Monday that the disorder at HMP Bedford at the weekend “may indicate the start of similar disturbances or worse to come”. It was a warning that was all too quickly fulfilled. “The old Victorian prisons are squalid and vermin-infested and governors do not have direct access to the funds to tackle it. Prison cells have been vandalised and prisoners have access to drugs and mobile phones, some delivered by drones,” the PGA said. It later said that while the spotlight would no doubt fall on Pentonville’s management or a lowly member of staff, the “finger of blame” should be pointed at the government. “The fact is that there is a complete disconnect between the operational frontline and the policymakers, and countless warnings that the system was creaking was not acted on. It is with profound sincerity [we hope] that the following prediction is wrong but this feels very much like on the beginning of the things to come,” the prison governors said. The Prison Service said: “Public protection is our top priority and we take escapes from custody extremely seriously. We are working closely with the police and are urgently investigating the matter.”"
2016-11-07T19:21:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan to draft new London police and crime plan by Christmas,"The first Police and Crime Plan for London had a crowd-pleasing quality, as might have been expected from the mayoralty of Boris Johnson. The document, which the capital’s mayors must produce through their office for policing and crime (MOPAC), set a list of six targets for the period 2013-2016, all of which which featured the figure 20%. It promised a reduction in what it defined as “key neighbourhood crimes” - snappily dubbed the MOPAC 7 - by 20%, reduced re-offending by young people leaving custody by 20%, lessened “delays in the criminal justice system” by 20% and a 20% increase in compliance with community sentences. The same percentage goal was set for “an increase in confidence” in the Met. And all this was to be done while reducing costs by 20% as the capital’s police service took its austerity hit. What was achieved? Depends on how you look at it. The most recent Police and Crime Plan annual report, covering the year to July 2015, says that the Met had already hit its youth reoffending target, was “on track” with the MOPAC 7 and cutting costs, getting mixed results on court delays, and improving but not fast enough on community sentence compliance and confidence levels. Quite apart from what you make of those results, such target-setting raises questions of itself, such as about the means by which progress is measured and the choice of targets in the first place. Johnson also claimed an 18% fall in all crime since taking office in 2008 and trumpeted getting the number of warranted Met officers up to 32,000, but the significance of these figures too have been challenged. For example, London Assembly Conservatives have highlighted the non-investigation of many “acquisitve crimes” while the Greens have argued that officers recruited for that nebulous concept “the frontline” have ended up doing so-called “back office” work because the numbers of civilian staff trained to do it had been cut. When Johnson’s plan was being drafted, a trio of high powered criminologists were highly sceptical about the confidence target - both the percentage and, most importantly, the way in which public confidence was to be defined and quantified. The assumption seemed to be that having more “bobbies on the beat” would push the confidence numbers up and that would be that, when what really mattered was the confidence that comes from good quality interactions with the service and its officers - a confidence that they will be there to help you when you need them and make effective, efficient use use of any help that you provide them with. One of the criminologists said, with some force, that the very setting and pursuit of targets, especially if they appear unrealistic or arbitrary, can have perverse effects: cynicism among officers; the management of crime figures so that the targets can appear to have been met. We might hope that Sadiq Khan, a former civil rights lawyer with wide experience of spotting where policing and police culture can go wrong, will be alive to all these issues and that his policing deputy Sophie Linden will be too. They aim to publish a new Police and Crime Plan towards the end of the financial year (before April, in other words), and to have a draft of it ready for public consultation before Christmas. Londoners’ views are now being solicited by way of an online survey, which asks for our views about, among other things, neighbourhood policing, cyber crime against businesses, keeping young people safe and tackling violence against women and girls, hate crime and extremism. Some clues, there, perhaps, to the new mayoralty’s priorities for the Met and whoever becomes its next commissioner. You can take the survey here."
2016-11-07T20:16:17Z,uk-news,UK news,MoD to sell tenth of UK defence sites including D-day training ground,"The British government is to sell off almost a tenth of its defence sites worth up to £1bn by 2040, with the estate currently too large and costly to maintain, the defence secretary has told MPs. Michael Fallon said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) now plans to dispose of 56 more defence sites, in addition to the 35 sites which it had previously announced. The MoD owns around 1,000 sites in total, 91 of which will be sold off. Eight of the sites to be sold are in Scotland, including Fort George, an 18th-century fort which currently accommodates soldiers from the Black Watch. The site was used for personnel training for the D-day landings during the second world war. Three will also close in Wales and three in Northern Ireland, with the rest in England, including two barracks in York. More than 32,500 acres of excess defence land is being released, including ten surplus airfields and five golf courses. The plans to sell off the estates are likely to be resisted by trade unions, who have warned the plans could put jobs at risk. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the public sector PCS union, said: “We are opposed to these closure plans that throw the future into doubt for thousands of staff. “The MoD has a poor track record on selling off land for homes and this again exposes how the Tories are simply paying lip service to the urgent need to address the housing crisis.” Fallon said the government hoped to raise £1bn from the sale of the land and save £140m a year in maintenance costs, while releasing enough land to build 55,000 homes. “We have been spending billions maintaining a defence estate that doesn’t meet the needs of our Armed Forces,” he told the House of Commons on Monday. “This plan delivers an estate fit for our forces and their families. “By putting money where it is needed, we will provide better facilities to train our armed forces and deliver more stability for military families.” Fallon said the current defence estate which made up 2% of the UK land mass – or an area three times the size of Greater London – needed to adapt to changing needs. “While the size and structure of our armed forces have changed to meet different threats, our estate has failed to adapt,” he said. “It is too inefficient, it costs £2.5bn a year to maintain, and 40% of our built assets are more than 50 years old. “It too often fails to meet the needs of our armed forces and their families, with capabilities spread across small, remote sites, often far removed from population.” Nia Griffith, Labour’s shadow defence secretary said there was a need to ensure the changes did not “cause undue challenges for our forces and their families” and asked what the government would do to minimise disruption. Griffith said the closures would affect communities which had long-standing links with military bases. “Servicemen and women and their families will be required to move and civilian staff will face redeployment. Many face gnawing uncertainty as the exact relocation of their base has not yet been decided.” Fallon said the MoD’s choice of sites was based on military advice on the best use of resources and how military families could be better looked after, in locations with more job opportunities for spouses."
2016-11-08T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ann Maguire murder could not have been foreseen, review finds","The murder of a teacher by one of her pupils during a class at a Leeds school could not have been predicted or pre-empted, an official investigation has found. Though Will Cornick had threatened to kill Ann Maguire in messages on social media, the independent reviewer, Nick Page, found that no warning signs had been known to staff or other agencies at the time. “There are a number of suggested refinements to practice in Corpus Christi Catholic college but this is in no way to suggest that if implemented previously they would have prevented Ann’s murder,” Page’s report says. “What is clear to me, as the reviewer, is that no one could have predicted or pre-empted Will Cornick’s attack on Ann Maguire and, following her murder, individuals and organisations acted courageously, coherently and professionally in supporting the school and affected people.”
Cornick was 15 when he fatally stabbed Maguire, 61, during a Spanish lesson in April 2014. In November that year he pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Page interviewed Cornick, who was found to have had a happy childhood despite his “loving and supportive” parents splitting. Cornick had reported some difficulties when he started at the school, but his head of year had commented that he was “a delightful pupil”, and Maguire had described him as a “bright conscientious young man”. In December 2013 Cornick “communicated on social media to a friend about his hatred of Ann and talked about brutally killing her”, Page’s report says. By February the following year, after a dispute over a detention, Cornick’s relationship with Maguire had broken down, according to his parents, a development that left the teacher baffled. Cornick sent a message to a friend on Facebook saying Maguire “deserves more than death, more than pain, torture and more than anything that we can understand.” Page’s report says Cornick decided to carry out the murder four days before going through with it, and told fellow pupils about his intention as well as plans to kill his head of year and another teacher and her unborn baby.
Having brought knives into the school on the day of the killing, he told other students what he intended to do, but was not taken seriously. “One pupil told police that Will had a dark sense of humour,” the report says. “There were no credible warning signs – behaviours or antecedent behaviours – that could or should have been picked up by agencies or professionals leading up to the murder.” Subsequent psychiatric assessments have suggested Cornick had an adjustment disorder, but this was not evident to those around him. Neither staff at the school nor his parents were aware of Cornick’s threats towards Maguire, Page found. He concluded: “This was a unique event and there are no recommendations I can make which in hindsight could have assisted staff in predicting or preventing the murder of Ann Maguire by Will Cornick or in preventing a similar event in the future.” Maguire’s widower, Don, said the review “appears to be significantly different from an early draft report which we viewed some months ago. Therefore, our family shall need some time to read and consider its findings. “Once we have completed this we will make a statement and I shall make myself available to answer questions or for interview.”"
2016-11-08T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Â£25bn hole will limit Philip Hammond's options in autumn statement, says IFS","Britain’s leading tax and spending experts have warned Philip Hammond that his options are limited in this month’s autumn statement after predicting that slower growth and higher inflation will punch a £25bn hole in the public finances by the end of the current parliament. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that if economic forecasters were right about the impact of Brexit, the new chancellor would have to extend austerity after the next election in order to finally eradicate the budget deficit built up during the financial crisis of 2008-09. A new report by the IFS found that the £10.4bn surplus pencilled in for 2019-20 by George Osborne in his last budget as chancellor in March was now on course to be a £14.9bn deficit.
Thomas Pope, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “The new chancellor’s first fiscal event will not be easy. Growth forecasts are almost sure to be cut, leading to a significant increase in the deficit even if all the very challenging spending cuts currently planned are in fact delivered. “Given the levels of uncertainty he might be wise to respond cautiously for now. Any new fiscal targets should be reasonably flexible. Any decisions to increase spending or cut taxes in the short run should be taken in the knowledge that significant further austerity after 2020 looks to be on the cards.” Hammond has already announced the scrapping of Osborne’s plans to run a budget surplus by the end of the parliament but has also made it clear that there will be no “splurge” of spending in the autumn statement. Instead, the chancellor is looking to target his limited fiscal firepower at so-called “shovel-ready” schemes that offer the highest economic benefits and which can be started with the minimum of delay. The IFS said it made sense for Hammond to be cautious due to the deteriorating outlook for the public finances since the budget. At that time, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that the deficit would fall from £55.5bn in the current 2016-17 financial year to £21.4bn in 2018-19 before going into the black the following year.
The IFS said that “virtually all” forecasters had revised down their predications for growth and revised up their expectations for inflation in the years ahead. Should the OBR follow suit, it is likely to predict that tax receipts will be £31bn lower by the end of the parliament than they would have been otherwise, the IFS said. The thinktank added that spending was likely to be £6bn lower because Britain would no longer be paying contributions to the EU budget. Its calculation that the budget deficit will be £25bn bigger by 2019-20 does not take account of tax cuts promised in the 2015 Conservative party manifesto but not yet delivered, but assumes that Hammond finds the £3.5bn savings from unspecified “efficiencies” that Osborne said would be found by the end of the parliament. The government measures the state of the public finances in two ways – by the size of the annual budget deficit and by the size of the national debt, which tots up deficits and surpluses from every year up to the present. The IFS said the expected £25bn increase in the deficit would result in public sector net debt not falling below its 2015–16 level as a share of national income until 2019–20, despite the government’s own target for it to fall every year. The OBR said in March that it expected national debt to be just under 83% of GDP in 2016. The IFS said that even delivering and maintaining a balanced headline budget from 2020–21 onwards would only put public sector net debt on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income in the mid-2040s. The IFS report said Hammond had two big decisions to make in the autumn statement which could set the direction for his chancellorship. The pro-EU lobby group Open Britain said the IFS analysis showed the importance of the UK maintaining access to the single market. Labour MP Pat McFadden said: “The leave campaign promised a rosy economic future where everything could be paid for from our EU contribution. These figures paint a very different story. It is critical that those on the lowest incomes do not pay the economic price for Brexit. “These warnings from the IFS underline how important it is for the UK not to damage the trading position it currently enjoys through membership of the single market with both the market access and the attraction to inward investors which that represents.”"
2016-11-08T00:20:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Former Spurs vice-chair accused of breaking man's nose in Harrods,"The former vice-chairman of Tottenham Hotspur broke a man’s nose as they queued for croissants in Harrods, a court has heard. David Buchler is accused of getting into an argument with Rosaria Birrane after pushing into the queue in the west London shop, before elbowing her husband James in the face. Buchler, 64, says Rosaria Birrane, 54, racially abused him during the incident on New Year’s Eve last year and that he acted in self-defence. Isleworth crown court heard on Monday that there was “bedlam” in the store’s bakery when Buchler, who had gone to buy himself a pastry, went to the front of the line. “[Rosaria] Birrane says he pushed in front of her and told her to fuck off,” the prosecutor Tim Naik said. “[James] Birrane told Buchler not to talk to his wife like that. He moved forward to protect her, he was then struck by the defendant to the nose.” James Birrane, who is 57, was taken to hospital for treatment to his broken nose, the court heard. “I stepped towards [my wife] to say let’s go and I was punched completely out of the blue, unprovoked,” he told the court. “The first I knew was a crunching, smashing in my face, I didn’t see where it came from. My wife put herself in between us as he was coming for me again.” It was claimed that Buchler was called a “dirty Jew” and that James Birrane was “clawing” at his eyes during the scuffle. James Birrane denies doing so. Buchler said he had acted in self-defence because James Birrane was bigger than him. According to Rosaria Birrane, he had been rude to the staff, swearing at them and telling them to be quick because he was in a hurry. She said he also swore at her. “I want justice for my husband,’ she told the court. “With one single punch [Buchler] has ruined a man’s life. He smashed my husband’s nose to the point where the specialist said nothing can be done, you have to live with it.” Buchler denies assault causing actual bodily harm. The trial continues. • Update: This footnote was added on 16 January 2018 to make clear that Mr Buchler was acquitted on 9 November 2016."
2016-11-08T11:04:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland: Leon Brittan's widow attacks Met 'spin' over report's release,"The widow of Leon Brittan, targeted by the Metropolitan police’s Operation Midland over claims of historical sexual abuse, has said the force is more obsessed with spin than justice. On Tuesday, the Met will unveil limited parts of a report expected to criticise its handling of claims that a group of establishment figures had abused and killed children. Lady Brittan will boycott the event and feels the force’s “shoddy” public relations attempts have worsened her pain and that of her family. Lord Brittan, a former home secretary, was investigated and cleared. Through a family friend, his widow criticised police for releasing the report into Operation Midland on US election day in an attempt to bury bad news. The friend said: “If they put as much effort into managing Operation Midland as they did the PR … then none of us would be in this position … We will not be spun and won’t be handled.”
The Met invited Lady Brittan to read the limited parts of the report it is releasing on Tuesday, and to meet the commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. She refused, saying: “She definitely is not going in, at two days’ notice and certainly not on US election day.” Instead, Lady Brittan will be out of London at a charity event and the Brittan family intend to give their reaction to the report’s findings in the days to come. The Met has already come in for fierce criticism over the controversial £2.6m investigation and worse may yet be to come. Hogan-Howe ordered the report by Sir Richard Henriques, a retired high court judge, after a furore over police actions and decision-making in Operation Midland, in which officers obtained warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their possessions. Midland ended in March this year after the Met concluded there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone, let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge. The Guardian understands Henriques’ report concludes that inconsistencies in the account of the main witness, known as Nick, compromised the investigation’s chances of success, which meant it was unlikely a criminal case would reach the threshold needed to proceed against any of the suspects.
The report also criticises decisions and actions by officers involved in the high-profile and complex investigation, and says it should have ended sooner. Nick’s claims led to allegations against public figures, including a former military chief, Lord Bramall, and a former Tory MP, Harvey Proctor, as well as against Brittan. The findings from Henriques have been studied by senior officers and advisers at the Met since they were delivered several weeks ago in draft form. The findings are potentially damaging to the Met’s reputation and the controversy around Operation Midland has been one of the worst episodes of Hogan-Howe’s five-year commissionership, which will end with his retirement in February 2017. The claims made by Nick relate to the period between 1975 and 1984, when he was aged between seven and 16."
2016-11-08T12:13:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Almost a quarter of Welsh population live in poverty,Â report finds","Almost a quarter of people in Wales are struggling to make ends meet and poverty is costing the country £3.6bn a year – a fifth of the Welsh government’s annual budget, a report has revealed. The report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation raises concern the crisis may grow when the UK leaves the EU because of the funding Wales receives from Brussels. It provides a series of suggestions for alleviating the problem including creating an enterprise zone covering the whole of the south Wales valleys, one of the most deprived areas in the UK. Drawn up with the Bevan Foundation, a thinktank based in the valleys, the report concludes the initiatives that would solve the situation need to come not just from the Welsh government but from business, trade unions, charities and individuals.
The Labour-controlled Welsh government said it was working hard to address poverty but that the report, published on Tuesday, showed there was still much work to do. Plaid Cymru claimed it illustrated austerity was not working for Wales and said the report should be a wakeup call for the political establishment in Cardiff and London. The report – Prosperity without Poverty – says an average of 700,000 people were in poverty in Wales in the three years to 2014-15: that is 23% of the population. Poverty is linked to additional public spending on health, education, social care and police and criminal justice services to the tune of £3.6bn a year – equivalent to £1,150 for every person living in Wales, the report says. It adds that compared with a decade ago there are fewer children and pensioners in poverty – but more people of working age. The report flags up high levels of “underemployment”, highlighting that in September about 17% of part-time workers wanted but could not get full-time jobs. The report says: “Tackling working poverty means recognising that for too many, low pay goes hand-in-hand with low hours. On average, part-time employees in Wales are paid much less than full-time employees, at £8.12 an hour (excluding overtime) compared with £12.26 an hour.”
It says there are particular challenges in certain areas: for example, the number of jobs per head in Blaenau Gwent in the valleys is half the average for Britain. Millions of pounds in EU money has been ploughed into the valleys over the years. The report acknowledges this, saying: “An immediate priority for Wales is to secure the continuity of funding under current EU structural fund programmes as part of the negotiations about UK withdrawal from the EU. In the longer term, the UK government should earmark a sum equivalent to Wales’s structural fund receipts – approximately £400m a year in 2014 – to rebalance the Welsh economy and support inclusive growth and employment.”
Calling for more affordable homes to be built, the report says high housing costs are the cause of poverty for 100,000 people in Wales. The report sets out a series of suggestions for tackling the problem. They include: Developing a new enterprise zone across the whole of the valleys that would use local planning powers and financial incentives including tax breaks to encourage job creation and employment of people at risk of poverty. Accelerating the Welsh government’s commitment to creating better jobs closer to home by encouraging local authorities, universities and hospitals to focus more on disadvantaged local people. Investing more money in education and creating better teachers. Developing more high-quality apprenticeships. Finding ways of increasing community collective action – such as mass switching of energy provider. Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Poverty in Wales is holding back almost a quarter of the population, damaging the economy and affecting the life chances of the next generation. This is unacceptable.” Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for housing, poverty, communities and steel, said: “When we get to the point where nearly a quarter of all people in Wales are experiencing poverty, this should as a massive wakeup call to the entire political establishment, both here in Cardiff and in Westminster. This report shows that the current austerity approach has truly run its course.”
The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, welcomed the report but said solutions were needed for the whole of Wales, not just in places like the valleys. He said: “It’s important that we recognise these challenges exist in communities across the whole of Wales, not just in one area. Regeneration status must apply to the whole country.” A Welsh government spokesperson said: “Employment in Wales is the highest on record and the number of children living in workless households is continuing to fall. However, as this report shows, there is still more to be done and we’re committed to rising to the challenge. “We have big ambitions for Wales and its economy and we will continue to work hard to create and safeguard jobs. We are investing £111m next year alone to create 100,000 all-age apprenticeships, piloting a Better Jobs, Closer to Home project to create employment and training hubs in deprived areas, and developing a fresh approach to improving prosperity in the south Wales valleys, which is being driven by a new ministerial taskforce.”"
2016-11-08T13:36:13Z,uk-news,UK news,"Carer forced towel into screaming woman's mouth, court told","A carer stuffed a towel into the mouth of a woman with disabilities to stop her from screaming in distress, a jury has been told. Fidela Chilcott, 57, allegedly gagged Beverley Baker, 55, who uses a wheelchair and has speech difficulties, as she dried her after a bath at a care home. Chilcott denies ill-treating or neglecting Baker, who was a resident at the Wraxall Road care home in Cadbury Heath, near Bristol. Ramin Pakrooh, prosecuting, told Bristol crown court many residents of the home, which is run by the Brandon Trust, were difficult and challenging. He said: “Being a carer is an involved and difficult job. The person has to be able to deal with the stress – not some of the time, but all of the time. Miss Baker was exhibiting challenging behaviours that were not unusual for her. It would manifest in cries and screaming, and workers were trained to deal with it. “The defendant’s response was to take the end of a towel and force it into her mouth, in effect gagging her. That was a rather inappropriate response to her not being able to manage her own stress. It is their [carers’] job not to lose their temper.” Colleague Joanne Edwards said she saw Chilcott, of Warmley, near Bristol, “roughly” shove a towel into Baker’s mouth twice to quieten her. She told the court Baker was not cooperating with carers and had not drunk enough water or taken her medication, so she and the defendant bathed her. Edwards said: “She was very, very agitated, screaming, which is something she does if she is not happy with the situation. We were trying to dry her, to get that done quickly, and she was screaming. “At that point, Fidela put the top bit of the towel in her mouth. She did it roughly – it was not forced, but it was put into her mouth to stop her screaming. It was there for two seconds before Bev was able to take it out. She pulled it out with her hand. “Bev carried on screaming and I was trying to get her to calm down, talking to her, then Fidela put the towel back in her mouth a second time. Fidela seemed very agitated because of Bev’s manner, but you don’t put a towel in somebody’s mouth – full stop.” Jurors were told that the incident, in April last year, was not the first time Edwards had been concerned about her colleague’s conduct. She claimed that four months earlier, the defendant “shoved” – rather than rolled – Baker when they were cleaning up after she had been sick. On another occasion, Chilcott allegedly slapped the patient’s wrist and told her aggressively: “Now behave.” The trial continues."
2016-11-08T13:46:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harry attacks press over 'wave of abuse' of girlfriend Meghan Markle,"Prince Harry’s decision to attack the British press for introducing “racial overtones” into the reporting of his relationship with an American actor was made because he had never before witnessed such a “degree of pressure, scrutiny and harassment” from the media.
Kensington Palace sources said that the prince feared for the safety of Meghan Markle and her family after they were “subjected to a wave of abuse” during newspaper investigations into what, until Tuesday, had been an unconfirmed relationship. An unprecedented statement, authorised by Harry, also complained of “a smear on the front page” of one newspaper about Markle and that her lawyers were engaged in “nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers”. Palace sources added that police had to be called last week after a photographer allegedly barged into the actor’s garage in Toronto.
The front page “smear” complained of in Harry’s statement referred to the Sun’s piece about clips of Markle in network television drama Suits appearing on Pornhub, an adult website. It was headlined “Harry girl’s on Pornhub” even though what was posted were clips of intimate scenes from the programme, and not pornography. The Sun strongly denied any smear and said it made clear that the “steamy sex scenes” it had referred to appearing on the adult site were from her appearances in the US drama series. However sources told the Guardian that reporters from the Sun were pulled back from trying to conduct “doorstep” interviews on Friday amid concerns about the behaviour of the US media, and that the Pornhub story was removed from the Sun’s website on Friday after some critical comments.
But what has particularly shocked Harry is the “dangerous relationship” in which newspaper reports and comment pieces that he considers racist and sexist sparked a torrent of vitriol against Markle on Twitter and other social media platforms as well as in comment sections below online news stories. Markle’s father, Thomas, is white and her mother, Doria Ragland, African-American, and she has written about her heritage on her website, describing herself as biracial and “half black and half white”, which has been referenced in many articles about their new relationship. The Palace is understood to have been particularly unhappy with one comment piece in last weekend’s Mail on Sunday, by Rachel Johnson, which said that if the couple had children, “the Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA”.
“Some of this has been very public,” the palace’s statement said. “The smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.” The palace also complained of the “bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life” and the harassment of her mother at her home in Los Angeles, who has had to “struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door”. “Given what she was going through in the press and what was happening privately, Harry no longer felt it was acceptable for someone in his position to sit quietly,” a palace source said. “This is happening because of him, not her. The traditional no-comment position no longer felt acceptable to him. “Once it was clear last week and through the weekend that this was accelerating and wasn’t washing through, then it was increasingly unacceptable in his mind to not add his voice. He is not naive. These stories will continue. He just wants people who are reading these stories in the future to at least have his point of view in the back of their minds and to at least have heard from him about what he thinks about them.” Among the other articles that concerned the palace because of their racial connotations was about a piece on DailyMail.com headlined “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton” in a reference to the rap record by NWA.
The prince is also concerned that now that he is 32, the press will consider that any girl he has a relationship with “may be ‘the one’ and so they will get treated as fair game”. “That is a very difficult place for any woman to be in, and being in a position where he is not able to protect her is a very serious concern for him,” the source added. The Sun said it was taken aback by Harry’s statement and said his reference to legal battles, bribes or racial undertones was not a reference to the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid. On Saturday, the Sun told readers that Markle’s background had more in common with the modern British family than those in the “fusty royal corridors” and was more relevant to the modern woman than the Duchess of Cambridge. “Meghan, with her divorce, her ethnic background and fake-it-til-you-make-it work ethic is much more the 21st-century woman”, something “the future of the royal family may depend on”. A source at the paper said Harry’s communications team failed to offer any guidance when reports emerged of their relationship first emerged in the Sunday Express last month. “They had three days to stop this story,” they said. “Any decent press office would have put out a statement saying they were in a relationship, saying they have a right to privacy, etc, and that would have been that. But they didn’t.” A source at the Daily Mail said they were bewildered by Harry’s reference to harassment, bribes and crossing a line. They said they did not know what his communications staff were referring to. Katie Nicholl, royal correspondent for the Mail on Sunday, told LBC radio: “If he really wants this to go away, there is one or two things he could do. You give the press what they want. You make a statement, or you give an interview or you issue a picture. There has not been one picture of them together. Fleet Street will not rest until they have got their picture of them together and they have got some words either from Prince Harry or Meghan about the relationship.”"
2016-11-08T14:40:17Z,uk-news,UK news,'You're only here for the culture!' Is Hull getting its buzz back?,"‘Change is happening!” says the message stencilled, in bright green, on a peeling wall just behind Hull’s new marina. And if that sounds a little wistful, given that right now it’s overlooking an empty car park surrounded by wire fencing, it has the underlying ring of truth. It’s two decades since I was last in Hull, frozen in my memory as one long Saturday night – short skirts, hot chips, scuffles in taxi queues, excitement edged with nerves. Back then I was working just over the Humber Bridge in Grimsby, and Hull was the bright light across the water, home of gigs and cavernous nightclubs and all the exotic thrills small towns lack. Those clubs are now mostly gone, but the tingling anticipation in the air is back. A city long buffeted by the wrong kinds of change now stands on the verge of potential renaissance; for Hull is next year’s official UK City of Culture, beneficiary of a public art project aiming to do here what similar European programmes did for Liverpool in 2008 and Glasgow in 1990.
The official opening spectacular isn’t until 1 January but the buzz has begun. Over summer, thousands of locals stripped naked and had themselves painted blue for a Spencer Tunick installation celebrating the city’s relationship with the sea; the Turner prize is coming here next year, plus a one-off gig from David Bowie’s old backing band the Spiders from Mars. “Go on the terraces at Hull City football club, and one of the chants now is, ‘You’re only here for the culture’,” says Daren Hale, deputy leader of the city council. But this isn’t just about rebranding Hull as a tourist destination – although it has made Rough Guide’s list of top 10 world cities to visit this year and a stroll through the old city’s narrow cobbled streets, studded with cosy pubs, reveals a rather different place from the one outsiders imagine. City of Culture is really a shot at economic redemption, and if the idea of building a future on poetry and song feels hopelessly airy-fairy, beneath it is a hard-headed attempt to portray Hull as a feelgood city to which big employers might want to bring their staff. For it’s jobs that will ultimately revive those pockets of the city tourists don’t come to see, as Hale points out: “Once you come here you see there’s a real creative buzz, and people say: ‘This is the sort of place you could do business and you could settle’.” But that’s no longer the only vision of Hull’s future on the table. In June, despite warnings that Brexit risked its future as a port city that trades daily with the outside world, Hull voted to leave Europe. If it was already a city at a crossroads, in the words of filmmaker and opening ceremony curator Sean McAllister, it’s even more so now. One road harks back to bygone days when other countries sent their ships here, but not their people; the other evokes a bright, high-skilled future that nonetheless sounds uncertain to people who have heard such promises before. Of all the jaunty City of Culture slogans plastered across the city, the most evocative is a banner near the pierhead. “Where have you been all our lives?” it asks, in a way that could be plaintive or mildly acerbic.
Hull isn’t a swaggering big city, a noisy Manchester or Leeds, and like a child whose older sibling gets all the attention, it has learned to conceal any resulting hurt with defiance. It’s friendly enough to tourists but as the Hull-born author and poet Russ Litten writes in My People Come From The Sea, there’s a tendency to “ignore the rest of the country, face away/lips pursed, arms crossed”. Yet there’s a lot going on behind those masks. As the poem goes on, “My people come from deep waters/My people are deep waters/My people are in deep water.” They are indeed – Hull was the third most deprived local authority in England last year, with household disposable income a third less than the national average – but suspicion of City of Culture’s proffered lifebelt lingers. There have been complaints about local artists being overlooked in favour of famous outsiders, and scepticism about what commercial regeneration means for the kind of non-conformist city that remains proud of holding out for years against getting a Starbucks. Litten has long been a driving force on Hull’s musical and literary scene, and while the 2017 programme excites him, he worries too little of it is created by or for locals. “For people inside the city, I hope it doesn’t make us feel self-conscious,” he says, when asked how he hopes people will feel by the year’s end. “I’d like to think that people would feel empowered to create stuff rather than just consume stuff. And for people from the outside, to be perfectly honest, I couldn’t care less. The minute you start to worry about what people think and how they view you, you’ve had it.” Litten grew up in the Hessle Road area, a working-class community ripped apart in the 1970s when territorial battles with Iceland scuppered its fishing industry, and he’s not alone in linking that history with Hull’s flinty resilience. My People Come From The Sea, improvised for a spoken word album with local musician Steve Cobby, is based on their grandfathers’ stories. “Our families lived close to death,” he says simply. “Six times more people died in fishing than in mining. Where I’m from was like a village within a city and it bred a specific type of person, very stoic.” When Sheffield and Hull both flooded a few years back, he says, TV crews descended on Sheffield to film stricken householders but Hull just cracked on, out of sight and mind.
The lazy stereotype of this city as a grumpy backwater at the end of a railway line, redeemed only by Philip Larkin and the Housemartins, is self-evidently wrong. It has a quirky, almost eccentric side supporting a thriving artistic scene, and Litten argues that it’s a great place to be creative; rents are cheap, geographical isolation fosters originality, and so does the landscape of sea to the east and rolling fields to the west. “It’s flat, and artists like a horizon, don’t they?” But years of being laughed at by outsiders – famously, the book Crap Towns once called it Britain’s “worst place to live” – has left its mark. “Culturally and psychologically, because the city was run down by people outside for so long, it kind of bites,” says Andrew Young, a strategic consultant to universities whose Twitter account @Hullbhoy plugs all that’s good about his home town. He sees City of Culture both as injecting new ideas and challenging those who knock Hull without ever having been: “I think it’s fantastic to have the spotlight on the city and big national players on the stage. We don’t get the London Philharmonic here, but we’ve got it in 2017.” Yet he concedes the spotlight isn’t comfortable for everyone. “People in Hull can be quite timid in terms of shouting about what they do. If you go to Glasgow people aren’t slow in coming forward and telling you what’s going on. We don’t do that so much.” And that ingrained reticence can make Hull a hard city to help. Diana Johnson, MP for Hull North, says the city was “late to the party” in the boom years for urban regeneration, hesitating to hustle for funding when rivals such as Newcastle and Liverpool were doing so. And now it’s finally at the front of the queue, the party is winding down. Few envisage Conservative ministers spending more now on rundown estates than Labour did during a boom.
The good news is that alongside winning its City of Culture bid, Hull recently secured a £310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens to build new offshore wind turbines in the city, creating up to 1,000 jobs. Alan Johnson, MP for Hull West and Hessle, has argued offshore wind could do for the city what oil did for Aberdeen, and if that was a cheerier analogy before the oil price crashed, it’s still a breakthrough for a city that’s struggled in the past to woo inward investors. The city’s luck seemed to be turning, which in some ways makes the decisive backing for Brexit more surprising. Hale puts it down to a now familiar mix of anti-establishment feeling, longstanding anger at the EU’s treatment of the fishing industry, but above all immigration. For decades Hull had experienced relatively little, but then eastern Europeans started coming to work on the outlying farms as well as in the city. Drive north of the centre, past the leafy university quarter, and you soon find a scruffier landscape of pound shops and cut-price carwashes, many of the latter immigrant-owned. In the mid-90s the biggest ethnic minority group in town was Chinese, according to Hale, constituting about 1% of the population; now, he reckons anywhere up to 15% are from immigrant backgrounds. “It’s been massively good for the city in lots of ways but it’s a massive change in the culture.” The incomers have, he says, helped reverse inner-city decline by bringing empty shops and homes into use: “People hark back to the day of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker but those shops had gone. The eastern Europeans were opening up boarded-up, empty shops.” But Ukip, now second behind Labour in Hull’s three parliamentary seats, is finding a ready audience for its message here. The vote, Johnson thinks, was a protest not just against immigration but “the fact that Hull hasn’t done as well in recent years, people feel their wages don’t go up as fast as prices”. And then there were those who, like some of Litten’s friends on the left, voted Leave for radical socialist reasons. “It was a ‘fuck you’ to the establishment, saying don’t tell us what to do,” he explains.
There is relief that Siemens remains publicly committed to the city, its new factory more than busy enough supplying turbines for British use in the North Sea. But it had ultimately hoped to export turbines made here across Europe, and local politicians are worried about the longterm prospects for investment given uncertainty over life outside a single market. If the worst fears about a hard Brexit are realised, Hull may just have voted to shoot itself in the foot. Walking to a meeting in the city, I cross its last foiled attempt at regeneration. The innovative Scale Lane Bridge over the river Hull, which swings aside for shipping, is where Tunick assembled his naked blue people but it’s more than just a landmark. It was originally conceived to link the picturesque old city on the west bank with a largely derelict industrial site on the east, which would then be turned into a swanky waterside development complete with new hotel. The hotel was built but the banking crash killed off everything else, leaving just an unusually spectacular approach to a marooned Premier Inn, and a reminder of Hull’s vulnerability to forces beyond its control. The optimist’s view is that if hard times are coming again, they could at least foster creative revival. “All great art is born out of struggle, and the need for survival,” says Litten. “Look at punk, reggae, acid house.” If new artforms are to emerge in Hull, however, they may come from the development around the marina, which includes a spanking new hub for tech startups. It’s not Shoreditch, but you could live here far more cheaply than in London while trying to get a business off the ground – Hull made the Sunday Times top 10 urban places to live last year partly for its affordable housing – and the idea is to encourage computer science students from the University of Hull to stay around after graduation.
Combine that with the fact that, for the first time this year, none of Hull’s secondary schools were ranked inadequate by Ofsted and three were outstanding – meaning fewer couples leaving the city when they have children – and the low skills base that has held Hull back is improving. These are, admittedly, little acorns from which to grow oaks. Hull may never quite be Liverpool, reinvented as a sexy weekend destination with its Beatles Museum and its Tate and its thriving bars. But there’s an offbeat charm beneath this city’s tough outer skin and if nothing else, it deserves respect for trying. This is a bold roll of the dice, from a city that doesn’t necessarily have a plan B. What’s the worst that could happen if you gave it an evening or a weekend of your free time? Walking back later towards the bridge, I pass a karaoke bar where men are downing cut-price pints while someone belts out a song I’ve not heard for decades: the Beautiful South’s Perfect 10. “I love her body, especially the lies/Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes.” Time has taken its toll on Hull, but the bones of what it was and could be remain. Change is happening, all right. Hopefully for the better."
2016-11-08T15:01:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Press feeding frenzy over Harry and Meghan has echoes of Diana coverage | Roy Greenslade,"A handsome prince and a beautiful actor. This is the sort of story made in tabloid heaven. So Prince Harry’s relationship with Meghan Markle was bound to excite popular newspaper interest. If royal advisers thought editors in the post-Leveson age had cleaned up their act then they were surely in for a shock. All the old tricks of the royal rat-pack trade from the era of Prince Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, were there from the moment the story of their relationship was broken by the Sunday Express nine days ago. The traditional feeding frenzy was evident in the increasingly intense coverage in the two best-selling daily tabloids, the Daily Mail and the Sun.
Both ran a succession of articles last week and were able to draw on a huge portfolio of photographs of Markle to illustrate stories of sometimes questionable merit. Much of the material was laced with innuendo and informed by little more than speculation. The sexism was obvious in the Mail’s first front page mention of Markle as “Harry’s new hottie”.
In the following days the Mail ran page leads in which headlines often carried question marks: “Did Harry cancel tryst with new hottie after cover was blown?” (Tuesday); “Dreaming of a white wedding are we, Meghan?” (Friday); and “Is Meghan the minx really Prince Harry’s Miss Right?” (Saturday). The Sun, making much of a revealing pose, began with “Prince’s royal thighness” on Monday and claimed the following day that “smitten Harry” had “bombarded Meghan with texts until he got a date”. On Wednesday, both the Mail and the Sun carried pieces based on an interview with Markle’s half sister, Samantha Grant. This elicited a critical headline from the Mail: “Watch out, Harry! Prince ‘would be appalled’ if he knew truth about his new girlfriend, warns her sister”. The Sun, meanwhile, wrote “Prince Harry’s new girlfriend is a pushy diva who is unfit to be a member of the royal family” in the intro to its front page story. The Mail’s piece on Thursday had a sharp edge: “Harry has spent past week with lover in Canada, and by strange coincidence she’s just launched her own fashion range!” while the next day’s Sun claimed “Dirty Harry” had enjoyed “a romantic stay at Balmoral” with Markle. Not content with that, the Sun told its readers that the prince had wooed Markle during “a dirty weekend” at a friend’s house in Los Angeles. The source was an anonymous “pal”. The Sunday red-tops had weighed in with similar claims. According to the Sunday Mirror, Prince Charles’s former butler confirmed the romance in an interview given “with official authorisation from Clarence House”. And the Sunday People relied on an unnamed source to suggest that Markle was due to spend Christmas with Harry, although not at Sandringham. None of this was unduly surprising. It is redolent of the coverage of royal romances over the last 50 years, from Princess Margaret through to Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. What is new is the unprecedented strength of the statement complaining about the coverage. It makes claims about “outright sexism and racism”, some of which were obvious from the coverage. A Mail on Sunday column by Rachel Johnson was unwise in stating that Markle’s union with Harry will thicken the Windsors’ “watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA”. Clearly, the “smear” mentioned in the prince’s statement referred to a Sun front page story about Markle’s appearance on Pornhub, an adult website. But the clips taken from her TV show, Suits, were not pornographic. Other allegations in the statement were less easy to narrow down, such as Markle’s mother being harassed by photographers (who, presumably, were not all British). Similarly, it does not specify whether reporters and photographers attempting to “gain illegal entry” to Markle’s home were acting on behalf of UK newspapers. This does not let Britain’s press off the hook, of course. But editors will doubtless argue, unless proof is presented, that they are not responsible for overstepping the mark. One other notable point: an early Mail Online report of the Kensington Palace statement made no mention of press intrusion, merely using the statement as confirmation of the couple’s relationship. A later version did mention media intrusion. The Sun’s website article also viewed it as an acknowledgement that its previous speculation had been correct, but it did refer to the statement’s complaints about unwarranted media attention. There are bound to be cries from editors that Harry is benefiting from undue protection and that Kensington Palace is engaged in some form of news management. But newspaper claims that the people have a right to know will need to be carefully balanced against the possibility of a public backlash as memories are summoned up of Diana’s death while being chased by paparazzi."
2016-11-08T16:23:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Neighbour warned of landslip risk before fatal incident, inquest told","A neighbour of a woman who died when her home was destroyed by a landslide had warned the local authority about the risk of erosion years before the fatal incident, an inquest has heard. Susan Norman, 68, was killed when her ground-floor flat was destroyed by tonnes of mud and rubble that fell from a cliff behind her rented property in Looe, Cornwall, in the early hours of 22 March 2013. Tim Topham, who lived two doors from Norman in Sandplace Road, told the inquest that several landslips had happened in the area since 2006 and he had alerted Cornwall council. He said during heavy rain water would run down the steep St Martin’s Road above his property and cascade over the cliff face into his garden because of a lack of kerbing on the road and blocked drains. “I warned the council we had problems with erosion because I could see it on a daily basis, seeing the subtle changes,” Topham said. “In 2006, liquid mud adjacent to our property came down to our patio and steps. It moved our garden shed 4ft or 5ft and came within a foot of falling on to Sandplace Road.” Topham said he wrote to the council highlighting problems with the overflowing rainwater in 2005 but he claimed he was ignored. In February 2006, a mud slip caused damage to his home and the council paid him £2,176 compensation. “Eventually they did put the kerbing in but only after they paid me for the damage caused to my property,” he told Cornwall coroner’s court. “They could have saved themselves £2,000 if they had dealt with it after I first raised it.” Topham accepted that in subsequent correspondence with the council between 2006 and 2012 he had not mentioned overflowing water being a problem. But he had raised concerns about the stability of trees on the cliff face above his home and he told jurors the local authority had surveyed the trees but did not carry out any felling. The court heard that in October 2012 there was a small landslip further down Sandplace Road, and the following month another happened next to Topham’s boundary. He wrote to Cornwall council in December 2012 with his concerns about what he perceived to be the lack of a long-term plan to deal with the instability of St Martin’s Road and the cliff face. Explaining his motives for writing the letter, Topham told the court: “I think it was an accumulation over several years of not really being satisfied with what was being done.” He said he received a reply within a couple of weeks from the council saying the first phase of works was being carried out by specialist contractors to address the recent landslips, including repairing cracks in Sandplace Road. The inquest heard previously that Norman would have died almost instantly from crush injuries when her home was destroyed. The mother of three was wearing pyjamas and was most likely watching television when she was killed. In the days before the incident builders had been carrying out repairs to a retaining wall behind Norman’s home after it was reported to be bulging and described as looking like a pregnant woman. The inquest, which is being heard before a jury, will have to consider whether water flow in the area had increased in the year before Norman’s death because of a Barrett Homes development nearby and what the developer and Cornwall council had done about it."
2016-11-08T16:45:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Severe weather warning issued as UK temperatures drop,"Parts of Britain could get up to six inches of snow on Tuesday night as temperatures drop below freezing. The Met Office issued a severe weather warning as temperatures fell to -5C (23F) in England on Monday night. It said snow was expected in the Midlands, the north and Scotland and that there was a risk of gales of up to 50mph developing in the south-west on Wednesday before moving along the Channel.
Frosty conditions are expected to continue until rush hour on Wednesday morning as a band of wintry weather moves slowly eastwards. The Met Office forecaster Emma Sillitoe said: “We have had a few wintry showers, but this is the first event where more people are going to be affected. There is a frontal system moving in from the west meeting the quite cold weather we have been having over the last few days. “A yellow weather warning will be in place from 12pm today until 9am tomorrow covering high ground from Scotland down the east coast to the Midlands, and we could see snow to lower levels below 200 metres of around 2cm (0.7in).” Sillitoe also warned of a risk of difficult driving conditions on high routes over the Pennines and in Scotland. “People will have to scrape the frost from their windscreens, so it will be quite slow getting out and about on Wednesday,” she added. Highways England issued an amber “be aware” alert for the north and Midlands in anticipation of the heavy rain turning to sleet and snow. They warned drivers to check the forecast before setting out and ensure they have a winter kit in their vehicles. The wintry weather is expected to affect the M6 and A66 in the northwest, and the A66, M62 and A628 in the Pennines. The AA said it had experienced its busiest day of the year so far with more than 10,000 calls. Many drivers had flat batteries and other cold weather-related problems."
2016-11-08T16:58:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland:  where the Met police went wrong,"The police investigation into allegations of the abuse and murder of children by a ring of VIP paedophiles was riddled with errors, according to a report. It found: There were “serious failings” in the conduct of the police investigation, indentifying 43 individual errors made by officers. The man who made the allegations – known by the pseudonym Nick, a father in his 40s – was believed for too long and is now being investigated for attempting to pervert the course of justice. Officers misled a judge to get search warrants. The author of the report, Sir Richard Henriques, said: “The gravity of a judge being misled in such circumstances cannot be overstated.” Five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings. The former home secretary Leon Brittan should have been informed before his death that the case against him had been dropped. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said he accepted responsibility for the failings, and that it was a matter of “professional and personal dismay” that the VIPs – including Brittan, the former military chief Lord Bramall and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor – were pursued for so long."
2016-11-08T17:01:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland: Complainant 'Nick' investigated for attempting to pervert course of justice - as it happened,"A report into the Met police’s investigation into an alleged Westminster paedophile ring has identified 43 failings. The most grave failings identified included officers misleading a judge to get search warrants, believing the complainant known as Nick for too long, publicly stating the allegations were credible and true and not closing the investigation sooner. The main complainant, whose allegations led to the Met investigation has been referred for criminal investigation. The man, known, only as Nick will be investigated by Northumbria police regarding an allegation of perverting the course of justice. Five police officers have been referred to the police watchdog, the IPCC, including Det Asst commissioner Steve Rodhouse, the senior officer in Scotland Yard’s investigation. Rodhouse released a statement saying he did not believe he or any of his officers in Operation Midland had committed any misconduct. The Met commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, accepted there had been “serious failings” and publicly apologised to Lord Bramall and Harvey Proctor, who were among those accused. He also apologised to Lady Brittan the widow of Leon Brittan, who was also accused. Proctor said that he had accepted Hogan-Howe’s apology but lamented the “irreversible” impact on his life and that of his friends and family. The NSPCC warned that the report could prevent victims coming forward in future."
2016-11-08T17:08:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Lindsay Rimer death: man held on suspicion of teenager's 1994 murder,"Detectives investigating the death of a schoolgirl 22 years ago have arrested a man on suspicion of murder. The body of Lindsay Rimer, 13, was found in the Rochdale canal five months after she disappeared in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, in November 1994. On Tuesday, West Yorkshire police announced that a 63-year-old man from Bradford had been arrested and was being questioned by detectives. In April, police said they were exploring new leads in the hope of identifying Lindsay’s killer. Forensic experts in Canada had developed a DNA profile after examining unspecified exhibits provided by West Yorkshire detectives. Lindsay left her home in Cambridge Street at about 10pm on 7 November 1994 and visited the Trades Club in Home Street. The last known sighting of her was on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes at a shop in Crown Street. Her body, which had been weighted down with a stone, was recovered about a mile upstream from the town centre. Speaking publicly about the case for the first time in April, Lindsay’s younger sister Juliet Rimer described the void her death had created. “There will always be a void. I have no memories of her of my own, everything is from photographs, stories and the media,” she said. “A piece of everyone’s soul is missing, and I often wonder how our lives would have been if we were not a ‘broken’ family – the advice Lindsay would have given me, the fights we might have had, the things we may have shared.” In a video appeal issued by police in April, Juliet added: “Not knowing what happened is the worst part. You walk down the street and wonder: ‘Was it them? Do you know something?’ Getting the answers wouldn’t change the hurt, but it would help bring closure to us all.”"
2016-11-08T17:09:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Who controls whom? The monarchy v the media,"Rarely, in the long and turbulent history of the royal family’s relationship with the press, has a palace spokesman used such direct and outspoken language. “The past week has seen a line crossed,” Kensington Palace said of the coverage of Prince Harry’s relationship with the US TV actor Meghan Markle. Saying the prince fears for Markle’s safety, the spokesman added: “This is not a game. It is her life and his.” The intervention will certainly have captured attention in tabloid newsrooms, but it is unlikely to usher in a permanent truce in a relationship that has been strained for the best part of 30 years. The decision to issue such a forthright statement is evidence, however, of the increasingly proactive approach that Kensington Palace is taking with the media, particularly in response to coverage of Harry and the family of Prince William.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took a similarly direct approach last year when their spokesman wrote to editors warning that some paparazzi were using “dangerous tactics” to obtain photos of their son, Prince George, and “profit from the image of a two-year-old boy”. That letter said photographers had stalked the prince’s nanny, used toddlers to lure him into view and been discovered hiding in fields and woodland around their Norfolk home. It also claimed a photographer had set up a “hide” in his car, complete with sheets and supplies of food and drink, as he staked out a play area. The royals have also appealed to the Independent Press Standards Organisation for protection. Earlier this year, Prince Harry forced the Daily Star to retract a claim he had an affair with the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, Pippa Middleton, after complaining to Ipso. The press standards body also ruled that a front-page headline in the Sun claiming the Queen “backs Brexit” was “significantly misleading”. But some media observers, not all of them defenders of the tabloids, have expressed unease at the royals’ attempts to control their own image. Writing last year, Joan Smith, the executive director of Hacked Off, questioned some of the Cambridges’ claims over paparazzi excesses in relation to George, and argued that no other institution in the UK would be allowed to “cow the media”. Ipso’s decision to uphold a complaint by the duchess in September, on the grounds that a photograph of George riding a police motorbike breached his privacy, also provoked unease that the couple were seeking unprecedented levels of control over their image. The palace and the tabloids have been tentatively rebuilding bridges ever since matters reached an all-time low after the death of Princess Diana. Earl Spencer said the press had “a direct hand” in his sister’s death and contacted tabloid editors to tell them they would not be welcome at her funeral, after they had been invited by Buckingham Palace. The shock of the princess’s death led to the famous temporary truce, with newspaper editors agreeing not to use paparazzi pictures and agreeing to end “deplorable practices” in their coverage of the royals.
The young princes were allowed substantial privacy while growing up, but remained uncomfortable in their dealings with the media. In 2002, Harry was exposed for drinking underage and using cannabis; two years later, he was involved in a scuffle with reporters as he left a nightclub, reportedly shouting: “Why don’t you leave me alone?” In 2007, as the relationship between William and Kate Middleton intensified, the then regulator, the Press Complaints Commission, circulated a letter to editors claiming Middleton was being harassed. It worked. The publisher of the Sun and News of the World announced that it would no longer publish paparazzi pictures of her. MPs later said she had been “hounded” and subjected to “persistent harassment”. The couple were largely left alone on honeymoon after their marriage in 2011, but when topless photographs of the duchess emerged the following year the palace was furious, calling them a “grotesque and totally unjustifiable” invasion of privacy, and saying it would be “unthinkable” for anyone to reproduce them. The photographs did not appear in a mainstream UK publication, but were published in the French magazine Closer and widely available online. That incident illustrated the scale of the difficulty the family faced in controlling their image in a global media market where they were of huge international interest. It was not a British newspaper, for instance, but the US website The Drudge Report that revealed Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan in 2008, forcing him to be urgently pulled out of Helmand. On that occasion, the British media had been aware of the deployment but agreed to observe a strict media blackout. Even if it is impossible to restrict every outlet, however, it is clear the family will do their best to control what they can. “[Prince Harry] knows this is not a magic wand and this stuff will continue,” a royal source said. “But he no longer felt comfortable in himself having so much written about someone not because of who she is, but because of who he is.”"
2016-11-08T17:50:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Good news on low pay in London - up to a point,"In a city where more than a quarter of the population has been officially in poverty in recent years, including 1.2 million people who are members of a household where someone works, any good news about low pay is to be cherished. Let us therefore enjoy new figures showing that the number of low-paid jobs in the capital has fallen just a little in 2016 following five years of successive rises. Drawing on the Office for National Statistics annual survey of hours and earnings, the New Policy Institute (NPI) thinktank has calculated that the number of jobs in the capital that haven’t been providing the non-statutory London Living Wage rate - their definition of a low-paid one - stood at 720,000. However, that’s still nearly one in five, of which 370,000 are full-time jobs and 350,000 are part-time. It’s also - and here’s a sobering qualifier - still considerably more as a proportion of all jobs than was the case ten years ago. The rate is 18% compared with 11% in 2006. The analysis, which was funded by Trust for London, also finds that 58% of low-paid jobs - approaching 420,000 - are done by women. They fill 220,000 of the part-time low-paid jobs and the number in full-time ones has increased by 80,000 in the past five years. Younger adults too are heavily represented among low-paid employees, with 40% of 21-24 year-olds falling into the category. Low-paid employment continues to be a feature of the retail (27%) and hotel and restaurant (21%) sectors and although only 10% of all private sector service jobs are low paid, there are an awful lot of them. They account for around a fifth of the low-paid total. The NPI analysis also breaks down low pay incidence by borough. The five where it found the highest proportions of jobs that paid less than the London Living Wage are all in Outer London: in Bexley, Harrow, Enfield, Sutton and Waltham Forest more than 30% of jobs are low-paid. By contrast, the five with the lowest scores are all in Inner London: less than 15% of jobs in Tower Hamlets, Islington, Southwark, Camden and Westminster are low paid. The borough with the highest proportion of low-paid residents (rather than jobs) is Newham, where 34% of people have been getting less than London Living Wage rates. The London Living Wage rate applied in this research is £9.40 per hour, which is what it was set at until 31st October. It has now been increased to £9.75, a hike of 4% as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation. Announcing the increase, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was glad to see the wage well on track to pass £10 an hour during his time at City Hall, and repeated his desire to see London become “a fairer and more equal city”. During the election campaign he said London should become “the world’s first Living Wage city” and that this could arise from what he called “a new compact” with big businesses, under which he would recognise their importance to making London prosperous while promoting “the principles of inclusivity and fairness”. He spoke of “building a coalition for shared prosperity” in which being a London Living Wage employer would be seen as “a badge of pride”. Over 1,000 London business now wear that badge, including recent recipients Curzon Cinemas, RSA Insurance and the British Library, where Khan announced the brand new increased rate. How many more will wear it by 2020?"
2016-11-08T17:51:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Preston named best city to live and work in north-west England,"Preston is the best city in north-west England in which to live and work, according to a report. The Lancashire city beat Manchester and Liverpool in an annual assessment of the UK’s largest cities that measures economic success and personal and family wellbeing. Preston became the highest performing city in the north-west by scoring relatively highly compared with the UK average across all measures except for income. The city ranked 19th overall in the 2016 Good Growth for Cities index, which measures the performance of 42 UK cities against 10 categories including jobs, income, work-life balance, transport, skills, environment and the house price to earnings ratio. The highest ranking cities were Oxford, Reading, Edinburgh, Southampton and Bristol. The lowest ranking were Doncaster, Wakefield and Castleford, Swansea, Sunderland, and Middlesbrough and Stockton. In the index, published by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the thinktank Demos, Preston scored particularly highly for jobs and business startups. Peter Rankin, the Labour leader of Preston council, said the city was a success story due to its location and cheap housing. “We are just two hours from London and one hour from the Lakes and Manchester, which puts us in a very good position. We are also building 17,000 new homes and all of this contributes to our success,” he said. “In the past we have been a bit shy about our achievements, almost under-marketing ourselves. But we are rapidly catching up and we are following in the footsteps of Manchester who are very good at overselling themselves.” Liverpool performed well in work-life balance, house price to earnings, and income distribution, but placed 37th overall. Greater Manchester ranked 30th, performing more consistently across a range of variables including work-life balance, housing affordability and new businesses. Northern cities performed better than the UK average in three areas: higher owner occupation, house price to earnings and income distribution. Furthermore, they continued to demonstrate substantial improvement in reducing unemployment levels. Jonathan House, a partner at PwC, said: “When it comes to jobs and the commitments of business, the northern powerhouse is performing on cue. “The northern powerhouse network is reporting over 180,000 new jobs in the last 12 months alone and a raft of new business recruits supporting the network and its objectives.” However, the report showed cities in the north-east were still struggling, with Newcastle 31st, Sunderland second last and Middlesbrough in last place.
Newcastle scored highly for work-life balance, the environment and its house price-to-earnings ratio, though it was still in the bottom group nationally for health and income. Sunderland performed well in income distribution and house price to earnings, but was in the bottom group in a range of areas including skills, health, jobs and number of new businesses. Middlesbrough fared badly for income, jobs and the environment but was well rated for its transport links. Stephanie Hyde, a PwC executive board member, called on the government to support devolution, claiming it would further strengthen the economy in the north. She said: “Devolution is a central part of the answer to unleashing the economic potential of the UK. By giving local leaders the ability to control the levers of good growth, cities can tailor their approach to economic development to their own unique strengths, weaknesses and potential.” The report’s authors said Brexit could lead to higher unemployment and slower growth in household incomes over the next few years. John Hawksworth, PwC’s chief economist, said: “All the elements of our Good Growth index could be impacted by Brexit to some degree, although housing, jobs and income may see the largest effects. “Starting up new businesses, for example, could suffer as a result of increased economic uncertainty. On the other hand, changing trade relations and regulations after Brexit, the shock to the status quo, and the potential opening up of new markets outside the EU could create opportunities for new entrants.”"
2016-11-08T19:30:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Plan for immigration removal centre near Glasgow airport rejected,"The Home Office has been refused planning permission to build a rapid removal centre for asylum seekers near Glasgow airport after almost 300 objections were lodged with the local council. The planning application was overwhelmingly rejected by Renfrewshire council’s planning board on Tuesday afternoon. Local politicians and campaigners had criticised plans for the new short-term facility to replace Dungavel immigration removal centre in Lanarkshire, raising concerns that vulnerable asylum seekers risked being funnelled out of Scotland and away from family, friends and legal representation. Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, said at the beginning of September that Dungavel, which has been condemned as “barbaric and inhumane” and been the focus of numerous protests, will shut late next year. Kenny MacLaren, the deputy leader of Renfrewshire council’s Scottish National party group and one of the local councillors for the proposed location of the new centre, told the Guardian there had been unanimous and cross-party opposition to the application. He said: “There were clear planning grounds to reject this application, never mind the moral case for rejecting this application.” “A full list of objections will be prepared and given to the applicant including the negative economic impact this proposal would have on the airport and surrounding area. There was also no specific need for this site to be used as claimed by the applicant. Detainees weren’t to be frogmarched to the airport, so vans or buses would be used, meaning that any site could be used.” MacLaren, who had a number of constituents approach him with their concerns about the facility, said a total of 297 objections had been lodged by a combination of local residents and campaigning organisations such as Positive Action in Housing, an independent homelessness charity that supports people from refugee and migrant backgrounds. The Home Office can consider the reasons for refusal and appeal to the Scottish government, if it chooses to. A spokesperson said the department was “considering our next steps”. “We are disappointed by the decision of the planning committee. A new short-term holding facility in Scotland would provide a modern and secure facility for those with no right to be in the UK and would allow for the closure of Dungavel immigration removal centre,” the spokesperson said. As the Home Office sought to build the short-term airport facility, where individuals could only be held for a limited period, groups including the Scottish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Detention Action said they were worried it would result in asylum detainees being taken away from their support networks. There is no long-term centre north of Lincolnshire, so those removed from Scotland will be a number of hours’ drive away from friends and family. They will also face jurisdictional difficulties as they find themselves under a different legal system. This means they may need to abandon any pending legal challenges in the Scottish courts and find new representation in England. Kate Alexander, the director of the charity Scottish Detainee Visitors, has previously told the Guardian there is little evidence to show that short-term facilities led to people being removed more quickly. The most recent figures for Larne House, Northern Ireland’s short-term holding facility, showed 44% of inmates were moved to another detention centre. She added that, in contrast with longer-term facilities, short-term units operated with no equivalent rules regarding the protection of inmates, resulting in concerns about conditions and, in particular, the treatment of women."
2016-11-08T19:59:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Operation Midland police fell for 'false claims' of VIP abuse, report says","Senior detectives fell for “false allegations” from a man who claimed VIPs had sexually abused and killed children, and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones, a report has found. The report into Operation Midland by Sir Richard Henriques, a retired judge, said one of the reasons detectives blundered was because they had to believe the victim under a policy originally aimed at stopping officers hiding the scale of sexual violence. The main complainant, known as Nick, is now under investigation by Northumbria police for allegedly perverting the course of justice. Details of his alleged conduct are outlined in sections of Henriques’s report that the Metropolitan police are keeping secret, the Guardian understands. Detectives helped Nick fill out a claim for criminal injury compensation, and at one point described his claims as “credible and true”. But Henriques identified 43 failings by detectives who spent 16 months and more than £2m pursuing the allegations. Nick’s claims led to the Met investigating public figures including the former military chief Lord Bramall, the former home secretary Leon Brittan and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Henriques said police should have spotted that Nick was not credible earlier, and ceased their investigation sooner.
The report concluded: “Those accused remained isolated and uninformed of the progress of these several investigations until finally being informed that there was an insufficiency of evidence against them. In short, these men are all victims of false allegations and yet they remain treated as men against whom there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. The presumption of innocence appears to have been set aside.” Bramall’s late wife witnessed the search of their home, Lady Brittan was distressed by the raid on their property, and Proctor has said police actions ruined his livelihood. Henriques called for an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry into the false grounds used to obtain search warrants. “The gravity of a judge being misled in such circumstances cannot be overstated.” He said the searches were carried out “when there were no reasonable grounds to believe an indictable offence had been committed”. Police stated in the application for a warrant that the victim had contacted police in late 2014, “when in fact Nick first contacted MPS [Metropolitan police service] in 2012 before being referred to Wiltshire police where he was interviewed at length in December 2012”. One police chief and four detectives are to face investigation for potential disciplinary offences. The deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who was in day-to-day charge of Operation Midland as well as a separate inquiry into claims Brittan had raped a woman in the 1960s, denied any wrongdoing. “I do not believe that I, or indeed any officer within Operation Midland, have committed any misconduct,” he said. The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioned the report in February, a month before Operation Midland was shut down having been unable to establish any grounds for arrest. It was dismissed by critics as a baseless witch-hunt, and Henriques’s report damned the Met. He said the presumption of innocence had been sacrificed for the policy that victims should be believed. He said the protocol “perverts our system of justice” and should be scrapped. While Hogan-Howe backed the report’s findings, the rest of British policing and victims’ groups appeared to oppose it, saying it could damage the fight to bring sexual abusers to justice. David Tucker, crime lead at the College of Policing, said: “To start an investigation from a position of doubt is unlikely to encourage victims to come forward.” The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the report’s recommendation to scrap the policy could not be allowed to result in “a return to the dark days when we looked the other way and failed to confront the horrors of abuse and bring those responsible to justice”. Hogan-Howe said he had been unaware of the scale of the blunders until he read the report. He accepted responsibility for the serious failings and said it was a matter of “professional and personal dismay” that the VIPs had been pursued by the police for so long. However, the commissioner, who retires in February, said he could not know about every investigation across London, even the high-profile ones. He said he had apologised to Bramall, Lady Brittan and Proctor. “They have all suffered as a result of the investigation and our description of the allegations as ‘credible and true’. We should not have said this.” But Hogan-Howe said that when Midland started in late 2014, police were accused of being part of an establishment coverup of sexual abuse: “These investigations … started at a time when there was significant concern that numerous sexual attacks on children and others had been ignored, including by the Metropolitan police in decades gone by. “Even worse were the allegations that abuse had been covered up by the establishment, including the government.” The Met faces more than 40 claims of bungling child sexual abuse inquiries and is expected to face criticism from the government-backed inquiry into the handling of sexual abuse claims over the past several decades. Henriques said Brittan should have been informed before his death that the rape claim against him had been dropped, and he backed calls for suspects to have anonymity unless there was a reason to name them. The Crown Prosecution Service said perverting the course of justice occurred when “a person deliberately makes a false allegation of a crime in the knowledge that there is a risk that the police will conduct an investigation”."
2016-11-08T20:28:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Man admits sending 'cowardly' shooting tweet about Leanne Wood,"A man has admitted sending a “cowardly” tweet to the Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, expressing the wish that she should be shot. Wood saw the message, posted just two weeks after the shooting of the Labour MP Jo Cox, while watching television at home. Swansea magistrates court was told that Ross Hookings, 27, tweeted: “Shame someone didn’t shoot Leanne Wood though.” Hookings, from Port Talbot, south Wales, pleaded guilty to a charge under the Malicious Communications Act and was given a 12-month community order and ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. According to a probation report, Hookings tweeted the message in response to comments Wood made about Port Talbot steelworks during a television debate. Defending, Matthew Murphy said Hookings did not intend Wood to see the tweet but accepted it was in the public domain. District Judge Neale Thomas described the abuse as “cowardly”. He said Hookings was not a young man and should have known better."
2016-11-09T07:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harryâ€™s plea to newspaper editors has slim chance of success,"Prince Harry’s extraordinary statement attacking the “racial undertones” of press coverage of his girlfriend Meghan Markle ends with a plea to newspaper editors to “pause and reflect before any further damage is done”. But his chances of succeeding in this are far lower than the chances of the fifth in line to the throne ever becoming king. If Harry believes he has dampened interest in his sex life with his direct appeal for public sympathy, he has been badly advised. The Sun reported: “IT’S OFFICIAL! Prince Harry confirms he has been dating Suits actress Meghan Markle for months”, while even the BBC led on the fact that “Prince Harry has confirmed that US actress Meghan Markle is his girlfriend”. The royal intervention raises important questions about whether the press has changed since the death of his mother, Diana, or since communications involving his older brother prompted what became the phone-hacking scandal. Harry’s statement suggests he is among those who believe the press has changed surprisingly little.
Recent exuberant newspaper coverage, particularly of Brexit but of more besides, has convinced campaigners for victims of press intrusion that newspapers once again feel relatively unfettered in their pursuit of stories. The Mail’s front page labelling high court judges “enemies of the people”, for example, came days after the government launched a consultation on two remaining elements of the Leveson inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal. The Mail went on to crow that the prime minister had supported the freedom of the press over the matter. The Society of Editors moved quickly after Harry’s statement to stress that the press took allegations of harassment “very seriously” and insist that Fleet Street had cleaned up its act since Diana’s death. It went on to accuse foreign newspapers, ungoverned by its own code of conduct, of the worst excesses in the current crisis. However, Markle’s lawyers are understood to believe it is demand from British newspapers that is encouraging global news outlets to report royal stories that the British press can then follow up – although tabloid sources have always denied that such “story laundering” takes place. Jonathan Coad, a privacy expert and partner at Lewis Silkin who has acted both for and against the industry, said: “Making a plea to Fleet Street for privacy where the press’s commercial interests are engaged is as likely to succeed as making a plea to Vladimir Putin to get out of Ukraine. Unfortunately, tabloid journalists look at Prince Harry as a butcher looks at a pig: his privacy is laid out on a slab for public consumption and turned into profitable copy for the tabloid press.” Prince Harry, whatever his right to a private life, is a public servant paid for by the public purse. If the allegations of harassment and bribes to Markle’s former boyfriends are borne out, one of the most surprising things is that his statement appears to have come before any attempt to protect the privacy of a relatively unknown actor or her anonymous family. Palace officials, as they have in the past, have acted as though the typical behaviour of celebrities – contacting the media regulator, making the terms of engagement clear – is beneath them. Hours after the prince’s statement, Ipso, the industry regulator set up in the wake of Leveson and supported by most of the national press, sent a private advisory note including a letter from Markle’s lawyers urging editors to desist. The response will say more about the relationship between tabloid editors and Theresa May, who will ultimately decide on press regulation, than it will about the relationship between a prince and an actor."
2016-11-09T13:21:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Greater Manchester police gave 'slap on the wrist' cautions for rapes,"A police force has been criticised after it emerged it handed out cautions for serious offences including rape, child abduction and soliciting to commit murder. The police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, has demanded answers from Greater Manchester police (GMP) after it was revealed that cautions were given out for hundreds of serious crimes over the past five years. The figures were released under freedom of information legislation and revealed that the force had handed out 14 cautions for rape offences and a further 177 for a variety of sex crimes. A caution requires an offender to admit their crime and is regarded as an official “slap on the wrist” and an alternative to a charge that would bring the perpetrator before a court. Lloyd said: “On the face of it, it is clearly unacceptable that cautions should be issued for serious crimes such as rape. Taking this approach without a clear, transparent and justifiable rationale risks endangering public confidence in the way in which the police deal with the most serious of offences. “Greater Manchester police now need to explain clearly to the public how it is that rapists have ended up with a slap on the wrist, and I will demand an explanation from the chief constable Ian Hopkins this week at my monthly public scrutiny forum.” Half the rapists were handed a “conditional caution”, where they could be required to complete a course addressing their behaviour or make reparation to their victim to go along with an official warning, which would remain on their police record. No minimum sentence applies to rape crimes although official guidelines for judges suggest a “starting point” of five years in prison before time is added or subtracted for aggravating or mitigating factors. The MP for Blackley and Broughton, Graham Stringer, said the use of cautions for rape and sex offences was “completely inappropriate”. He said: “There is a place for the police caution, but for rape and sexual assault it’s simply wrong.” An analysis of the cautions handed out for 14 rape offences shows three were given to adults, two for the rape of a girl under 16 and another two for the rape of a girl under 13. A further 11 cautions were given to boys for rape crimes, three of them in 2015-16 for raping under-13s. It was also revealed that many more serious crimes ended in a caution, including robbery, gross bodily harm (GBH) and wounding. The figures, released to the Manchester Evening News, showed 86 cautions were handed out for robbery; 81 for GBH; 149 for malicious wounding; 60 for racially or religiously aggravated common assault; 60 for indecent exposure; 33 for violent disorder; 26 for aggravated vehicle taking; 22 for arson endangering life; 18 for possessing a real or imitation firearm; 18 for supplying or offering to supply class A drugs; 16 for endangering the safety of an aircraft and 12 for child abduction. A single caution was also recorded for other crimes such as soliciting to commit murder, perjury, misconduct in a public office, causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person, bigamy and aggravated burglary. GMP issued nearly 32,831 cautions between 1 April 2011, and 31 March 2016. During the whole period, the most common offence for which a caution was handed out was assault occasioning actual bodily harm (5,123 cautions). However, the figures showed the force uses the sanction less frequently now than in 2011-12, when 8,977 were handed out compared with 4,358 in 2015-16. Assistant chief constable Rob Potts, of GMP, defended the force, saying cautions were handed out for serious offences under exceptional circumstances. He added: “A police caution is a formal warning given by the police to deliver swift and effective justice that carries a deterrent effect and reduces the likelihood of reoffending. A police caution can also act as a record for possible reference in future criminal proceedings. “Each offence is dealt with on an individual basis and when a decision to issue a caution is taken, all evidence is considered to ensure this is the most appropriate course of action. “Cautions are normally issued for more minor offences but no two cases are the same and all the circumstances are taken into account.”"
2016-11-09T13:54:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Palace defends Prince Harry's press attack over Meghan Markle coverage,"Kensington Palace has defended Prince Harry’s decision to speak out against what it claims is unacceptable media intrustion into his relationship with the American actor Meghan Markle after the Sun on Wednesday told him to “get real” and the Daily Mail argued his public status “comes at a price”. The 32-year old prince had on Tuesday issued a statement decrying “a wave of abuse and harassment” of Markle in UK papers, which included an alleged “smear” report in the Sun about footage of her that appeared on the Pornhub adult website and “racial undertones” in comment pieces, including in the Mail on Sunday. Sarah Vine, writing in the Daily Mail, was among the tabloid commentators to hit back. She said: “He seems to be saying: ‘Even though I lead a life of unbelievable privilege and could conceivably one day be king, I am entitled to exactly the same privacy as the humblest dweller of the humblest bungalow.’” The Sun said in a leader: “We understand Harry’s worried about the level of interest in them. But he needs to get real. He is an heir to the throne, living a privileged life at public expense.” A source close to the prince said the palace did not accept their arguments and stressed he was trying to defend Markle, not himself, from unwanted coverage. “All this is not for him,” the source said. “He was asking to protect someone else and their privacy, someone he has been in a relationship with for a few months.”
Prince Harry and his advisers are understood to be satisfied that even if newspapers have pushed back against his statement, at least their readers and users of social media now know how much the coverage of his relationship with Markle means to him and his views on the reporting of so far. “That’s what he wanted to do,” a palace source said. “This was a debate happening in public being encouraged by a handful of papers and he has added his voice to that and went straight to the public. Millions of people will have seen that statement directly.” His statement, which Kensington Palace published on the royal family Facebook page, said: “He knows commentators will say ‘this is the price he has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game – it is her life and his.” The statement was shared more than 11,000 times on the social media platform. One user, Thomas Marlow, commented: “Wow I have to say that this is a very modern approach for a royal to release such a thing. The press put his mother in her grave, he has every right to want to protect his girlfriend.” The Daily Mail said in a leader that the statement was “hot-headed” and contained “scattergun allegations”. It questioned why the palace didn’t ask Ipso, the press regulator, to issue cease and desist notices if there was a problem. Ipso did circulate one such notice on Tuesday after Prince Harry’s office had issued his public statement complaining “the past week has seen a line crossed”. In reference to the allegations contained in Harry’s statement, a spokesman for the Daily Mail said: “The Daily Mail believes it acted courteously and correctly throughout its coverage of this story. We carried no front-page smears, our articles had no racial undertones, there were no nightly legal battles to keep stories out of the paper, we had no photographers outside Ms Markle’s mother’s front door, we offered no payments to Ms Markle’s ex-boyfriend and finally, we certainly made no attempt to gain illegal entry to her home.” The Sun strongly denied any smear and said it made clear that the “steamy sex scenes” it had referred to appearing on the adult site were from her appearances in the US drama series Suits. Sources told the Guardian that reporters from the Sun were pulled back from trying to conduct doorstep interviews on Friday amid concerns about the behaviour of the US media, and that the Pornhub story was removed from the Sun’s website on Friday after it attracted critical comments. The Guardian understands that with the support of Kensington Palace, Markle’s lawyers threatened legal action against unidentified UK publishers over some potentially defamatory stories last week, none of which was published. It grew frustrated that some of the stories re-emerged night after night, hence its reference in the statement to “nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers”."
2016-11-09T14:00:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Smart cookies: Waddesdon Manor recreated in gingerbread,"The palatial interiors of Waddesdon Manor, a Rothschild mansion in Buckinghamshire stuffed with treasures once owned by emperors and queens – and now owned by the National Trust – have been recreated in gingerbread and sugar icing for Christmas. The miniature rooms are detailed down to the Sevres and Meissen porcelain set out on the dining room table for a banquet, the festoons of silk brocade in the grandest bedroom where Queen Victoria took a nap, and the views of 18th-century Venice by Francesco Guardi on the panelled walls of the east gallery.
The two-metre-long gingerbread Waddesdon is the creation of Biscuiteers, whose previous work includes a panorama of lost buildings of London such as the Euston Arch and Old London Bridge, made for Selfridges’ Christmas windows in 2013, and a selection of gingerbread books presented last year to Harper Lee, to mark the launch of Go Set a Watchman, 55 years after her last book.
The ingredients for their latest creation included 30kg of butter and 216kg of icing.
Waddesdon was built by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the 1870s in the style of a French renaissance chateau as a setting for his extraordinary art collections, which included furniture owned by Marie Antoinette and a carpet from Versailles. The mansion has been lavishly decorated for Christmas – something that never happened in the days of Waddesdon’s creator. The property, with installations by the light sculptor Bruce Munro, will be open until 2 January."
2016-11-09T17:40:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Lancashire likely to be first county to elect mayor,"Lancashire looks set to become the first English county to introduce mayoral elections in return for more powers from Whitehall. The county’s political leaders are close to agreeing a deal to bring in an elected mayor, following their neighbours in Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city regions where Labour hopes MPs Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram will win inaugural elections next May.
“I think we are clearly heading towards the position of an elected mayor for Lancashire,” said Simon Blackburn, leader of Blackpool council, who heads the nascent shadow Lancashire combined authority, which brings together the 15 local councils in the county. Speaking at an event organised by Marketing Lancashire at Burnley football club on Wednesday, Blackburn said: “Can we imagine a situation whereby the elected mayors of Greater Manchester and Merseyside are striding up Downing Street to have a conversation with the prime minister and the chancellor while Lancashire continues to speak with 15 voices? I can’t really think that’s going to work.“The government are clear that they want robust and accountable governance arrangements – that’s civil servant talk for the need to have an elected mayor.” Blackburn will chair a meeting on Thursday with Jenny Mein, the leader of Lancashire county council, and the leaders of councils in Darwen, Burnley, Rossendale, Hyndburn, Pendle, Fylde, Chorley, Preston, Ribble Valley, West Lancashire, Lancaster, South Ribble and Wyre. He said leaders would discuss what the role of elected mayor of Lancashire might look like. “It is for the leaders and the people of Lancashire to decide how much power they want to place in the hands of that individual.” If the leaders agree, they will propose a deal with central government asking for more spending powers in return for the introduction of a mayor.
Across the Pennines, Lancashire’s arch-rivals in Yorkshire have yet to agree a county-wide devolution deal. So far only the Sheffield city region has decided to elect a mayor next May, though that deal could be imperilled by a case being heard in the high court this week challenging whether Chesterfield in Derbyshire and Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire should be part of the mayoralty. The five Labour leaders in West Yorkshire wanted to strike their own deal based on the Leeds city region, which includes bits of North Yorkshire. But they have been unable to reach a compromise with Tory MPs and councillors in North Yorkshire, who favour a Greater Yorkshire deal. Andrew Percy, the minister for the northern powerhouse project, said on Wednesday he could see the merits in a Greater Yorkshire mayoralty, which would include his east Yorkshire constituency of Brigg and Goole. Speaking at the event at Burnley football club, Percy said: “We have to get a deal for the rest of Yorkshire. If you look at the port infrastructure, the M62 corridor, everywhere through to Leeds it’s so important to the economy of the north. We want a devo deal because Manchester is powering ahead, so is Liverpool, so is Tees Valley just to the north. We’ve got this gap in the middle and we’ve got to plug that.”"
2016-11-09T17:59:54Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police officer raped girl, 14, in her bedroom 36 years ago, court told","A police officer raped a 14-year-old girl after giving her a lift home from a police station 36 years ago, a court heard on Wednesday. Raymond Jeacock, 62, was a 26-year-old detective constable when he followed the then child to her bedroom and told her: “You need fucking,” a jury at Nottingham crown court was told. “She was shocked and terrified,” said Andrew Vout for the prosecution. “She didn’t fight him; she did as she was told.” In a 2014 police interview, the woman, now in her 50s, said: “I didn’t fight back, I didn’t tell him to stop, I didn’t do anything [...] I couldn’t cope with the thought that I didn’t do anything.” When questioned by the police two years ago, Jeacock denied the allegations, saying he had “never laid a finger” on the girl. Outlining the crown’s case more than three decades after the rape is alleged to have happened, Vout said the girl had met the officer before. Her mother had asked Jeacock to “tick her off” for having a sexual relationship with an older boy. “He asked her a number of intimate questions,” he said. “It wasn’t something she particularly enjoyed.” He explained to the jury why it had taken so long for the case to come to trial: “The jury will understand that in the 36 years that have elapsed, the willingness to investigate and prosecute allegations made by children has undergone something of a sea change.” The court heard that on 13 December 1980 the girl had visited her then boyfriend in a young offender’s institution in Leicestershire, using the identity of another girl. She was then taken to a police station, after officers arrived wanting to question the older female whose proof of identity she was using. After the mistake was realised, her father, who was separated from the girl’s mother and lived at a separate address, was called to take her home. But Jeacock told the girl her father had been drinking and that he would take her home himself. When the girl got home, she opened the door with keys hidden under a plant pot. The former police officer asked her if she would lock the door after him, but she said she would leave it open for her sister, the court heard. As she was getting ready for bed, she heard a noise. In the recording of the 2014 police interview she said: “I heard someone coming up the stairs. He just walked in and I was in shock, and he just said: ‘You need fucking.’ I did as I was told.” He pulled one leg out of her trousers and knickers and started to rape her, she said. But during the alleged rape, her father arrived at the house and called up the stairs. “He just whispered to me: ‘Don’t say a word. If he asks, say I was searching.’” Her parents made a complaint to police and the girl was taken for a medical examination several days after the alleged rape. In the police interview she said the police doctor had told her to undress. “Then he told me I was a little slag and I’d had more pricks than a second-hand dart board,” she told police. The court heard that Jeacock was “required to resign” on 13 July 1981 after a police disciplinary hearing, but no criminal charges were brought against him. After the alleged victim went to the police again two years ago, Jeacock denied the allegations. Vout said Jeacock told police he had taken the girl home because no female officers were around. “It couldn’t happen today, but it wasn’t such a big deal in those days,” he told police, adding that the allegations were “extending the misery that was brought to my family”. Jeacock denies rape. The case continues."
2016-11-09T18:37:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Operation Midland: peers demand release of unredacted report,"A judge-led inquiry which has severely criticised the police investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring should be released in full, peers have said. A summary of the report by Richard Henriques into Operation Midland, which was redacted by senior Metropolitan police officers, was released on Tuesday. It found the inquiry was launched on the basis of a single witness and made 43 separate errors. Officers from the Met misled a senior judge to obtain search warrants and seemed to set aside the presumption of innocence to traduce the reputations of former MPs and war heroes, the report found. But only a fraction of the original 493-page report by Henriques was released to the public – and that was redacted after being examined by officers and their legal representatives.
In an emergency debate in the House of Lords, the retired judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, an independent crossbench peer, said: “It is so patently unsatisfactory that the full report is not produced for the public to read. Could I ask the minister whether in fact the Home Office should be urging the commissioner of police to make this report public?” Following the release of the key findings, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said he “fully recognised” D-day veteran and former army chief, Edwin Bramall, former Tory MP Harvey Proctor and the late former home secretary Leon Brittan were all “innocent of the offences of which they were accused”. Former Conservative MP Patrick Cormack said Lord Bramall and Lord Brittan had been “traduced in a most vile and improper way”. He said the reputation of the late prime minister Edward Heath had been “trashed” by accusations while Proctor’s life has been ruined. Cormack demanded a debate and for copies of the inquiry’s report to be made available. Liberal Democrat peer Susan Miller pressed the government over Henriques’s recommendation that those accused should remain anonymous until police brought charges. “An initial reading of the report suggests that the operation fell short on a number of issues of natural justice,” she said. “The one I would like to ask the minister about, though, is whether she believes and whether she will make sure her department issues guidance that people under investigation should remain anonymous until police are in a position to actually bring charges,” Lady Miller said. In reply, home officer minister Susan Williams said there were circumstances in which names might be released in order for victims to come forward. “Victims’ groups support that principle,” she said. The House of Commons home affairs select committee is expected to examine the report’s findings. David Winnick, the Labour committee member, said there appeared to have been a failure to test the claims of the accuser known as “Nick” before launching a £2m investigation. “It is a question of the police using common sense in deciding with what seriousness they should pursue the complaints, bearing in mind evidence or lack of evidence, as well as credibility of those making the allegations,” he said."
2016-11-09T19:24:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"No evidence to link Levi Bellfield to fresh crimes, says Met police","No evidence has been found to link the serial killer Levi Bellfield to any fresh crimes, say officers who have been reexamining files after claims he confessed to a series of unsolved rapes and murders. The operation, which involved 10 police forces across the country and was being coordinated by the Metropolitan police, has been closed as a result.
“It has taken a considerable amount of time and police resources to conduct the investigation. All lines of enquiry have now been exhausted and the decision has been taken to close this investigation as there is no evidence to link the individual to any case for which he has not already been convicted,” Scotland Yard said in a statement released on Wednesday. The investigation was launched after police received information in early 2015 that Bellfield had admitted various “serious crimes” while in his prison cell at Wakefield prison. Police have informed the families of people thought to have been additional victims of Bellfield that the investigation will now be closed. Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, murdered the teenagers Milly Dowler and Marsha McDonnell, and 22-year-old Amelie Delagrange. He has also been informed. Though police have long believed he is linked to other crimes, officers were said to be treating his reported confessions with skepticism when they announced they were investigating in January this year. Officers looking into claims that Bellfield had an accomplice arrested a man but released him with no further action soon afterwards. Bellfield had long denied any involvement in the murder of Dowler, of which he was convicted in 2011, but finally confessed this year. Soon after, his solicitor wrote to Surrey police to say that claims he had, during an interview with officers, admitted abducting, raping and killing the schoolgirl were false. The force said it stood by its statement. Dowler was the first of Bellfield’s known victims. The murder of 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell followed in 2003, before he then tried to kill 18-year-old Kate Sheedy in May the following year. She was injured but managed to survive the attack. Three months after that, he attacked and killed the French student Amelie Delagrange."
2016-11-10T02:23:35Z,uk-news,UK news,"Pentonville prison escape: Matthew Baker caught in east London, say police","A man who escaped from Pentonville prison, where he was being held after being convicted of attempted murder, has been arrested, police have said. Matthew Baker was found less than 10 miles away in east London on Wednesday night, having spent about three days on the run. He was being held at a north London police station on Wednesday night, police said. A 33-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman were also arrested and were being held at a station in the east of the city. Baker, 28, had been awaiting sentencing after his conviction two weeks ago for stabbing a man 25 times in Dagenham, east London. He and another prisoner, James Whitlock, 31, are thought to have escaped from the north London prison over Sunday night. It is believed that they used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through their cell bars before scaling an outer perimeter wall. It was rumoured in the prison that they had folded sheets into the shape of a person to make it look like they were asleep in their beds and escaped through a cell window on the fifth floor, using more sheets to lower themselves down.
Whitlock, who was on remand charged with conspiracy to burgle, remained on the run on Wednesday night and police renewed appeals for information. “He is described as a white man of slim build. He has the word ‘Tracy’ tattooed on his torso. It is not known what clothing he had on when he escaped from the prison,” police said. “Officers from Islington borough are continuing to investigate, supported by expertise and resources from the Met’s flying squad and homicide and major crime command.” They advised anyone seeing Whitlock not to approach him, but to call 999. Labour’s Emily Thornberry, the local MP, said the escape was the “final straw” and called for the Victorian-era prison to be closed down. “People don’t seem to be safe inside Pentonville and now it transpires inmates can escape. That is the final straw. If they don’t have control of the place, what is the point of it being there?” she told the Islington Gazette. “This was built in 1842 and is totally inappropriate for modern needs. It should have shut a long time ago, and needs to close as soon as possible.”"
2016-11-10T06:01:24Z,uk-news,UK news,"Move over, Manchester â€“ Midlands motor Birmingham is setting the pace","Move over, Manchester. Never mind the northern powerhouse. Birmingham is Britain’s business hotspot, according to the estate agent Knight Frank. The UK’s second city, with a population of more than a million, has cast off its image of motorways, industrial decline and urban unrest to become a budding centre for financial services, new technology and architectural showpieces, Knight Frank said in a report. The city’s renaissance is being fuelled by the arrival of big banks, professional services firms and the planned building of the HS2 rail link to London alongside the success of Jaguar Land Rover and other manufacturers. Mirroring this development, pints of mild and uninspiring nightlife have given way to glitzy bars, Michelin-starred restaurants and upmarket shops. John Lewis, whose former managing director Andy Street is now the Tory candidate for Birmingham’s mayor, opened a 170,000 sq ft store last year.
Deutsche Bank opened a Birmingham office 10 years ago and now employs 1,200 people, including corporate bankers and wealth managers. Next year HSBC will return its retail bank’s head office to the founding city of Midland Bank, which HSBC bought in 1992. The move will create 1,200 jobs. The closure of regional tax offices leading to job losses will be Birmingham’s gain in 2019 when HM Revenue & Customs opens a regional hub employing at least 3,000 people. HSBC and HMRC are moving into new buildings in central Birmingham, whose Victorian grandeur gave way to grim postwar office blocks during the 70s and 80s. HSBC will occupy a building at the Arena Central development in the convention quarter overlooking Broad Street, where city centre living took off in the late 90s. Ashley Hudson, Knight Frank’s head of Birmingham commercial property, said even before HS2 is built Birmingham is benefiting from being distinct from but relatively close to London, which is 120 miles away. Last year 6,016 people moved from London to Birmingham, more than to any other UK city. But he said Birmingham had its own appeal and that graduates from its universities were increasingly staying on, attracted by the quality of life, lower living costs and career opportunities. “I arrived in Birmingham 20 years ago and it wasn’t a particularly brilliant place to be and a lot of people would agree with that. “At one time in the office district there wasn’t really anything to do after work, but now there are bars opening all the time and they are full. There’s never been a better time to work in property in Birmingham.” Despite being almost twice the size of Manchester, Birmingham has played second fiddle in cultural and business terms to its rival former industrial city. Just as the Smiths and the Stone Roses had more credibility than Duran Duran and ELO, so the last government favoured Manchester as a model for urban renewal, putting it at the centre of the northern powerhouse project.
Under Theresa May that has changed, and she now refers to Birmingham as the Midlands motor as she seeks to build appeal across the country. The city’s growing appeal is reflected in its property market, Knight Frank said. Takeup of office space this year of 596,500 sq ft is 18% higher than the long-term trend, and in the year to the end of June, Birmingham was one of the 10 best-performing European cities for capital growth. Since the start of 2014, more than 425,000 sq ft of office space has moved from London to Birmingham, with a potential further 1m sq ft in the pipeline, Knight Frank said. Trowers & Hamlins, a London law firm, opened an office in Birmingham with a handful of people five years ago, but the branch now employs 100. Chris Plumley, a property law partner at Trowers who has worked in Birmingham for almost 20 years, said the office expanded as the city spawned bigger and bolder regeneration projects. “Birmingham has always had a pretty vibrant market, but what seems to have happened is a move away from parochialism,” he said. “The business community has developed a confidence that is more fitting for the size of the city.” Birmingham’s renaissance has further to go, Knight Frank’s Hudson argues. He said the growing financial sector and Birmingham’s proximity to London give it the potential to become a technology centre as tech firms set up to serve banks and jobs in manufacturing are performed by robots."
2016-11-10T08:21:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"Croydon tram driver 'blacked out' in crash that killed seven, claim passengers","At least seven people have been killed and more than 50 taken to hospital after a tram, believed to have been going too fast, crashed in south London on Wednesday morning. Survivors of the accident said people went flying as the tram left the tracks, with bodies and blood inside the carriages following the derailment, which occurred at about 6.10am. Some passengers said the driver of the vehicle, who was arrested afterwards, had blacked out. Martin Bamford, 30, from Croydon, one of those on the tram, recalled it speeding up. “Everyone just literally went flying,” he said. Speaking outside Croydon University hospital, where he was being treated for broken ribs, he added: “It was just terrifying. There was a woman that was on top of me ... I don’t think she made it at all. She wasn’t responsive. There was blood everywhere.” Bamford said he asked the driver if he was OK: “He said: ‘Yeah.’I said to him, ‘What happened?’ He said he thinks he blacked out.” Royal Navy veteran Kevin Snow, 57, was one of those injured. He said the tram failed to slow down at its usual point coming out of a tunnel between the Lloyd Park and Sandilands stops. “Usually, as you come out the tunnel, you feel the brakes, but I didn’t seem to at all. I thought, ‘He should be braking in a minute.’ The next thing I knew we were on our side. Everyone was screaming and shouting, a lot of people were injured – lots couldn’t move.” He said the tram slid for between eight and 10 seconds before coming to a halt. “It seemed like for ever that everyone was trying to get out, but we couldn’t find a way out. “All I could think about was if no one called the emergency services, could another tram hit us?” The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said: “Initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted.” British Transport police Asst Ch Con Robin Smith said the force was investigating whether the driver fell asleep, alongside “a number of factors”. He said officers would be “working through the night” at the scene, and staff would be present for a “number of days”. He said: “We have a very difficult and very challenging scene. “We have carriages that are lying on their side … which will eventually have to be moved carefully. And at the same time, us being able to understand exactly what happened.” The 42-year-old male driver, from Beckenham, is being held on suspicion of manslaughter and is currently in custody, British Transport police said. The crash occurred near to Sandilands junction on a sharp, left-hand curve as the tram was approaching a stop as it travelled from New Addington to Wimbledon. There is a 12mph (20km/h) speed limit on the section in question, which is on old rail tracks. The Croydon trams have a top speed of around 50mph. After news the crash broke, claims emerged on Facebook that an incident had occurred on the same stretch of line on 31 October, though there were no reports that anyone was hurt. In a post written that day, Andy Nias, from Croydon, wrote: “30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up ... tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! I swear the tram lifted on to one side. Everyone still shaking ... it’s mad.” In a further post on Wednesday, Nias said he had reported the incident to British Transport police, who advised him not to speak to journalists. Another man, James Tofield, who is also from Croydon, said he too was on the tram on 31 October. On Wednesday evening, he posted an image online of a text message to his partner dated that morning. It read: “The driver went round the bend so fast, u no the tunnel ... when u r coming up to Sandilands, he’s obviously forgot there’s a bend approaching, smacked on the brakes and somehow the tram managed to stay on the track.” He said he intended to report the incident to both Transport for London (TfL) and the police. TfL said it was aware of the claims but refused to comment further because an investigation was ongoing. British Transport police did not respond to a request for comment. Wednesday’s crash is the worst accident on the rail and tram networks since 2004, when seven people were killed in a rail crash near Ufton Nervet in Berkshire, when a car driver trying to kill himself caused a serious accident. There have been no fatalities on board a tram in the UK since 1959, when two female passengers and the driver died when a tram caught fire in Shettlestone Road, Glasgow, after a collision with a lorry. Martin Harris, who was on his way to work, called his mother, Jane, after the crash to tell her a body was lying on top of him. She told the Telegraph that he had told her “it looked like the driver had fallen asleep”. Jane Harris added: “He was on the tram, the tram was going really fast, the tram went over, my son had a dead body on him.” Nearby resident Hannah Collier, 23, said: “I heard a massive crash at about 6.15am, then heard shouting, then the emergency services arrived. They started bringing up the casualties, some very seriously injured.” Eight fire engines, five fire rescue units containing specialist rescue equipment and 22 ambulance crews were involved in the rescue operation. A spokeswoman for the London ambulance service said eight people had serious or life-threatening injuries, 20 of those injured were taken to St George’s university hospital in Tooting and 31 to Croydon university hospital. Croydon Health Services NHS trust urged members of the public with minor ailments to go to their GP or a walk-in centre instead of the hospital to ease pressure on staff. A casualty helpline was set up for relatives and friends to call. Mike Brown, London’s transport commissioner, said: “Our thoughts are with those who sadly lost their lives in this incident, those who were injured and the families of those affected. We are working closely with the emergency services on-site and will continue to work with them during the investigation into what happened.” Finn Brennan, of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said the incident was “truly dreadful”. He said: “Lives have been lost and there are many serious injuries. This is a tragedy for all those involved. For the women and men who set out this morning on their journey to work and suffered this awful accident and their families, the grief and pain must be terrible.“There should be no rush to judgment or to place blame until the facts are known.” Transport expert Christian Wolmar, who is also Labour’s candidate in the Richmond Park byelection, said trams generally had an excellent safety record and most accidents that did occur involved road vehicles or pedestrians. “This sort of accident is incredibly rare, particularly because it’s on a section that used to be a railway and there are no cars around,” he said. The Croydon tram is London’s only tram network. It uses a mix of on-street and segregated running for its 17 miles (27km) of track. More than 27 million passengers used the service in 2015-16. A casualty bureau number has been set up for relatives and friends to call – 0800 056 0154.

2016-11-10T13:14:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Cardiff teenager faces fight to avoid being sent back to Afghanistan,"Thousands of people, politicians, celebrities and refugee charities have backed a campaign to stop a teenager who fled to Britain from Afghanistan as a 10-year-old after his father was murdered from being forcibly removed to the country of his birth. Bashir Naderi’s sole memory of Afghanistan is his father being shot by the Taliban and he has no contacts with family or friends, cannot speak any of the Afghan languages and claims he will not survive if he is sent back. Naderi, 19, was detained by immigration officials in Cardiff – where he was brought up by a loving foster family – taken to Gatwick airport and came within minutes of being forced on to a plane bound for Kabul when his long-term girlfriend and her family managed to win him a temporary reprieve. Naderi said he was terrified that any day now he might be detained again and sent back to a country he fears and has no connections with. “I am really, really scared,” Naderi told the Guardian. “I was in the middle of my college exams when all this happened. My life and my family is here. I feel as if I was born in Cardiff, not Afghanistan. I couldn’t cope there.” His foster mother, Dawn Jackson, who took Naderi in, said she was frightened for the teenager. “I love him to death. I’ve had him for 10 years. I’ve nurtured him, looked after him. He’s part of my family. He’s a Cardiff boy. The Home Office seem to think it’s safe for him to go back. We know it’s not. It’s a very cruel society that can do this to a young man.”
After his father was shot, Naderi’s mother sold the family’s land to send her son to the UK. He does not know what has happened to her. It took him a year to reach Britain, where he was placed with Jackson in the Welsh capital. He flourished, attending a Catholic high school, gaining nine GCSEs and going on to study at Cardiff and Vale college. Naderi was detained after attending what he thought was going to be a routine immigration appointment and spent 11 days behind bars at a police station in Wales and a detention centre. “I’ve never been in trouble but it felt as if I had been put in prison,” said Naderi. When it became clear that he was going to be taken to Gatwick to be put on a plane, he resisted, was restrained with some sort of belt and suffered a wrist injury, meaning his lower arm is now in a cast. “The guards just laughed,” he said. Meanwhile Naderi’s girlfriend, Nicole Cooper, 24, the daughter of a retired policeman, was at the Royal Courts of Justice in London trying to halt the process. At the last moment, Naderi’s lawyer managed to obtain a stay of removal, arguing Afghanistan was not safe for him because he was so westernised. Naderi, nursing his injured arm, was freed and left outside in the cold for two and a half hours as he waited for Cooper’s family to pick him up. It is now up to the Home Office to make the case again for Naderi’s removal. It could lead to a judicial review that may have implications for many other unaccompanied youngsters who have made a life in the UK and become westernised. Naderi is on tenterhooks. “I’m not myself. I can’t sleep. Life is on hold,” he said. The response to the case has been extraordinary. By Thursday around 12,000 people had signed a petition calling for Naderi to be allowed to stay. The Welsh singers Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews were among those to voice support. Members of all parties at the Welsh assembly – including Ukip – took part in a demonstration in support of Naderi on the steps of the Senedd on Wednesday.
The Labour assembly member Jenny Rathbone said: “He is a Cardiff citizen. He’s an amazing guy, very keen to make a contribution. I think there’s a deliberate policy for the UK government to push back all the people who were unaccompanied minors. That is really worrying.” Immigration is not a devolved issue but responding to an urgent question on Naderi’s case, the Welsh government’s cabinet secretary for children and communities, Carl Sargeant, said: “I hope the home secretary will take note of the views expressed here and among the wider Welsh public.” Jo Stevens, the MP for Cardiff Central and shadow Welsh secretary, said the case highlighted a wider issue. “To forcibly remove Bashir and others like him to a country where there is a high security risk seems completely against what the public wants,” she said. Judith Dennis, policy manager for the Refugee Council, said: “It’s utterly baffling that the government is doggedly determined to return these teenagers to a country where the security situation is worsening.” A report from the Refugee Support Network published this year said that since 2007 more than 2,000 youngsters had been forcibly removed to Afghanistan. It monitored 25 and found that most struggled to find work or access education and suffered mental health problems. If an unaccompanied child qualifies for asylum, they are granted limited leave to remain, normally for a period of five years. Once an individual turns 17½, the Home Office expects them either to start making preparations to return to their country of origin once they turn 18 or to make a further application for leave to remain. These applications are considered on a case by case basis. A Home Office spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases."
2016-11-10T13:20:58Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK-China relations still 'golden', says PM, as investment talks open","Britain’s relationship with China remains “golden”, Theresa May has said, as she opened talks aimed at bringing billions of pounds in Chinese investment to the north of England. The prime minister and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, are meeting Ma Kai, one of China’s vice-premiers, and other senior Chinese officials. The two-day visit by Ma is seen as an opportunity to put UK-Sino relations on an even keel after the row over Hinkley Point C. Using the “golden era” phrase coined by David Cameron and George Osborne in their attempts to woo the Chinese, May said on Thursday: “I am determined that as we leave the European Union, we build a truly global Britain that is open for business.
“As we take the next step in this golden era of relations between the UK and China, I am excited about the opportunities for expanding trade and investment between our two countries.” Hammond will attempt to secure Chinese investment in more than £5bn worth of infrastructure and property schemes across the north of England, including plans to double the size of the BBC’s MediaCityUK in Salford. The portfolio is similar to the Northern Powerhouse Investment Pitchbook Osborne launched in September last year during a trip to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in China. It is unclear what Chinese investment followed the then chancellor’s £24bn pitch, but at least three of its projects also featured in Hammond’s portfolio launched on Thursday. The 13 projects on offer to the Chinese include plans to build 1,000 homes in Liverpool, the UK’s biggest potash mine in the North York Moors national park and a regeneration project that promises to bring 6,000 jobs to Doncaster. While Osborne’s pitchbook was heavy on projects in the major northern cities of Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne, Hammond will attempt to secure investment for other urban areas including Sunderland, Stockport and Ellesmere Port. Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at Nottingham University, said China’s interest in the northern powerhouse was limited, but Ma’s visit was more significant given Donald Trump’s election in the US on Wednesday. “I don’t think the Chinese are bothered with the northern powerhouse at all. That is a British agenda. They are listening, but no more than that,” he said. “They’re interested in making money and will only do it [invest] if they see the British proposals being put on the table as offering something for them. “The visit becomes more useful now because of the US election result. Even though the Chinese preferred Trump to win over [Hillary] Clinton, they are also aware that Trump is likely to take a more unpredictable and strong position on Chinese economic ties, investment and capital flow. “That being the case, what the UK is proactively engaging with the Chinese on – trade, investment and economic cooperation – becomes more attractive.” Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, confirmed that the government was working with 15 Chinese investors on property development and infrastructure projects in the north of England, although officials have not given details of the schemes. “Attracting trade and investment is the foundation of our strong economy, helping to create local jobs, build local businesses and contribute to our national wealth,” he said. “These real-time and market-ready projects will build on the successes of the northern powerhouse region, which has for centuries been a global hub of commerce, science, technology and innovation. Setting out opportunities like these show to Chinese investors, and to the world, that the UK remains open for business.”"
2016-11-10T13:42:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Bear Grylls riles Welsh locals with proposal to build beach huts,"The television adventurer Bear Grylls may have endured some of the most extreme conditions on the planet, but his survival on a north Wales peninsula is now under threat. The Old Etonian, who has a personal fortune worth £6m, has gone head to head with a rural council over his plans to develop a local beach. Grylls, who is best known for his extreme nature feats including scaling Arctic glaciers and becoming one of the youngest people ever to climb Everest, has submitted plans to build 25 beach huts at a tranquil spot on the Llyn peninsula. He is part of a business consortium applying for consent to develop empty land it has bought at Mynydd Tir y Cwmwd in Llanbedrog, which is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). But the former SAS soldier has come up against his toughest adversary yet, the tiny Llanbedrog community council. The application has enraged the council and local residents, who are strongly opposed to any development taking place at the beach. Councillor John Jones, who described the beach as iconic, said there was increasing local resentment towards developers. “The beach is absolutely beautiful and the last thing we want are beach huts,” he said. “There is no need, and the only reason for them to do this would be to earn a quick buck.” A dilapidated beach hut in nearby Abersoch sold for an eye-watering £153,000 earlier this year. Measuring just four metres by three (13ft by 9ft), it had no electricity or water and the owners were banned from sleeping in it overnight. Just a few miles away there was a two-bedroom house in the village of Llanbedrog - and a seven-bedroom terraced house at Tywyn across Cardigan bay - on sale for the same price. “Everyone is up in arms about this. We have had developers come in, knock down beautiful Welsh cottages and replace them with huge monstrosities,” Jones said. “Yet, someone like me who has lived in this village my whole life has been trying to get planning permission for five years to build a house and have not been allowed to. “We are just questioning what their intentions are. It is beautiful as it is, and this would not be an appropriate development.” Backed by dunes, the beach is accessible only via a track and is popular with windsurfers, surfers and canoeists. “What else are they going to propose in the future?” Jones asked. “The headland and beach is safeguarded as a site of special scientific interest and no one wants to see any development at all in this corner. We will fight by any means necessary to stop any development, large or small. “We don’t want our beach ruined by beach huts.” This is the second time Grylls, an evangelical Christian, has come up against locals in the area. In 2013 he was forced to remove a steel slide on his private island to avoid a showdown with planning officials. Grylls installed the slide on St Tudwal’s West, about half a mile off the Llyn peninsula, and posted a picture on his Twitter page. His tweet prompted Gwynedd council to investigate whether he had broken planning regulations because the island is an area of outstanding natural beauty. He also had to compromise over plans for a £580,000 harbour on the 380-metre long island. Grylls bought the island in 2001 for £95,000. He, his wife Shara and their three sons split their time between it and their other home, a Dutch barge in London. The most recent application has been submitted by Gryll’s business partner, James Nichols of the Llanbedrog Headland Company, which has its headquarters in a leafy part of Cheshire. The application states they are aware that the site is a SSSI and hope to discuss these issues with the local authority. It says: “We wish to hold a pre-application meeting to discuss proposals for beach huts and potential tourism-related schemes at Mynydd Tir y Cwmwd. “The proposals are at a very early stage of formulation, as we wish to meet with the council to understand its aspirations for the area and discuss the principle of the proposals. “Given the nature of the unique proposals, as well as landscape and environmental designations relating to the site we are keen to meet in person to discuss the proposals.” Peter Brett Associates, the agents acting on behalf of Nichols, did not respond to a request for a comment. Gwynedd council confirmed they had received a pre-planning application for the beach huts. A spokesperson said: “The council’s planning department has received an application for pre-application advice regarding beach huts in the Mynydd Tir y Cwmwd, Llanbedrog area. “This is a process undertaken before an applicant decides whether they intend to submit a full planning application.” In 1998, at age 23, Grylls became one of the youngest people to climb Mount Everest. He also once and rowed naked in a bathtub along the Thames to raise funds for charity and circumnavigated the British Isles on a jet-ski. The Bear Grylls Survival Academy, which offers a range of courses to the public, operates in the US, the UK, Australia and Zimbabwe. He has previously attracted controversy in Britain for allegedly taking part in a tax avoidance scheme and for staging some scenes in his television programmes. In August last year, he caused an outcry after posting a photo of his 11-year-old son, Jesse, on social media standing on rocks in the middle of the sea without a lifejacket."
2016-11-10T15:19:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Crown jewels of Scottish art to be housed in new Â£16.8m complex,"Scotland’s main national art collection, including works by Sir Henry Raeburn, Samuel Peploe and the Glasgow Boys, is to be housed in a new gallery complex in central Edinburgh. Sir John Leighton, the director general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said the warren of corridors and rooms currently housing the Scottish collection underneath its neo-classical galleries on the Mound were “an institutional embarrassment”. “They’re cramped, they’re dingy, they have an unpleasant subterranean atmosphere,” Leighton said. He said they were so badly sited, accessible by a narrow internal staircase, that the works were seen by only 18% of the galleries’ 1.4 million visitors each year.
Work has begun stripping out the galleries, which were built under the National Gallery and Royal Scottish Academy in the 1970s, to make way for a £16.8m redevelopment partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The rebuild will extend the lower floor and precinct above it by five metres (16ft), resculpting the eastern gardens with shallower slopes, broader, curving stairs, and adding a far larger main entrance to the complex, which would bring visitors immediately to the Scottish collection. “It is absolutely vital that what I would call the crown jewels of Scottish art are shown right in the heart of the city, right in the heart of the national galleries, the symbolic cultural, artistic centre of the country. I’m absolutely confident we’re on our way to creating a space everybody can be proud of,” Leighton said. Tricia Allerston, the galleries’ project director, said they hoped to double the number of works on show, including larger canvases that could not fit in the current rooms, by tripling the area available. It would feature work not often displayed, including the Portrait of a Lady in Black by Francis Cadell, a member of the Scottish Colourists group along with Peploe, and Northumberland-born Joseph Crawhall, a member of the Glasgow Boys grouping, whose delicate painting The White Drake was one of the galleries’ most-loved pieces.
There would be new spaces dedicated to Raeburn, best known for his “skating minister” the Rev Dr Robert Walker on Duddingston Lock, and 20th-century Scottish artists such as Phoebe Anna Traquair, famous for her embroideries and murals. The complex, due to open to the public in 2019, is the latest in a series of gallery refurbishments in the city. The National Galleries of Scotland gutted and rebuilt the portrait gallery’s gothic revival building near St Andrew Square, with a suite of new spaces, in 2011, while in the same year, the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street was rebuilt internally with a new lower-level public entrance and overhauled collections, at a cost of £47m. Soon to be demolished, the existing galleries were named concrete construction of the year when they opened in 1978. Despite facing Princes Street Gardens, which link the city’s old and new towns, towards the Scott Monument, Waverley station and the Firth of Forth, they were made with blacked-out windows. They were, Leighton said, known as the B wing within the galleries. The basement site “was sometimes wrongly assumed to reflect this gallery’s attitude to our national school”. • This article was amended on 11 November 2016 to clarify that Joseph Crawhall, though a member of the Glasgow Boys group, was not Scottish but born in Northumberland, and that Francis Cadell was a member of the Scottish Colourists group."
2016-11-10T16:18:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Man held in Wrexham on suspicion of terrorism offences,"A 48-year-old man has been arrested in Wrexham on suspicion of terrorism offences. Police said the man, whom they did not identify, was held on Thursday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism, under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. He was arrested as part of a joint operation between the Welsh extremism counter-terrorism unit, North Wales police and the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit. A police spokesman said: “The man is being questioned at a police station in the West Midlands. The arrest was preplanned and intelligence-led. There was no threat to the public’s safety. An address in Wrexham is the subject of an ongoing search.” Officers have 48 hours to question the suspect before charging or releasing him or applying for a warrant of further detention."
2016-11-10T16:20:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Croydon tram derailment: 19-year-old man is first victim to be named,"A 19-year-old man has been named as one of the six men and one woman killed when a tram derailed in south London. Friends said Dane Chinnery, from New Addington, was among those killed in the incident on Wednesday morning. They said he was a Crystal Palace fan and called on his fellow supporters to hold a minute’s applause in his memory at the team’s next home game. Chinnery was reportedly on his way to work at the drainage company Hydro Cleansing at the time of the derailment. The company said: “Dane Chinnery was a valued member of the Hydro Cleansing team and family. He will be sorely missed.” A family friend, Lloyd Allen, told the Evening Standard he was a “lovely, caring young man … beautiful inside and out”. Crystal Palace FC offered condolences to Chinnery’s family and those of the other victims.
Martin Giles, headteacher of Meridian high school, Chinnery’s former school, said staff and students were heartbroken at his death. At least three other former pupils were injured in the incident, he added. “All of the staff in the school share their pain at this difficult time,” Giles said. The British Transport police (BTP), who are investigating the derailment, said they were not expecting to be able to publish the names of any of the victims on Thursday. Survivors said passengers were sent flying as the tram left the tracks shortly after 6am, and the carriages were left strewn with bodies and blood. More than 70 firefighters worked to release passengers trapped in the carriages. It was the worst tram or train accident in the UK since 2004. Fifty-one people were taken to nearby hospitals. Of the 20 patients taken to St George’s hospital in Tooting all but three have been discharged.
A statement from the hospital said: “Yesterday (9 November), three patients seriously injured in the tram incident in Croydon underwent surgery at St George’s. “All three patients left theatre yesterday, and are continuing to be looked after by our surgical and medical teams. We are not planning to issue any further updates about their condition for the time being.” A further 31 people were taken to Croydon university hospital and seven people went to the hospital on their own. Dr Nnenna Osuji, medical director of Croydon health services NHS trust, said: “Yesterday we cared for 38 people affected by the tram derailment and supported many of their families. One patient stayed with us overnight at Croydon university hospital. It is hoped they can be discharged later today.” Sections of the tram network remained closed on Thursday and the derailed tram remained at the scene as officers from the BTP investigated. Police confirmed they were examining claims on Facebook dating from last week about a tram that came close to derailing on the same bend. Andy Nias, from Croydon, wrote on 31 October: “30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up … tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! I swear the tram lifted on to one side. Everyone still shaking … it’s mad.” A police spokeswoman told the Guardian: “We were only made aware of the report on social media yesterday and it’s now forming part of our inquiries.”
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, visited the site on Wednesday afternoon with the local MP Gavin Barwell and warned that the death toll, which at that point stood at five, could rise. Barwell wrote on his blog that it had been a “long and tragic day” and paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency services. Tony Newman, leader of Croydon council, said: “Croydon is in mourning today.” The London assembly member Steve O’Connell said: “Today the whole of Croydon is in mourning as we try to come to terms with the single biggest tragedy in our community in living memory.” Police were investigating whether the tram was going too fast as it approached a bend at Sandilands junction. The driver, who was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, was later released on bail. “The man from Beckenham has been bailed until May while investigations continue at the scene and officers work to establish the circumstances of the incident,” the BTP said. Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith said on Wednesday that officers were investigating whether the driver had fallen asleep, alongside other potential causes. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch, which was also investigating, said the derailment took place at a point where drivers must slow to less than 12mph to negotiate a sharp left-hand curve in the track. “The derailment occurred on the curve and initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted,” it said."
2016-11-10T17:03:16Z,uk-news,UK news,One of the oldest Scottish remembrance poppies is restored,"A few scraps of crumpled red silk and cotton, one of the oldest surviving Scottish remembrance poppies, has been restored in time for Armistice Day. It was made in 1930, just four years after the separate Scottish poppy scheme was founded. The poppies made and distributed in Scotland are still distinct from those made in England; they are more botanically correct with a four-petal flower and a stem without a leaf.There was an immediate protest this month when some Scottish branches of Sainsbury’s were found to be stocking the wrong variety. The Royal British Legion was founded in 1921, the year of the first official fundraising Poppy Day, choosing the flower that had already become a cherished emblem of the first world war, inspired by In Flanders Fields, a poem by John McCrae, a Canadian army surgeon. The following year Maj George Howson opened the first poppy factory in London, which soon employed hundreds of disabled ex-servicemen, but there was such a demand for them that few reached Scotland. In 1926 Lady Haig, wife of Earl Haig, a veteran of the Battle of the Somme and one of the founders of the Legion, opened the first Scottish factory in Edinburgh. The crumpled flower in the National Army Museum collection was given in memory of a brother who died in the war, but it had not survived well: it was so creased and grubby that the conservators thought it might not survive their efforts to restore it. Its petals were gently cleaned and steamed open, and broken silk threads delicately repaired, gradually revealing the central button reading Haig’s Fund. The poppy will be on display for the first time when the museum reopens next year after a £23m rebuild."
2016-11-10T17:13:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenagers sentenced to at least 20 years for Spalding murders,"A girl and boy aged 15 have been sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in detention for murdering a mother and daughter as they slept in their beds. The teenagers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stabbed and smothered Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her daughter Katie, 13, to death at their home in Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 13 April this year. They then shared a bath, had sex and watched the Twilight vampire movies. Both were 14 at the time of the killings. They are believed to be the UK’s youngest ever double-murderers. Sentencing both to life, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told a packed courtroom at Nottingham crown court that the killings were “a terrible crime with few parallels in modern criminal history”. The murders had been “brutal ... almost in the form of an execution”, the judge said. He told the pair: “Both of you are perfectly intelligent and knew exactly what you were doing – either of you could have backed out at any time but you were selfishly determined to do it together.” They had “revelled” in their actions, the judge added. Neither the boy nor the girl reacted as the sentence was delivered. As the judge spoke, a family member wept quietly in the public gallery. The boy, with light stubble and dressed in a dark blue sweatshirt and dark trousers, had slumped in his chair throughout the hearing, looking down. He glanced briefly at the girl as she was brought into the dock but they did not otherwise look at each other. She listened to the legal argument without emotion, wearing glasses, a striped blouse and black cardigan. A jury convicted the girl last month of the double murder, after she had initially pleaded not guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The boy admitted both murders on the first day of the trial. The judge said that people would “struggle to comprehend” how the pair could have committed the crimes. The answer he said lay in their “toxic” relationship, “a hermetically sealed, pathetic world of your own of deep, deep selfishness and immaturity”. He said: “This has been, on any view, an exceptional, and exceptionally distressing case.” The sentencing starting point for a murder committed by a child was 12 years’ detention, Haddon-Cave said, but their case was “substantially aggravated” by the fact that it was a double murder, that their victims were asleep and must have “suffered terribly” in the moments before their deaths. Had they been adults, he said, “you may have been facing the whole of your lives in prison”. He added: “I sentence you as children, which you are. I sentence you in hope for you and society, rather than expectation of failure.” The jury previously heard that the murder plot, which the pair had discussed over burgers at McDonald’s, began because the girl had a grudge against Edwards, a school dinner lady. After their arrest, she told police she had “felt like murdering for quite a while”. She had been “excited” about their plan and “looking forward” to the murders, she said. They had planned in great detail, plotting to cut the mother and daughter’s voice boxes to stop them screaming. The boy first attacked Edwards, pinning her down on the bed as he stabbed her throat. He told police the woman had struggled for three minutes before she went “limp”. When the girl, who had originally planned to murder the younger victim, said she could no longer go through with it, the boy then stabbed and smothered 13-year-old Katie. Summing up the case before he delivered his verdict, the judge said the teenagers had met at school and started a relationship 12 months earlier. They had quickly become obsessed with each other, he said, and the relationship became sexual. Both had troubled upbringings, which the judge said he had considered in mitigation. They had hatched a “half-hearted plan” to kill themselves by taking an overdose after the murders, he said, “but [the girl] decided she didn’t feel like it”. Instead, they opted to watch another Twilight film. The court earlier heard that when the boy was arrested and cautioned by police, he said: “Fuck life.” The jury in the girl’s trial previously heard evidence from a forensic scientist who had interviewed them who likened the couple to Bonnie and Clyde – “that sort of intense attraction, emotional closeness – them against the world”. Making arguments in mitigation ahead of the sentencing, Simon Myerson, QC, representing the boy, said “two children became trapped in a fantasy of their own devising”. Andrew Stubbs QC, representing the girl, said that after coming up with the murder plan, the couple had been “almost playing chicken with each other ... They were unable to stop themselves”. He suggested that “as she matures ... there will be an increasing appreciation of what she and [the boy] have done and the horror that they had caused”. Karen Thompson, deputy chief crown prosecutor at CPS East Midlands, called the murders “one of the most distressing and disturbing cases that I have ever encountered”. Speaking outside the court after the sentencing, she said: “Our deepest sympathies are now with the extended family and friends of Elizabeth and Katie Edwards as they attempt to come to terms with this horrific crime.” DCI Martin Holvey, of the East Midlands major crime unit, said: “This has been a rare and unprecedented case and everybody who has listened to the details as they have emerged throughout the trial will, I am sure, have felt the same sense of shock and disbelief. “The planning that went into the brutal murders of Elizabeth and Katie as they slept in their beds was cold, ruthless and chilling, as was the lack of remorse shown by the two juveniles afterwards.”"
2016-11-10T18:13:13Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rape by police officer tipped teenager 'totally over the edge', court told","A 50-year-old woman has told a court she was a “vulnerable” 14-year-old who was “tipped totally over the edge” when she was raped by a serving police officer 36 years ago. At the time of the alleged rape by Raymond Jeacock, then a serving police officer, the girl was regularly skipping school, sniffing glue and staying out on nights when her mother was working because her stepfather “was not a very nice person”, the court heard. Jeremy James, defending, questioned evidence given by the woman to police in which she said she had gone from a “grade-A student to a lunatic” after the alleged rape. “I was a grade-A student but I didn’t have a particularly good home life. I was going through a difficult time but not to the [same] extent as after the incident,” she said, giving evidence behind a screen. After the alleged rape she was given 14 criminal convictions for 30 separate offences over a 17-year period, including shoplifting, theft, handling stolen goods, assault, perverting the course of justice and obtaining property by deception. Asked about the convictions she said: “Most of it was a blur, I was a drug addict.” But James suggested she was already “off the rails” by the time the alleged rape took place on 13 December 1980. The woman said: “I was an A-grade student. I was vulnerable, I didn’t have a good home life and if I did, maybe this wouldn’t have happened. I’m afraid these things happen to vulnerable people.“I was skipping school [but] I wasn’t taking heroin, I wasn’t taking crack cocaine, I wasn’t committing crimes. The tipping point that tipped me totally over the edge was this incident. I’m not saying everything was hunky dory before.” The woman alleges that she was raped by Jeacock, now 62, when she was 14. The court heard previously that on the day of the alleged rape she used the identity of another girl to visit her older boyfriend at a young offender institution, which James called “a deliberate decision to lie or dupe the authorities”. She was arrested and taken to Sutton police station. When Jeacock, then a detective constable, realised the wrong girl had been arrested he called her father. When the girl’s father arrived, Jeacock told him he would take her home himself – telling the girl her father had been drinking. The woman told police she had gone to bed, when she heard someone coming up the stairs. She saw Jeacock, who said to her: “You need fucking.” She told police she froze, and he took part of her trousers and knickers off and raped her. Cross-examining the woman, James said that while taking her home Jeacock had told her he was interested in her then boyfriend. Jeacock had searched a shed for evidence and asked where her room was to continue the search. “He is lying. That is not the truth,” said the woman. She added: “Some of the account may be a little blurry but the main account is imprinted on my mind and it’s something I have lived with for all this time […] You can suggest whatever you like but I know the truth and he knows the truth.” Speaking via videolink, her father later told the court that he had come to his ex-wife’s home where his daughter lived and had found Jeacock in her room. Asked by Andrew Vout, prosecuting, if he recalled what his daughter looked like, he said: “I knew she was upset straight away she was frightened and I daren’t say anything to her.” He said Jeacock was on the floor of the room, behind the bed. “I said: ‘What the hell are you doing?’,” he told the court. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he had confronted Jeacock and would initially not let him leave the house. Eventually he let him go, saying: “If we’d have kept him any longer we would have been done for kidnap.” He told the court he then reported the incident at Mansfield police station, because he was worried about reporting it at Sutton. Jeacock faced a police disciplinary hearing and was forced to resign but no criminal charges were brought against him. James asked the woman if, when arrested for a later crime, she told the officer she had got one police officer sacked and could do the same to him. She denied the allegation. But she added: “I was glad he did [lose his job], but it wasn’t enough.” Jeacock denies rape. He is expected to take the stand on Friday. The case continues."
2016-11-10T19:27:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Croydon tram crash: police examine reports of incident in previous week,"Police investigating the tram derailment that killed seven people and injured 51 near Croydon, south London, are examining passengers’ reports that a tram almost came off the tracks in the same place the previous week. The development came as a 19-year-old man was named as one of the victims of Wednesday’s crash. Dane Chinnery had been travelling to work on the Tramlink service from New Addington to Wimbledon when it overturned at a sharp bend in the track near Sandilands shortly after 6am. Investigators said the tram that crashed appeared to have been travelling too fast round the bend, where the speed limit was 12 miles an hour. Passengers said the driver, who was arrested and bailed after the crash, appeared to have blacked out.
A spokeswoman for British Transport Police (BTP) told the Guardian that officers were investigating reports that surfaced on Facebook after the crash, describing how an early-morning tram had taken the bend too fast on 31 October and braked hard. Andy Nias, from Croydon, wrote on that date: “30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up … tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! I swear the tram lifted on to one side. Everyone still shaking … it’s mad.” Another person, James Tofield, shared a message he had sent to his wife at the same time, describing how the tram driver had braked and narrowly managed to stay on the track, adding: “It was like a ride from Alton Towers.” A police spokeswoman said: “We were only made aware of the report on social media yesterday and it’s now forming part of our inquiries.” She declined to discuss this or other lines of inquiry further because it was an active investigation.
Transport sources said the company that operates the Tramlink, FirstGroup, was believed to have opened disciplinary proceedings against another driver who passed a stop signal before Sandilands on 25 October. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has examined two other derailments on Tramlink in the last five years, both of which occurred at low speed and did not cause casualties. Wednesday’s crash, in which six men and a woman died, was the worst tram- or train-related disaster in the UK since 2004. The driver, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the incident. On Thursday morning the BTP said he had been released on bail until May. Fifty-one people were taken to hospital and seven others made their own way to seek treatment. Three seriously ill people underwent surgery on Wednesday at St George’s hospital, Tooting, and were now in recovery.
Chinnery, the first victim to be named, worked at the drainage company Hydro Cleansing. At his family home in New Addington on Thursday, a man said it was too soon to speak to the media. Friends on social media called for a minute’s applause in his honour at Crystal Palace’s next home fixture. Martin Giles, the headteacher of Chinnery’s former school, Meridian high school, said staff and students were heartbroken. At least three other former pupils were injured in the incident, he added. “All of the staff in the school share their pain at this difficult time,” Giles said. A survivor of the crash paid tribute to the rescue operation, which involved 22 ambulance crews, eight fire engines and five fire rescue units. Rhys McCausland, a 19-year-old chef who had been on his way to work at Westminster, received a deep gash to the head and a cut to the arm in the derailment. He recalled how emergency workers had guided him through the rain to an empty tram nearby, which had been commandeered as a makeshift medical bay. He said he had watched as the most seriously injured were airlifted and taken in ambulances to hospital, and buses were used for others. He remembered little about the crash itself. “To be honest I was completely oblivious,” he said. “It was just an everyday morning … We went through the tunnel, I didn’t think much of it, and then we hit the corner.”Trams on the route travel in a straight line down a dedicated track – an old railway line – at 50mph for more than half a mile before coming out of a tunnel and making a 90-degree turn just before the Sandilands stop. They normally brake sharply just before the end of the tunnel to comply with the 12mph speed limit. At 6.10am on Wednesday, emerging into darkness, that point could have been less obvious to a driver. The RAIB said the tram appeared to have been significantly over the speed limit.
The Bombardier-built tram is believed to have been equipped with a “deadman’s handle”, a safety device that would trigger an alarm should a driver take his hand off the controls, and would apply the brakes after three seconds. But there is no equivalent of the track safety and control systems that would automatically stop any train that was speeding. Many speed restrictions on the network were lifted by Transport for London when it replaced tracks after bringing the route under its control in 2008, 10 years after it first opened. FirstGroup’s chief executive, Tim O’Toole, said: “At this stage we do not know the details of what caused the incident. It is absolutely essential that we find out exactly what happened yesterday and this could take some time. We are working closely with Transport for London and the accident investigators and will continue to provide every assistance ‎to the ongoing investigation.” Work was continuing at the crash site on Thursday night. Dozens of police officers were present, while heavy-duty cranes made their way out of the area. At the road junction closest to Sandilands station, several dozen floral tributes had been left. A wide cordon remained in place to prevent the public from milling around the construction equipment brought in to clear the wreckage. • This article was amended on 11 November 2016 to correct the name of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch."
2016-11-10T20:22:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Doing the chores valued at Â£1tn a year in the UK,"The total value of all the unpaid work done by the UK population, mostly by women – from cooking meals and cleaning the house to childcare, DIY and gardening – has been officially valued at £1tn a year by the country’s top statisticians. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which published the figures, found that women put in more than double the proportion of unpaid work when it comes to cooking, childcare and housework but men can claim bragging rights when it comes to ferrying family members and others around.
To coincide with the new data, the ONS has launched an “unpaid work calculator” that will allow people to work out the value of all the unpaid work they do, which may help to settle once and for all some of those arguments about who does the lion’s share of the chores, and who is getting off lightly. The calculator uses 2016 data on earnings to estimate how much an individual could earn for doing these tasks – if they could only find someone to pay them.
The department said its figures showed that unpaid work had a total value of £1.01tn in 2014, which was equivalent to approximately 56% of the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP). The ONS said women carry out an overall average of 60% more unpaid work than men. On average, men do 16 hours a week of cooking, childcare, adult care, and housework, which includes laundry and cleaning. But for women the figure is 26 hours. “The only area where men put in more unpaid work hours than women is in the provision of transport - this includes driving themselves and others around, as well as commuting to work,” said a spokesman. Women do more unpaid work than men in every age group, from the 25-and-under age category to the 56-and-over category. The average man would earn £166.63 more per week if his unpaid work was remunerated, whereas the average woman would earn £259.63. “So not only do women do an average of 60% more unpaid work in terms of hours, they also tend to do the work that has a higher value,” said the ONS.
According to the calculator, one hour of housework (which also includes DIY and gardening) a week is “worth” £8.58 per week or £446 a year. One hour of childcare a week is valued at £15.28 a week or £795 a year. For cooking meals, it’s £7.63 or £397, while for transport – such as driving children to their clubs and commuting to work – it’s £11.24 or £584. Overall, 36- to 45-year-olds carried out the most unpaid work, putting in 27.4 mean hours per week of unpaid work, followed by 26- to 35-year-olds. The figures also revealed that people on lower incomes tended to carry out on average more unpaid work than other income brackets, with some exceptions, such as transport."
2016-11-10T20:37:59Z,uk-news,UK news,London boroughs prepare for impacts of lowered benefit cap,"London has a special relationship with the government’s benefit cap. When introduced in 2013 it had by far its widest impact in the capital, thanks to our famously high housing costs and resulting high levels of housing benefit. On Monday, the cap was lowered. The reduction was less in London than everywhere else, but even so it is estimated that this will easily double the number of households here affected by it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates that the 8,400 being pinched by the cap before the change will increase to 19,000 losing some money as a result. London Councils, the body representing the capital’s 33 local authorities, thinks the figure likely to be well on its way to 25,000. In London, the cap has been reset from £26,000 a year to £23,000. That is the total amount in benefits that can now be paid to a couple or to a single person whose children live with them. For single adults without children the maximum is £15,410. Let’s apply some context. The last census put the number of households in London at 3.27 million and it will have increased since then, so the cap affects only a very small percentage of the city’s population. That said, £23,000 a year does not buy a life of luxury. The median London household income is more than than £39,000. The mean is around £52,000 (much higher than the median because of very high earners). A recently calculated minimum income standard for a London couple with two young children is around £25,000. Families that must get by on £23,000 don’t find it easy to make ends meet. London Councils believes that single parent households will comprise the majority of those made worse off and that three-quarters of all affected households will contain children. In a briefing to members, they also point out that the government’s own impact assessment anticipates that women will be disproportionately hurt. A majority of capped households are described as “likely to lose less than £50 a week (£216 a month),” while “a sizeable minority (around 44%) will lose more than this”. What does the cap achieve? It reduced benefit spending nationally in 2015-16 by a very puny £65m. But the government maintains that imposing it has created an incentive for claimants to find jobs. Being employed for more than 16 hours a week or, if a couple, for 24 hours a week combined, exempts claimants with children from the cap and means they qualify for working tax credits. The IFS says there is “fairly robust evidence” from government figures that about 5% of people nationally affected by the original cap moved into work and an even smaller fraction responded to it by moving house. In the capital, however, as of May, nearly 35% of all London households capped since the policy was introduced have taken jobs, according to London Councils - the highest of any UK region - with many boroughs running schemes to help people find them. Another part of the answer to the cap will be boroughs dispensing discretionary housing payments to help local tenants struggling to pay their rent in the short to medium term if the social consequences look particularly severe - a house move that would result in a vulnerable child having to change to an unfamiliar school, for example. London Councils say that boroughs have increasingly relied on these payments (in 2015-16, 41% of them were made in Greater London) which are made available by central government, but that they have a diminishing capacity for allocating it from pots that aren’t getting any fuller. They’ve also been helping capped claimants manage their money better. But London Councils believes the lowered cap is bound to place greater pressure on the housing and benefit services of local authorities and, in its own words, “likely to result in greater demand for temporary accommodation for homeless households”. There are already over 50,000 households in temporary dwellings in the capital, including 4,600 who’ve been capped (see page 26 here). Evidence is being gathered and discussions are underway with the government about the next discretionary housing payment budget and the devolution of the work and health programme - the coming successor to the work programme - to London so that better results can be achieved. The prime minister may have changed, but the wheels of austerity grind on."
2016-11-11T06:00:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Prevent strategy to be ramped up despite 'big brother' concerns,"The government’s controversial Prevent counter-radicalisation strategy is to be toughened rather than scaled back despite criticism that it is a toxic brand and a “big brother” security operation among Britain’s Muslim communities. The Home Office confirmed that a secret Whitehall internal review of Prevent, ordered earlier this year by Theresa May when she was home secretary, has concluded that the programme “should be strengthened, not undermined” and has put forward 12 suggestions on how to reinforce it. The overhaul of the programme is to be detailed as part of the government’s wider reworking of its counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest, that is to be published before the end of the year. Ministers believe that Prevent is working and is safeguarding people from being drawn into terrorism.
Criticism of the four-year-old Prevent strategy, under which more than 8,000 people have been referred for possible inclusion in the anti-radicalisation programme, has intensified in recent months. The programme has expanded rapidly over the last 18 months as more than 850 people have left Britain to go to Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq. Its critics include David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, and the Commons home affairs select committee, which called for the “toxic brand” of Prevent to be abandoned in favour of a more inclusive “Engage” title, and for much clearer guidelines and training on how it is implemented in schools and universities. Anderson has said: “There is a strong feeling in Muslim communities that I visit that Prevent is if not a spying programme then at least a programme that is targeted on them.” Others, including Diane Abbott – the shadow home secretary – and teaching and student unions, have called for its reform or even abandonment. The Muslim Council of Britain has announced that it will set up its own programme next year aiming to tackle the issue of support for Isis within Muslim communities.
“The whole scheme is simply unworkable,” Abbott said this week. “Even with widespread cooperation the number of children under 10 who have been referred to the police under the Prevent strategy is over 400 in the last four years. Families are terrified their kids will be taken from them, guilty only of playing school playground games, play acting or childish bragging. Yet according to the police, 80% of all referrals are not acted on.” A recent George Soros-funded Open Society Justice Initiative report cited instances in which information was apparently gathered from Muslim primary school pupils without their parents’ consent, and the case of a 17-year-old who was referred to police by his college because he had become more religious. The Home Office minister Susan Williams recently acknowledged there had been cases in which children were dealt with inappropriately in schools and that there was a need for “much-enhanced” training. Since 2011, some 600,000 frontline public sector staff have received some form of training in how to identify those vulnerable to radicalisation. The Home Office says the fact that the police do not act on 80% of referrals shows it is working as a safeguarding programme and successfully screens out those who are being wrongly identified. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We regularly assess our Prevent work to ensure it deals with the threat of radicalisation as effectively and sensitively as possible. “A review of Prevent has been carried out and will be reflected in the updated Contest counter-terrorism strategy, which we will publish in due course.” The Department for Education has produced guidance to schools on their statutory duty under the programme and the Educate Against Hate website contains resources for schools and parents on preventing young people from being radicalised and educating young people to reject extremist ideologies. Survey results reveal that 83%of head teachers say they are confident about implementing the Prevent duty. An individual intervention package is developed for each person accepted on to the Channel part of the programme which can include mainstream health, education, employment or housing services through to specialist mentoring or appropriate faith guidance and wider diversionary activities such as sports."
2016-11-11T11:28:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Oldham pensioner wins fight against deportation to Pakistan,"The family of a pensioner with dementia who have fought for almost a year against plans to deport him have won their case. A petition to save Hakeem Muhammad Haleem, 77, from being sent thousands of miles away to Pakistan gained more than 22,900 signatures after his story was shared around the world. The Home Office has ruled he can now stay in Oldham with his family on human rights grounds. His son, Muhammad Nadeem, 46, said: “We are so relieved, and we don’t think we could have done it without the help of our supporters. It has been such a long fight for us but finally we have good news. “Now he can stay until 2019 and we believe this has saved his life. Our only wish was always to be able to care for my father and keep the family together. My wife and I would like to thank the thousands of people who have signed the petition to halt the proposed deportation.” The family of Haleem, who is partially blind and deaf and also suffers from a heart condition as well as vascular dementia and needs 24-hour care, feared he would not survive the journey to Pakistan. In April, the Home Office told Haleem his father would not be granted a visa and must return to his homeland. Officials issued a deportation order and instructed he report to a detention centre. A letter from the Home Office says that, although Haleem cannot stay under immigration rules, he has been granted “leave outside the rules”, which means he will be able to remain in the country until May 2019 on compassionate grounds. Haleem, from Peshawar, first came to the UK with his wife Irshada. She returned to Pakistan as part of ongoing treatment for diabetes and died there in 2011. Since then Haleem has lived with his son, daughter-in-law Mehwish, 25, and his four-year-old granddaughter, Manahal. Before 2012, settled UK residents could be joined by parents or grandparents over 65 if financial and living support could be provided. But a strict new law means that only stands if long-term care in their home country is either more expensive – or non-existent. A Home Office spokesman said all applications were considered on their individual merits, including exceptional circumstances and in accordance with the immigration rules. He added: “We do not routinely comment on individual cases.”"
2016-11-11T11:36:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested after new forensic information links deaths of two women,"A man has been arrested and police have opened a double murder investigation into the deaths of two women who it was previously thought had died in their sleep five years apart. New forensic information into the deaths in Worthing, West Sussex of Susan Nicholson in 2011 and Caroline Delvin in 2006 prompted police to arrest Nicholson’s partner Robert Trigg, 52, on suspicion of murder. He has since been released on bail until next February, as the investigation continues. A 2011 inquest found that Nicholson, who weighed 50kg (8st), was accidentally smothered to death by 82kg Trigg as the couple slept on a sofa. Trigg told the inquest at the time: “It was a freak accident and I lost my partner.” Coroner Micheal Kendall recorded a verdict of accidental death. Reports of the verdict quoted him saying: “There is no doubt the death was caused by Mr Trigg overlaying on her face. There is no evidence whatsoever that this was part of an altercation, violence or an incident of aggression of any kind.” There was no inquest into Delvin’s death after the 35-year-old mother of four was found dead in her bed on Mothering Sunday in 2006. A postmortem at the time said she died of natural causes. Police said they have since discovered new information to link the deaths. In a statement, Sussex police said: “This current investigation followed new forensic information we received about the 2011 death, which may have some features in common with the 2006 death.” A spokesman refused to elaborate on the apparent breakthrough. The statement added that a 52-year-old man was arrested on Monday on suspicion of murdering Nicholson and Colvin. It added: “After being interviewed the man was released on police bail on the same day until 20 February 2017 while enquiries continue.” The families of both women are being kept informed about the investigation, it added. A postmortem into Nicholson’s death found pinpoint haemorrhages on her neck, face and an eye that were consistent with external pressure being applied. At the time Sussex police considered charging Trigg with accidental manslaughter but found no case to answer. He told the inquest: “When I looked down she was in the same position but she had changed colour. I just thought the worst, I had suffocated her. “Her hand was still warm and I held it and said ‘Time to wake up, stop mucking about’ but there was no response.”"
2016-11-11T11:57:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Missing boy read Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London before disappearing,"A schoolboy who has been missing for more than two months vanished after reading George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London, the classic 1930s memoir of travelling and living in poverty. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, disappeared from his home in rural Devon, leaving his parents a letter explaining that he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within a year. The teenager left home without his phone or bank cards and had just £350 earned from a job working in a restaurant kitchen – which is what Orwell did in Paris. There has been no trace of him since and his parents, Caroline and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, are becoming increasingly worried. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Caroline Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the country and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” she said. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. For the last two summers, his brother Reuben has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister Hester went inter-railing. I think he was inspired by all that. “We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure. Hester was leaving for university and he was going to be the last one at home with us. I think he wasn’t looking forward to being left alone with us. Perhaps he wanted to test himself, prove his abilities.” She said Arthur was an avid reader. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been an influence. He was reading it on a Kindle, which he left behind. “The police have asked us if it is possible he jumped on the back of a lorry. We can’t rule that out. He would have been following what was going on with refugees in Europe.”
The 15-year-old has not been seen since he left for Colyton grammar school on his bicycle at 7.30am on Tuesday 6 September. His last words to his mother were: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my fluorescent [jacket].” He used to leave his bike at a local post office and get the bus from there to school. When he did not return home, his mother went to the post office but could find no sign of him. The next day a letter arrived in the post. It said: “To mum and dad I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please do not try to find me or make me come home. I don’t know how long I will be away for but it won’t be longer than a year. You will find my school uniform in a bin bag in a small barn in the field on the green down the road near Membury church. “My bike is chained to the fence ... Please apologise to the restaurant and tell them that I will no longer be able to work there. I know you will be upset but please understand that I have to do this, from Arthur.” The letter had been posted in Devon. She added: “We have no idea what’s happened to him. He left with very little. His letter shows his departure was well-planned but he took very little with him. That gives us very little indication of what he had in mind or how he hoped to survive. We don’t know if he had a clear objective in mind or was just going to go whichever way the wind took him.” Arthur is very bright. He had just received outstanding GCSE grades and started his A-levels the previous day at Colyton grammar in Devon, one of Britain’s most highly-rated state schools. “At 15 you lack emotional maturity. He had read a lot and he had watched things on television and picked up on things online he had little direct experience. He wasn’t streetwise. You worry about how well he would be able to read situations. “We’re baffled by the whole thing and constantly speculating on what he may be doing. We can’t believe he has done this so we have to keep an open mind on what he might be doing now. “There was no row before he left, no indication. You rake over all the conversations before he left. There was absolutely no indication. That’s the same for his school friends. None of them had any inkling.” Devon and Cornwall police have found it difficult to find the teenager because he took no electronic equipment with him and has no bank account. No CCTV footage of him has been found. His parents have travelled to towns on the south coast and cities including London, Liverpool and Manchester to try to find him, putting up posters and speaking to hospitals and homeless charities. Appealing directly to the boy, his mother said: “Arthur, please whatever you do just make contact. Phone us, call us text us. Anything at all. We just need to know you are safe. We are desperate to know you are safe.” Police are asking anyone who may have employed Arthur, accommodated him, or who may have provided him with transport to get in touch. Supt Sam de Reya said: “We are appealing to business owners, likely to be restaurateurs, hoteliers and cafe owners who may have had a young man work for them in the last few months or anyone who may have provided accommodation to him in that time period.” He is described as white, 5ft 4in tall, of slight build with short, light brown hair. He may now have considerably shorter hair, possibly shaven. • If anyone has information, please contact police by calling 101 or emailing 101@dc.police.uk quoting log 255 of 14 September."
2016-11-11T14:09:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Ellie Butler social worker questioned over alleged child offences,"A private social worker who oversaw the return of six-year-old Ellie Butler to her violent father, 11 months before he murdered her, is under investigation by police for alleged offences relating to children. Steve Atherton, 57, from Reading, of the private social work consultancy Services For Children (S4C), was under investigation over an incident unrelated to the Butler case, the Metropolitan police said. The investigation relates to alleged inappropriate filming of children at a swimming pool in Northwood, Greater London, in July. Atherton was interviewed by police under caution earlier this week and was not arrested. Police inquiries into the alleged incident were continuing [see footnote]. A Met spokesman said: “Police in Hillingdon have received an allegation of alleged inappropriate filming of children at a swimming pool in Pines Close, Northwood, by an individual in July. “One man aged in his fifties was interviewed under caution in relation to this matter on 7 November. No arrests have been made. Inquiries continue.” Atherton qualified as a social worker in 1988. Before joining S4C, he worked in a variety of roles, including as a team manager in fostering and adoption for Reading borough council. The Guardian contacted Atherton about the police investigation but he declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Health and Care Professions Council confirmed Atherton was still registered with the organisation as a social worker. A spokeswoman for S4C stated: “This allegation is completely untrue.” Ben Butler was found guilty earlier this year of murdering Ellie in October 2013, 11 months after she was returned to his care following a custody battle. Ellie suffered catastrophic head injuries while being looked after by her father at their home in south London. Butler was also found guilty of child cruelty over a previous shoulder injury and was sentenced to life in prison. Ellie’s mother, Jennie Gray, was sentenced to 42 months for child cruelty and perverting the course of justice. Selena Lynch, the senior coroner for south London, is considering whether to reopen the inquest into Ellie’s death. Lynch said it was unlikely any new facts about the circumstances of the child’s death would be revealed, but an inquest could look at “wider issues”. “The management of her [Ellie’s] care by other agencies, such as social and medical services … in my view do fall to be investigated,” Lynch said at a hearing in July. She is due to hold another hearing on whether or not to reopen the inquest on 29 November. S4C was appointed to Ellie’s case by Mrs Justice Hogg during a family court hearing in which Butler and Gray were trying to have their daughter returned to them. Ellie had been removed from them in 2007 after Butler was convicted of grievous bodily harm and child cruelty; Ellie was found to have brain and retinal injuries associated with shaken baby syndrome when she was seven weeks old. Butler’s conviction was quashed in 2010 by the court of appeal because of new scientific evidence on the syndrome. S4C was instructed by the family court to carry out an independent assessment and oversee Ellie’s return to her parents, on the recommendation of one of the barristers in the case, Piers Pressdee QC. In a testimonial on the S4C website, Pressdee says: “Steve Atherton and [colleague] Cath Harris are first-rate social workers who provide a first-rate service. I have recommended them in the past and would have no hesitation about recommending them in the future.” • This footnote was added on 6 February 2017. In December 2016 a Metropolitan police spokesperson said that no evidence of any indecent images had been found the matter was concluded with no further action taken."
2016-11-11T14:44:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harry: the 'grown up' royal taking the fight to the tabloids,"On Thursday morning outside Westminster Abbey, Prince Harry was in his element surrounded by hundreds of military personnel and veterans, all chatting among 60,000 tiny wooden crosses planted for a remembrance event. After a week which began with him raging in public against the tabloid press and social media trolls for smears, racism and sexism in coverage on his blooming relationship with American actor Meghan Markle, he couldn’t have looked happier. Harry spent a decade in the army, including two tours of Afghanistan, and earlier this year described his service, which ended in 2015 as “the best escape I ever had” from the media spotlight. For the two hours he spent in the garden of remembrance, he seemed free again.
There were none of the death stares Harry occasionally shoots at royal reporters, and which some had expected after a week in which his spokesman railed against “the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls,” in coverage of his new relationship with Markle, the daughter of a white father and African-American mother. His mood was no doubt also boosted by Markle’s arrival in London. She was pictured shopping at Whole Foods in Kensington High Street on Thursday and returning to Kensington Palace where Harry lives. But as he talked animatedly and at length with soldiers, eye contact locked, body language relaxed and attention undivided, it was obvious the military is the 32-year-old’s happy place. “I felt as though I was really achieving something,” he said recently of his army career. “I felt as though I was part of a team. All I wanted to do was prove to people I had a certain set of skills – flying an Apache helicopter, for instance, rather than just being Prince Harry.” But in his low-ceilinged cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, he had spent the previous eight days getting increasingly angry at how “just being Prince Harry” seemed to be hurting people he cared for in his private life. His office was not confirming the relationship with Markle and so the royal news industry went into overdrive to fill in the gaps and to judge the suitability of the possible new princess. Photographers and reporters stationed on the doorstep of Markle’s mother in Los Angeles and a photographer barging into his girlfriend’s garage in Toronto enraged him, as did a welter of press coverage. This included a report on the front page of the Sun that she appeared on the adult website Pornhub, which she did, but not of her own volition and only in clips from her network TV drama Suits.
The Mail on Sunday columnist Rachel Johnson riffed on the prospect that Markel could be “the one” and wrote that if the couple had children, “the Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA”, something Johnson has denied was racist, but which upset Harry. By Monday night his aides and Markle’s lawyers were again trying to keep allegedly defamatory stories out of the papers. Harry decided it was time to act. The next morning at 10.11am his spokesman, Jason Knauf, issued the 406-word statement that declared for the first time that Markle was his girlfriend and he was “deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her” and that “this past week has seen a line crossed”. Some journalists deemed it an overreaction and grumpily questioned why the palace had not confirmed the relationship or provided a photo-opportunity of the couple together. But Harry’s friends were not surprised it had come to this and his allies pointed out that the statement was deliberately posted on the Royal Facebook page as part of a strategy of trying to speak over the heads of the conventional media directly to people using social media. “There is still a residual depth of feeling about the media that will never go away,” one told the Guardian. “A lot of the fiction around what [Harry and William] have done and who they know has really pissed them off. So as well as the legacy of their mother, as well as the intrusion, which ended up in phone hacking, was this fictionalisation which has been part of this past week. The rap sheet goes back quite a long way.” In early adulthood the British press covered Harry’s multiple indiscretions and disgraces. These included him lashing out at a photographer outside London’s Pangaea nightclub in the early hours, dressing up aged 20 as a Nazi at a friend’s “colonial and native” fancy dress party and calling a fellow officer cadet at Sandhurst “our little Paki friend”. They were serious trangressions for which he later apologised. But he was the victim of phone hacking and the impact of the death of his mother, Princess Diana, when he was just 12, chased by press photographers into a Paris road tunnel, should not be underestimated. The Royal historian Robert Lacey told the Guardian this week that Harry’s antipathy to the media stems from “the absolute belief that the press caused his mother’s death”. Prince Henry Charles Albert Davis of Wales was born on 15 September 1984. By the time he was eight his father, Prince Charles, and mother were separated. A year after their 1996 divorce, Diana shockingly died with her lover Dodi Fayed. Harry was two weeks short of his 13th birthday and many were deeply moved by the sight of him walking behind her funeral cortege with his handwritten note addressed to “Mummy” in a flower arrangement on top of the coffin. The following year he went to Eton, enjoying playing rugby – the sport he still loves most – but not flourishing academically, earning only a B in art and D in geography at A-level. He didn’t go to university, spending time in his gap year carousing with friends such as the nightclub owner Guy Pelly at his father’s house, Highgrove, and in the local pub, before heading to Sandhurst for officer training. “He has always been more emotionally open [than William],” said one friend. “It is the typical younger and older sibling dynamic, particularly when one is going to be king and the other is not. He is not academically smart, but is very emotionally intuitive. He is very good fun, gregarious and loyal.” Harry is “a big consumer of news” according to a palace source. In 2005 he admitted he would find himself “shouting and screaming at all sorts of different stuff” in the newspapers about his then girlfriend Chelsy Davy. “I get to see how upset she gets,” he said, in a foreshadowing of this week’s events. Another long-term relationship with the dancer Cressida Bonas reportedly ended when, according to royal observers, she decided she could not live in the spotlight. When Harry was pictured naked playing strip billiards in Las Vegas in 2012 some observers wondered if he was destined to follow Prince Andrew’s “randy Andy” playboy approach to the “spare to the heir” role. But now it seems Harry is forging a successful and popular adult identity around the military, not as a figurehead, as is common for royals, but as part of the team. His launch in 2014 of the Invictus Games for wounded and sick soldiers has given him that purpose, observers say. He attends board meetings, gets closely involved in planning and even personally made the calls to book bands such as the Foo Fighters to provide entertainment at the 2014 event in London. “The Invictus Games has been the making of him and his image,” said Lacey. “He has made a more striking identification to which the public can relate than William. It is a much stronger, more heartwarming cause than fighting the ivory trade [which William has taken up]. The bravery and the emotionality of it fit very well with Harry’s perceived character.” He is doing more work for “The Firm” too, as official duties on behalf of the Queen are known in palace circles. Next Sunday he will embark on a seven-country tour of the Caribbean. With cricket games, a Rihanna concert in Barbados and a trip to Guyana’s Kaieteur Falls, it may sound to some like a two-week holiday. But it is also a full official visit and is significant for forging Commonwealth bonds. Allies say “he has grown up”. “The line he used after Las Vegas about being ‘too much soldier and not enough prince’ shows you the wisdom that he has acquired,” said a friend. “He was young, angry and unfocused but he has matured a hell of a lot.” Potted profile Born 15 September 1984 Age 32 Career Fifth in line to the throne.

2016-11-11T15:38:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Police in Oxford schoolgirl rape case say she was not abducted,"Police investigating an incident in which a 14-year-old schoolgirl said she was abducted and raped have now said she was not snatched off the street. The girl told investigators that two men made her get into a car as she was walking along the road in Summertown, Oxford, on 28 September. She said she was raped in the car. On Friday, Thames Valley police said: “The evidence gathered indicates that the reported abduction did not take place.” Officers were still investigating the rape claim and were “following all lines of inquiry to establish what has taken place”, the spokesman said. “Specially trained officers and staff from the police, Oxfordshire county council children’s services, health and other agencies continue to work with the victim, at her pace.” The girl was found at midday knocking on doors in the Marston area of the city. At the time, police said the girl was extremely traumatised by her ordeal and was unable to provide a description of her attackers, other than they were white men whom she did not know. On Friday, officers said they had carried out a “thorough review”, including sifting through CCTV and dashcam footage, and gathering witness statements, and had concluded that there was no abduction. Supt Joe Kidman, the local police commander for Oxford city, said the incident had caused “a great deal of community concern” but that such reports were rare. “In the weeks after the incident higher-visibility patrols were in place to provide reassurance and gather information,” he said. “We have worked with schools in the area on their security plans and are ready to respond to concerns raised. “Working with vulnerable and young victims is an extremely complex and lengthy process, and it is paramount that they are protected appropriately.”"
2016-11-11T17:09:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Police to consider Halliwell link to 20-year-old murder,"Cold case detectives investigating the murder of a woman 20 years ago are to look at whether the suspected serial killer Christopher Halliwell could be responsible, the Guardian has learned. The partially clothed body of Vera Holland, 47, was found on a tip in Berkshire in November 1996. She had been strangled, dumped among rubbish and her body set on fire. Thames Valley police and Holland’s children made an appeal on Friday for more information about the murder. Officers said they had no prime suspect but confirmed they would speak to colleagues in neighbouring Wiltshire, where Halliwell struck at least twice.
The taxi driver is serving a full life term for the sexually motivated murders of Sian O’Callaghan and Becky Godden. Wiltshire police have made it clear they believe there are other victims. Holland disappeared after leaving home in Reading on Thursday 14 November 1996 to buy a takeaway from a nearby KFC. The mother of three failed to return home and was reported missing by her husband, Brian. At 5.30am on 16 November the fire service received a call from a member of the public who reported a fire at an illegal fly-tip known as Two Bridges, south of Reading. A pile of rubbish was on fire and after extinguishing it, firefighters discovered the partially clothed body of a woman lying face down. She was identified as Holland and a postmortem examination found she had been strangled. Speaking at a press conference, Holland’s son, Andrew Bennett, read out a statement on behalf of the family. “Twenty years ago someone murdered our mum,” he said. “In doing so they robbed us of the love and care she brought to our family. Our children, her grandchildren, never got to know her properly and Mum never had the opportunity to see her grandchildren grow. “Having your mum murdered is a really awful thing to happen to anyone. What made Mum’s death even more difficult for us was the callous way her body was dumped among rubbish and then set on fire. It robbed her of any dignity. “What adds to our anguish is not knowing who was responsible for this horrific crime and that they have been able to carry on with their life for the last 20 years. We have 20 years of not knowing who did this. There must be some people that have information that could help the police. “We appeal to you to think of how you would feel if it was your mum that had been killed in such a way and ask that you contact the police with any information, no matter how small, as it may help.” The head of Thames Valley police’s major crime review team, Peter Beirne, said he believed Holland may have been abducted before she reached KFC. She is thought to have been wearing a pink coat, green tartan skirt, black jumper and black shoes, none of which have been found. Beirne said: “The public did assist and come forward with information in 1996. However I do feel there are people who have some information who, for whatever reason, have not spoken to police. It might be that allegiances have changed in 20 years or you know something now that you didn’t at the time.” The officer said there was no confirmed motive. Asked about Halliwell, he said he would be talking to Wiltshire police. “I will keep Halliwell in mind,” he said. Halliwell murdered O’Callaghan, 22, in 2012 and Godden, 20, in 2003. He left O’Callaghan’s body at the side of a road in Oxfordshire and buried Godden’s remains in a field in Gloucestershire. Officers do not believe Godden was his first victim or that he did not kill between 2003 and 2012. As well as working as a taxi driver, Halliwell travelled widely as a chauffeur and a groundworker. He was also a keen fisherman who knew the rivers and lakes of Thames Valley well – the site of the tip where Holland’s body was found was close to a popular fishing spot on the river Loddon. Former Det Supt Steve Fulcher, who caught Halliwell, has suggested that he may have killed a Swindon woman called Sallyann John in September 1995. Another notorious murder that Halliwell’s name has been linked to is that of Melanie Hall, who vanished from a nightclub in Bath in 1996. • Anyone with information about Vera Holland’s murder is asked to contact the police on 101 and quote reference 497 (9/11/16) or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2016-11-11T18:23:52Z,uk-news,UK news,More Croydon tram crash victims named as investigation continues,"A young father who was due to marry his girlfriend is feared to be among the seven people killed in Wednesday’s tram derailment, as friends paid tribute on Facebook to the “young, genuine, devoted family man”. The identities of those killed in the incident, which took place in New Addington, south London, have not yet been formally confirmed. But friends and family members identified Mark Smith and two other victims in tributes on social media. A fourth person killed in the crash, 19-year-old Dane Chinnery, was named by friends on Thursday. Smith could “make everyone laugh”, according to a tribute posted by his cousin. “Still cannot believe this is true, the last couple of days have just felt like a nightmare that I’m gonna wake up from.” A friend has set up a crowdfunding page aiming to raise £5,000 to support Smith’s fiancee, Indre Novikovaite, and his son Lucas. On Friday afternoon it had raised more than £2,000. Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, who has a husband and two daughters aged five and seven, has not been heard from since she left for work on Wednesday morning. Relatives told the Evening Standard the couple had moved to the UK from Poland 10 years ago. They said though Rynkiewicz’s death had yet to be officially confirmed, more than two days after the crash they feared the worst. Her sister-in-law described her as “an amazing mother and definitely a hard-working person”, adding: “She was on her way to work so early in the morning to provide for her kids.” Her sister-in-law said there was no other family in England, so Rynkiewicz’s husband would have to raise her daughters alone.
Philip Seary, 57, is also missing. The father of three, a Crystal Palace fan, lived with his wife, Vivian, in New Addington. Friends left tributes on Facebook to the “most kind, giving person we’ll ever have in our lives”. The tram has now been turned upright and will be removed from the site on Friday. It appears to have come off the rails as it travelled too fast round a bend, which has a recommended speed limit of 12 mph, shortly after 6am. Passengers said the driver, who was arrested after the crash, may have blacked out. On Friday, an extra minute’s silence was added to Croydon’s Armistice Day ceremony to allow people to remember those who died in the crash.
DCC Adrian Hanstock, of the British transport police (BTP), paid tribute to the people of the town for their strength and resilience. He also praised the emergency services and other workers who “worked round the clock” to help those affected by the crash. “This has been a challenging and difficult week for everyone in Croydon, not least for those directly affected and the local community,” he said. “I want to thank everyone for their continued patience while we fully investigate the circumstances of what happened.” He said the tram was expected to be moved from the track over the next 24 hours. The line is expected to remain closed over the weekend. Police are also looking at claims from passengers that a tram almost came off the tracks in the same place last week. A spokeswoman for BTP said officers were investigating the allegations that surfaced on Facebook after the crash, describing how an early morning tram had taken the bend too fast on 31 October and braked hard. Andy Nias, from Croydon, wrote on that date on Facebook: “30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up … tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! I swear the tram lifted on to one side. Everyone still shaking … it’s mad.” James Tofield shared a message he had sent to his wife at the same time, describing how the tram driver had braked and narrowly managed to stay on the track, adding: “It was like a ride from Alton Towers.”
A police spokeswoman said: “We were only made aware of the report on social media yesterday and it’s now forming part of our inquiries.” She declined to discuss this or other lines of inquiry further because it was an active investigation. The tram driver, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham in south London, was released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The Rail Accident Investigation Board said on Friday it would publish an interim report next week outlining the causes of the crash. The RAIB has appealed for more witnesses to come forward. The investigation, which runs independently from police inquiries, will reserve its full conclusions and recommendations to improve tram safety for a final report next year."
2016-11-11T18:54:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police officer 'absolutely gobsmacked' by claim he raped girl, jury hears","A former police officer accused 36 years ago of raping a 14-year-old girl told police he was “absolutely gobsmacked” when the allegation was put to him, a court heard. Raymond Jeacock, 62, was a detective constable when he was accused of raping the girl after giving her a lift home from a police station in 1980. When interviewed by police in 2014, he said he had delivered the girl home from a police station in Sutton because of concerns about her father taking her, Nottingham crown court was told. He said he had taken her alone because there were no female police officers and he had then searched the property for stolen goods. “There were no policewomen around – when you look now you would say it wouldn’t be allowed to happen, but in those days it didn’t seem like such a big deal,” he said. Officers were in the time of “Life on Mars policing, not the current practices we have now”, Jeacock added. He told police he was interested in the girl because she was in a relationship with a 19-year-old criminal. The woman, now in her 50s, earlier told the court she had been visiting this boyfriend at a young offender institution when she was arrested on the day of the alleged rape. Jeacock said he could not recall a claim, made by the prosecution, that he had previously interviewed the girl, on the request of her mother, about having underage sex with her boyfriend. He said he was “well aware she was young”, but she “came across older”. Jeacock told police in 1980 the girl was considered to be a “bad boy’s moll”. In the 2014 interview, he said: “She was that. She was knocking off one of the most prolific criminals of the time. I don’t want to sound prejudiced.” The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accuses Jeacock of raping her in her bedroom after following her into the house on 13 December 1980. Her father told the court he went to his ex-wife’s home to check on his daughter and found Jeacock attempting to hide on the floor of a bedroom. The jury earlier heard that the father had attempted to prevent Jeacock from leaving the house and conversation had become heated. Jeacock denies he was in the girl’s bedroom. He told the jury he informed the girl’s father he had conducted a search of the home and then left the property unimpeded. “I would have arrested [her] dad if he’d thrown me out of the house,” he added. He told police in an interview read to the jury: “From where I sat, none of this occurred. I have been wronged because of professional conduct. That was a razor blade.” The court heard Jeacock had been investigated at the time, after a complaint was made, but the then director of public prosecutions ruled there was not sufficient evidence to bring a case. After a disciplinary hearing in July 1981, Jeacock was “required to resign” because he had acted in a way “likely to bring discredit” to the police force. He said having his badge taken away was “awful”. “I could have slid down a sewer,” he told police, adding: “If I had walked out of the house with a [stolen] camera, I would have been patted on the back.” The court heard a statement from the woman’s mother, who recalled that 36 years ago her daughter had told her Jeacock had “raped her, or tried to rape her”. “She said she was terrified of him,” the mother said in a statement to police. In another statement for the prosecution’s case, an officer working with Jeacock on the day of the alleged rape said Jeacock had asked to borrow his unmarked police vehicle to make an inquiry. When Jeacock returned after taking the girl home, he “seemed a bit upset”, the officer said. Jeacock told him he had been searching under a bed when he was found by the girl’s father. “I asked him why he didn’t get me to go with him, but I don’t recall his answer,” the officer said. Under cross-examination from defence counsel Jeremy James, the officer leading the current investigation, DC Nicola Costello, said the few remaining documents from the time suggested the case had been investigated by a senior police officer. The court earlier heard that the alleged victim denied saying to an officer, when arrested at a later date, that she had “got one person sacked and I’ll get another one sacked”. James showed the jury a police record of a 1983 arrest of the girl, who was then aged about 16. In a section labelled “other useful information”, an officer had written “makes allegations”. There were no details about the type of allegations the officer was referring to, or against whom they had been made. The case continues."
2016-11-12T08:00:44Z,uk-news,UK news,The rise of Trump comes as no surprise on England's disaffected east coast,"“It’s like Brexit isn’t it,” says Tim Rix, a staunch leave supporter and the fifth generation of his family to run JR Rix and Sons. “Donald Trump was voted in for many different – and sometimes conflicting – reasons,” the managing director says. “Many reasons that overturned the establishment’s expected result.” There are thousands of miles between the rust-belt US states that supported Trump and Rix’s office in Hull in east Yorkshire, but in many respects the two places are closely aligned. The communities of both quietly voted to shock the world, taking decisions that would reveal deep divisions in each nation and leave large swaths of society asking how this could happen. Rix sees parallels in the economic protectionism that Trump used to appeal to millions of struggling US middle-class voters. “Europe is broken, it’s not going to work,” he says. “We have our own problems and we need to concentrate on dealing with the problems in this country.” The mood in those areas that turned against the establishment in the EU referendum is one of economic and social discontent, where people feel left behind and struggle to find their own answers to this and every other question posed by the decline of post-war industrial Britain. And while Rix and his forebears managed to develop a business that now turns over £400m to £500m, the local area is faring less well. Following the demise of its fishing, shipping and heavy industries, the city moved into sharp decline. But manufacturing still makes up 17% of the jobs in Hull, compared with 2.6% in London, according to statistics from the Centre for Cities thinktank.
“When the fish industry went down other businesses got more important. We have a lot of global operators in food, chemical, aerospace and oil refineries,” explains Ian Kelly, chief executive of the Hull and Humber chamber of commerce. “A lot of profit that is created here does not stay here. It goes to the business headquarters in London or other parts of the world.” And so Hull remains one of the poorest cities in Britain, with nearly 30% of households in social housing and one of the lowest average workplace earnings in the UK.
London is perceived as ignoring the region’s problems. “Politicians are not listening,” says Kelly. To illustrate the issue he tells of when, before becoming city of culture in the UK in 2017, Hull applied for £15m to build a bridge to connect its marina to the rest of the city. “They couldn’t find the money, yet at the same time we read in the London newspapers that the prime minister was signing off £25m for a garden bridge across the Thames – over which there are already several bridges – with hedges and trees on it, and we can’t even get a basic bridge.”It is the “London bubble” Brexiters so often rail against; a political class concentrated in one place, ignorant or dismissive of problems beyond the city and unwilling to engage with external concerns. Voting for Brexit was intended to prick the bubble. “You see it with Trump as well. He profits from an anti-establishment feel,” says Kelly. In Grimsby, 20 miles south of Hull and equally in favour of leaving the EU, Martyn Boyers struggles to see the link between economic hardship and the desire to turn away from an interconnected world. Boyers, chief executive of the town’s fish market, and whose father and grandfather were fish merchants, says: “There is a lot of people like me in Grimsby. Fishing is part of the community here.” But the decline in the fishing industry has changed the town dramatically, he says. “It was a slow decline that lasted over 50 years. And it started before Britain joined the EU. Coastal areas like Grimsby suffered because of a decline in the deep water fleet. Look at coal mining, look at cotton mills, look at all the big employment – if that goes the area starts to suffer.” “When I was young, Grimsby was quite a thriving town,” says Margaret Haessig. The 69-year-old retired teacher lives with her Swiss-born husband in a semi-detached house in the town. “We had so many people working, mostly men on the fish docks. Everybody had work.” When the fish industry went downhill, Grimsby did too. “There was no investment at all,” says her husband, Beat, also a retired teacher.
The decline began when the UK and Iceland had a series of confrontations over territory rights in the north Atlantic. The cod wars saw Iceland expand its fishing territory and nowadays 95% of the fish processed through Grimsby’s fish market arrives in lorries from Iceland and Norway. “Grimsby is not the worst of cities,” explains Mary, a friend of Margaret and Beat. “It’s just a small town where the industry went down.” All three of them voted to remain in the EU referendum, unlike 70% of the voters here. “Because the EU so much improved the ways of our lives,” says Margaret.
But all three of them are as disappointed about the outcome of the referendum as they are the performance of the pro-European politicians. “We have never seen anybody here,” says Margaret. Mary adds: “The politicians have let us down.” Boyers says: “Nobody – including me – could envisage the consequences of going out. How do they organise fishery, for instance. There are a lot of interests in a small pot. “A lot of people think that Brexit opens the door to catching more fish. You bring more fish into Grimsby, that will create more jobs, and that creates more prosperity. But it just won’t happen. “We cannot go back to free fishing. There has to be a form of control for the fisheries. “You can’t build a fence, like Donald Trump is going to do, in the North Sea. It’s got to be an agreement between Britain and the rest of Europe.”
Although he voted remain, Boyers is optimistic about the future. “This country is resilient enough to come through,” he says. From his office overlooking the port he can see a scattering of wind turbines that have been built in the past seven years. Dong Energy from Denmark has established windfarms off the east Yorkshire coast and Siemens, the German tech company, invested more than £300m in a facility manufacturing blades and turbines in Hull. “What you can see from in here,” says Boyers, pointing to three boats in the port, “are supply vessels for the windmill farm. It’s not fish. It’s something completely different, but what this community has provided is the ability to adapt and change.” Rix in Hull says: “Siemens arriving here was not the end of our problems, but it was the day the economic tide stopped going out.” The whole city had worked hard to attract Siemens. “And what we learned from Siemens coming here was that when we work together a lot can be achieved.” Shouldn’t this principle also apply to the EU? “Not at all,” says Rix. “In the city we have a common interest. It would be very difficult to build a common interest between all of the nations in the EU.” This article was amended on 14 November 2016 to correct the turnover of JR Rix and Sons from £4-£5m to £400-£500m."
2016-11-12T10:16:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Arthur Heeler-Frood: postal workers urged to look out for missing boy,"Royal Mail workers have been urged to look out for an idealistic grammar school boy who vanished after reading George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, disappeared from his home in rural Devon more than two months ago, leaving his parents a letter explaining that he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within the year. His parents, Caroline and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, have made emotional appeals asking him to tell them he is safe but also want him to contact Missing People if he feels he cannot speak to them. Paul Joseph, senior helpline manager at Missing People, said on Saturday: “When someone goes missing it can be an exceptionally difficult time for any family. When the missing person is a child, as in Arthur’s case, not knowing where a loved one is, or if they are safe and well, can be especially hard. “We would encourage Arthur and anyone else who is missing or away from home to contact us by phone or email. It’s free and 24/7 and you can call in confidence. We will not make you go home and we cannot trace your call. Our team is here to offer advice and options that will help make you safe.” The charity is also working with the Royal Mail to ask postal workers to look out for Arthur. Missing People said: “Through our partnership with Royal Mail, we are able to target alerts to particular geographical locations or, as in Arthur’s case, we can alert all 120,000 postal workers across the UK.
“Having postal workers looking out in their local communities for a missing person can bring great comfort to the families who are waiting for news and the police are increasingly requesting Royal Mail alerts as a key part of their search in high risk situations.” Devon and Cornwall police are working on new leads following appeals from Arthur’s parents but Ms Heeler-Frood said on Saturday there had been no major developments. The teenager left without his phone, any other electronic equipment or bank cards and had just £350 earned from a job working in a kitchen restaurant – which is exactly what Orwell did in Paris. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Caroline Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the country and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” said Heeler-Frood. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. “For the last two summers his brother, Reuben, has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister, Hester, went inter-railing. I think he was inspired by all that. “We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure. Hester was leaving for university and he was going to be the last one at home with us. I think he wasn’t looking forward to being left alone with us. I think he wanted to test himself, prove his abilities.” Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an avid reader. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been influence. He was reading on a Kindle, which he left behind. “The police have asked us if it is possible he jumped on the back of a lorry. We can’t rule out that possibility. He would have been following what was going on with refugees in Europe.” The 15-year-old has not been seen since he left for Colyton Grammar school on his bicycle at 7.30am on Tuesday 6 September. His last words to his mother were: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my fluorescent.” His custom was to leave his bike at a local post office and get the bus from there to school. When he did not return home, his mother went to the post office but could find no sign of the bike. Next day a letter arrived in the post. It said: “To mum and dad. I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please do not try to find me or make me come home. “I don’t know how long I will be away for but it won’t be longer than a year. You will find my school uniform in a bin bag in a small barn in the field on the green down the road near Membury church. “My bike is chained to the fence. ...Please apologise to the restaurant and tell them that I will no longer be able to work there. I know you will be upset but please understand that I have to do this, from Arthur.” The letter had been posted in Devon. Heeler-Frood said: “We have no idea what’s happened to him. He left with very little. His letter shows his departure was well-planned but he took very little with him. That gives us very little indication of what he had in mind or how he hoped to survive. We don’t know if he had a clear objective in mind or was just going to go whichever way the wind took him.” Arthur had just received outstanding GCSE grades and started his A-levels the previous day at Colyton Grammar in Devon, one of Britain’s most highly rated state schools. It has been very difficult for Devon and Cornwall police to find the teenager because he took no electronic equipment with him and has no bank account. No CCTV footage of him has been found. His parents have travelled to towns on the south coast and cities including London, Liverpool and Manchester to try to find him, putting up posters and speaking to hospitals and homeless charities. He is described as white, 5ft 4in tall, of slight build with short, light brown hair. Arthur may now have considerably shorter hair, possibly shaven. • Missing People. Call Freefone: 116 000.

2016-11-12T12:46:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Jo Cox to share peace prize with the Syrian group she championed,"The MP Jo Cox is to receive a posthumous peace prize jointly with the Syrian civil volunteer group known as the White Helmets, which she supported in the last years of her life. The MP will be remembered next week at the Rising Global Peace Forum, launched in Coventry last year by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The recognition comes as the trial of Thomas Mair, the man accused of shooting Cox on 16 June near her constituency office in Birstall, West Yorkshire, begins tomorrow. Cox’s husband, Brendan, said that she would have been delighted to see the White Helmets honoured. She had written a letter this year to the Nobel peace prize committee, nominating the civilian group. They lost out to Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, who was awarded the prize for his work in brokering peace in the country’s long-running civil war. “Jo was inspired by the White Helmets because they personified some of the best about humankind in some of the worst circumstances,” Brendan Cox said. “These are the people who run towards danger when others run away. They’ve saved over 70,000 lives and helped many more and, for Jo, they were a symbol of how, even in the depth of inhumanity, humanity can still respond and individuals can still find that compassion, that commitment and that service in their hearts. “Jo worked on Syria for many years and she focused on it not because it was high profile but because it was the clearest case in the world of where civilians were at risk and the international community was ignoring their plight, saving up all sorts of problems for itself in the future. But it’s not just about Syria – this is about standing up for what is right and for our values in the face of threats, and those threats come in different forms.” He added: “In one of the last speeches that Jo gave she said that all that was required for evil to triumph was for good men and women to do nothing. That is even more true today.” He congratulated those being honoured for standing up against “the threats we are facing to our values”.
The Rising peace conference will be held on the anniversary of the Coventry blitz – one of the most devastating nights of the Luftwaffe bombing of Britain in the second world war. During the raid on 14 November 1940, about 500 tonnes of explosives, including 36,000 incendiary bombs, dropped on the city overnight, killing more than 600 people and leaving many buildings, including its cathedral, in ruins.. Cox was co-chair of the Friends of Syria All-Party Parliamentary Group with the Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, who will be speaking about the refugee crisis at the forum. He said Cox’s “audaciousness and sense of responsibility, not only to her constituency and country but to the entire world, should be taken as example to all in public offices”. “I’m delighted by the decision to award her and the White Helmets with the global peace prize,” he added, “and I hope this will help in keeping her memory alive for future generations.” Ciarán Norris, director of the Rising Global Peace Forum, said the organisation had been set up to put a “spotlight on the catastrophic consequences of conflict and the power of peace”. The award was being given to those who embodied these qualities. “Jo Cox worked tirelessly to bring about a better world and is a very deserving winner of this inaugural award. ” Norris added: “Jo referred to the White Helmets in her nomination letter to the Nobel committee as ‘heroes’. We wanted to recognise their tireless, non-partisan work to help the victims of one of the worst conflicts of modern times.” • Musicians and MPs are recording a charity single on Thursday to raise cash for the launch of The Jo Cox Foundation, writes Vanessa Thorpe. Four MPs will be joined in the studio by the Kaiser Chiefs’ Ricky Wilson, KT Tunstall, David Gray, Suzi Quatro and Cockney Rebel’s Steve Harley on a version of the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You Want."
2016-11-12T14:35:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Councils accuse Home Office of dragging heels over Calais children,"Frustrated council leaders have accused government officials of dragging their heels over the slow transfer of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who have arrived from Calais and elsewhere. An estimated 320 unaccompanied children from Calais have been allowed entry to the UK so far, but very few have been settled in new homes. Under a voluntary national transfer scheme established in July, some local authorities have offered to take in limited numbers of children. These include many of the 3,000 who claimed asylum in Britain last year, usually after entering the country illegally, putting particular pressure on local authorities in Kent, which is home to the ports of Dover and Folkestone and the Channel tunnel. All 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester agreed in August to take four children each, whether from Calais, Kent or elsewhere. Bury council said it had been ready to accept its allocation for several weeks, with social workers making costly arrangements to house the four either with foster carers or in special supported accommodation. None has arrived, however, and the Home Office has given no explanation nor indication of which children will be coming or when.
Rishi Shori, Bury’s leader, said: “We put a lot of thought and work into plans to welcome four unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Bury after central government asked us to accept these vulnerable children. We were expecting to pick some of them up last Monday and had booked a minibus to collect them, as well as specialised accommodation at significant cost, yet at the last minute the Home Office effectively went awol and the pick-up didn’t take place. “The communication has been very poor from the Home Office. We are happy to do our bit and help, but we need to know which children we are receiving, what their needs are and when we will be able to fetch them. We know from the news that several hundred children have arrived in Britain, so what is the delay in transferring them to local authorities like ours which have offered to look after them? “Surely it is in the best interests of the children to have them settled in their new communities as soon as possible. We have also yet to receive the promised funds from central government to help pay for the children’s care, despite the fact we are already having to pay for accommodation. We don’t want to give up those places in case they are then not available when the children do arrive.” Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said he had offered to accept one child a month but so far just one had arrived under the so-called Dublin III convention, which reunites lone asylum-seeking children with family members already in the UK. Forbes said: “It’s gone very quiet. I’ve heard the same issue from other places, that the Home Office are dragging their heels and have a very poor on-site assessment process. It’s frustrating when we’ve worked hard against the clock to put support arrangements in place for these vulnerable children and prepare our communities to welcome them but the government hasn’t met its responsibilities on time.”
Shori added: “The government issued the clarion call for action a few weeks ago and we have answered, but there has been no movement whatsoever. “Local authorities in Greater Manchester have been disproportionately affected by austerity and are having to deal with huge financial demands on our adult and children’s social care budgets. In spite of all of that, and the uncertainty around the funding from government for these placements, we have stepped up to the plate because it is the right thing to do to support these vulnerable children at their time of greatest need.” The Local Government Association has complained that councils are not being offered adequate funding to care for the children, who often have very high levels of need. When contacted by the Guardian, the Home Office did not respond to the complaints from local authorities but said daily rates for local authorities providing care for unaccompanied children had increased by more than 20%, with an additional £60,000 available for each area. A spokesman said: “Local authorities are now provided with £114 per day for unaccompanied asylum seeking children under 16 and £91 per day for those aged 16 or 17. This equates to £41,610 and £33,215 per year respectively.” Not all local authorities have offered to take in child asylum seekers. Wakefield in West Yorkshire said it already had a disproportionate number of such children because of its proximity to two motorways. Sir Peter Box, Wakefield’s leader, said: “We’ve got approximately 26 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, all off the back of lorries – more than all our neighbours –and because of our M1/M62 location. So we have no further capacity.” The Home Office spokesman said: “We have consulted with every region in England, Scotland and Wales on their capacity and substantially increased the levels of funding we give to local authorities for providing care. We are grateful to the significant number who have stepped forward and provided assistance and would encourage others to take part.”"
2016-11-13T00:04:03Z,uk-news,UK news,From 19th-century black pioneer to cultural ambassador of Coventry,"When Ira Aldridge stepped on stage as the first black actor to play Othello, the Moor of Venice, he had an insight into the role shared by no other performer of the day. Arriving in England from America in the early 1820s, he had been met with prejudice and suspicion, like Shakespeare’s hero, especially when he went on to marry an Englishwoman. But the towering theatrical reputation that Aldridge built up across Europe during the mid-1800s rested just as much on his portrayal of a full range of leading roles as on his unusual racial status. Now the people of Coventry are finally to claim the actor as a key part of their cultural heritage and plan to celebrate his achievements with a series of readings, performances and guided walks. The city was already proud of its connection with Aldridge, recognised now as Britain’s first black theatre manager because of his 1828 stint running the former Coventry Theatre. But the full impact of Aldridge’s career has come to light. New research reveals the extent of his role in the political campaign against slavery in the colonies. “Aldridge chose to play a lot of anti-slavery roles, including Othello, as well as the standard lead parts in the repertoire,” said Tony Howard, professor of English at Warwick University. “And at the height of his influence in Coventry, there was actually a public petition held at County Hall for all those against slavery to sign.” The activities are designed as part of Coventry’s bid for the title of City of Culture in 2021 and include the staging of a new docu-drama about the life of Aldridge at the Belgrade Theatre, as well as a guided walk to the site of the former Coventry Theatre, later called the Theatre Royal and Empire. Extracts from several plays Aldridge programmed in his 1828 Coventry season, including Othello, The Taming of the Shrew, the anti-slavery melodrama The Revenge and a musical called The Slave, will also be staged as part of Against Prejudice – Ira Aldridge in Coventry 1828. Aldridge’s story clearly provides a welcome alternative to other well-rehearsed stories about the city, from Lady Godiva’s mythical horse ride through its streets to the destruction wrought by the Blitz more than 70 years ago.
Aldridge, who was also known as FW Keene, appears to have felt equally positive about the city that had given him a chance to run his own theatre. David Burbidge, chair of the Coventry City of Culture trust, cites a letter of thanks the actor wrote to the local newspaper almost 180 years ago. It first details his plans to “improve the fittings” at the theatre and make sure that curtain up always commenced “precisely at seven”. Then it continues: “FWK [FW Keene] might have feared that, unknown and unfriended, he had little claim to public notice, did he not feel that being a foreigner and a stranger are universal passports to British Sympathy. He desires only to be judged by his actions and relies on that discrimination and generosity which appreciates endeavour and rewards effort.” Burbidge believes this makes Aldridge the perfect embodiment of culture in a diverse city. “In other words, he felt he might not be welcome but rather than being held back, the city judged him not on his colour or creed but on what he wanted to achieve and his clear talent … In adopting Ira Aldridge’s story we hope to inspire young people in particular to learn from this ambition and talent of nearly 200 years ago,” he writes. Many black performers, inspired by Aldridge’s legacy, have gone on to become well-known names, from Paul Robeson to Adrian Lester, but the story of the man himself has been slow to re-emerge. “Aldridge has always interested black stars, but the wider influence he had is not well known,” said Howard. “Robeson was a great fan of his, and when he came to London to play Othello in 1930 at the Savoy, he put on an exhibition about Aldridge in respect of his memory.” In 2012, Lester starred at the Tricyle Theatre in north London in Red Velvet, a new play about Aldridge, written by Lester’s wife, Lolita Chakrabarti. The acclaimed production was revived early this year at the West End’s Garrick, with Lester earning renewed plaudits for his rendering of soliloquies in the authentic 19th-century declamatory manner. The phrase “political theatre” is more usually associated with the modern era, and yet Howard believes there is no clearer example of it than in the close relationship between Aldridge’s work and shifting social attitudes. “He really was able to make the most of good timing. He came into Coventry at the age of 20 and wanted to meet the important people of the town. He then went through the most extraordinary change of circumstance in the course of just two months. By the end of it, he was running a theatre,” said Howard. The Coventry Theatre had been built by the theatre manager Sir Skears Rew but, by the time Aldridge arrived in the city, Rew was very ill and the venue had fallen into disrepair. The actor must have impressed Rew, an alderman, fervent anti-Tory campaigner and abolitionist. Before he died on 23 April he had handed over the theatre to Aldridge in what Howard believes was both a political move and a leap of faith. “It seems such an extremely young age to have the responsibility,” Howard said. “It is the one time the community took a bet on Aldridge and he made a success of it in only a few short months. Both the shows and the standards of rehearsals were much improved.” Aldridge was born in New York and, as a teenager, had been involved in an attempt to create a black theatre company. These plans were effectively destroyed by a rival New York manager who, according to Howard’s research, “hired thugs to beat up the actors”. The theatre subsequently burned down and the actors were victimised by the New York police. Aldridge managed to board a ship to England but initially encountered the same sort of racist treatment. He was regarded as something of “a circus freak,” said Howard. He toured Britain in serious productions but was first billed to West Midlands audiences as a “Most Extraordinary Novelty, a Man of Colour”. “But audiences were then utterly astonished by the skill of his acting. Critics said he was one of the two or three best they had ever seen,” said Howard. Aldridge’s first wife was the daughter of a member of parliament, something anti-abolitionists regarded as a real provocation. “From one political perspective he was your worst nightmare come true, for others he was a symbol of all that might be possible,” said Howard. Aldridge toured Europe and was hailed by fans as the “African Roscius”, after the actor popular in ancient Rome, Quintus Roscius Gallus. Aldridge was fêted in Russia, too. But once work in England had dried up, he was forced to consider returning to America. He died in 1867 in Poland, after both the end of slavery and the American civil war. He had been about to go back to America, where several prominent white actors had declared that they were ready and willing to act with him in New York. Next summer, 150 years after his death, the City of Culture trust in Coventry hopes to put up a plaque to his memory on the site of his lost theatre. CULTURAL CAMPAIGN ■ Coventry’s celebration of its links with Ira Aldridge are part of its bid for City of Culture status in 2021. Coventry, now home to 250 Syrian immigrants, hopes to underline its diversity. ■ The bid trust is also showcasing the work of Indian photographer Maganbhai Patel, 94. His exhibition at Fargo Village, to 20 November, chronicles south Asian immigrants since the 1950s. ■ Coventry also hopes to establish itself as the home of peace studies and research, with an annual Peace Festival, set up in response to the destruction after second world war bombing. The Lord Mayor’s Annual Peace Lecture was given by War Horse author Michael Morpurgo, and a Remembrance Sunday service and parade are to be staged at the city’s War Memorial Park."
2016-11-13T08:30:13Z,uk-news,UK news,‘The challenge is to provide for everyone’: the National Trust under fire,"The Vyne in Hampshire, in the care of the National Trust since 1956, has something of a split personality, comprising as it does the remains of a Tudor mansion, built for Henry VIII’s Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sandys, and an 18th century country pile, once the home of the vividly named Chaloner Chute, speaker of the House of Commons in the last Commonwealth parliament. Henry VIII visited it three times, twice with Catherine of Aragon – in its panelled Oak Gallery you can still see the pomegranates that were carved in her honour – and once with Anne Boleyn, whom Sandys, ever the diplomat, would later escort to her imprisonment in the Tower. Chute, meanwhile, commissioned John Webb, Inigo Jones’s most talented pupil, to provide the new building with a classical portico, the first of its kind to adorn an English country house; and his great-grandson, John, a friend of Horace Walpole, designed its Palladian staircase, an ambitious addition whose luxuriant appearance belies its relatively diminutive size. From where I’m standing, you can see both parts of the building with a single half-turn of the head, though not their contents, for I am high up, perched on the leadwork between its two roofs. If I lean over, I can touch the tiles, attached to ancient beams with only one pin, that have, on the Tudor side, lately been causing the Vyne’s custodians so much trouble (in 2014, the roof leaked so badly, the tapestries below had to be removed for safekeeping), while straight ahead is a brick chimney, standing at a drunken angle that is almost, but not quite, comical. It’s an amazing vantage point, the mottled engineering of the structures around me reinforcing the house’s extraordinary history better than any oil painting or marble bust ever could. But I can’t be too smug. This view is a privilege that will soon be extended to every person who visits the Vyne. When, early next year, a £5.4m project begins to replace the roof and straighten the chimneys, the Trust will not close the property, as it might once have done. Rather, it will incorporate a roof-height walkway in the scaffolding, around which members of the public, vertigo allowing, will be invited to walk at their leisure. There will also, for those without the mobility to climb stairs, be a lift. What, you might wonder, is the point of this? Wouldn’t it be better just to focus on the job in hand? But to ask such questions is to fail to understand the way the National Trust works in 2016. “It’s about telling the story of what we’re doing here,” says Stuart Maughan, the Vyne’s general manager. The story. These are words I hear again and again in the company of the Trust’s more devout employees (also: “offer”, as in “visitor offer”). Later on, after we’ve loitered in the Vyne’s Tudor chapel, where plainsong plays through speakers, the better to stoke the atmosphere, Maughan will take me outside to a small hut where visitors can buy and customise tiles for the new roof, thus contributing not only to the NT’s appeal fund, but to the long swell of history. At some date in the distant future, another general manager will consider one of these, worked loose by an autumn wind, and find it to be covered in drawings of rainbows and smiley faces rendered in marker pen. What he or she will make of it is anyone’s guess. Perhaps by then the Trust’s money-making schemes, if not its priorities, will be radically different in nature.
The National Trust is, by any measure, an extraordinary organisation, inordinately rich and powerful and yet (mostly) greatly loved. Founded in 1895, its governance underpinned by several acts of parliament, it now has more members (4.5 million) than any other similar organisation in Britain – and, it goes without saying, four times more than all our political parties combined. Its income, generated from memberships, revenue from property and legacies, rose in 2015/16 by 5.7% to £522m, and while it this year spent more than it earned – £541m, part of a drive to catch up with a backlog of conservation costs – there is seemingly no cause for concern: its total assets stand at £1.13bn. In its ownership are 775 miles of coastline, 1,357 scheduled ancient monuments, and nearly 1,000 square miles of land including over 300 historic buildings, 59 villages and 61 pubs and inns. At this time of year, it has some 10,000 members of staff. Much more significantly, it also has 61,000 volunteers in its employ, enthusiasts young and (more often) old whose labour is valued at somewhere in the region of £43m. Recently, however, it has been dogged by bad press. Some of these stories are easily dismissed. Any large landlord is always likely to have among its tenants one or two who are disgruntled, and since when did Sir Roy Strong, the former director of the Victoria & Albert Museum, ever have anything good to say about the new, the modern, the innovative? (Most recently, he took against a cycle path planned for Croome Park, a Palladian house in Worcestershire; its landscape, he insisted, was designed by Capability Brown to be traversed only on foot, by horse, or “in carriages”.) But other stories have more credibility and thus the potential to damage: the healthy pay rises awarded to its executive board members; the plan, opposed by local residents, to fell trees on Winter Hill, near Cookham Dean, setting of The Wind in the Willows; the decision to lay on tours of Croydon and other “pop-up” events in an effort to appear “less stuffy”. There is a growing sense in some quarters that the Trust is distracted from its main purpose – conservation – and that in its determination to be inclusive, it is, for want of a better description, dumbing down.
Above all, one row is refusing to go away. Last August, the Trust bought at auction land belonging to Thorneythwaite Farm in Borrowdale, which came with a flock of Herdwick sheep (the rare breed to whose conservation Beatrix Potter was so committed), but not the farmhouse itself, the property having been divided by the vendor into two lots. Two things about this purchase were striking and, to many of those who live and work in the Lake District, deeply worrying, not to say enraging. The first was the breaking of the historic bond between the farmstead and its land. Why, people wondered, had the Trust not bought both, and installed a tenant farmer, as at its other farms in Borrowdale? (There is, incidentally, only one farm in Borrowdale now that the Trust does not own.) The second was the sum the Trust had paid. The auctioneers’ guide price was £750,000 for the 303 acres of land, and £800,00 for the farm buildings. Why, then, had the Trust coughed up £950,000 for the land? The Trust insisted that it couldn’t afford to buy both, and had therefore prioritised the land, which includes important wildlife habitats and woodland. But others were not convinced. Couldn’t it see that by paying so much, no local farmer could have hoped to get a look-in? In the days after the news broke, the Trust was criticised publicly not only by the Herdwick Sheep Breeders’ Association and the Federation of Cumbria Commoners, but also by James Rebanks, author of the bestselling book, The Shepherd’s Life, whose family has farmed Herdwicks in Matterdale for several generations, and by Melvyn Bragg. Lord Bragg, a Cumbrian by birth, did not mince his words. “The National Trust.... behaved very badly,” he said. “It put in a bid which was way above that which was reasonable for the land, thus making it impossible for local farmers to get a look-in. It was a nasty piece of work. Had a billionaire bullied his way into this disgraceful purchase there would have been a deserved outcry.” The denunciations hit home. Anecdotally, some have resigned their memberships as a result. I’ve come to the Vyne for my jaunt on the roof, but also to meet Dame Helen Ghosh, the former high-ranking civil servant who has been the Trust’s director general since 2012 – and who finds herself the focus of much of the ire currently directed at the Trust. She grew up in nearby Farnborough, and knows the place well. Ghosh’s reputation, as it has been disseminated in the press, is for a certain kind of brusqueness; she is, they say, an overpaid nanny (her salary is £183,960) who always knows best. Is this fair? She agrees with me that the tone of these articles may have something to do with her gender. “There is a strand in the rightwing press that is perhaps more critical of women leaders than of men,” she says. “I discount for that.” But it also has to be said that her manner is – how to put this? – edged with condescension. Five minutes into our conversation, she tells me about her first-class history degree from Oxford, as if this alone should settle my mind in her favour. Like her colleague, Peter Nixon, another high-ranking Trust person I will meet (its director of land, landscape and nature), she talks loudly of the importance of listening to other views without ever really giving the impression that she is doing so.
Ghosh spends two days out and about every week – the Trust’s HQ is in Swindon – and enjoys going “back to the floor”, wiping down tables in a cafe, or spending time clearing scrub on heathland. This helps her to understand the challenges the Trust faces, which are legion. There are macro problems: the effect of global warming on Britain’s coastline and other landscapes; the rapid decline in soil fertility across the UK; the issue of growing visitor numbers and how best they might be managed. And there are micro problems, many of which have to do with what the Trust likes to call “engagement”: should the volunteers in this house dress up as servants? Should that path involve a detour to a family-friendly bivouac-making workshop? (Visitors, incidentally, are somewhat creepily divided by the Trust into various categories: Curious Minds are the kind of people who wonder what lies behind a baize door; Explorer Families are, well, just that; Out and About-ers love the countryside, and the feeling of space that comes with it; those who Live Life to the Full favour thrilling experiences – surfing, for instance – over looking at paintings in grand houses.) I wrinkle my nose. One rainy day at Wordsworth’s house in Cockermouth, my husband and I virtually the only visitors, two women in mob caps proudly showed us the loaves they’d baked; embarrassed, we couldn’t get away quickly enough. Walking by Buttermere on the same weekend, we were confronted with, among other interventions, a series of signs, presumably for children, about ghoulies and ghosties. Don’t some of the Trust’s ploys turn off as many members as they delight? Ghosh shakes her head. “Some people want to paddle,” she says. “And some to swim, and some to dive. The challenge is to provide for all of them.” To the derision of the Daily Telegraph, she once referred to the collections in the Trust’s houses as “stuff”. This was, she goes on, to miss her point. “Highly educated people with an art-historical background can go into a crowded room and you don’t have to explain it to them. But people who are not interested in history will remember the volunteers [in mob caps], and that their children enjoyed it. The feeling is more important than the theoretical stuff. Looking after a tapestry or preserving a habitat has an intrinsic value, but if no one ever came to look at these things, we wouldn’t be enriching the life of the nation, and why would anyone carry on supporting us?” For Ghosh, the question of the Trust’s power, and how it might be used, is a “very interesting one”. She would never, she insists, take her members’ views on any subject for granted, and on most matters her postbag splits 50/50. She resents the idea that it is frequently viewed as a Goliath surrounded by Davids, because it operates in a very localised way. Nor does she accept that it is seen as being too political when it gets involved in issues like global warming, or what might replace farming subsidies once Britain leaves the EU: “I don’t talk about global warming much at all. But we do believe that it is man-made, and that we must play our part in mitigating that. The effect of extreme weather is the single largest threat to our conservation work.” The criticism, she says, comes from both sides, left and right, so the Trust can never win. While some regard it as too PC, others resent it for being too middle class – though my strong feeling is that no one worries about the latter half so much as it does. “There are encouraging signs that people from perhaps slightly different socioeconomic groups are coming in,” she says, unprompted by me. “It’s not price that puts people off [a family membership costs £111 a year]. It’s accessibility: you need a car. We’re thinking about acquiring properties closer to where people live, though when we talked to ethnic groups in Manchester, their view was: we are part of Manchester and we are interested in its industrial history. In other words, they were more interested in history of place than in, say, black history. You can misjudge these things.”
And so to Thorneythwaite. If the Trust had its time over, would she have made sure it bought the farm as well as the land? “No, I wouldn’t,” she says, after a longish pause. “It would have been an easy way to avoid criticism, and we would have had a quieter life, but it wouldn’t have enabled us to highlight the debate about how you can support sustainable [hill] farming in terms of the income, and the threat of subsidies disappearing [with Brexit]. We’re clear that our role must be to support adaptation. Conservation is about managing a process of change.” She reminds me that the farmhouse had been empty for a while, the tenant having left a generational tenancy (ie his family had been there for long time) for a mere 15-year one at a National Trust farm nearby, on the grounds that he could not make Thorneythwaite pay, and she denies, again, that the Trust, as was widely reported, has plans to rewild the land now in its possession. The farm’s flock remains there, in the care of a local shepherd, albeit (though she doesn’t say this) one with only a short-term contract to do the job. “We understand that hill farming is part of the culture in the Lake District, as well as an economic business, and that is why we are one of the main supporters in its application to be a Unesco World Heritage Site.” (The bid she refers to centres on the area’s distinctive topography, a landscape created in large part by hundreds of years of sheep farming.) Why, then, does she think people are so upset? Are they wrong? Why won’t they participate in her “debate”? (Buying land to provoke a debate seems to me, incidentally, rather an odd thing to do.) But here they are again, those words: the story “We didn’t tell this story quickly enough. All three of our people there happened to be away at the time. It got about that there would be wolves and so on, and no sheep, and that no local people would be involved. Those things aren’t true, but we didn’t say so fast enough.” Does she know who bought the house? “I think it was a family! And if they are sending their children to a local school and what not… a single farmer in that house is of no benefit to the community.” What if they are incomers, or second-homers? “Not our problem!” she says, rather tartly. I’m genuinely amazed at this, given the pressures on housing, the fact that young people in the Lake District can no longer afford to buy homes there. This may well not be the Trust’s responsibility, but to say so in the way that she just has is at best careless, and at worst, little short of heartless. In fact, the buyers of Thorneythwaite Farm are – according to another National Trust employee, Mike Innerdale, its regional director for the Lakes – precisely what I suggested they might be: incomers. A middle-aged couple from London, they have plans, or so I hear, to turn the farmhouse and its buildings into a respite centre. Does this worry him, as someone who lives and works in the area? “I do see [how their purchase of the farm plays in the community]. But if we step back in history, a lot of the influencers in the Lake District have been incomers. None of them were locals.” Well, if he means the likes of Beatrix Potter, that was somewhat before the current pressures on the housing market. Hasn’t the Trust simply helped to facilitate the move of some people up from London? “Actually, they were interested in the whole farm,” he says, as if this was any kind of answer.
My conversations with members of the Trust about Thorneythwaite are notable for two things. First, there is the fact that neither Helen Ghosh, Peter Nixon, nor Mike Innerdale mentions Peter Edmondson, who farms at nearby Seathwaite, and who believed he’d raised sufficient funds to buy both the farm and its land. A National Trust tenant himself, he hoped either to move there with his wife, or to put it into the care of one of his adult sons, both of whom still live at home. “I don’t mind being outbid,” he tells me, soon after my meeting with Ghosh. “But an outrageous bid like that was unacceptable, and never to be forgiven in my lifetime. It feels like a scar across my face. I’m more or less heartbroken.” The Edmondsons have been tenants in Borrowdale for six generations and, given that only one farm in the valley remains in private hands, are unlikely now ever to own their own property.
Second, there is the fact that their narratives are so inconsistent. Take the issue of the price the Trust paid, a figure it arrived at following independent advice. Peter Nixon tells me that one reason the Trust paid so much was because it feared a buyer from overseas. So, I ask Mike Innerdale, who gave the Trust the idea that there might be interest from overseas? If it came from the vendor’s side, surely they were simply trying to keep the price up. “Potentially. But we couldn’t ignore it.” Are any upland farms in the Lake District, to his knowledge, owned by foreigners? “Not to my knowledge. But we know there was international interest when Blencathra was put on the market.” This is disingenuous. In the end, the Earl of Lonsdale, unable to find a buyer for his iconic mountain (definitely not a hill farm), eventually took it off the market. All three talk of the “threat” the land was facing. But this isn’t quite the case. It’s in a national park, and as such, subject to protection come what may. The Trust deems the outrage about Thorneythwaite to have been the result of “misunderstanding”. But two months on, the anger is still there. “Helen Ghosh is absolutely, fundamentally and categorically wrong about Thorneythwaite,” says James Rebanks. “It is not a misunderstanding on our part. We have a perfect understanding of what they did, and how ill conceived it was. For us, breaking the lands from the historical farmstead sets a terrible, terrible precedent. The Trust exists to counter threat. They did not establish there was a threat to those lands, but they mindlessly waded in all the same. It’s not just about Thorneythwaite now. It’s about their values and whether our land is safe with them – or have they got another agenda that doesn’t include us, the farmers? There isn’t one of us that wants to fight with the Trust. We want to support it. But they think farmers are old-fashioned and narrow-minded and don’t understand what’s coming to them.” Rebanks knows change is needed, not least in order to counteract the calamitous flooding from which the Lake District has suffered in recent years (the Trust hopes to “explore” ways in which its newest farmland might be used to slow the flow of the upper river Derwent, thereby contributing to the prevention of flooding downstream in Cockermouth and Keswick). But he also thinks the Trust is unwilling to acknowledge how much upland farming has already changed. “In the past 10 to 20 years, there has been unprecedented tree planting on farmland and fells, and reductions in flock sizes by a third to a half. The old days of dinosaur farmers resisting environmental progress are long gone.” Recently, moreover, there has been a resurgence of interest in upland sheep farming. “The Herdwick culture has never been stronger. There are so many young people at our shows and sales. It’s amazing, and yet the Trust is still talking like it did 15 years ago, saying no one wants to come into farming.” If the Trust does decide not to keep sheep at Thorneythwaite – Peter Edmondson says he’ll be surprised if the sheep are there in four years’ time – his own farm becomes less sustainable. “I buy and sell sheep to Thorneythwaite, so if that flock goes, mine is less viable.”
I make a point of asking all the National Trust high-ups I meet whether their organisation has an institutional bias against farming in general, and against sheep farming in particular, and they all say the same thing, which is: no. Nevertheless, this doesn’t stop them from criticising Rebanks, and even from briefing against him. “He doesn’t farm full time,” says Ghosh, a note of satisfaction in her voice. “I don’t know if you thought he did, but he doesn’t.” This is untrue: like all farmers in the Lake District, he has in the past diversified, but his life is currently devoted to his farm, and to the writing it has inspired. A few days later, a National Trust press officer quietly suggests to me that it is “useful for Rebanks to be seen as an outsider” and that he is playing “a cute game”. Idon’t want to get too bogged down in the Thorneythwaite saga. The more I learn, the more I am minded to agree with Melvyn Bragg. But it is, after all, only one property, in one place, however precious that property and place, however beloved. I am not quite ready to resign my own membership just yet. A week later, then, I travel to Birmingham to see the back-to-back houses the Trust owns in the city centre, after which I will head to a place I’ve never been before: Kinver Edge, near Stourbridge in Staffordshire, to visit a collection of rock houses carved into the local red sandstone. Together, they help to illustrate some of the breadth and scope of the Trust’s work in 2016. The back-to-backs – there are 11 of them, two of which are now holiday cottages – have been in the care of the Trust for 11 years, and are the last such structures in the city. I’m shown around by Mukith Miah, the property’s education and off-site development officer, and about the most enthusiastic advocate for the Trust that it’s possible to meet: “If I ever left, I would still volunteer here,” he says, and I believe him. A Muslim who prays five times a day, Miah relishes the fact that he does not conform to the expectations most people have of Trust employees, and is doing good work encouraging visitors and volunteers from different communities. When, for instance, a group of women from the city’s Bangladeshi community came along, and it became clear that they did not fully understand the guide, he arranged a return trip, this time ensuring a translator was on hand. The Trust here also runs an inspirational summer scheme for young people in which they learn to be a tour guide in a week (the training usually takes six weeks). As he tells me proudly, one graduate of the scheme, Khalil Ali, then a 19-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan, is now an aerospace engineer in Derbyshire. The back-to-backs are one of the places where having volunteers in period costume really works: they light the gas lamps and tend the coal fires, and generally tell the stories of the families that lived, cramped as all hell, in these houses. Today, a group of primary school children are visiting, and they are dressed up too, little Victorian urchins of every creed and colour, staring wide-eyed at the tray of eyeballs made by Mr Oldfield, who lived in one of the houses in the 1840s. Upstairs, in the house occupied in the 1930s by Mr Mitchell, a locksmith, Miah pats a wall. “What do you think these marks are?” he asks, pointing at a series of rust-coloured blotches. “Well, I’ll tell you: the house was infested with bugs, and these are the marks Mr Mitchell left when he killed them.” His face is a picture of pure delight.
The Holy Austin Rock Houses at Kinver are an hour away by car, and have no equivalent in all England. They date from 1770, when they were carved into the sandstone by workers at the local iron works; in 1861, 11 households lived here. The Trust has now restored several of them, which are in two tiers (the caves at the top were, apparently, posher). One is dressed to show what it would have been like in Victorian times, and another in full 1930s-style; a third is a tea room, just as it used to be when, following the opening of the Kinver Light Railway in 1901, tourists began to visit, curious about these Hobbit holes and their stoical inhabitants. The houses are magical. You might take this for a film set if the Trust didn’t offer photographic evidence that real people – the last tenants, Alfred Howell and Rose Novak, left in 1964, when the council condemned the properties – once lived here. But Peter Nixon (this is where we meet) and his enthusiastic colleagues are just as eager for me to climb up through the woods to the iron age fort nearby. The heathland beyond it, which the Trust intends to protect and augment by removing trees, highlights the difficulties that lie in explaining certain kinds of projects to the public: we hate the idea of losing woodland, but while there are more than 3m hectares of it in the UK, only 95,000 hectares of lowland heath remain, a vital habitat for an extraordinarily rich variety of wildlife – though I will, alas, see no adders today. If they’re using this as a kind of proxy, hoping it will change my view of the situation at Thorneythwaite, they’re wasting their time. Nevertheless, as I fill my lungs with fresh air, gazing at a view that extends across three counties, I do take their point. Sentiment is the Trust’s greatest friend; without it, after all, it would be likely to have no members. But it is also, in some circumstances, a powerful enemy. As the idea of what constitutes heritage becomes ever wider – the pebble-dashed Liverpool semi that was John Lennon’s childhood home is only the start of it – and the preservation of our landscapes grows ever more complex, the Trust is, I fear, going to find itself fighting the romantics on more than one front."
2016-11-13T12:20:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Croydon tram crash: three more victims named,"Police have named the last three victims of the Croydon tram crash in which seven people died. Donald Collett, from Croydon, and Philip Logan and Robert Huxley, both from New Addington, were named on Saturday evening, as another report of a tram travelling too fast emerged. Friends and family of 62-year-old Collett described him as a “well-loved, funny and generous man who could light up a room with his smile”. “He is tragically leaving behind a loving family, partner, adored friends and work colleagues,” they said. “Please rest in peace and know you are truly loved and greatly missed.” The family of Logan, who was 52, said he would be “immensely missed”. “He was a true family man and generous friend to all with a magnificently dry sense of humour,” the family said. “Phil was a man with more love compassion and zest for life than words can express.” Six men and one woman died and more than 50 people were injured when the commuter tram overturned early on Wednesday morning. The others killed were identified earlier this week as Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz. Investigators have said the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than it was meant to. A report of a tram on the same line travelling too fast on 22 October was being investigated by police along with an earlier report from 31 October. The driver of the crashed tram, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham, south London, was released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.
On Saturday, family and friends of those killed held a tribute march. Up to 100 people walked to the spot where the tram derailed, and laid flowers and wreathes. Many were wearing the colours of Crystal Palace, whom Chinnery and Seary supported. The football club will hold a minute’s silence before its next home game, against Manchester City, on 19 November. An experienced former tram driver told the Times that there were “crazy” shift rotas, and the left turn where the crash took place was known as a nasty bend.
A spokesman for the tram operator FirstGroup said shifts were arranged with the consent of drivers and trade unions, adding: “We are dedicated to safety which is central to our culture and values as a transport business.” Repair work has begun on the line following the removal of the crashed carriages on Saturday morning."
2016-11-13T16:06:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester: manhunt under way after woman raped at knifepoint in her home,"A major police manhunt is under way after a woman was raped at knifepoint in her home in Manchester. The attacker held a knife to the 22-year-old victim’s face after breaking into her home in Old Trafford at about 7.30pm on Saturday. He ordered her to hand over any money she had before raping her at knifepoint, police said. DI Carl Gilbert, of Greater Manchester police, appealed for the public’s help following the “brutal and terrifying rape”. He added: “This is an absolutely shocking incident and one that is sure to cause much concern to anybody who hears about what has happened. We have increased patrols to provide reassurance to the local community and carry out further enquiries. “This man forced his way into the address and subjected his victim to a brutal and terrifying rape. We have a team of specially trained officers working to investigate, and [they are] providing her with support at this difficult time. “The attacker was completely unknown to the woman and I would ask the people of Old Trafford to please contact the investigation team if they believe they may have seen anything suspicious yesterday evening or in the hours following the rape.” The offender is described as white, aged somewhere in his 20s to 30s, and of medium build with dark hair. Police said the man spoke with a local accent and was wearing a dark hooded top or coat with dark-coloured tracksuit bottoms. Anybody with information is asked to contact police on 0161 856 7655 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."
2016-11-13T17:06:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Facebook helping police in search for missing teenager Arthur Heeler-Frood,"Facebook is helping police try to find a grammar school boy who went missing after reading George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, disappeared from his home in rural Devon more than two months ago, leaving his parents a letter saying he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within a year. Police forces across the country have been asked to look out for Arthur, and postal workers across the UK have joined the search for him. Devon and Cornwall police and the boy’s parents, Caroline and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, have been anxious to get access to his Facebook account, believing it may hold clues over where he may be or who he may have made contact with before vanishing. Facebook has refused to comment directly on the case but is understood to be helping the police and the charity Missing People, which is also involved in the hunt. The job of finding Arthur has been challenging partly because he left without a phone or any electronic equipment. He had £350 earned from a job washing up in a kitchen restaurant – as Orwell did in Paris. Devon and Cornwall police are working on fresh leads after his parents made emotional appeals at the end of last week but have not given details. Speaking to the Guardian, Caroline Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the country and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” she said. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. For the last two summers his brother, Reuben, has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister, Hester, went inter-railing. I think he was inspired by all that. We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure.” Arthur was an avid reader, his mother said. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been influence. He was reading on a Kindle, which he left behind. “The police have asked us if it is possible he jumped on the back of a lorry. We can’t rule out that possibility. He would have been following what was going on with refugees in Europe.” Arthur has not been seen since he left for Colyton grammar school on his bicycle at 7.30am on Tuesday 6 September. His last words to his mother were: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my fluorescent.” The next day a letter arrived in the post. It said: “To Mum and Dad, I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please do not try to find me or make me come home. “I don’t know how long I will be away for but it won’t be longer than a year. You will find my school uniform in a bin bag in a small barn in the field on the green down the road near Membury church. My bike is chained to the fence. “Please apologise to the restaurant and tell them that I will no longer be able to work there. I know you will be upset but please understand that I have to do this, from Arthur.” The letter had been posted in Devon. Caroline Heeler-Frood said: “We have no idea what’s happened to him. He left with very little. His letter shows his departure was well-planned but he took very little with him. That gives us very little indication of what he had in mind or how he hoped to survive. We don’t know if he had a clear objective in mind or was just going to go whichever way the wind took him.” Arthur is described as white, 5ft 4in tall, of slight build, with short, light brown hair. Arthur may now have considerably shorter hair, possibly shaven. • Anyone with information should contact police by calling 101 or emailing 101@dc.police.uk quoting log 255 of 14 September."
2016-11-13T19:29:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Police catch second Pentonville prison escapee,"Police have caught the second man who escaped from Pentonville prison last week. James Whitlock and another prisoner, Matthew Baker, escaped from the north London prison on 6 November. Officers from the Metropolitan police arrested Whitlock, 31, in Hackney, east London, on Sunday afternoon. A 48-year-old man and a 19-year-old man were also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender. Baker, 28, was found on Wednesday less than 10 miles away in east London, having spent about three days on the run. It is believed the pair used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through their cell bars at Pentonville before scaling an outer perimeter wall. It was rumoured in the prison that they had folded sheets into the shape of a person to make it look like they were asleep in their beds and escaped through a cell window on the fifth floor, using more sheets to lower themselves down. Baker was found at his sister’s house in Ilford where he was found hiding under a bed. He was taken to hospital for treatment for a broken leg believed to have been suffered in the course of the prison break. Kelly Baker, 21, appeared at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Friday accused of harbouring him. She is also accused of buying him hair dye so he could disguise himself. A 33-year-old man and 24-year-old woman were arrested on 9 and 10 November respectively on suspicion of assisting an offender and bailed pending further inquiries, police said. Baker had been awaiting sentencing after his conviction two weeks ago for stabbing a man 25 times in Dagenham, east London. Whitlock was on remand, charged with conspiracy to burgle. Following their escape, the prison’s independent inspection watchdog said Pentonville was a “soft target” due to the “dilapidated” condition of the Victorian building. Both men escaped from the category B prison’s G wing where 21-year-old prisoner Jamal Mahmoud was fatally stabbed last month in an attack by other prisoners that left two other men injured. Speaking after the breakout, Emily Thornberry, the local Labour MP, said the escape was the “final straw” and called for the prison to be closed down. “People don’t seem to be safe inside Pentonville and now it transpires inmates can escape. That is the final straw. If they don’t have control of the place, what is the point of it being there?” she told the Islington Gazette. “This was built in 1842 and is totally inappropriate for modern needs. It should have shut a long time ago and needs to close as soon as possible.” The prison was singled out last year by the former justice secretary Michael Gove as “the most dramatic example of failure” within the prisons estate, raising the prospect of its closure under the government’s “new for old” scheme. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers’ Association, said that the Pentonville breakout was a result of years of under-investment and staff cuts, and the focus should fall on the government for breaches in prison security. The news of the escape came the morning after a large-scale riot in HMP Bedford over prisoners’ anger about understaffing. No one was harmed but the riot prompted fresh fears that prisons are facing unprecedented levels of underfunding and understaffing, with prisoners left either unsupervised or locked up in cells for long periods of time. Holloway women’s prison, another Victorian-era jail less than a mile from Pentonville, was shut down earlier this year with many of the female prisoners transferred to Downview prison in Surrey."
2016-11-13T21:49:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Remembrance in London: poppies, their wearers and what they mean","Nine days ago, when the unappetising soufflé of Brexit press outrage about Fifa, British footballers and poppy displays was on the rise, I travelled from Hackney by London bus, London Overground, London Underground and foot to the Southwark studios of TalkRadio to discuss, among other matters, that very soufflé. I counted the poppies I saw on people on the way. By the time I’d swiped through the barriers at Southwark Tube I’d been travelling for about an hour with many hundreds of people, but spotted only two wearing the remembrance symbol. One was a middle-aged black woman on the train from Hackney Central to Stratford. The other, on the Jubilee Line heading south, was speaking to a companion (another black woman) in a language I did not recognise - Mandarin? Korean? Vietnamese? - and looked as if she came from, or had roots in, south or southeast Asia. There was a poppy seller just inside the station, the first I’d seen this year. From him, a white Englishman, I bought two of the traditional paper poppies and stuck them in my pocket to attach to my lapel later (I was in a bit of a rush by this time). Outside, at the junction of Blackfriars Road and The Cut, there were two more, a young white man and a young black woman (pictured above). Hurrying down The Cut, I passed a middle-aged white man with a poppy pinned to his overcoat. He was the last wearer I saw before walking through the radio station’s doors. On air, the presenter remarked on how few poppy-wearers she too had seen around the capital. The contrast between this low early take-up level among the public and the heavy obligation to wear one when appearing on television was noted. So too was the ethnic and linguistic diversity of the London poppy-wearers and vendors I had seen on my way in. For me, this all revived recurring questions about remembrance, who participates in what numbers, how and why. The point I tried to make on air, and now offer again in the light of subsequent events, is that remembrance should be a charitable and voluntary matter through which loss and sacrifice are recognised, the past reflected on and the costs of war considered soberly. You do not have to have backed every conflict Britain has been part of since 1914 to participate, and to participate is not to approve of every decision to engage in war taken by British governments. Each person, here in London or anywhere else in the UK, will have their own reasons for marking 11 November each year and for doing so in their own way. Mine are mostly about my late father and being glad London survived the Blitz and that Britain wasn’t over-run by Nazis, though I also think of soldiers from more recent history I have met. Those poppy-wearers I encountered on my excursion to Southwark will have their own, distinctive stories to tell. But there have long been those who politicise remembrance. Some on the left have always perceived it as representing nationalistic glorification and shunned it accordingly. In 2010, a handful of East End Islamists made their, quite literally, inflammatory point by burning poppies near the Royal Albert Hall. But it is the right, including some of its most powerful influencers, that routinely seeks to colonise remembrance for their own ends, imposing it on opponents and as an inflated sort of patriotism test - one that Labour leader Michael Foot was sneeringly deemed to have failed at the cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday way back in 1981. What Jon Snow has dubbed “poppy fascism” is a contemporary manifestation of this. So too was that Brexit press furore over the England-Scotland match at Wembley played on Friday night, though in that case the attacks were on foreigners in the form of Fifa. The players and British football’s national authorities were right to defy their dim and discredited international counterpart, but the backdrop to the episode is less easy to like. My radio appearance was on the same day the Brexit press attacked British judges for upholding British law over Article 50 and withdrawal from the EU. Now, foreign secretary, London MP and former London mayor Boris Johnson incorporates Donald Trump’s election victory into his Eurosceptic performance and Nigel Farage parades himself as the representative of Britishness in the US. Those small acts of remembrance I’ve witnessed in London are a reminder in these uneasy times that its ceremonies, symbols and often very private meanings can be misused on the platform of national life all too easily."
2016-11-14T00:01:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Station Welsh troops in Wales to boost soldiers' welfare – Plaid Cymru,"The British army’s Welsh regiments should all be based in Wales rather than across the border in England when not on active service, the nationalist party Plaid Cymru has said. Plaid’s call for all Welsh troops to come home follows the British government’s announcement it is to sell off almost a 10th of its defence sites, including the historic Brecon barracks in south Wales. The party’s leader in Westminster, Hywel Williams, said: “Our hard-working servicemen and women should be allowed to be as close as possible to their friends, family and wider support networks when not on active service.” The three Welsh regiments of the British army are all based in England: the Welsh Guards are at Pirbright, near Guildford in Surrey, 1st The Queen’s Dragoon Guards in Norfolk and the 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh at Lucknow barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire. Williams said: “Recent assessments of the makeup of the Royal Welsh regiment, for instance, show that 98% of recruits are from Wales, but they are forced to move to Wiltshire, Norfolk or Surrey to serve their country. “Despite there being several locations in Wales that are suitable for stationing regiments, the three Welsh regiments are stationed in England. Facilities in Wales are excellent. “There is also a strong economic case to be made in favour of bringing our troops home. Data available up until 2008 showed that the Ministry of Defence spends less per head in Wales than in any other UK nation or region. That means Wales is losing out on the benefits to the Welsh economy of local procurement as a result of not having those regiments stationed in Wales. “The government in Westminster must look again at arrangements for stationing Welsh regiments so that the welfare of serving individuals are made an utmost priority and our economy benefits as a result.” There has been growing anger in Brecon, where there has been a barracks since 1805, at the announcement that the army’s Welsh headquarters will be shut in 2027. A storage depot nearby in Sennybridge is also to go, as is Cawdor barracks further west in Pembrokeshire. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has said the government hoped to raise £1bn from the sale of MoD land across the UK and save £140m a year in maintenance costs. An MoD source pointed out problems in Plaid’s call, including the issue that the Welsh Guards provide security for the Queen and so it makes sense for them to be based near London. The source emphasised that Wales – including the Sennybridge training area - was used by many hundreds of soldiers, from across the UK, each year. An army spokesperson said: “The basing of army units is deliberately designed to maximise military capability and flexibility that allows us to respond to the security challenges of these uncertain times. “With over 2,000 military personnel based in the region, and soon to be the future home of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft repair hub, Wales continues to make a vital contrition to our defence capability.”"
2016-11-14T00:01:32Z,uk-news,UK news,"Employees £3,500 a year worse off under Tories, says Labour","Sluggish wage growth means the average employee is £3,500 a year worse off since the Conservatives came to power, according to Labour analysis of Treasury figures before chancellor Philip Hammond’s first autumn statement next week. Compared with the average wage growth under Labour, full-time employees are £67 a week or £292 a month worse off, the party’s report found. The analysis compared the average annual percentage change in wages in the six years of the Conservative and coalition governments, which is 1.3%. In contrast, the average growth under the last Labour government was 3.2%, though growth fell significantly post-2008. Labour will use slow wage growth as a key argument against plans to cut universal credit, which Hammond is being urged to reverse in his autumn statement on 23 November. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, has said the government will not make any more immediate welfare cuts after the UK’s vote to leave the EU in order to focus on economic recovery, but said cuts already announced would go ahead as planned.
John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “We have known for a long time that the government has failed to make good on its promises to ‘make work pay’; we have had sluggish wage growth and a failure to return wages to their 2008 peak. That’s why Labour is calling on the chancellor, in the upcoming autumn statement, to reverse the damaging cuts to universal credit still planned for the remainder of this parliament.” Labour will also focus on the self-employed in the party’s response to the autumn statement, with the shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, highlighting the gaps in the national insurance framework for freelancers or small business owners, who make up 15% of the workforce. In a speech on Monday, Abrahams will call for changes to the current system in which self-employed workers are not able to gain access to important elements of the social security system, including sick pay and paternity pay, and for the government to tackle the potential pensions black hole because of lower personal pension savings among the self-employed. “In so many ways, self-employment is characteristic of both the opportunities and the challenges faced by our society,” she will say. “It brings to the individual a combination of great freedom with great risk, an ability to build one’s own enterprise or to work flexibly around other priorities; it can offer great prosperity for some, but poverty pay for others.”"
2016-11-14T11:02:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Public inquiry into police spies issues appeal to bereaved parents,"The public inquiry examining the undercover infiltration of political groups is making an appeal to bereaved parents to get in contact. Lord Justice Pitchford, the senior judge leading the inquiry, is investigating how undercover police officers stole the identities of dead children and adopted them to create their fake personas. He wants to hear from parents who wish to know whether police used the identities of their dead child. The police have previously been forced to apologise for stealing the identities of dead children following a public outcry about a technique that has been criticised as being “ghoulish and disrespectful”. This and this describe how the undercover police developed this technique to create their aliases.
Police never told any of the parents of the dead children that their identities had been stolen in this way. Police have admitted (see here) that the identities of at least 42 dead children were used by the police spies. Pitchford is seeking to investigate the full extent of the practice by police forces in England and Wales, as part of his inquiry into how undercover officers have spied on hundreds of political groups since 1968. He suggests that the identities of up 100 children who died between 1938 and 1975 were stolen. His appeal can be found here with further explanation here. Pitchford has asked parents to register their interest by December 22. Issuing the appeal earlier this month, Pitchford said that during his inquiry, “it is likely that a number of identities used by undercover officers will come to light and wherever possible we want to be in a position to communicate with parents or close relatives about this.”
He added that the names of some spies may be kept secret during his inquiry, and so he may not be able to tell some parents that their child’s identity had been stolen. The extent to which the inquiry will be held in secret - and the identities of individual spies kept concealed - has yet to be decided, amid much legal argument (see this and this). There was some criticism of the appeal after it was issued by Pitchford, with this from the Undercover Research Group, referring to the demand for the inquiry to publish a list of fake names used by the police spies:
This piece by the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance analyses the appeal (questioning, for instance, whether parents will stumble across it) and examines how and why the identities of dead children were stolen by the spies. Pitchford says he is due to outline early next year when his inquiry will start holding substantive hearings. The inquiry is in the process of gathering evidence. According to an update published this month, the inquiry has received at least 320,000 documents from the police, more than 220 witness statements and requested information from more than 50 organisations. * If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here and here)."
2016-11-14T11:58:42Z,uk-news,UK news,British woman falls to her death from Benidorm hotel balcony,"A British woman has died after falling from the ninth floor balcony of a hotel in Benidorm. Danielle Hall, 21, reportedly from Newcastle, died after a night out in the Spanish Costa Blanca resort. It is understood she was staying at the three-star Bermudas apartment hotel with her boyfriend, Jordan Bevan, 23, and his grandmother. Local reports said Hall, a supermarket worker, lost her balance and went over the balcony railing at about 2am on Sunday after going to answer the door to a relative who was also staying at the hotel. They had only arrived at the hotel for a week-long stay the day before the tragedy. A spokeswoman for the Bermudas hotel said: “We can’t give much more information about what happened because we weren’t there when it happened. It was about 2am. The police were here, along with firefighters, ambulance crews and forensic officers. We’re still coming to terms with what’s happened.” Spanish police would not confirm the woman’s identity due to privacy laws but said the death did not appear to be suspicious. “She was on holiday in Benidorm with her family and her boyfriend,” said a police spokesman. “At about two in the morning, she fell six floors – about 25 metres – and died.” He added that police had been in touch with the British consulate. A police investigation has been launched under the supervision of a judge. Police said they were not in a position to make an official comment but were treating the death as an accident. A spokesman said: “There is nothing at this stage to indicate any foul play.” The group is understood to have travelled to the town for its annual festival, which started on Friday and finishes on Wednesday."
2016-11-14T12:46:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"London super-sewer is waste of £4bn, says assessor","The original assessor who backed plans for a multibillion-pound super-sewer beneath the river Thames has said his decision was based on incorrect information, as crews begin work on the project. Chris Binney, the chairman of the 2005 steering group that recommended the Thames Tideway tunnel as the solution to London’s wastewater problems, has questioned whether it was worth the £4.2bn estimated cost.
The seven-year project – the biggest upgrade to the capital’s sewers since Joseph Bazalgette oversaw their construction in the 1850s – is intended to stop wastewater from overflowing into the Thames at times of heavy rainfall. Engineering crews have already begun damming sections of the Thames to sink shafts to the required depth, but Binney now says it is unnecessary and that the government ought to have looked at alternative solutions. His original decision was made on the basis of information that “turns out not to have been factually correct”, he told the Guardian. “The modelling that was done showed it was downstream of Chelsea Bridge where this was needed but now downstream of Chelsea Bridge is fine,” Binney said. “There is doubt about quite a lot of the quoted spill frequencies. I don’t believe the model is robust, nor do the people who actually verified the model. “In broad terms I think it is a waste of about £4bn … and it is largely the Thames Water customers that will pick up the bill.” Thames Water, London’s privately owned water supplier, says the 15-mile sewer will collect almost 18m tonnes of sewage every year that would otherwise be pumped into the Thames.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said it is needed to bring the capital’s ageing sewer system up to date and is the only solution that will meet environmental requirements in the shortest time and most cost-effective way. However, Binnie says the most up-to-date analyses show that the issues the super-sewer is designed to solve are not as bad as previously thought. Meanwhile, the National Audit Office (NAO), the government’s spending watchdog, has raised questions over a financial plan for the project that would leave taxpayers footing the bill in the event of cost overruns or a fresh crisis in global credit markets. A private company, set up by the government and Thames Water, will own, manage and finance the sewer during construction. One-third of the cost is being contributed by Thames Water, while the remaining £2.8bn will be raised from private investors. To encourage investors, they will receive an income from the project from the very start, while the government will indemnify them against a number of risks. When the tunnel is finished, the company will supply sewerage services to Thames Water on a 125-year concession, with the cost borne directly by customers through a fee added to bills. The NAO had been originally set to report this autumn. However, this has now been pushed back into the new year. In the meantime, work on the sewer is under way, with engineers preparing to sink shafts at three sites to lower the boring equipment that will dig the tunnel. Binney said: “I think virtually everybody has accepted that there is nothing we can do to stop it. [In the future] we need to be a lot more careful about the information on which these types of projects are assessed and make sure you really do have to construct it. “I am not criticising Thames Water. They were instructed by government to get on with it and they have done so ... The fault lies with government and to a certain extent with the Environment Agency, which provided insufficiently robust information.” A Defra spokesperson said: “In the 21st century, London should not have a 19th-century sewage system that pours untreated waste into the Thames every time there is heavy rainfall. “The Thames Tideway tunnel is privately financed and delivered, with no public money expected to be spent on its construction, and will modernise our capital’s ageing sewage system. The modelling used to assess the sewer is recognised as industry-leading and is regularly refined and updated. The Environment Agency has revisited the early findings of 2005 using this and found they are still accurate.” • The byline on this article was corrected on 22 November 2016."
2016-11-14T15:48:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Three held over death of woman after 'slapping therapy' workshop,"Three people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a diabetic woman died following a workshop based around slapping as a form of “self-healing”. Danielle Carr-Gomm, 71, was found dead in her room on 20 October at Cleeve House in Seend, Wiltshire. An inquest was opened and adjourned on Friday. Wiltshire police are treating Carr-Gomm’s death as suspicious and confirmed the arrest of three people, who have been released on bail until mid-January. “Police were called to an address in Seend in the early hours of 20 October following the sudden death of a woman,” a spokeswoman for the force said. “Inquiries are continuing. A 64-year-old woman, a 53-year-old man and a 51-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.” It is understood that one of those arrested was Hongchi Xiao, a Chinese therapist running the paida lajin retreat. He promotes the controversial therapy as a way of purging toxins from patients by slapping them or getting them to slap themselves. Last year, Hongchi was questioned by police in Australia after the death of a seven-year-old boy from Sydney who had attended one of his workshops. Carlo Zacca, the manager of Cleeve House, said staff were doing all they could to help police with the investigation. “I don’t know any more than what the police are saying. This was a very sad and shocking event. We are very sorry for the lady and for her family,” he said. Carr-Gomm’s son Matthew, 43, said his mother, from Lewes, East Sussex, had been given false hope. “I am certain that if she hadn’t gone on this course, she would still be alive today. She was convinced this alternative treatment was going to have a positive effect,” he said. “She had a lifelong fear of needles, so diabetes was probably the worst illness she could get. That was why she was so keen to try alternative therapies.”"
2016-11-14T16:31:28Z,uk-news,UK news,'Desperate' Afghan children go on hunger strike in France in bid to rejoin families in UK,"Three 16-year-olds from Afghanistan have begun a hunger strike in France in protest at the slow process of being reunited with their families in the UK, according to a refugee legal organisation. Three weeks after the demolition of the Calais camp, several charities say there is rising anxiety among the 1,600 children and young people who were dispersed to disused elderly people’s homes and youth hotels across France without being given information about their future. The Red Cross and Save the Children have called on the Home Office to urgently provide basic information to children and French hostel staff about the expected timescale for processing applications to come to the UK. The three boys from Afghanistan who are on hunger strike have been trying to get permission to join relatives in the UK for several months, and had been living in tents in Calais for more than six months, according to Laura Griffiths, a senior field manager for Safe Passage UK. “It is a sign of their desperation at being forgotten,” she said. The organisation was in regular contact with the boys since they stopped eating last week and was trying to convince them to stop the protest, she said.
Elsewhere, at least 20 children have become so concerned at the absence of information that they have run away from the centres where they have been rehoused, hoping to continue their attempts to come to the UK illegally by smuggling themselves on to lorries. The 1,600 children and young people who were dispersed from Calais to about 60 hostels across France on 2 November were accompanied by two Home Office staff members on each bus, but the British officials left most centres as soon as the buses arrived at their destination, according to refugee charities who are in contact with the children. Since then most have had no explanation about the process under way, nor given any clarity about how long they will have to wait before their asylum claims are examined. Home Office staff have returned to some centres to start interviews, but have not revealed when decisions will be made, according to charity staff. Volunteers from HelpRefugees, who have visited eight centres, said there were translators in only two of them, and concluded that “overall it is a negative picture”. They said they had met two boys who voiced suicidal thoughts, and many others who were distressed by not knowing what was happening. They were aware of 22 children who had already left three of the centres they visited. They also noted that centres which were well run, with access to translators, had less of a problem with runaways. “Most kids are already suffering from anxiety having been taken from Calais without any information and now they are in centres with still no information,” Benny Hunter of HelpRefugees said. “They feel safe, they enjoy the showers, but the lack of information is breeding anxiety. Our biggest concern is that this distress and lack of information is driving children to leave centres.”
Thirteen-year-old Wasilkareem Y, from Afghanistan, was taken on a 12-hour coach trip to a centre in Talence, a suburb of Bordeaux in south-western France, with about 30 other boys from Afghanistan aged between 12 and 17. He was interviewed last week for about eight minutes by a Home Office official about his application to join his maternal uncle in Southampton. He described the process as “disorganised” and said he had been called back to answer questions again after officials had apparently got his forms muddled with someone else’s. “They registered two of us with the number 75. I said, ‘why are you interviewing me twice?’ They said they had lost the paper. They were asking very simple questions that we have answered before.” There was no information about when the applications would be approved or rejected. “All the boys were asking, when will there be a result. They said, ‘We are not sure when you will have a reply,’” he said. Meanwhile, he and the other boys in the centre were struggling with the boredom. “We can have a bath or a shower, and it is warm at least. In Calais it was not warm. But there is nothing for us to do. There are no activities, no school, no chance to learn anything. You just sit in your room and wait,” he said. He said that because none of the boys spoke French and the staff did not speak English, they were communicating through Google Translate on staff members’ phones. “People feel unhappy and angry,” he said. After visiting one of the reception centres,, Karl Pike from the Red Cross, said the children were “extremely anxious”, and called on the Home Office to provide urgent information to the children about the timescale for the consideration of applications to come to the UK. “They need some reassurance that the process is going to happen; that would help avoid them going missing. What would also clearly help if something official-looking was sent to the centres stating when the Home Office is coming back,” he said. “We were surrounded by children with a lot of questions.” The Home Office said it would not be providing any time frame for the decision-making process. A spokesperson said that officials needed to “continue to ensure the right checks have been made on these young people for their safety and the safety of others. This means assessing their ages, confirming their identities and eligibility to come to the UK and running security checks. The French authorities have committed to supporting minors as we make these essential checks”.
Save the Children said it was aware that some children were leaving the centres because they did not understand what was happening, and the charity has also called on the Home Office to give children a clearer sense of when they might be told about their future. Safe Passage, which is conducting a census at all 60 centres, said there was particular concern at the absence of information in any language understood by the children. The frustration expressed by children in France is echoed by some councils in the UK, who had rushed to make beds available for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and have been frustrated at the delay in transferring children from France. In a detailed report on eight centres, HelpRefugees workers said the quality of the centres varied considerably. In the better reception centres there were appropriate translators, activities, French lessons and well-qualified staff; children in these centres described themselves as “very lucky”. In other centres, however, children had not been given winter clothes, and some still only had flip-flops. In one, children had made themselves a cricket bat but did not have a ball. The most common complaint, beyond lack of information, was boredom. Many centres had no television, and no lessons or activities for the children. During their research at an interview centre near Grenoble, two HelpRefugees volunteers overheard a Home Office official requesting by telephone to a colleague in London that all British staff be taken out of the centres before the results of the asylum applications were announced. The official was heard to request “we want to get teams off the ground before answers come through in case tensions emerge”, according to Hunter and colleague Rosie Pope. The official was overheard to add: “The expectation is that the Home Office are clearing out the centres; we’re not taking as many as the French think … you’ve got your frontline staff in the middle of the battlefield; it’s going to cause so much tension.”"
2016-11-14T16:56:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Nazi memorabilia spotted at London school car boot sale,"Nazi memorabilia has been spotted at a car boot sale during a fundraising day in the grounds of a London school. Several items decorated with swastikas were on display at the Chiswick school sale, which is held on the first Sunday of each month and is in aid of the school’s parent teacher association (PTA). One woman who photographed some of the items said she was shocked to find Nazi memorabilia at a school sale. Cecile Ruhe, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, posted three photographs online showing medals and a sign decorated with swastikas. She said she saw about 20 similar items at several stalls. “I went around the market and doubled back when I realised I had seen this – it’s very unusual,” she told the Guardian. “I was shocked. I saw more and more [examples of Nazi memorabilia] and thought, wait, what’s going on here? I saw about 20 different things on four stalls, maybe five.” She added: “Nobody seemed to say anything.” Ruhe, who has lived in the west London area for 25 years, said she visited the sale regularly but had never noticed this type of merchandise on sale before. She shared the photos on the Facebook page of the school’s PTA, which organises the sale, with the message: “Local car boot today highlighted disturbing trend for Third Reich ephemera. Sign of the times?”
A spokeswoman for the PTA told the Evening Standard: “A seller has contacted us to report the stall. This stall is unknown to us and as reported would certainly be inappropriate for any car boot, school-based or not. “We have never encountered this before and will be amending our website and flyers to reflect our views. I have informed the lady who raised the issue that this is the action that we would be taking.” Malcolm Fisher, an expert in war memorabilia, told the Guardian that at least some of the items appeared to be originals. He said Nazi memorabilia sometimes surfaced during house clearances but it was unusual for several stalls to be selling such items at the same sale. The items in the photos included a medal honouring those who participated in the 1923 Munich putsch, a submariners’ brigade medal, and a medal for the Germanische order, awarded by the SS to foreigners who followed the organisation’s ideals. “I’d say these are all replicas,” said Fisher. Another photo showed an enamel plaque for the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, the organisation that replaced unions. This appeared to be genuine, according to Fisher. A third photo showed an eagle and swastika item that was once used as a pole top, he said. “Either it’s genuine or they’ve aged it up by burying it underground.”"
2016-11-14T17:10:15Z,uk-news,UK news,London health and care reforms finally emerge to face local scrutiny,"A report from thinktank the King’s Fund says the latest government plans for reorganising health and social care in England have been kept shrouded in secrecy by NHS England and taken little note of the views of the public and frontline staff. This will come as no surprise in London, where there’s been great annoyance that draft plans produced in October were not immediately opened up for general scrutiny by Londoners. Two local authorities went ahead and published anyway. “There’s no way the NHS can produce these plans in secret,” tweeted Camden’s Labour leader Sarah Hayward when her council became the second in the country (after Birmingham’s) to unveil the 68-page draft sustainability and transformation plan (STP) for the North Central London area, which also takes in the boroughs of Barnet, Islington, Haringey and Enfield. “There is a national crisis in both the health and social care systems,” she said in a statement. “Both need to change and we recognise they could be more efficient. As the provider and commissioner of social care services in Camden, we want to be sure that future needs are reflected in this plan.” The other borough to publish was Lib Dem-controlled Sutton, which fits into the South West London organisational “footprint” along with Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Richmond and Wandsworth. Sutton leader Ruth Dombey acknowledged some “strategic engagement” on the part of the various local NHS bodies involved and said boroughs had been informally updated on the progress of their STP. However, she said that central NHS’s not allowing the general release of its provisional version “is raising worries about its content and the process around its development”. That’s why she put the 61-page South West London draft STP out there smartish. In all, five STP “footprints” cover Greater London out of the 44 in England as a whole. The other three are: North West London (encompassing Brent, Harrow, Hillingdon, Ealing, Hounslow, Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea); North East London (Barking and Dagenham, City of London, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest); and South East London (Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark). The draft STPs for the full quintet all have now been published, so at least - some will say at last - everyone can now have a look at what’s in store: see the North West one here, the North East one here and the South East one here. Passions have long been running high about these templates for reform, with some seeing them as exacting yet in some ways also potentially beneficial devolutions and integrations of vital services and others doubting they amount to anything other than mechanisms for ruthless cuts, closures and privatisations. All concerned with their creation have been feeling the strain. Now comes the anxious and heavy scrutiny. In London, the debate has been taking place very much in the context of meeting the particular needs of a city with such a large, diverse and shifting population. The case for proper input from patients and practitioners seems exceptionally strong here. The Kings’ Fund report concludes with a summary of recommendations about the development of STP’s nationally. Several ring very true for the capital. They include: Involvement in the STP process should be strengthened at all levels within the health and care system, particularly among clinicians, frontline staff and local authorities. Meaningful involvement of patients and the public in the plans has not happened so far and must now be a priority. National bodies in the NHS should ‘stress-test’ STPs to ensure that the assumptions underpinning them are credible and the changes they describe can be delivered. Realism is needed about what can be achieved within the timescales and funding available. Honesty is needed in communicating these messages to politicians and the public.

2016-11-14T17:51:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Britons with no passport struggling to rent due to immigration checks,"British citizens without a passport are finding it harder to rent accommodation since the introduction of immigration checks on new tenants. Forty-three per cent of private landlords said they were less likely to rent to people who cannot produce a British passport because they feared criminal sanctions if they were tricked by false documents, a survey has shown. This means that the 17% of UK residents who do not have a passport could be wrongly denied access to privately rented accommodation. Nearly two-thirds of private landlords said they were also less likely to rent to migrants who are legally in Britain, but only have permission to stay for a limited period, while 56% said they were less likely to rent to someone from outside Europe.
The survey by the Residential Landlords Association (RLA), which represents landlords in England and Wales, was carried out to assess the impact of the right to rent scheme introduced across England by the Home Office in February, as part of a drive to “create a hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in the UK. The scheme has yet to be introduced in Scotland or Wales. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford has reported that foreign-born residents were almost three times more likely than Britons to live in the private rented sector. Landlords who fail to check that potential tenants have the right to be in Britain face a fine of up to £3,000. From next month, landlords who knowingly rent to people without permission to be in the UK will face a prison sentence. The survey results were based on interviews with 810 landlords, 507 of whom had carried out a right to rent check in the past six months. Two-thirds of those polled said they were worried they would make a mistake or be caught out by forged documents, and be unfairly fined. Only 13% said they had found a Home Office advice line helpful. Dave Smith, the RLA policy director, said: “These survey findings confirm our fears. Those who cannot easily prove their right to live in the UK, whether they are British or not, are finding it harder to access homes to rent. This is particularly concerning for those UK nationals without a passport, many of them the most vulnerable in society. “Landlords are quite reasonably becoming ultra cautious to avoid tough criminal sanctions and need reassurance that they will not be punished when they get fooled by false documents. They are not trained immigration officers.” Smith called for clarity about the status of EU nationals living in Britain to prevent landlords from becoming nervous about continuing to rent to them if their legal position changes. The RLA also wants to see clear guidance from the director of public prosecutions that landlords who try to do the right thing but are caught by forged documents will not face sanctions. The Home Office said landlords were not being asked to be immigration officers. They said they recognised that not all British citizens hold passports and a range of documents were accepted to satisfy the simple checks. The immigration minister Robert Goodwill said: “We are working to deliver an immigration system which is fair to those here legally and firm with those who try to break the rules. Following a pilot of the Right to Rent scheme, we have fully involved landlords and tenants ahead of its national roll out. “We have made crystal clear that landlords will only be prosecuted if they knowingly rent to illegal migrants and that we will not criminalise those who have simply made a mistake or been misled by forged documents,” he added."
2016-11-14T18:16:30Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jo Cox killed in 'brutal, cowardly' and politically motivated murder, trial hears","The Labour MP Jo Cox was repeatedly shot and stabbed in a “brutal, cowardly” and politically motivated murder, the trial of the man accused of the killing was told on Monday. Thomas Mair uttered the words “Britain first” and “keep Britain independent” as he carried out the attack, Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey. The killer struck as Cox went about her business in her Yorkshire constituency during the European referendum campaign, in which she had supported the campaign to remain in the EU. Her final moments – in an assault described by the prosecution as “dynamic, fast-moving and shocking” – were captured by closed circuit television cameras. “It was a cowardly attack by a man armed with a firearm and a knife,” Whittam told the jury. “It was a premeditated murder for a political and/or ideological cause.” Mair is charged with Cox’s murder ‪on 16 June‬, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and and grievous bodily harm to a second victim, the passerby Bernard Carter Kenny. The 53-year-old unemployed gardener declined to enter a plea when he appeared at the Old Bailey last month. As a consequence, not guilty pleas to all four charges were entered on his behalf.
Mair is alleged to have accessed a string of internet sites about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen-SS, Israel, matricide and serial killers in the days before Cox was killed. Items later recovered from his home showed he had “strong political and ideological interests”, Whittam told the court. The jury was told that Mair struck as Cox was on her way to a meeting with voters at the library in his home town, Birstall. The town lies within Batley and Spen, the West Yorkshire constituency to which she had been elected in the 2015 general election. Cox was 41 when she died, and had two children, then aged five and three. Members of her family, including her parents, Jean and Gordon Leadbetter, and her sister Kim, were in court as Mair’s trial began. Wearing a black tie and dark suit, Mair sat making notes as the prosecution began to outline its case. The jury was told that the day before Cox was killed, the defendant had gone to the library in Birstall, where he had used a computer to access a number of items, including the Wikipedia page for an online publication called the Occidental Observer. The page states that it is a far-right publication with a white nationalist and antisemitic perspective, and which is concerned with matters such as white identity and western culture, Whittam said. Two days earlier, at the same library, Mair had viewed Cox’s Twitter feed, the court heard. He had also looked at the Wikipedia entry for Ian Gow, the Conservative MP murdered by the IRA in 1990, and material about the former foreign secretary William Hague, another Yorkshire politician. Like Cox, Hague supported the campaign to remain in the EU. The jury heard that Mair also viewed pages about .22 ammunition, including one that offered an answer to the question: “Is a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human’s head?” The court was told that the following day, ‪14 June‬, Mair viewed online material about Nazis, the death penalty in Japan and serial killers. The jury was shown a series of closed circuit television clips from Birstall, which showed Mair carrying a bag through the town on the day that Cox was killed. He could be seen to be “hovering around” outside the library before Cox arrived with her constituency manager, Fazila Aswat, and case-worker Sandra Major. As the judge and jury watched CCTV footage of the actual attack, Mair sat staring straight ahead, ignoring the screens around the court on which it appeared. Aswat saw Mair approach Cox from behind, stab and then shoot her, then stab both Cox and Carter Kenny, who had attempted to intervene, Whittam said. Then she saw Mair shoot Cox again. During the attack, Aswat could hear Mair saying: “Britain first, this is for Britain, Britain will always come first.”
Cox was shot twice in the head and once in the chest. “She had what the pathologists describe as ‘through and through’ gunshot injuries to her hands, consistent with her hands being used to protect herself,” Whittam said. She also suffered 15 stab wounds to her heart, lungs, abdomen and right arm. Emergency services arrived within minutes and an emergency operation was conducted at the scene, but Cox could not be saved. Carter Kenny, 77, a former miner, survived after surgery. There were many witnesses, Whittam said. Rashid Hussain, a taxi driver, was dropping off a fare. He challenged Mair, demanding that he leave her alone, but was warned: “You just go away, otherwise I’m going to stab you.” Hussain also alleges Mair said words to the effect of “Britain first”. Jack Foster saw Mair shoot Cox and shout: “Britain first”. Foster shouted: “Fucking leave her alone” but Mair fired a second shot. The court heard that Mair was arrested moments later, with a knife and a firearm in his bag. When the weapon was recovered, Mair declared: “I’m a political activist.” Whittam said: “There is no credible suggestion that she was not murdered. Jo Cox was murdered by being shot and stabbed. He did it. Thomas Mair held views that provided him with a motive – utterly misplaced of course – to kill her. The prosecution suggests that he killed her because she was an MP who did not share his views.” Members of the jury were told that they would not be permitted to serve if they were closely involved in the operation of Oxfam or Save The Children, two charities with which Cox was associated. The judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, also told them that the case “has attracted considerable public interest and publicity, and will continue to do so”, but that they should not conduct any research on the internet, and should avoid media reports of the trial. The case continues."
2016-11-14T18:17:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadomasochist found guilty of murdering London police officer,"A crystal meth user obsessed with Breaking Bad has been found guilty of murdering a police officer he invited to his flat for sex and drugs. Stefano Brizzi, 50, strangled Gordon Semple, 59, and dissolved his body in acid in a bath, mirroring a method of disposal employed by Walter White, the lead character in the hit US TV series. Brizzi cooked other parts of the officer’s body, and possible bite marks were found on a rib, leading the prosecution to accuse him of cannibalism. Brizzi admitted dismembering and disposing of Semple’s body, but claimed that the officer, who served in the Metropolitan police for 30 years, died accidentally during a sex game after a dog leash around his neck slipped. On Monday, after more than 30 hours of deliberation, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted the Italian national of murder by a 10 to two majority.
Brizzi, a former web developer who lost his job at Morgan Stanley as a result of his crystal meth addiction, broke down a number of times during the trial as the prosecution detailed the gruesome nature of the allegations. He showed no emotion as the jury returned its verdict. DCS Peter Ayling said: “Fuelled by drugs, Stefano Brizzi murdered Gordon and then set about systemically disposing of his body, the detail of which is quite frankly distressing to read and hear. “The investigation has evidenced the sickening lengths that he went to [to] dismember Gordon and dispose of his remains, not just in the immediate aftermath of the murder, but over the days that followed, and amounts to cannibalism.” He said the officers who discovered their colleague’s body and those involved in the investigation had been affected by the traumatic nature of the case. Semple went to Brizzi’s flat in Southwark, south London, on 1 April after the pair made contact on the gay dating app Grindr. The officer, who was supposed to be on duty, messaged Brizzi to say he was “free now for [a] hot, dirty, sleazy session”. Both men regularly indulged in extreme sexual practices including domination, bondage and sexual asphyxiation, and used illegal drugs. That day, Brizzi was said to be tired and fractious because he had been engaged in heavy drug use, had not slept and had been let down by someone else on Grindr. He was also unhappy at Semple’s appearance, describing him as fat, ugly and unattractive.
Brizzi is believed to have killed the officer after the pair had sex. Four days later, he bought items including pincers, heavy-duty scissors, a putty knife, plastic buckets, carpet cleaner and a perforated metal sheet from a hardware store, using them to strip flesh from the corpse.Semple’s partner, Gary Meeks, made more than 20 unanswered calls to his mobile phone on 1 April and reported him missing the next morning after he failed to return home. But Semple’s body was not discovered until 7 April, when officers were called to Brizzi’s flat after neighbours complained about the smell. They found human remains in the bath and in plastic buckets on the floor. A pool of fat and grease was discovered inside Brizzi’s oven and the handle was bloodstained. Semple’s DNA was also recovered from the oven, a cooking pot and chopsticks found in the flat. Brizzi, who answered the door to officers wearing pink underpants, initially confessed to deliberately killing Semple, telling police at the scene: “Satan told me to.” But he later changed his account, claiming it was an accident. However, a pathologist concluded that while strangulation was a possible cause of death, it would have taken minutes, rather than the momentary slip of the leash described by Brizzi. In a statement, Semple, who was based in the Westminster antisocial behaviour team, was described by his family as “a loyal and much loved long-term partner, brother, brother-in-law, uncle, cousin and friend to all. “We were devastated when the news broke of Gordon’s murder and the circumstances, which are still incredibly hard to deal with. It is still insurmountably upsetting.” Malcolm McHaffie, a deputy chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service in London, said: “Stefano Brizzi is an evil and calculating man who intentionally killed Gordon Semple and then made gruesome attempts to dispose of his body.”"
2016-11-15T00:01:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK slowdown will give chancellor little scope for tax cuts, says PwC","A slowdown in the UK economy will hit tax receipts and leave the chancellor with little wriggle room for giveaways at next week’s autumn statement, a new report warns. Publishing new forecasts for GDP growth to slow next year as the Brexit vote bites, the consultancy firm PwC said Philip Hammond could afford some spending on big projects such as housing and roads if he changed the government’s fiscal rules. But he would not have the money for large net tax cuts and would probably keep a tight rein on spending by central and local government. Speaking ahead of the 23 November budget announcements, PwC chief economist John Hawksworth cautioned against hopes for an end to the spending restraint seen under Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne.
“It will not be ‘this is the end of austerity’. It will be austerity delayed rather than cancelled,” said Hawksworth, predicting the new chancellor would be fiscally prudent. He saw little reason for Hammond to make any bold moves given signs that households and businesses have largely shaken off the initial shock of the vote to leave the EU. “It doesn’t need to be any kind of emergency budget because there isn’t an emergency,” said Hawksworth. PwC now predicts GDP growth will be 1.2% in 2017, double the rate it forecast in July in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It expects growth this year will be 2.0%, which could prove to be the fastest rate in the G7 group of leading economies. The main factor behind next year’s slowdown would be businesses’ reticence to spend amid uncertainty about the UK’s future trading relationships, said Hawksworth. “But we expect Brexit to exert a long, slow drag on growth, rather than giving the economy a short, sharp shock,” he added. The consultancy echoes the Bank of England in forecasting that inflation will rise to around 2.7% by the end of 2017 as the effects of a weaker pound feed through to consumers, squeezing real spending power. Inflation has already picked up since the Brexit vote as the drop in sterling has raised import costs and sparked pricing tussles over household products such as Marmite. Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show inflation hit a two-year high of 1.1% last month, according to forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. That compares with 0.3% back in May, before the Brexit vote. The rise in inflation will accompany a weakening jobs market that means consumers could struggle to get pay rises to match their rising day-to-day costs, the report predicts. That will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending growth to 2.2% next year from 2.9% this year. PwC believes tax receipts will suffer from that slowdown and stamp duty could take a hit if housing market transactions ease. As a result, it warns public borrowing could significantly overshoot forecasts from the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), made before the referendum.
PwC projects a budget deficit – the gap between what the government spends and receives – of about £67bn this year, more than £10bn above the OBR forecast, and this would only fall to around £18bn by 2019/20 on unchanged fiscal policies, rather than moving into surplus as the OBR forecast in March. That forecast is similar to the £25bn overshoot predicted by respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The consultancy also used its outlook to assess the prospects for trade after the Brexit vote. Its economic adviser, Andrew Sentance, found there were clear risks to Britain’s trading position with the EU, but he also saw opportunities from the UK’s strength in services exports and its relatively robust performance in exporting to non-EU countries. Before the Brexit decision, PwC estimated EU markets’ share as a destination for UK exports of goods and services could fall from 44% now to around 37% by 2030 as trade shifted towards faster growing emerging markets. If the UK faces additional barriers to accessing EU markets post-Brexit, then this share could drop more quickly to as low as 30% by 2030, Sentance said. With those non-EU markets looking more attractive, he called on trade minister Liam Fox and his department to provide extra support for companies looking to export there. “There’s been a lot of talk from that department about new trade deals but there’s a lot more practically that can be done ... Over the coming years we’d get more bang for our buck on trade promotion.”"
2016-11-15T00:01:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Dilapidated military bases 'putting UK armed forces readiness at risk',"The operational readiness of the UK’s armed forces is at risk because the country’s military bases and infrastructure have become too dilapidated to use effectively, Whitehall’s independent auditor has found. The National Audit Office has examined properties and land controlled by the Ministry of Defence, which cover nearly 2% of the UK’s landmass, and found that they need £8.5bn of investment so that they can be used efficiently to react to any military threats. “There is a significant risk that the poor condition of the estate will affect the department’s ability to provide the defence capability needed,” the NAO report, published on Tuesday, said. “As the estate’s condition deteriorates, some parts may wholly or partially close. This will exacerbate other risks and could reduce operational readiness.” Financial pressures have meant that since 2009, the MoD has been forced to abandon its programme of improvement works, auditors explained. This has reduced service levels to those needed to keep the estate “safe and legal”, resulting in a “general deterioration” in the overall condition. Auditors said the extent of the deterioration could now jeopardise the delivery of new and existing military capabilities. Problems include a lack of funding at Portsmouth naval base, which could threaten the ability of the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers to operate. Cables that are supposed to provide energy to the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales – the largest ships to be built for the Royal Navy – have not been replaced, the report disclosed. “This may jeopardise the carriers’ ability to operate. For example, the cables that supply power to the base and carriers are more than 80 years old. They need replacing, but there is no funding available to do this,” it said. The report also found that the army’s main vehicle support and storage site at Ashworth in Gloucestershire lacked the capability to keep vehicles at high levels of readiness for deployments. Fuelling facilities at RAF Brize Norton also had to be shut down for safety reasons and a temporary facility installed because of lack of maintenance, auditors said. Meanwhile, a failure to fix a leaking roof at the medical centre at RAF Valley in Anglesey caused the building to deteriorate so badly that it had to be demolished, they added. Auditors concluded that the overall model for managing the estate had failed, and indicated that the Capita, the outsourcing firm contracted to manage the estate, was in part to blame for its failures. They criticised Capita for failing to manage the estate after being given a £90m contract by the then defence secretary Philip Hammond. Hammond signed a 10-year contract with Capita in 2014 to run the defence infrastructure programme (DIO), despite widespread criticism of a contract with thefirm to deliver the IT systems some months earlier. However, auditors said there had been “fundamental weaknesses” in the contracting process and that Capita had not “performed adequately against agreed key performance indicators”. “Although there have been some improvements, the strategic business partner’s performance has not met all expectations and has not made a notable difference in transforming DIO to better meet the needs of the commands,” the report said. The government spends £4.8bn on the estate, which – at 424,000 hectares – accounts for 1.8% of the total UK land mass. Nia Griffith MP, the shadow defence secretary, said the report paints a “shocking picture” of mismanagement and underinvestment. “Amongst the most alarming findings is that a failure to invest in the estate may jeopardise the ability of the UK’s two new aircraft carriers to operate. “This represents an outrageous failure to plan for the future, and the government must urgently ensure that it makes funds available so that these carriers can enter service without delay,” she said. Responding to the report, an MoD spokesperson said it was aiming to deliver a better defence estate. “That’s why we’ve outlined a long-term, military-led strategy, to invest £4bn in training facilities fit for our strong and modern armed forces and better accommodation to deliver more stability for military families,” he said. A Royal Navy spokesman said of fears about the operational capabilities of aircraft carriers: “Portsmouth naval base will be ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2017. The power delivery infrastructure required to support the arrival of the aircraft carrier has been fully assessed and, where necessary, upgraded.”"
2016-11-15T00:01:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour to call on chancellor not to extend austerity beyond 2020,"Labour is to call on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, not to extend austerity beyond 2020 in the autumn statement later this month in order to soften the blow of welfare cuts. In a speech setting out Labour’s priorities ahead of Hammond’s first financial statement, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say continuing with austerity over a longer period would further undermine the government’s reputation after a succession of missed deficit targets. McDonnell will say the Treasury should scrap planned reductions to universal credit and other benefits to protect low and middle-income families from rising inflation and slowing wage growth. “Next week we will see a Tory chancellor admit that he has not met any of the targets in the 2010 Conservative party manifesto. There’s been a change of rhetoric, but the priorities remain the same,” he will say. Accusing Hammond of being a weak and isolated member of the cabinet with little power to reverse divisive economic policies, McDonnell will say: “The tax giveaways to the wealthy remain. Just as the cuts to the poor and the vulnerable remain.” Labour would increase public investment spending and pay for much of this with higher taxes on the wealthy, he will say. In addition, McDonnell is to say he would provide “secure and properly funded support for our public services, providing the necessary funding needed for the NHS and social care”. The Treasury minister David Gauke said Labour had “zero credibility when it comes to the economy” and only offered a “recipe for economic ruin. Ordinary working people would pay the price for Jeremy Corbyn’s fantasy economics”. The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to provide a downbeat prediction for economic growth and government finances next year in its biannual healthcheck, leaving Hammond to impose deeper spending cuts, delay austerity or borrow more to balance the books. It is understood that the chancellor has rejected further cuts to reduce the deficit and will focus on longer-term business tax reforms and small-scale investments to offset the worst side-effects of faltering growth. But McDonnell will say the government’s “shambolic approach to Brexit” was in danger of infecting its handling of the economy, at a time when gloomy forecasts about the UK’s growth prospects for next year showed Britain badly needed higher public investment spending. “They have the wrong ambitions for our economy, and the wrong ambitions for Brexit, which means they will continue to undermine the ambitions of working people,” he will say. “It also means we will be left with a Brexit that works only for bankers and the rich, instead of one that’s based on fairness and works for the rest of us.”"
2016-11-15T06:00:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Move to new UK inflation measure sparks controversy,"In the midst of all the market turmoil following Donald Trump’s US election victory last week, the UK’s Office for National Statistics announced an important change in how it publishes inflation numbers – and not everyone is happy. From March next year, statisticians will drop their focus on the consumer prices index (CPI) in favour of CPIH, which seeks to measure the housing costs of owner-occupiers. The reason this gets economists hot under the collar is that inflation rates are used to calculate everything from pension payouts and wage deals to rail fare rises.
News of the change comes after a rise in inflation the wake of the Brexit vote, stoked by the sharp drop in the pound. As import costs rise and price tussles over household goods like Marmite and Typhoo tea grab the headlines, economists and the Bank of England are warning households to prepare for further increases in inflation, which measures the pace of change in the cost of goods and services. The latest CPI figure, out on Tuesday, is expected to put inflation at a two-year high of 1.1%. That backdrop has added to concerns of those who believe CPIH is lacking as a measure. It lost its status as a “national statistic” in 2014 and has yet to regain it. One of those voicing worries about CPIH is former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance. He sits on the National Statistician’s stakeholder advisory panel on consumer prices but says he was caught out by last week’s announcement. “My understanding was if there was going to be a change it would take place more gradually,” said Sentance, now a senior economics adviser at PwC. “Not everyone is convinced that CPIH is the right measure and yet the ONS are pressing ahead with it on quite an accelerated time scale.” Sentance says other economists share his concern that CPIH, by using figures based on rents, does not truthfully capture people’s experience of the housing market. Another economist opposed to the change is Shaun Richards, who specialises in inflation measurement. He believes the mood on statistics forums online and off has turned against CPIH. “I was against this from the beginning ... now at discussions on this noone speaks against me. The consensus has swung against CPIH,” he says. On Monday the UK Statistics Authority, which gives out the national statistic designation, said that its regulatory team was continuing to review evidence provided by the ONS, and to speak with users of inflation statistics and that any decision would be based on the degree to which CPIH met standards of “trustworthiness, quality and value, expected by users”. Jill Leyland, a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, is another economist worried that the ONS is shifting its focus to CPIH and not providing the general public with a measure that reflects their experience of inflation – something the retail prices index (RPI) was previously seen to do, although it has also faced criticism for overstating inflation and the way it includes housing costs. “We are concerned about some ongoing issues with this measure, which were reflected in its de-designation as a national statistic,” said Leyland. “CPIH, which as a derivative of CPI was primarily designed for macroeconomic purposes, does not give the public a price index which measures the actual impact of inflation on households to replace RPI.” Sentance feels there is confusion around the UK’s use of different inflation measures for different purposes – the UK still uses the RPI for inflation-linked bonds, for example, but CPI is used to set an inflation target for the Bank of England. “We seem to be getting ourselves into quite a muddle about which measure of inflation we should focus on,” said Sentance. But the ONS deputy national statistician responds that it is precisely this “alphabet soup” of inflation measures that supports its move to announce a move to focussing on CPIH. “From our point of view we want to signal what we think is the best measure,” said Jonathan Athow. He also rebuffed suggestions the change had been sprung on people and defended the quality of the figures, which took in hundreds of thousands of rental prices. The ONS had been consulting on CPIH for several years, he said. He also defended the measure as reflecting housing costs, without being clouded by changes in house prices – something that would reflect asset prices not goods and services prices. Athow said CPIH was asking: “What’s the service you are getting from your home in terms of being able to live there.” “We are certainly not alone in using this among statistics offices around the world. We think it’s the best measure,” he added. Economist and former BoE policymaker Kate Barker agrees. She chairs the advisory panel on which Sentance sits. “I’ve listened hard to everyone’s views and I support moving things on,” she said on Monday, backing the move to CPIH as something that offers an alternative to RPI and all its shortcomings."
2016-11-15T06:00:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Delayed route plan for HS2 second phase to be unveiled,"The route for the second phase of HS2 is due to be confirmed on Tuesday, with communities in the north of England ready to discover how the high-speed rail network will affect them. Up to seven significant alterations to the original route are expected to be put out for further consultation, and they are likely to provoke outcry in affected areas. The government is committed to pressing ahead with the broad Y-shaped route to Leeds and Manchester, which it claims will provide up to three times as many intercity train seats and free up more space on existing lines for commuter services.
According to the Department for Transport (DfT), there will be almost 15,000 seats per hour on trains between London and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, compared with 5,000 now. A proposed route was first published in 2013 for the northern half of HS2, but a review of the programme and debate over the location of stations, especially around Sheffield, means detailed plans have been delayed by almost two years from the original schedule. However, DfT still says it expects the £55bn scheme to be fully operational by 2033. The hybrid bill to secure the first phase of building HS2, between London and Birmingham, is expected to pass through parliament this autumn, allowing work to commence next year. Legislation for the rest of the route is expected to be introduced in 2019. A “Phase 2a” would build the line as far as Crewe for service in 2027. There is widespread support for the second phase in northern cities, who have been keen to secure transport links. Much of the opposition to HS2 has so far been focused in the Chilterns, where construction will bring no benefit to those affected. However, the detailed route is likely to turn more communities to opposition. After a revision was made in July to the high-speed track’s path through the East Midlands, with a branch to Sheffield, residents on a newly built estate were told they faced compulsory purchase of their homes for demolition."
2016-11-15T07:00:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Jenny Jones calls for IPCC to investigate alleged destruction of her police files,"A Green peer has called on the police watchdog to investigate claims that a secretive Scotland Yard intelligence unit improperly destroyed files it had compiled on her. Jenny Jones has written to the Independent Police Complaints Commission asking for an inquiry into what she says appears to be “serious misconduct”. Her call follows claims by a whistleblower who worked for the Metropolitan police intelligence unit tasked with spying on alleged extremists. Sgt David Williams alleged that the unit – which has been compiling records on thousands of political campaigners – destroyed the files to prevent Lady Jones from finding out the scale of the police’s monitoring of her political movements. His claims of what he called a “highly irregular” cover-up were disclosed by the Guardian in January. As a London councillor, Jones, a former candidate for the capital’s mayor, had been the deputy chair of the official committee that oversaw Scotland Yard. In a letter to the IPCC, lawyers from Bindmans, who represent Jones, have complained of alleged misconduct by officers who, according to the whistleblower, shredded or deleted police records relating to her.
She said: “This appears to be an example of gross misconduct by the police officers who not only monitored an elected politician who was part of a body overseeing the police, but then allegedly tried to destroy the evidence.” She said an IPCC inquiry was needed as she believed the Met failed to investigate the whistleblower’s allegations properly. Last year, Williams outlined his claims in a four-page letter to the peer, saying he had not become a police officer to monitor politicians. In his letter, he claimed that in June 2014, he witnessed three officers shredding more than 30 reports relating to Jones, and two other officers deleting records from a police database. Soon afterwards, he reported his concerns to the Met department responsible for looking at alleged misconduct. It concluded there had been no wrongdoing. The Met has said there was evidence that documents had been destroyed on the day alleged by Williams but the force could not establish if they related to Jones. According to the force, documents were destroyed as a part of a legitimate programme to improve record-keeping. The Met has said the unit had been told to regularly remove data that was “either too old, inappropriate or irrelevant” following criticisms that too much information was being held.
The unit monitors protesters as it says some of them may commit crime to further their cause or have already done so. But it has been criticised for keeping files on protesters, such as Jones, who have no criminal record. The unit has been revealed to have monitored leading members of the Green party, including the MP Caroline Lucas. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the judge-led public inquiry into the undercover infiltration of political groups since 1968 has been examining the alleged destruction of records about Jones. The inquiry – led by Lord Justice Pitchford – has formally asked the Met to submit evidence about the alleged destruction. The existence of the request was disclosed in an official statement sent to the inquiry by Scotland Yard officer DS Neil Hutchison, who added that if the allegation was substantiated, “this may lead to criminal or misconduct proceedings”. The public inquiry was set up in 2014 by Theresa May when she was home secretary following revelations of misconduct by the undercover officers sent to infiltrate political groups. It is expected to start its substantive hearings next year. • If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here and here)."
2016-11-15T07:48:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Delayed HS2 second-phase route unveiled,"The preferred route for the second phase of HS2 has been published, setting out exactly where the government will build the high-speed rail network through the north of England – although a controversial decision on how to run the line to Sheffield has been delayed once again. Seven significant alterations to the original route are being put out for further consultation, with some likely to provoke outcry in affected areas. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said he “felt desperately sorry” for those residents affected, who he said would be “treated with fairness, compassion and respect”. Compensation measures would apply immediately, including a premium on compulsory purchases and moving costs.
The government is committed to pressing ahead with the broad Y-shaped route to Leeds and Manchester, which it claims will provide up to three times as many intercity train seats as now and free more space on existing lines for commuter services. Grayling said: “Our railways owe much to the Victorian engineers who pioneered them, but we cannot rest on their legacy when we face overcrowding and capacity problems. “HS2 is an ambitious and exciting project and the government is seizing the opportunity it offers to build a transport network fit for the 21st century; one that works for all and makes clear to the world that Britain remains open for business.” According to the Department for Transport, there will be almost 15,000 seats an hour on trains between London and the cities of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, compared with 5,000 now. A proposed route was first published in 2013 for the northern half of HS2, but a review of the programme and debate over the location of stations, especially around Sheffield, means detailed plans have been delayed by almost two years. The revised proposal for Sheffield is expected to cost almost £1bn less than the original plan, although there has been no alteration to HS2’s overall £55.7bn budget. The bill to secure the first phase of building HS2, between London and Birmingham, is expected to pass through parliament this autumn, allowing work to start next year.
Legislation for the rest of the route is expected to be introduced in 2019. A “phase 2a” would see the line built as far as Crewe for service in 2027. There is widespread support for the second phase in northern cities, which have been keen to secure improved transport links. Much of the opposition to HS2 has so far been focused in the Chilterns, where construction will bring no benefit to those affected. However, the publication of the detailed route could see new communities threatened. After a revision was made in July to the line’s path through the east Midlands, with a branch to Sheffield, residents on a new estate were told they faced the compulsory purchase of their homes for demolition. Residents in more than 4,000 homes in rural areas along the second phase will now be eligible for compensation, while a total of 580 homes will be demolished in work north of Birmingham. Among the seven changes to have gone out for further consultation are moving a new depot to Crewe, altering the site of a tunnel in southern Manchester, changing the route in Cheshire and Leicestershire, and no longer tunnelling under East Midlands airport. Letters were being hand-delivered by HS2 Ltd on Tuesday to people newly affected by the revised route, predominantly in Nottinghamshire, where the site of a station in Toton has also been adjusted. The government confirmed that a new HS2 station would be built next to Manchester Piccadilly, with a stop at Manchester airport. But questions remained over the airport station’s development, which the government said would only be agreed with local funding. Manchester airport insisted that the station’s costs should be met in the same way as those of others on the route. A further report detailing how HS2 will be integrated with the existing rail network and future plans for “northern powerhouse rail” - a name that now appears to have supplanted what was referred to as HS3, linking northern cities via the Pennines – is not due until next year. Campaigners warned that this would be crucial to HS2’s success. Ralph Smyth, head of infrastructure at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “HS2 will simply fail to live up to its promises if it is not integrated with wider upgrades to the rail network.” He added: “Parkway stations plonked in the green belt, like that proposed a mile away from Manchester airport, would create gridlock rather than faster journeys.” Penny Gaines, the chair of Stop HS2, said: “The government is proposing spending £56bn or more on a railway line most people don’t want and that won’t benefit the economies of the Midlands and the north. “Anywhere where there are gaps in the line is continued uncertainty for people affected. Phase two was announced in early 2013, and these people have been living in limbo for nearly four years.” Grayling said the government had been clear about its preferred option for a branch to Sheffield city centre but its decision still needed to go through the proper consultation process. The revised route would see fewer home demolitions and save almost £1bn. “Clearly we have to treat people in the right way. Of course if you are building a system that will transform the capacity of our transport system and create new opportunities for our freight trains and commuter services on our existing network, of course some people are going to be affected,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We want to do the right thing by those people but of course it’s not possible to make the kind of investment we need in the future of our transport system without some impact on people.”
The government has said that HS2 would create about 25,000 jobs during construction, as well as 2,000 apprenticeships, and support wider economic growth equating to 100,000 jobs. The Trades Union Congress said it would be a “much-needed shot in the arm for the British economy”. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “Today’s announcement is not only good news for rail workers, but for companies throughout the UK supply chain too. Britain’s steel workers stand ready to provide the steel needed for HS2 – all they need is for the government to commit to buying British.” But residents in the path of the network expressed fury and dismay. On the threatened Shimmer estate in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, homeowners demanded that HS2 bosses came in person to see what it would mean for them. Russell Holmes, who lives on the estate, told the BBC: “It may be a new estate but it’s a proper community. For that to be destroyed is devastating. But the uncertainty, waiting until it happens, when you can actually put something in place to move, is horrible as well.” Sandra Haith told the BBC the nearby village of Bramley was also affected. Around 70 houses were in the safeguarding area, which could be purchased for HS2. Her son’s home was not eligible for compensation, she said, but “there will be trains at the bottom of the garden, and no one will want to buy [the houses].” The exact route will be decided next year after the consultations, although parliament will not ratify those decisions until 2019."
2016-11-15T13:44:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Schoolboy dies after falling ill in detention at east London school,"Police are investigating the death of a 14-year-old boy who was taken to hospital after falling ill at school. Nasar Ahmed, a year nine pupil at Bow school in east London, had severe asthma and became unwell while he was in detention on Thursday. He was taken to hospital but died on Monday afternoon. Tower Hamlets council said he was supervised at all times during the detention in a ground-floor room, adding that staff were aware he had asthma and had a “care plan” in place. The boy’s uncle told the BBC he had been in detention with his friends after lunch. He said Nasar complained he felt ill and asked to get his inhaler. The school then called an ambulance and his nephew was taken to Royal London hospital. The school’s executive headteacher, Cath Smith, said: “The whole school community sends our thoughts and prayers to him, and to his family. We will continue to offer support to the family, his fellow pupils and teachers at this very difficult time. “We will, of course, cooperate fully with investigations into the circumstances of this tragic incident and will also carry out a thorough review of what happened ourselves.” A Metropolitan police spokeswoman said: “The death is being treated as unexplained at this time.” She said a postmortem examination would be carried out."
2016-11-15T13:48:33Z,uk-news,UK news,More than 7m Britons now in precarious employment,"The number of workers in the UK in precarious positions where they could lose their jobs at short or no notice has grown by almost 2 million in the past decade, as businesses insist on using more self-employed workers and increasingly recruit staff on temporary and zero-hours contracts, analysis for the Guardian has revealed.
More than one in five workers, some 7.1 million people, now face precarious employment conditions that mean they could lose their work suddenly – up from 5.3 million in 2006, according to analysis of official figures conducted by John Philpott, a leading labour market economist. Half of the biggest group – the self-employed – are in low pay and take home less than two-thirds of the median earnings, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Two million self-employed people now earn below £8 per hour. The extent of the precarious work phenomenon emerges as a Downing Street-commissioned inquiry into modern employment practices gears up. Amid growing concern about the social impact of a workforce increasingly divided between low-paid, low-skilled and insecure work and higher-paid, higher-skilled employment, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles on the consequences of the change for the kind of workers described by Theresa May as “just managing”. The government is concerned that the lack of training offered in precarious work, particularly in self-employment, is “completely backward”, according to a No 10 source. The fear is that it entrenches low pay and hinders career progression to higher earnings.
Meanwhile, 750,000 more people are on zero-hours contracts than in 2006, and 207,000 more people are working as temps, according to Philpott’s analysis of the government’s labour force survey. Some of the zero hours workers may also be included in the temp count – 32% in the most recent set of figures. “There is something profound going on and all of this poses a potential risk to social cohesion and a risk to the potential for social mobility,” Alan Milburn, the chairman of the government’s commission into social mobility, told a recent event on precarious working. The issue has also been prioritised at the Trades Union Congress, which has launched a review of the scale and nature of vulnerable work in Britain. Companies such as Argos and Tesco use thousands of agency temps. Sainsbury is now using 54 different employment agencies for its temporary warehouse workers. The taxi company Uber and courier firms Hermes and Yodel are among firms relying on 4.7 million “self-employed” workers, although Uber recently lost a landmark employment tribunal case when judges ruled that its self-employed drivers should be treated as workers and paid the “national minimum wage”, enjoy paid holidays and get sick pay.
Anxiety about low pay is running so high that more than 10,000 people called the Acas minimum wage helpline in the five months to September concerned they were not receiving the statutory minimum – a 73% increase on the same period last year, according to figures released to the Guardian. The UK currently has a greater proportion of full-time employees in low pay than all but seven of the 22 developed nations in the OECD. “The rise in self-employment has been hailed as part of the economy’s success story in the recovery, but for thousands of people it can mask some worrying trends – namely being forced into precarious, low-paid work,” said Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. He pointed out that self-employed families were more likely to live in poverty, with a median income of £209 a week against £384 for employees.
Vulnerable work does not always mean poor pay and conditions, but while many workers choose self-employment or temporary contracts, earnings on average are much lower. Self-employed workers typically earn about half the wage of permanent employees, zero-hours contractors about 40% and temp workers around two-thirds, Philpott said in his analysis for the Guardian, although this is complicated by the variability of hours worked.
The impact of the changes to pay is not spread evenly across the UK. An estimated one in four of all workers in the Greater Lincolnshire area, for example, is forecast to be earning near or below the national living wage or the national minimum wage by 2020 – an increase from one in 10 in 2015, according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation. Other areas badly affected include London, Nottingham, Liverpool and the Tees valley.
The human impact of the phenomenon is also becoming clear. Last year, a review of studies around the world published in the BMC Public Health journal concluded that job insecurity posed a comparable threat to health as unemployment – and that anticipating a job loss could actually have a more significant effect than experiencing it. Young adults have been hit hardest by the long-term trend. The proportion of working 16- to 20-year-olds in low pay rose from 58% in 1990 to 77% in 2015, while the proportion aged 21 to 25 rose from 22% to 40%, according to Resolution Foundation analysis. Older workers have become less likely to endure low pay. The attractions of flexible or insecure contracts are considerable to employers and they dispute many of the downsides that unions, workers and analysts have highlighted. Deliveroo is a multinational company that relies on 8,000 self-employed workers in the UK to deliver takeaway meals by bicycle. By contrast, in the Netherlands and Germany it directly employs 1,500 couriers, which might suggest that its business model, in those countries at least, is not reliant on self-employment. Lawyers for several Deliveroo riders in the UK are at the early stages of considering making a claim against the company for false self-employment, something Deliveroo denies. But Deliveroo describes its riders as “independent suppliers” and in a statement a spokesman said this status was because “the flexibility this offers is important to them”. It is not just insurgent tech companies that use large numbers of non-staff workers to deliver their core services. Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, said between 35% and 40% of its warehouse workers – some 6,000 – are provided by agencies.
For many of our biggest brands, employment arrangements resemble a Russian doll. Amazon relies on thousands of self-employed workers to deliver its parcels and subcontracts to companies such as Hermes and Yodel, which subcontract to thousands more couriers themselves. For warehouse workers who are not directly employed, Sainsbury uses a similar multilayered arrangement. It has a contract with De Poel, an agency services provider, which in turn manages contracts with employment agencies, which then hire staff. Sainsbury says the vast majority of these workers have full-time contracts but some drivers are on limited-hours contracts, something the retailer says it is monitoring with the agencies.
“Like all large retailers, working with agencies allows our distribution network to accommodate business needs – Christmas being the obvious example,” a spokesperson said. That argument about fluctuating demand is a powerful one for many companies. “One of the attractions of flexible contract options for businesses is being able to meet more volatile demand patterns in increasingly 24/7 markets,” said Neil Carberry, director for people and skills at the Confederation of British Industry. Nonetheless, he insists that the trend is not significant. “There have been claims that the mass casualisation of the British labour market is around the corner for 30 years. But the need to retain talent and build productivity in companies mean that directly employed staff will always be the majority of our labour market.” “No form of contract is inherently problematic,” he added. “It is about how companies deal with their staff … The key thing is good management, and businesses are committed to doing that well.” Some of the 7.2 million workers now in precarious employment might disagree that is always the case. ‘If it was a slow month I would be worried’ Norma, a mother of three from Rotherham, has been juggling three self-employed jobs to try to make ends meet. She worked six days a week delivering parcels for Yodel, which earned her between £400 and £800 a month before paying her car expenses; she delivered 500 newspapers a week for Whistl, earning about £25 a week; and she ran her own small online business selling cross-stitch craft kits she assembled in her conservatory. “It was a fine balancing act for the family,” she said. “I never knew how much money was going to be in the bank. If it was a slow month I would be worried about finding extra work from somewhere. I couldn’t make the money I needed in the time I’d got.”
Yaseen Aslam, a former Uber driver, is also self-employed – but succeeded along with another driver in challenging that status at a recent employment tribunal. . “When I first started minicab driving eight years ago, I used to do 30 hours a week and took home £500 after expenses,” said Aslam, a 35-year-old married father of three from High Wycombe. “I was self-employed and I felt self-employed. Over time we have lost control of what we were making. There were lots of advance bookings but with technology things changed. We have no sense of what we were going to be making, the prices fell and more drivers came on to the streets. I was getting between £50 and £100 per day before expenses, which was much less. I didn’t have any quality family time and I was busy working all the time just to pay my bills.” He has found another form of self-employment, again enabled by the internet: trading merchandise on eBay from his home."
2016-11-15T15:07:41Z,uk-news,UK news,South Yorkshire estate in the path of HS2 faces more uncertainty,"After four months of waiting, residents of the newly built Shimmer housing estate in Mexborough are facing yet more uncertainty about the fate of their new homes. In July, 400 residents received a letter from HS2 Ltd informing them that the government would need to acquire “some or all” of their properties if proposals for the high speed rail route through South Yorkshire were approved. While the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said on Tuesday that a route passing through the estate was the preferred option, he launched a public consultation that will also look at alternatives.
“It’s a bit of an anticlimax,” said Rachel Ridler, 29, who moved with her young family into a four-bedroom home overlooking a canal nearly three years ago. Her children are one and three years old, and she had hoped they would grow up in the house. The government also announced on Tuesday that the estate would be in the safeguarding area, which means residents can start applying for compensation. “I know there are people on the estate who were trying to sell and want to go because they don’t like the uncertainty, so it’s good news for them,” said Ridler. “But I love this community and I want to stay, so for us it’s just more uncertainty, turmoil and waiting.” The £30m estate of 212 family homes has been under construction since 2011 and was expected to be finished in June 2017. By July, 166 houses had been sold or were occupied. Another 46 were to be finished, and 23 of those had been reserved by buyers. Rachel’s nextdoor neighbours, Sue and Peter Douglas, who are 65 and 62, moved into their four-bedroom house on the Shimmer estate nearly three years ago. They spent £20,000 making it suitable for them to grow old in. Sue Douglas said: “What’s angered us is that we get a call from the media last night to tell us this whereas we don’t get a letter from the government. They don’t have the politeness to actually write to us all individually and explain the situation.”
Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday morning that affected residents would be given enough compensation to buy a similar house in the area. But Sue said: “Well, I’d like Chris Grayling to come and show me where they are because I certainly don’t know of any.”
Kirsty Holland, 23, moved in to her four-bedroom house with her boyfriend 12 days before she received the letter from HS2 in July. “The house has three spare bedrooms and we had all these plans – like my dad was going to move in and we were going to have kids,” she said. Holland said when she moved in she felt like she had hit the jackpot. “We’ve got neighbours on either side that we love and everybody gets along,” she said. “It’s a shame because it was going to be beautiful. It’s such a nice setting with the canal right there and all the wildlife. “We’ve bought this house to be our lifelong home and now to find out that it might be ripped down is devastating, but what can you do?”"
2016-11-15T17:32:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Boy who hacked TalkTalk website was ‘showing off to mates’,"A 17-year-old boy who hacked into the broadband service provider TalkTalk and exposed its vulnerabilities has pleaded guilty to seven offences. Appearing at Norwich youth court on Tuesday, the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted he was “showing off to his mates” when he posted details of his success online. While he did not exploit the information for gain, the TalkTalk website was targeted more than 14,000 times after he initially broke through its security using a “hacking tool”, said Laura Tams, prosecuting. The youth was arrested in Norwich on 3 November last year and charged with breaching the Computer Misuse Act 1990 following an investigation by the Metropolitan police’s cybercrime unit. Sentencing has been adjourned until 13 December. Tams said police raided the teenager’s home after he was identified as having been involved in the TalkTalk breach. An iPhone, USB stick and Apple laptop were seized and analysed. They showed the teenager had been involved in attacks on other websites including those of Manchester University, Cambridge University and Merit Badges, a small family company that supplies martial arts badges. The prosecutor said the boy used software called SQLmap to identify vulnerabilities on websites.The “legitimate software” gave a legal disclaimer warning to users that it must only be used to identify vulnerabilities on websites with mutual consent, she said. In a Skype conversation on the day of the breach, the teenager told a friend he had “done enough to go to prison”. Chris Brown, in mitigation, said the teenager had not discovered the vulnerability and it had been discussed by other people before his breach. Hundreds of attempts were made by others, but the teenager’s attempt was successful. Brown said of the boy’s actions: “It’s inexplicable to the rest of us: why get in so much trouble for what’s bravado – to prove you can, to prove you’ve got the skills?” The teenager’s role, he added, was limited to “signposting”. The boy, who admitted he knew his actions were illegal, told magistrates: “I didn’t really think of the consequences at the time. I was just showing off to my mates.” The chair of the bench, Jean Bonnick, said magistrates were minded to spare the teenager prison but further reports were needed first. TalkTalk fell victim to what it described as a “significant and sustained” attack on its website on 21 October 2015, which resulted in the personal data of nearly 160,000 people being accessed. The Information Commissioner’s Office said that in 15,656 cases, bank account details and sort codes had been accessed. In May, the firm said the fallout from the cyber-attack had cost it £42m. A second teenager has been charged in a separate case over the alleged hack and data theft. Daniel Kelley, 19, of Heol Dinbych in Llanelli, faces eight charges of blackmail, four of computer hacking and two of fraud. He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday for a plea and trial preparation hearing. It is alleged that he hacked TalkTalk to get customer data and demanded a payment worth about £216,000 in bitcoins, an online currency. Prosecutors claim that he carried out similar attacks on other firms including an educational business in Australia in 2015."
2016-11-15T17:42:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"Fake doctor blackmailed three women with nude videos, court hears","A man pretended to be a successful doctor to impress women on a dating website, secretly filmed them naked and blackmailed them for thousands of pounds, a jury has heard. Farhan Mirza, 38, had a set of green hospital scrubs in his wardrobe and made a point of showing off his stethoscope, the court was told. Mirza, described by the prosecution as a “sexual and financial predator”, allegedly demanded thousands of pounds from three Muslim women, knowing they would be shamed if his videos were released. Timothy Evans, prosecuting, told Cardiff crown court on Tuesday: “He targeted these ladies because of their religion and their background. In his possession were videos of them which would cause terror, embarrassment and humiliation.” Evans said Mirza created a profile on the shaadi.com dating site in which he presented himself as a doctor of medicine. He promised to marry one woman and said he would buy her a ring worth £25,000. “He asked her for £4,500 to buy a motorbike as a wedding gift. She transferred him £3,500. When they split up she asked him for her money back but he refused. He later sent her a text threatening to send a video of her … to where she worked. He said he would make her famous.” Mirza allegedly told a second woman he was a “wealthy doctor”, but their relationship ended after a few months when she found out about his lies. The court heard he kept footage in which she was partially naked. She said she did not know she was being filmed. The two women were contacted by officers after an investigation involving a third woman who reported Mirza to the police. She said Mirza had threatened to send a video of them having sex to her family in Pakistan if she stopped giving him money after their breakup. He was also said to have stolen jewellery, clothes and a laptop from her home. Mirza, of Abertillery in south Wales, denies four counts of blackmail, three of voyeurism, one count of fraud and one count of theft. One of the alleged blackmail victims also told the jury Mirza drove a gold Mercedes. The woman said they met up for sex in secret, because “dating was not allowed” in her culture. She told the court: “He told me he was a doctor. He said the majority of his family were doctors as well. “He said they were all highly educated. There was a lot of airs and graces. We’d meet up for meals, coffees, the cinema. I would always have to pay for it. I did mention a few times he seemed stingy. I pointed it out, but it was water off a duck’s back. He didn’t care.” Andrew Taylor, defending, said to the woman: “Didn’t you find it surprising a highly qualified doctor was practising in Bristol but was living in a small house? I put it to you he never told you he was a doctor.” She replied: “He did. He had a stethoscope and green scrubs in his house. When we met one time he got out of his 4x4 gold Mercedes. When he got out of the car he made a point of getting the stethoscope out.” The trial continues."
2016-11-15T19:28:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Harvey Proctor considering legal action against Met police,"Harvey Proctor, the former MP who lost his job and home during a 16-month Metropolitan police inquiry into an alleged VIP paedophile ring, is considering taking legal proceedings against the force. The announcement follows a meeting between the former Conservative MP for Basildon and the Met police chief, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, at Scotland Yard to discuss the aftermath of Operation Midland. It comes a week after a damaging report by Sir Richard Henriques found 42 serious failings in the force’s handling of sex crime allegations against high-profile suspects including Lord Brittan, who has since died, and the war hero Lord Bramall. The retired high court judge found that the Operation Midland inquiry could have taken place “speedily” without the suspects learning of the claims. The original complainant, Nick, is being investigated for perverting the course of justice. Proctor lived and worked in a farmhouse in the castle grounds of Belvoir Castle with his partner, Terry Woods, as the Duke of Rutland’s private secretary, when his home was raided by dozens of officers in March 2015. News of the raid was leaked within minutes to the now defunct website Exaro and media organisations were briefed that Proctor was accused of a brutal and prolonged murder and rape of two boys. Proctor has said pressure upon his employers by police and social services meant that he had to resign and leave his home, leaving him homeless and penniless. The Met has since said that Proctor was innocent of all claims. Proctor, 69, met Hogan-Howe at 2.30pm, a hastily arranged meeting after the Met released the Henriques report on the day of the US election. At a press conference at a hotel opposite the Yard, Proctor said: “In the light of the Henriques report and its findings, the letter of apology which I received from Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe last Tuesday, and the intolerable strain and stress I, my family and friends have borne this last 18 months, I have asked my solicitors to look towards taking proceedings against the Metropolitan Police Service and I will comment further shortly.” He added that he was also considering taking action against against two other unnamed parties involved in the criminal inquiry. Proctor said Hogan-Howe admitted at the meeting that a decision in 2014 by DS Kenny McDonald, who was overseeing the inquiry, to describe Nick’s allegations as “credible and true” was premeditated – an apparent contradiction of Hogan-Howe’s previous claims in interviews with Radio 4 and LBC that the officer “misspoke”. The statement was seen as highly damaging to the reputation of the Met and those under investigation because it pre-empted the conclusion of the inquiry. “I quoted roughly what Hogan-Howe had said – that it had been a throwaway line. He admitted that it was not, and that he understood it was a more drafted and pre-arranged remark,” Proctor said. Proctor also pressed Hogan-Howe on why he had decided not to resign following the Henriques report but would instead retire in February, leaving other more junior officers to take the blame. “Hogan-Howe replied that he thought the Met, in general, had done a good job and that there were many other important investigations which he regarded to be as important as Operation Midland which had proceeded well. He did not come to my conclusion that he should have gone,” Proctor said. Established in November 2014, Operation Midland was set up to examine claims of a Westminster VIP paedophile ring, with allegations boys were abused and murdered by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies. The inquiry related to locations across southern England and London in the 1970s and 1980s, and focused on the private Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London. A spokeswoman for the Met declined to comment on any of Proctor’s statements. “The commissioner did meet Harvey Proctor and delivered in person the apology that he outlined last week. We are not going to comment further on a private meeting,” she said."
2016-11-15T19:43:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Arthur Heeler-Frood: missing boy found safe nine miles from home,"A grammar school boy missing for two months after telling his parents he was bored with his life has been found safe and well. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, who sparked a nationwide hunt, was apparently making his way home when he was recognised on a train and intercepted by the police. Arthur’s frantic parents, Caroline and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, had wondered if he had sneaked abroad, possibly inspired by George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London, which he had just been reading. Speaking to the Guardian on Tuesday night, Caroline Heeler-Frood confirmed he was back at home in rural Devon. She said he had not been abroad but said she wanted to have a proper talk to him before she revealed more.
The boy’s mother said: “He is safe and well. We’ve just got home with him and want a little bit of time to talk to him.” Arthur’s mother said he was on a train in the Exeter area when he was spotted by a member of the public, who tipped off the police. The teenager was met off the train at Honiton, nine miles from his home, by officers and taken to a police station. “He was recognised on a train. He was coming home,” said Ms Heeler-Frood. “The police picked him up at Honiton. He is fine and well.” A police spokesperson said: “Arthur Heeler-Frood has been found safe and well in Honiton today. The 15-year-old was located by officers at Honiton train station after being alerted by a member of the public shortly after 4.30pm. “He went missing after leaving his family home on the morning of Tuesday 6 September and failed to turn up at school. Officers would like to thank the member of the public who called in and also thank everyone who has assisted with the appeal to find Arthur over the last two months.” Ms Heeler-Frood also declined to say if he had changed his appearance, which was suspected as hair clippers went missing with him. When he disappeared, Arthur left his parents a letter explaining that he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within the year. Police forces across the country had been asked to look out for Arthur and postal workers have also joined the search for him. The job of finding Arthur was challenging partly because he left without a phone or any electronic equipment. He had just £350 earned from a job washing up in a kitchen restaurant – which is exactly what Orwell did in Paris. However, he had no passport. Speaking last week to the Guardian, Ms Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the country and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” she said. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. For the last two summers his brother, Reuben has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister, Hester, went InterRailing. I think he was inspired by all that. “We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure. Hester was leaving for university and he was going to be the last one at home with us. I think he wasn’t looking forward to being left alone with us. I think he wanted to test himself, prove his abilities.” Ms Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an avid reader. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been an influence. He was reading on a Kindle, which he left behind.” The 15-year-old had not been seen since he left for Colyton Grammar school on his bicycle at 7.30am on Tuesday 6 September. His last words to his mother were: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my fluorescent.” His custom was to leave his bike at a local post office and get the bus from there to school. When he did not return home, his mother went to the post office but could find no sign of the bike. Next day a letter arrived in the post. It said: “To mum and dad I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please do not try to find me or make me come home. “I don’t know how long I will be away for but it won’t be longer than a year. You will find my school uniform in a bin bag in a small barn in the field on the green down the road near Membury church. “My bike is chained to the fence .... Please apologise to the restaurant and tell them that I will no longer be able to work there. I know you will be upset but please understand that I have to do this, from Arthur.” The letter had been posted in Devon. Arthur had just received outstanding GCSE grades and started his A-levels the previous day at Colyton Grammar in Devon, one of Britain’s most highly-rated state schools."
2016-11-15T20:12:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police officer cleared of raping girl in 1980,"A former Nottinghamshire police officer accused of raping a girl almost 36 years ago has been found not guilty by a court. A 50-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accused Raymond Jeacock, 62, of raping her after taking her home from a police station when she was 14. It took a jury of seven men and five women 15 minutes to reach a unanimous not guilty verdict after a five-day trial at Nottingham crown court. Jeacock broke down in tears as the verdict was read out, removing his glasses to hold his face in his hands. Members of his family who had been present throughout the trial cried and hugged each other, as Jeacock said “thank you” and walked out of the defendant’s stand to join them. In a statement his family said the verdict had brought into disrepute the disciplinary proceedings that had forced Jeacock to resign. The family would be looking for responses to unanswered questions, including why the case was brought to court, said Jeacock’s son Adam. “Today it took the jury just 15 minutes to reach a unanimous decision, the same decision that was reached 36 years ago by the DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions]. My dad is innocent,” he said in a statement. “We, the innocent family, question why this ever came to court. The decision to take this weak case to court may have been influenced by a local MP, after the case had been initially rejected by the police. The case leaves these and other unanswered questions for our innocent family and we will be seeking clarification in due course.” The court heard that the woman accused Jeacock of raping her in her bedroom after following her into the house on 13 December 1980. She had been arrested in a case of mistaken identity and taken home by the former police officer, who was 26 at the time. Her father told the court that he had come back to his ex-wife’s house to check on his daughter, having been told the police would take her home from the police station. He said he had found Jeacock attempting to hide and there had been an altercation. Jeacock maintained that he had taken the girl home because there were concerns about her father doing so. He said he had taken her alone because there were no female officers and had searched the property for stolen goods because of the girl’s relationship with a known criminal. Jeacock was investigated for rape at the time after a complaint was made, but the office of the DPP ruled that there was not sufficient evidence to bring a case. After a disciplinary hearing in July 1981, Jeacock was “required to resign” because he had acted in a way “likely to bring discredit” to the police force. The court heard that the former detective constable felt “a razor blade” had been taken to his life and he had “slid down a sewer” after losing his badge following the disciplinary hearing. After the criminal case was opened in 2014, he told police that it could not be right that the accusations were “extending the misery that was brought to my family”. Jeacock worked for Derbyshire social services for more than 30 years after his resignation, first in security, then qualifying as a social worker. He also qualified as a swimming coach and worked with a young Rebecca Adlington. Summing up for the defence, Jeremy Janes said Jeacock had made a mistake in taking the girl home alone, and had paid “a heavy price”. Since the incident 36 years ago Jeacock had “dusted himself off and got on with being a good father, a good husband, a good grandfather and a good man”, he said."
2016-11-15T20:33:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Julia Baird: Queen Victoria would have been a 'nasty woman' in Trumpian terms,"There is only one story around the world at the moment, splashed across front pages and leading news bulletins: the former-bankrupt millionaire turned reality television star turned pussy-grabber turned president of the United States. Donald Trump seems to have permeated everything, so it should come as no surprise that his name would come up in a conversation about Queen Victoria. Australian journalist and commentator Julia Baird’s 696-page book about the monarch has just been released, and when she meets me she has just wrapped up an interview with the national broadcaster about her impressions of the president-elect, who she joined for a New York Times editorial board meeting in January. Victoria: The Queen began germinating in 2008, when Hillary Clinton lost the democratic nomination to Barack Obama. Baird carried the idea with her as she followed Clinton’s ascension to secretary of state and Democratic nominee before the eventual defeat – a defeat which Baird partly attributes to Clinton’s gender.
“I do wonder about the part the strong queens of England have played in the [nation’s] psyche towards the acceptance of women in politics, and what kind of women. We’ve got Margaret Thatcher, we’ve got Theresa May, yet still today America cannot vote in Hillary Clinton,” Baird says over a salad. We’re sitting in a cafe down the road from the ABC, where she hosts news analysis TV show The Drum. Baird believes having strong female monarchs such as Victoria and Elizabeth II helped British people become comfortable with women in power. “Victoria was so tough and stubborn and sometimes rude, and refused to accept defeat. Refused to be told what to do,” she says. “She was micro reported on every second of the day and she behaved how she wanted to behave. That was quite different – she would’ve been a ‘nasty woman’ in Trumpian terms, without a doubt.” When Baird set out to write Victoria, she wanted to examine how the queen wielded power during her reign and how far – or little it seems – our acceptance of powerful women has come. The book chronicles Victoria’s life, but unlike other histories of the queen it charts her role as an “incredibly powerful working mother”, and explores how she managed her nine pregnancies and raising children while the monarch.
Baird says she was not particularly interested in royal history when she began the book, but after spending a year reading about Victoria was astounded by the myths the queen had been buried under, and the caricature she had become. In Baird’s words, she want to rescue Victoria from history. The queen, of course, did not earn her title – although Baird would argue she fought for it. Instead, she was born to the right parents at the right time. Baird contrasts Victoria’s indulged way of life with tales of what was going on beyond the palace walls: children being sexually assaulted in coalmines, pantless because of the heat; England’s ambivalence towards the the Irish famine, in which more than one million people starved. Victoria is depicted in the book as sympathetic to the plight of the working class – she donated the equivalent of roughly £200,000 in today’s money to the Irish. But it is likely she donated more to animal shelters over her lifetime.
She may have been born into “the madness of inherited power”, but that doesn’t make her reign any less interesting, says Baird. “Because we’ve had few women elected by popular vote to lead, it’s very instructive and interesting to look at the women who inherited [power],” she says. Besides, many elected leaders – most of them men – are born into power as well. “There’s a fundamental thread running through western cultural thinking about the incompatibility of woman and power – that it’s surprising, that it’s secondary, that it only ever comes from someone else, under someone else’s tutelage or relation ... that it’s somehow less authoritative, [that their bad behaviour is] worse than others,” Baird says.
“What we often fail to portray is the incredible complexity of women in powerful roles, and what we’re capable of. [This is] largely because we are so blinkered by expectations of female behaviour – of what a powerful woman or a feminist looks like. “Victoria said women weren’t suited for public life, but she spent several decades protecting and demanding an influential place in it,” Baird says. “[It’s] like a lot of women who say they are not feminist now, all the while they’re collecting pay cheques and expecting to vote and expecting to have property rights, and to have recourse if anyone were to assault them. Her power was assumed to have come from the men around her, especially from her husband.”
In many ways, Prince Albert – an intellectual reformer with a social justice bent – was a superior monarch to Victoria. But she has almost been crowded out of her own story by him: by his role in the “golden age” of her reign, and by her extended grieving over his death. The dominant narrative is that after Prince Albert died, when he was 42, Victoria withdrew from society and lost her way as queen. But while she did withdraw for a few years and wear black for the rest of her life – a kind of “widow superstar”, Baird says – “there was almost something spectacular in her grieving”. She maintained a very active role in politics and ruled for 40 years on her own. The gulf between the image of Victoria the queen and Victoria the actual woman is partly her own creation. While attempting to stop Gladstone from becoming prime minister – an outrageous intervention even for the time – and weighing in on wars, she was also writing and releasing hugely popular journal extracts, in which she portrayed herself as a likeable woman living a domestic life at Balmoral in the Scottish Highlands. “I think it’s important to tell stories of women as fully human and complicated, and seek judgment [of women] that is not more excessive than that of a bloke. Why do so many women hate Hillary Clinton? Why is a gut instinct to hate her? I think it goes back to that fundamental disconnect between women and power,” Baird says. “The likability thing is a real burden, and it’s demonstrable: there is study after study that not only shows that women have to be more likable, but that they are genuinely considered less likable when they ask for more pay, or when they do certain jobs, or when they make tough decisions.” Baird worked on the book across three continents, visiting London each year as she moved from New York to Philadelphia to Sydney with her two young children. When the project began, she was the deputy editor of Newsweek; since then she has worked in Australian radio and TV, written columns for the New York Times, and been diagnosed with cancer – all while reading and writing hundreds of thousands of words about the queen. Baird carried her laptop with her everywhere, “grabbing the time” she could. “My little boy broke his leg and was in hospital and I had to live there with him for six weeks, and I just remember some of my friends coming in and saying, ‘OK, go,’ and I would dash downstairs to the cafe and [write] as much as I could. I wrote out the coronation chapter when he was in hospital,” she says. “There was no neat pattern.” Another was presented by the royal family itself: Baird was denied access to the royal archives for years. Eventually, Australia’s then-governor general Quentin Bryce put a good word in for her, a royal experience in the most classic sense: she got access based on the strength of her connections – not her PhD in history or book deal.
The royal archives also requested she censor the book, taking out one of the most revelatory parts, about Victoria’s relationship with her servant John Brown after the death of Prince Albert. The passage came from information Baird had found outside the archive. She rejected the request. “There’s a lot of historians who are censored a lot of the time, I’ve seen it,” she says. The secrecy around the monarch continues today; Baird says it’s hard to say what role Queen Elizabeth II is playing in 2016 without access to her letters or journals. “The thing that I wrestle with [about the monarchy], I know a lot of Brits wrestle with, is the expense and the secrecy. Trying to get the material to report properly, to write properly about any of the royals – how closed the archives are is a real problem.” Victoria: The Queen goes beyond the biography of a royal figure from 200 years ago; it is a contemporary tale of how women are expected to behave, and the conflicts between obligations to family and a career. “Sometimes even the most prominent women have been buried by mountains of myths,” Baird says. • This article was amended on 6 April 2017.

2016-11-16T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Anglo-Saxon graves and tree-trunk coffins unearthed in Norfolk,"Six plank-lined Anglo-Saxon graves, believed to be the oldest of their kind found in Britain, have been discovered on a waterlogged site in a river valley in Norfolk, alongside 81 coffins made from hollowed oak trunks. Archaeologists think the startlingly well-preserved graves were part of the burial ground of an early Christian community, dating from between the 7th and 9th centuries. Tree ring dating is being carried out to establish a more precise age. Finding timber graves of this age is extremely rare, due to wood’s tendency to leave little more than a decayed smudge in the earth. The river Wensum, which laps the edge of the discovery site and flows through the village of Great Ryburgh, has changed course over the last millennium, possibly destroying evidence of Anglo-Saxon homes and farm buildings at the site.
Although much of the human remains has been crushed under many hundreds of years of soil, some of the best-preserved bones may be able to give a wealth of evidence about who the people were, what they died of, and where they came from. Traces of a timber structure thought to have once been a church have also been found. The graves were dug in an east-west alignment, and marked with timber posts, but unlike Roman or prehistoric burials there were no grave goods with the dead, suggesting that they were Christians. James Fairclough, who led the excavation for the Museum of London’s archaeology unit (MoLA), said: “The combination of acidic sand and alkaline water created the perfect conditions for the skeletons and wooden graves to survive, revealing remarkable details of Christian Anglo-Saxon practices.” There was nothing in the historical record to suggest that a sizeable Anglo-Saxon community existed in a fallow field behind landowner Gary Boyce’s house. The medieval church of St Andrew, with its distinctive round tower, is several hundred metres away in the centre of the village. However, as soon as preparatory work began for a fishing lake, local archaeologist Matthew Champion spotted Saxon pottery in the soil, and MoLA was called in for a full excavation.
The best of the timbers from the pits and the oak coffins will be preserved at Norwich Castle museum, where curator Tim Pestell said they were fascinating evidence from such an early period of Christianity. “The site was in use in the heyday of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia, and positioned next to a strategic river cross. As with much of East Anglia at this early date, we have no documentary sources that relate to this site, and so it is archaeological finds like this that are crucial in helping us to understand the development of the kingdom.” Fairclough said that although analysis continued, there did not appear to be any difference in status between the burials in plank-lined pits and those in the oak trunk coffins. The pit burials were carefully dug graves that were lined with expertly shaped planks. The bodies were laid in and then the grave was roofed with more planks. The log coffins would each have taken up to four days’ work to hollow out – a laborious technique known from much earlier burials in bronze age Europe. The two types of grave are mixed across the site, and it is not yet clear if they date from different periods. There are records of log coffins being found on other sites in the late 19th century, but this is the first time that any have been excavated using modern archaeological techniques. • This article was amended on 16 November 2016. An editing error resulted in the text and headline implying that the oldest Anglo-Saxon graves in the UK had been found. They are believed to be the oldest plank-lined graves."
2016-11-16T00:30:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Rory McGrath in court accused of stalking woman,"Rory McGrath, the comedian and TV personality, has appeared in court to plead not guilty to an accusation that he stalked a married woman. The 60-year-old, from Cambridge, was said to have harassed the woman, also from Cambridge, for 14 months. McGrath is said to have sent the alleged victim electronic messages, as well as to have approached her in public and sent letters to her husband. The woman cannot be identified for legal reasons. The comedian, who is best known for his appearances on the BBC1 panel show They Think It’s All Over, spoke only to confirm his name, address and a not-guilty plea when he appeared at Cambridge magistrates court on Tuesday. The alleged harassment is said to have taken place between April 2015 and August this year. McGrath was granted conditional bail, which forbids him from contacting the woman or visiting an address in Cambridge. He is due to stand trial in January at the same court. McGrath was a panellist on They Think It’s All Over for its entire run from 1995 until it was axed in 2006. He went on to appear in the Three Men in a Boat comedy specials on the BBC with Dara O Briain and Griff Rhys Jones."
2016-11-16T00:40:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Migrant teenagers without family in UK barred except Syrians and Sudanese,"Unaccompanied teenagers from Afghanistan, Yemen and Eritrea who had reached the Calais refugee camp will be barred from entering the UK according to Home Office guidelines. In a decision that was condemned by refugee charities and campaigners, the move will limit the intake of teenagers who do not have family in the UK to those from Syria and Sudan except in exceptional circumstances. The Home Office’s guidance said it would take children 12 or under of all nationalities, those deemed at high risk of sexual exploitation, and those who “are aged 15 or under and are of Sudanese or Syrian nationality” because people from those countries are already granted asylum in the UK in 75% of cases. Lady Sheehan, the Liberal Democrat peer, said the new rules, details of which emerged on Tuesday night, were “unacceptable”. Sheehan said they would come as a “horrible shock” to refugees from other countries who had been led to believe they might be able to come to Britain. “It is quite arbitrary. We had no idea they were going to apply this sort of criteria,” she said.
Sheehan said she feared that teenagers awaiting asylum decisions in reception centres across France would now escape and return to Calais to risk their lives jumping on lorries. “People will be just devastated,” she said in relation to some of the refugees she has campaigned for in Calais. Rabbi Janet Darley, the leader of Citizens UK, accused the government of back-tracking on its promises. “The UK is unforgivably backtracking on its commitment to vulnerable refugee children in Europe. Citizens UK’s safe passage team estimates that around 40% of the children who were in Calais at the time of the demolition are Eritrean or Afghan,” said Darley. “By ruling out children from these countries, the home secretary is arbitrarily preventing many vulnerable children from being helped by the Dubs amendment, and will make it impossible for her to keep her promise that the UK would take half of the unaccompanied children in Calais.” The new guidelines were issued to Home Office staff on 8 November and have been seen by the Guardian after they were shared on Tuesday with charities which have worked in the Calais migrant camp. They follow claims by some tabloid newspapers that some of the youngsters coming to the UK were over 18. The Calais camp was demolished two weeks ago, with an estimated 2,000 children and young adults of 16, 17 and 18 years old now scattered across France in reception centres while their cases are examined by French and Home Office officials. The UK has so far taken about 330 children from the Calais camp. Unaccompanied children who have a family member in the UK are currently allowed in as part of a “fast transfer” family reunification programme, mandated by EU lawe. The remainder have no family in the UK, but qualify for entry under an amendment to immigration laws pushed through parliament by Lord Dubs earlier this year. Citizens UK also said that the Home Office process of transferring children to the UK has virtually ground to a halt. A group of girls aged between 15 and 17 arrived in Scotland under the Dubs amendment at the weekend, but the charity has not been made aware of any others in the past week. Of the unaccompanied minors who have been brought to the UK from France so far this year, about 250 are part of the “fast transfer” family reunification programme. The chaotic clearance of the Calais migrant camp caused bitter tensions between the French and British governments, with France’s president telling the UK it had to do its “moral duty” and take 1,000 children from the camp. The Home Office said that “all children who have close family in the UK will be considered for transfer” and those that do not have family ties would be assessed according to the new guidance."
2016-11-16T09:56:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Haringey to welcome Syrian refugees as London struggles to take its share,"Considering London’s long and famous history of giving sanctuary to refugees, it seems strange that so few fleeing Syria have been settled in the capital so far. In April, Citizens UK reported that only 43 of the 1,337 accepted by Britain since 2014 had relocated to any of London 32 boroughs at that point. In May, Home Office figures showed that only 33 of the 1,602 Syrians housed in the UK since October 2015 under the government’s Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (SVPRS) were in London, the lowest number of any UK region or nation. Of the 32 London boroughs, only Camden, Barnet, Kingston and Islington had begun accepting people at that stage, though others had agreed to in principle. On Tuesday, Haringey joined those taking in Syrians when its cabinet voted to accommodate up to ten families under the SVPRS. Council leader Claire Kober pledged to “work round the clock to give refugee families a safe home and the support they need to rebuild their lives”. Quizzed on Twitter by a local refugees support group about when the Syrian families will arrive, Kober replied that the council was “moving fast to finalise deal with Home Office” but added that “we’re in their hands on broader timescale”. Kober’s comment hints at the processes involved with helping refugees, not only those from Syria. The Haringey officers’ report recommending the cabinet decision illuminates some of the wider issues, including types affecting other London boroughs too. It says that in 2014-15 across London around 2,500 households with no recourse to public funds (because their immigration status was being assessed) were supported by boroughs and voluntary groups to the tune of an estimated £50m and that the number of such households has risen by about 40% in the last two years. The report explains that councils participating in the SVPRS can claim government funding of £20,500 per individual over a five year period, beginning at £8,500 and ending in year five at £1,000. This amount can be topped up to meet the educational needs of school age children and some extra social and medical care needs. But, unsurprisingly for London, housing costs are described as “the biggest challenge” Haringey faces to participating in the SVPRS. Syrian families must be found places in the private rented sector (PRS), where rents are very high. “Central government has assumed that housing costs will be fully covered through housing benefit,” the report says: “However, the supply of PRS properties available at local housing allowance rates is very low in London.” It means boroughs must cover the “rent gap” between what housing benefit provides and what is charged. The whole thing, to put it briefly, is a bit of a struggle. Last month, eight boroughs - Camden, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hounslow, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham and Redbridge - wrote to home secretary Amber Rudd asking for more help with supporting refugee children from Calais, pointing out that they have had to cope with huge budget cuts in recent years. Hammersmith and Fulham are among those who’ve taken in unaccompanied Calais camp children. Camden’s leader Sarah Hayward says that her borough is presently supporting 51 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children of whom she believes 17 arrived from Calais. Lambeth currently looks after 33 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, a number which they say might increase. They are also response for 33 over-18s who arrived when they were younger. Haringey supports 46 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in all at the moment, including three from Calais. In her role as chair of London Councils, the body representing the capital’s local authorities, Kober too has pressed Rudd for help across the capital with looking after over 100 children allowed in under Lord Dubs’s amendment to the Immigration Act (2016). Elsewhere, Hackney has committed to increasing its number of SVPRS families to seven by Christmas, with maybe more after that. Lambeth has taken in four so far. Others are being urged to follow suit. This article was updated on 18 November to add more information about what Camden and Lambeth are doing. I will continue to update if and when I hear from other boroughs."
2016-11-16T09:57:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Rotherham abuse scandal: MPs ask Met to investigate claim PCC lied under oath,"MPs have asked police to investigate whether a former South Yorkshire officer and crime commissioner lied under oath during a hearing about the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. The home affairs select committee announced on Tuesday evening that it had referred complaints about Shaun Wright to the Metropolitan police for investigation. The complaints allege Wright lied when he gave evidence to MPs in September 2014, but the exact nature of the allegations is not known. In a statement, the committee said: “The home affairs select committee has received two complaints alleging that a witness who was examined on oath by the former committee in the last parliament deliberately misled the committee. “Since lying to a committee of the house when under oath would constitute the criminal offence of perjury, the committee has resolved today to refer the complaints to the commissioner of police for the metropolis for investigation. Any further action is for the police and the prosecuting authorities to consider. “Since a criminal offence is alleged, it would not be appropriate for the committee to make any further comment.” An investigation by the Times in 2012 found that gang rape and trafficking were widespread in Rotherham. A report in 2014 by Prof Alexis Jay, a former chief inspector of social work, concluded that failures of political and police leadership contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children by groups of Asian men in the town over 16 years. Wright, the first person to hold the position of South Yorkshire PCC, resigned shortly after giving evidence to the committee, following criticism that he should be held accountable for his role as head of children’s services on Rotherham council’s cabinet for five years from 2005. When Wright gave evidence to the home affairs select committee in September 2014, he was asked to do so under oath and the committee’s chairman at the time, Keith Vaz, told him he would be committing perjury if he gave false evidence. Wright told MPs he had not been aware that child sexual exploitation was a significant problem during the time he was responsible for Rotherham’s children’s services and that he did not remember a reported face-to-face meeting with a victim of sexual exploitation."
2016-11-16T12:07:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Surge in eastern Europeans working in UK since EU referendum,"There has been a surge in the number of eastern Europeans working in Britain since the EU referendum but numbers from France, Germany and other western European countries have dipped, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said the number of eastern Europeans working in Britain rose by 46,000 between June and September, to 1,053,000. It is the first official indication that the vote has triggered an increase in labour from eastern Europe amid fears that Britain will close its doors, particularly to unskilled labour from the EU. At the same time the numbers in work from western European countries fell by 7,000 to 937,000, suggesting that uncertainty about their status in a post-Brexit Britain is already beginning to put off some French and German people from remaining or coming to work in the UK. The Brexit vote also seems to have led to a drop in the number of people coming to Britain from Romania and Bulgaria, the latest countries to join the EU.
The quarterly ONS labour market figures show that the number of non-UK nationals working in Britain rose by 241,000 in the 12 months to this September, to 3.49 million, or just under 11% of the UK workforce. Over the same period the number of Britons working in the UK rose by 213,000 to 28.39 million. The figures for employment levels in the three months since the Brexit vote in June show there was a 219,000 rise in the numbers in work in Britain. This was made up of an increase of 175,000 in UK employment and a net increase of 43,000 in non-UK employment in Britain. Along with the 46,000 increase from the A8 eastern European countries, which include Poland, and the drop of 7,000 from western Europe, there was also a fall of 8,000 in work from Romania and Bulgaria. Estimates based on the country of birth, rather than the nationality, of those working in Britain show an even starker picture. Between July and September 2016 there were 5.55 million people born abroad working in Britain, compared with 3.49 million foreign nationals working in Britain. The ONS said the numbers differed because the estimates of those born abroad included many UK nationals born outside Britain. The detailed estimates of those born abroad working in Britain also show a 48,000 rise in people born in eastern Europe working in Britain and a 30,000 fall in the numbers from western European countries working in Britain in the third quarter between July and September this year."
2016-11-16T12:50:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Child abuse inquiry facing 'credibility crisis', Labour says","The troubled inquiry into historical child sexual abuse is facing a “crisis in credibility” according to Labour, after another senior lawyer resigned and two more threatened to do so. Aileen McColgan, who was leading the inquiry’s investigation into abuse in the Anglican and Catholic churches, quit over concerns about the inquiry’s leadership, according to BBC Newsnight. Two other barristers have told the inquiry of their desire to leave over similar concerns, the programme reported. An inquiry spokeswoman refused to comment on McColgan’s departure. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, called on Amber Rudd, her Tory counterpart, to “address this crisis of credibility” by explaining the inquiry’s problems to parliament. “The victims of child sex abuse have put their faith in this inquiry. The very least they deserve is some openness from government and an explanation for what is going on,” she said. Rudd said she still had confidence in the inquiry. Speaking at a policing conference in London on Wednesday, she added: “I saw the latest news on the inquiry today. I would say it is a matter for the inquiry. They are an independent inquiry so they will manage their own recruitment process.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, called on the inquiry to be more transparent and said her committee would seek evidence from McColgan about why she quit.
McColgan’s departure is the latest blow to the inquiry, which has been hit by a series of high-profile departures. The current chair, Prof Alexis Jay became the fourth person to lead the inquiry after the previous incumbent, Dame Lowell Goddard, resigned amid criticisms of her leadership style. In September, the inquiry’s lead counsel, Ben Emmerson, resigned a day after he was suspended. Emmerson’s junior colleague, Elizabeth Prochaska, also stood down. Cooper described the latest resignation as a “concern”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, she said: “This is a really important inquiry into historical child abuse and it has had a very difficult two-year history so far. What we want is for it to get back on track. There are a lot of survivors depending on it to do a good job.
“We have contacted the other lawyers who have resigned and we have asked them for written evidence and I hope we will be able to do so with Aileen McColgan as well.” Jay has completed a review of the inquiry’s work, but the findings have not been published. Cooper called on Jay to be more open about the inquiry’s problems. “If we can have some transparency about the things that have gone wrong in the past then that will help us be confident that it is all back on track now,” she said. “We are in a difficult interim position at the moment, because we know that there were a lot of problems under the previous chair. We don’t know what they were and she’s refused to give oral evidence to us. “We have a gap now before the new chair has had the chance to set out the results of her review into the inquiry. Prof Jay did an extremely good job on the inquiry she did into Rotherham. and it is important that she should be able to set out her conclusions about how the inquiry should go forward. “We are caught between those two with a lot of questions unanswered. What is unclear is how much this has been about legacy problems and personality issues … or whether there are ongoing problems for the future.” Meanwhile, Andi Lavery of Catholic survivor group White Flowers Alba, who has core participant status at the inquiry, has called for Jay’s resignation. In a letter to her, Lavery said: “If there is no accountability within the inquiry, how can those institutions who harmed us ever be held to account. “You and your staff don’t even have a dialogue between us who know much about those institutions. The attitude displayed and behaviour exhibited towards us is appalling.” An inquiry spokeswoman said: “We have a large legal team comprising a number of junior counsel, senior counsel and solicitors. They come and go subject to their professional obligations and we are not commenting on specifics.”"
2016-11-16T13:00:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Arthur Heeler-Frood says he slept rough and explored big cities,"A school pupil missing for two months from a remote Devon hamlet has revealed that he spent the time sleeping rough and exploring three of Britain’s biggest cities. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, was reading George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London – the classic tale of living on a shoestring – when he took off with just £350.
Following frantic appeals from his parents, Caroline, an artist, and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, a cabinet maker, the teenager reappeared on Tuesday afternoon, making his way back to Devon by train. On Wednesday Arthur said: “I have spent the last 10 weeks exploring London, Birmingham and Manchester by foot, sleeping rough at night. “I am very grateful to everyone who has helped my family in trying to ensure my safe return. I apologise to the police for the time they spent looking for me and for the worry I have caused family and friends.” In a statement issued via Devon and Cornwall police, his parents said: “We are overjoyed to have Arthur home with us again – tired, grubby and rather smelly but otherwise none the worse for his experiences. We feel extremely lucky that he is safe and sound. “Many thanks to Devon and Cornwall police for their professionalism and their tireless search for Arthur. Thank you also to the media for their help in raising awareness of his disappearance and our deep gratitude to all our friends and family who have supported us through this difficult time. “We now wish to spend some time in private with Arthur to settle him back home and to make some plans for his future.”
Speaking on Tuesday evening, Caroline Heeler-Frood said Arthur was on a train in the Exeter area when he was spotted by a member of the public, who tipped off the police. The teenager was met off the train at Honiton, nine miles from his home, by officers and taken to a police station. The police said: “Officers would like to thank the member of the public who called in and also thank everyone who has assisted with the appeal to find Arthur over the last two months.” The teenager went missing after leaving his family home in a tucked-away valley near Axminster on the morning of Tuesday 6 September and failing to turn up at school. When he disappeared, Arthur left his parents a letter explaining that he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within the year. Police forces across the country had been asked to look out for Arthur and postal workers also joined the search for him. The job of finding Arthur was challenging partly because he left without a phone or any electronic equipment. He had just £350 earned from a job washing up in a kitchen restaurant, which is what Orwell did in Paris. However, he had no passport. Speaking last week to the Guardian, Caroline Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the countryside and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” she said. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. For the last two summers his brother, Reuben, has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister, Hester, went InterRailing. I think he was inspired by all that. “We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure. Hester was leaving for university and he was going to be the last one at home with us. I think he wasn’t looking forward to being left alone with us. I think he wanted to test himself, prove his abilities.” She said Arthur was an avid reader. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been an influence. He was reading on a Kindle, which he left behind.” He had not been seen since he left for Colyton Grammar school on his bicycle at 7.30am on Tuesday 6 September. His last words to his mother were: “Don’t worry, I’ve got my fluorescent.” His custom was to leave his bike at a local post office and get the bus from there to school. When he did not return home, his mother went to the post office but could find no sign of the bike. Arthur had just received outstanding GCSE grades and started his A-levels the previous day at Colyton grammar, one of Britain’s most highly rated state schools."
2016-11-16T13:05:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Jo Cox murder trial: accused 'told police he was political activist',"The man accused of murdering the Labour MP Jo Cox threw his hands in the air and declared himself to be a “political activist” when approached by police moments after the gun and knife attack, his trial has heard. When Thomas Mair began to lower his hands, two unarmed officers charged at him and rugby-tackled him to the ground. Craig Nicholls, a constable with West Yorkshire police, told the Old Bailey on Wednesday that he and his colleague PC Jonathan Wright had been instructed to search for a man involved in a shooting in Birstall on 16 June. They saw Mair walking nearby, got out of their car and ordered him to drop the black holdall he was carrying, said Nicholls. “He put his arms up and just said, ‘It’s me,’” said Nicholls. “We ran towards him. He came to put his hands towards his shirt. We rugby-tackled him to the ground.” Nicholls said it was “a reasonably heavy impact”, which left Mair with a head injury. When Wright found a firearm in the holdall, Mair said: “I am a political activist,” according to Nicholls. Mair was handcuffed and arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. He was taken for treatment at Leeds General Infirmary before being taken to a police station for questioning. Simon Russell Flint QC, defending, put it to Nicholls and Wright that Mair said nothing to police at any time during his arrest. Both officers said he did. The jury heard that police recovered a sawn-off .22 rifle from the bag Mair had dropped. It contained two rounds in its magazine, a third in the chamber and the safety catch was off. Two knives were also recovered and a plastic bag containing a number of .22 bullets was found in Mair’s pocket. Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, West Yorkshire, is charged with the murder of Cox, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to a passerby, Bernard Carter Kenny. He declined to enter a plea when he appeared at the Old Bailey last month. As a result, not guilty pleas to all four charges were entered on his behalf. Cox was killed during the EU referendum campaign, during which she supported the remain side. She was 41 when she died and had two children, then aged five and three. Mair allegedly struck as the MP was on her way to a meeting with voters at the library in Birstall. The town lies within Batley and Spen, the West Yorkshire constituency to which she had been elected in the 2015 general election. Her final moments were captured by CCTV. The prosecution described a “dynamic, fast-moving and shocking” assault. When the footage was shown to the jury on Monday, Mair stared straight ahead, ignoring the screens placed around the court. Mair allegedly said “Britain first” and “keep Britain independent” while carrying out the attack. He is also alleged to have accessed a string of internet sites about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen SS, Israel, matricide and serial killers in the days before Cox was killed. The jury heard that Mair also viewed Cox’s Twitter feed and looked at the Wikipedia entry for Ian Gow, the Conservative MP murdered by the IRA in 1990. The prosecution said Mair viewed pages about .22 ammunition, including one that offered an answer to the question: “Is a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human’s head?” Items later recovered from his home showed Mair had “strong political and ideological interests”, said Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting. The case continues."
2016-11-16T13:27:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Metropolitan police chief job open to foreign candidates for first time,"Foreign candidates will for the first time be allowed to apply to be the head of the Metropolitan police, but the government has signalled that it no longer sees it as the top job in British policing. The successor to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be selected by a panel that includes the head of Britain’s version of the FBI, Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency. She chose that job instead of running to be Met commissioner and has the power to issue the commissioner with orders. Law changes mean a police chief from one of four other countries can apply for the role. But non-police officers, such as ex-military chiefs, cannot. Hogan-Howe, announced his retirement in September. The six weeks it has taken to place the advert to find his successor means his replacement may not be in post by the time he stands down in February 2017. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, confirmed the advert would go out on Wednesday. The advert sets out the criteria for the next commissioner and says the successful candidate will need to: Show evidence of successfully leading transformational change in a challenging financial climate. An understanding of changing crime and threat patterns, and the protection of the most vulnerable; Show evidence of a lasting commitment to respecting and valuing difference and inclusion. Have experience of working successfully with national and local government and an understanding of the wider political, social and economic context. Have a successful track record of working with diverse communities to achieve positive outcomes.
The appointment of the Met commissioner is by royal warrant and essentially made by the home secretary, who is supposed to take into account the views of the mayor of London. Among the favourites to replace Hogan-Howe is Sara Thornton, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, which borders London. Thornton – who technically holds the rank of assistant commissioner in the Met – has been described as the former prime minister David Cameron’s favourite police chief. The other favourite is Mark Rowley, an assistant Met commissioner who oversees counter-terrorism. In that role he has got to know key politicians who will choose the next commissioner, namely Rudd, Theresa May and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Rowley was previously chief constable of Surrey. Also considering a bid are Stephen Kavanagh, the chief constable of Essex police and previously a Met officer, and Cressida Dick, who left the Met to join the Foreign Office. Police sources say the Cheshire chief constable, Simon Byrne, who has senior-level experience in the Met, is also mulling a bid.
The job comes with a £276,000 salary but the new commissioner faces swingeing budget cuts and the task of repairing the damage to the force’s reputation after a report showed it bungled a high-profile inquiry into allegations of historical sex abuse by establishment members, which ended with no charges.
Police chiefs from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US as well as the UK would be allowed to apply, but applicants have to have served as a police officer. This means applicants from the military would not be considered.Rudd has called on police chiefs to look outside the service when recruiting their new personnel. Addressing police and crime commissioners and chief constables at a conference in London, she said: “You must recognise that talent does not only come from within police ranks. “It can be found elsewhere too, in both the public and the private sector.” Rudd cited the direct entry scheme, which allows candidates from outside policing to join the service at certain ranks. “These men and women bring expertise from the worlds of finance, the civil service, the military and business. Expertise that can make a difference,” the home secretary said. Rudd stressed the scheme’s intention was not to take away top jobs from existing police or to put them out of reach of eligible candidates from within forces. She ruled out imposing targets for direct entry recruits, but told the audience: “I urge you to see it for what it is: an opportunity to bring in talented leaders from different sectors.”"
2016-11-16T14:37:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Call for inquiry as Asian men who fought far-right extremists are cleared,"Campaigners have called for an inquiry into the actions of South Yorkshire police after 10 Asian men, who fought with far-right extremists after attending an anti-racism protest in Rotherham, were cleared of violent disorder. The verdict at Sheffield crown court was greeted by applause from the public gallery. The case had provoked a major campaign across South Yorkshire in support of the men , which was backed by the Orgreave and Hillsborough Truth and Justice campaigns. Using the slogan “self-defence is no offence”, campaigners staged rallies outside the court at various points during the six-week trial. They branded the men the Rotherham 12, a reference to the Bradford 12 , who were charged with terrorist offences after an anti-fascist march in 1981 in Bradford and later acquitted following a campaign. The 12 men, two of whom pleaded guilty at the start of the trial, were attending an anti-fascist demonstration organised by the group Unite Against Fascism in Rotherham on 5 September 2015, a month after the racist murder of 81-year-old Mushin Ahmed in the town. On the same day, the far-right group Britain First also staged a protest in the town and more than 800 police officers were deployed from across the UK to keep the two groups apart. A jury heard that it had been one of a long line of far-right demonstrations held in Rotherham in the aftermath of the child sex abuse scandals uncovered in 2012. A 2014 report by Prof Alexis Jay concluded that failures of political and police leadership had contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children by Asian men in the town over 16 years.
Michael Mansfield QC, defending Asif Zaman and Arshad Khan, told the court the town had been besieged by toxic fascist groups and the air was filled with fear. “The fear was not a fantasy – it was a reality,” he said. “But there comes a point when people have to say to themselves, are we going to be humiliated to the extent that we won’t leave our homes? And is it time to show our respect and solidarity for this elderly man who was stamped to death?” The court heard that, after the demonstration, police channelled the anti-racism protesters down Rotherham’s Wellgate road, past the William Fry pub, said to be a well-known hangout of the far right. Paul O’Shea, prosecuting, said men outside the pub had shouted “vile racist abuse” at the Asian men as they passed . “Not exactly original but certainly offensive,” said O’Shea. The jury was played various pieces of CCTV footage that showed a clash between the two groups in the street outside the pub before the police arrived. The prosecution contended that while there was no doubt that “the other side” in the clash – who will be prosecuted later this month – had acted first, the actions of the defendants could not be justified as self-defence. During the trial, the defence questioned South Yorkshire police’s decision to send the men past the pub, described by Mansfield as a “pub for thugs”. Giving evidence, Ch Insp Richard Butterworth said he did not know the pub was associated with the far right. “Everybody knew it, save for one person, save for, apparently, the silver commander,” said Mansfield. “I don’t know what planet he’s been on, but clearly he’s not been on this one.” The men – Asif Zaman, Mohammed Saleem, Arshad Khan, Abrar Javid, Imran Iqbal, Nasrum Rashid, Moshin Mahmood, Sadaqat Ali, Shaban Ditta and Akaash Nazir – shared tearful embraces with their families and friends outside the court following the verdict. Two other men, Haseeb Alam and Mahroof Sultan, had already pleaded guilty to violent disorder but will apply to change their plea in light of Wednesday’s verdict. Reading a statement on behalf of the defendants outside court, Suresh Grover, director of the Monitoring Group, an anti-racism charity, said that apart from the actions of the far-right groups, their anger was reserved for South Yorkshire police and the Crown Prosecution Service. “The prosecution evidence clearly acknowledged that far-right groups were intent on sowing community divisions … It beggars belief knowing what the police knew that the defendants were ever arrested, let alone charged and put on trial,” he said. “Instead of protecting the real victims in this case, the police and the CPS turned against them. On that day they led them towards danger and left them unprotected. “Public confidence in South Yorkshire police is at an all time low. It can only be gained if there is a rigorous independent inquiry into their conduct and behaviour and they begin to respect local communities.” One of the defendants, Javid, a 38-year-old NHS project manager, told the Guardian that he had felt personally in danger as a result of the increase in far-right action in the town and that he had been provoked to attend the demonstration following the murder of Ahmed. He said he understood that policing big demonstrations was a “logistical nightmare” for the police, but that he and the 11 other men arrested on that day had been victims of political policing. “I believe that because the police had failed in terms of child sexual exploitation they were trying to make examples of a community – in whatever shape or form – and say : ‘Look we’re doing our job now. We’re actually putting a few Asians away.’” His fellow defendant Saleem, a 44-year-old gas engineer, said he did not think that sending the anti-racism protesters past the Wellgate pub had been an innocent mistake . “I have my own theories,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m right or not. I don’t think it was just a cock-up. There are similarities with what the police did to the Orgreave miners, and how they herded them to a particular spot. “I had a bin thrown at me, punches thrown at me and I had literally done nothing. Now you imagine five weeks later, at six or seven in the morning, police officers, 10 of them, coming to your house. Your children are scared, you’re scared, you’re treated as some common criminal.” Following the protest and arrests in September, the Muslim Community of Rotherham group called for a boycott of South Yorkshire police in the town. A subsequent report by the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, Alan Billings, into policing on that day urged a different approach to policing “a small number of licensed premises in Rotherham with reputations for disorder and for far-right associations”. A spokesperson for South Yorkshire police said: “Following legal advice, we have taken the decision that it would not be appropriate to provide comment on the outcome of the trial given the fact there is a second trial due to be heard in the next few weeks arising out of the same incident. “It is critical that the case is dealt with to finality and due legal process is followed and respected for all involved following the events of 5 September 2015.”"
2016-11-16T15:03:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Universities accused of 'importing Sports Direct model' for lecturers' pay,"One of the most highly skilled and prestigious professions in Britain, university teaching, is now dominated by zero-hours contracts, temp agencies and other forms of precarious work, the Guardian can reveal. New analysis reveals that it is the richest Russell Group institutions that rely most heavily on insecure academic workers. The Guardian investigation has led trade unionists to accuse vice-chancellors of “importing the Sports Direct model” into British universities. It has also prompted the National Union of Students to warn that low-paid and overstressed tutors may not be providing quality education to undergraduates paying tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year.
Academics teaching or doing research in British universities will typically have spent years earning doctorates or other qualifications, yet more than half of them – 53% – manage on some form of insecure, non-permanent contract. They range from short-term contracts that typically elapse within nine months, to those paid by the hour to give classes or mark essays and exams.
Among junior academics – those most likely to be doing frontline teaching – three-quarters are on these kinds of precarious contracts. It is highly likely that the majority of undergraduates are paying many thousands of pounds to be taught by casual workers. The investigation is part of a series of articles published in the Guardian this week about the growing numbers of people in Britain who find themselves in precarious work. The figures come from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and have been analysed by the University and College Union (UCU). They show that within the Russell Group, the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick have the largest proportion of frontline teaching staff on short-term or zero-hours and other flexible contracts. At Birmingham, 70% of teaching staff are on insecure contracts, while at Warwick it is 68%. Yet Birmingham has begun a vast £500m building project, including a new sports centre costing £55m and student housing.
The analysis suggests that as the university sector charges higher student fees and faces further competition, many institutions are getting into speculative building and expansion of their business models, even while many of their frontline teaching staff are struggling to get by. It also raises the prospect of a two-tier academic workforce, with those at the bottom living hand to mouth and unable to pursue research, while those at the top are very well paid. The vice-chancellor of the University of Birmingham, Sir David Eastwood, last year received a pay and performance package of £416,000 – nearly three times the prime minister’s salary.
One-year and two-year contracts are an inevitable part of grant-funded research. But these figures show temporary and zero-hours contracts are now widespread among those teaching undergraduates. University managers typically argue that such flexible contracts allow young academics to gain valuable experience. But in interviews with the Guardian, academics have disputed that argument from their own experience, including: • A 44-year-old politics lecturer working at three different institutions at once but still earning only just over £6,000 a year, relying on benefits to top up his poverty pay. • A 32-year-old linguistics lecturer who has experienced “serious mental health issues” and says “unstable work without a network of colleagues and without any security is proving really difficult”. • A 49-year-old English lecturer who says: “I earn such a pathetic amount. I feel quite humiliated.” Academics rarely speak out publicly against their precarious working arrangements for fear of being punished by losing hours. Some have spoken to the Guardian using a pseudonym while others have said they have “nothing left to lose”.
Academics on insecure contracts form “a reserve army of precarious and exploited labour”, claimed Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU. “Many universities are hacking up teaching jobs into ever smaller bits and shoving people on to the worst contract they can get away with. This is the Sports Direct model imported into our universities.” The Guardian has seen sections of a private survey of academics on casual contracts at the University of Nottingham, one of the largest and most renowned institutions in the country. The comments include: • “The lack of value that I feel towards me is passed on in my feelings towards the students’ education.” • “I have heard people complaining about the fact that they are paid 10 minutes to correct one exam, therefore they will use only 10 minutes to read them.” • “I am definitely much less inclined to go the extra mile in terms of preparing for a class.”
The NUS warned of the impact this could have on student learning. “When academic staff are demoralised and forced to cope with low pay and insecurity, the knock-on effect on students is significant,“ said Sorana Vieru, a vice-president at the union. “Many students are now taking on unprecedented levels of debt to go to university. They deserve good quality teaching and anything that damages that is deeply unjust.” Universities are independent charities, but the Department for Business has told the Guardian that conditions for academics will form part of the independent review of workers’ rights to be conducted for the government by Tony Blair’s former head of policy, Matthew Taylor.
At a few universities such as Edinburgh, the use of zero-hours contracts has caused huge controversy and even led to managers pledging to scrap them. Yet the figures show that Edinburgh has shifted many of its teaching staff on to other kinds of insecure contract. But the lobby group for academic employers, the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, argued: “It is essential that universities retain the ability to operate with part of their workforce in a flexible mode to enable them to respond to changes in demand. The variability in student enrolments on programmes, and features of academic life such as sabbaticals and research leave for permanent staff, mean that fixed-term opportunities to teach, generally for a year or a semester, are made available.” The University of Birmingham said the figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, were “extremely misleading”. It added in a statement: “While the university recognises that a significant number of individuals engaged in teaching are not on standard contracts, they provide only a small fraction of teaching (about 7%), because most of them are engaged for a small fraction of a full-time equivalent post. “Many of the people in this category are expert visiting lecturers, from commerce, industry and the professions, who provide practical support and insight to our students based on their own experience; and others are our own research students, who communicate their enthusiasm for scientific endeavour to undergraduate students through their work as laboratory demonstrators or tutorial assistants, under the supervision of academic staff. We believe these individuals enhance the learning experiences of our students.”"
2016-11-16T15:03:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Part-time lecturers on precarious work: 'I don't make enough for rent',"Steve Hanson, 44, part-time lecturer in political sociology I have a doctorate from a great university; I’ve worked on government research projects, and have more published work than many tenured staff. I have been hourly-paid for about five years now, but HR departments have been alert enough to knock me out of the system before I could rack up four years and become semi-permanent.
I’ve been working for three places at once for most of those years. You have three HR systems and three intranets and three security systems, each with their glitches and perversities. The negotiation of all that stuff – just getting paid is far from automatic – stacks up to something like a management role. But of course this is without the security or the reward or pay being put in automatically. It’s often like trying to play Tetris very fast, and then you look at what you’re doing all this for and it’s three hours one week, seven another, none the next week. I earn just over £6,000 a year. My pay always just reduces my benefits, which is now universal credit. It’s hard to get by. Then friends and sometimes even students say things like: “Ah, it’s all right for you being a university lecturer …” We are seasonal labourers, like fruit pickers. You have to email every September, cap in hand, saying: ‘Is there any work for me this year?’ Universities are giving their hourly-paid people less hours, therefore paying them less. I do struggle to get by. I live in a housing co-op. On a day-to-day basis it means getting big bags of pulses and rice from Asian supermarkets, as cheaply as possible, making a whole batch of something and living off it. I cycle everywhere. It’s absolutely no frills. I’ve got a partner. We would like a family, but it would be extremely difficult. And the idea of getting a mortgage is a non-starter. The reason I am willing to be named here is because there is little left at stake, not much left to lose; the idea that if I be nice and polite about the situation and don’t say anything I might progress is clearly not true.
Sam, 32, part-time lecturer in applied linguistics and communications I obtained my PhD in 2013 from a Russell Group university. Since then I have worked in three different universities, have taught on seven different modules, and have been module leader for five of these modules. I love working in [higher education] but, having had a succession of casualised contracts as an hourly-paid lecturer, am finding it increasingly unsustainable for both financial and personal reasons. I am not making enough money to make rent, particularly in the summer, and have to freelance as an editor and proofreader, which eats into time I really should be using to develop my own research and publications. I am unable to make long-term plans because I don’t know where – or if – I’ll have work next year. At the moment I face long commutes and/or sleeping on friends’ spare beds, sofas, floors or beanbags the night before I teach. There’s no point in moving closer to work because I might be working at the other end of the country in six months. Buying a house is out of the question. I have moved back in with my parents in order to save even my meagre rent. The best time was when I was teaching two courses a semester and doing MA supervision – I was earning £6,000-8,000 a year. Sometimes it’s as low as £2,000-3,000. Casualised contracts do not always pay you for office hours or sufficiently pay you for teaching preparation. You are rarely paid for the hours of emailing and advising students outside the days you are working. It becomes a difficult juggling act between supporting your students and paying yourself.
On a personal level, I’ve experienced serious mental health issues and, while I have worked very hard at getting to a point where I can function, unstable work without a network of colleagues and without any security is proving really difficult. Three years of temporary contracts have meant that my life has been on hold. My friends outside academia are settling down, buying houses and getting married. Meanwhile, I have a PhD, a book that’s too expensive for anyone other than a university library to buy and face constant uncertainty. I’m worried that casualised academic labour means that the only ones who get permanent academic jobs are those able to tough out several years of fraught, unstable work – and I worry that the people able to do that are those with considerable financial privileges, without caring responsibilities, without financial dependents and those mentally resilient enough to cope.” Sam is a pseudonym.
Catherine Burgass, 49, part-time lecturer in English “I got my PhD in 1997 in English literary theory. I worked for about six years at various universities on a series of temporary contracts. I then had my daughter and was made redundant from the last of those contracts. I was at home for five years with my daughter, then I returned to work as a lecturer at Staffordshire University on a series of temporary contracts including full-time and part-time; my underlying permanent contract remains hourly-paid. My life is OK because my husband earns a decent wage but I certainly could not support myself on what I earn. Plus there’s the issue of insecurity – the fact that your hours can be cut. My hours have been cut. I have been on occasion quite depressed by the situation. I was only doing five or so hours a week last year. This semester I’m only teaching two hours a week. The hourly-paid lecturing rate includes payment for half an hour preparation and half an hour marking for each hour of face-to-face teaching. If I was preparing a course I have not taught before I would often spend a day preparing for a lecture and a seminar or a workshop. I earn such a pathetic amount. It’s ignominious. I feel quite humiliated – the remuneration and the status of the job is much lower than it is for full-time equivalent colleagues. There’s a lack of career progression, a lack of status and not much money. I’m in a sense lucky. I’m not on my uppers. I can work for little money, but for other people who need to support a family, I can’t imagine how they manage. Everybody is scrabbling around trying to find work. My husband is a professor of philosophy. He is the one with the proper job. It’s not unusual, but it’s not very good on the feminist front.”"
2016-11-16T15:03:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Nottingham academic on casual contract: 'I had more rights as a binman',"The way Greg tells it, it was like a trapdoor swinging open beneath him. One day, he was a promising young academic. The next, his fixed-term contract was up, his wife was ill – and barely any money was coming in to cover the mortgage, to pay for the groceries, to keep the entire show on the road. The trapdoor was wide open; now it would take everything he had not to plunge through it.
Greg wanted me to hear his story, but I did not find it easy to sit through. For him, it’s both a warning of what can happen to any academic living on casual contracts – and a source of shame. Hardly any of his colleagues at the University of Nottingham know and this piece will not give his real name or identifying details. “There’s a lot of snobbery in academia,” he says, imagining a faculty drinks and some brogue-wearing professor discovering his background. “That one cutting remark.” Yet it begins conventionally enough, in the middle of the last decade, with a grant for some more university research about to come through. Except it didn’t. The plans he and his wife had made were suddenly dust. They had always been “tight”, Greg remembers, even paying off some of the mortgage. But as an academic on a casual contract, his only safety net had been a little saving and a lot of ambition – and now the couple’s finances went “from the comfortable to the calamitous”. In a rush to bring in money, he became what one advert describes as an “outdoor cleaning operative” or, as he calls it, a binman. During his part-time shifts, he had to keep clean an entire out-of-town retail park – from the carpark out front to the bins by the shopfronts to the skips and bushes around the back. It was the beginning of what he calls “the humbling”. His PhD counted for nothing; what others saw were his metal litter-picker, and his outfit. A few months earlier, he had been writing scholarly papers. Now he was picking up used sanitary pads. Shoppers would see him sweeping away fag-ends and lob theirs right by him to collect. Strangers would call him “scum”.
It was humiliation, on starvation wages. He would crawl into supermarket skips for food to take home, keep his eyes peeled for dropped coins. Sometimes he would get caught. Once he tried over and again to pick up a 50-pence piece. Looking up, he saw a cluster of workers watching: they had superglued it to the ground. Now they were laughing. Then they chucked coppers at him. These memories Greg calls his “scars”. They are not the only things that stay with him. In one email, he told me: “I am still obsessed with money because I once had to shovel shit to earn it.” He didn’t mean it as a figure of speech. Over time, he took on more work: one day of teaching at Nottingham and another at a rival university. These were casual contracts: short-term, and paying him only by the hour. As such, they offered more experience than income. So he also did some gardening and, where possible, wrote for a local newspaper. He was pulling five jobs, working up to 70 hours a week. And he was still only making £22,000 to £23,000 a year before tax – below the national average. What’s exceptional about Greg’s story isn’t that he found himself in a precarious position – it’s how far he went to escape it. As the Guardian reports as part of a series on a new wave of workers in insecure positions, more than half of all academics in the UK are on some kind of casual contract. According to the latest official figures, 45% of all Nottingham staff either teaching students or teaching and researching count as casual labour. The vast majority of those are on “atypical” contracts. Like Greg, they may be paid by the hour to teach fee-paying undergraduates and mark their essays and exams.
It can be gruelling and insecure work. Before talking to Greg, I met Steven Parfitt. After five years of teaching history to undergraduates, he has still not got a permanent contract – despite excellent student feedback and a string of academic publications. A labour historian, he is in effect a 21st-century pieceworker, cobbling together casual jobs from different universities across the east Midlands. This semester, he will be teaching at Nottingham, Loughborough and Derby. “I sometimes spend more time on a train than I do teaching,” he says. Then there’s all the research he must do to have a hope of some day landing a permanent position. For all this he earns less than £10,000 a year. In five years he has not had a single above-inflation pay rise. During the long summer holidays, when there is no teaching or marking to be had, he relies on his partner for income. He holds out no hope of buying a home or of starting a family. At 31, many of the rites of passage of adulthood are off-limits. Originally from Auckland, Parfitt once worked as a sorter for the New Zealand postal services. That was years back, yet it paid “comfortably more” than he earns now. Tell Greg this and he nods: “I had more rights as a litter-picker than I had as a lecturer on fixed contracts. Because at least I got holidays as a litter-picker.” What marks him out are two things. First, he had no one to turn to for extra funds. His wife was too ill to earn much and his parents were also hard up. Despite that, he wanted to cling on to his threadbare middle-class lifestyle: the house, the car, the TV. Most of all, “I craved security. I had to make sure I wouldn’t be cast further down.”
So he would “wake like a frightened rabbit” at 2.45am and get into work for about 3.30am. In the dark and cold and wet, he would clean the retail park. Just before the shoppers came, he would go home, run a bath and fall asleep there. He would wake up with a shiver when the water went cold. “That was the signal to get in a suit, get in my car and get to Nottingham.” He would park up, catnap in the car for another 20 minutes – then begin a day’s teaching. He talks about it like an actor putting on face paint and striding onstage. “You were putting on someone else who was bright and cheery and engaging. Never any looking back.” In a timetable that allowed him almost no time to himself, he had one personal ritual. On the mornings he drove up the hill into Nottingham’s beautiful campus, he would put on What I Do by Alan Jackson and sing along. “Corny country and western,” he tells me. Afterwards, I had a listen. It’s a simple lyric about holding on to one’s dreams that begins: “I’ve been a waiter, a roofer, a clerk / I’ve shovelled manure till my pride hurt.” It ends: “So I count my blessings when I step up to sing / Cause there are so many people who would give anything / To do what I do.” Neither of Greg’s parents went to university, and now he was doing the most menial jobs to pay for an academic career. For someone who even now doesn’t feel like he belongs in “snobbish” higher education, it must have been so tempting to give up on his dreams and get something steadier. That song reminded him “how privileged I am to have managed to get a job here. To get my foot in the door.” Besides, there were “a hundred talented people” with PhDs and publications who could take his place. “You’re so fearful.” Greg is proud of his university, Nottingham. It is one of the biggest and most prestigious in Britain. It is expanding fast – into China, Malaysia and academy schools. School visitors on open days are shown a new £40m sports centre, complete with a 200-machine “fitness suite”. Nearby is a swanky hotel, also built by the university. Last year, the vice-chancellor, Sir David Greenaway, received a total pay and pension package of £381,000. Last year, this charitable enterprise made a surplus of £25m. In 2014, it also racked up a £25m surplus. Looking at all these millions, critics of the university’s vast “reserve army” of academic labour argue that it could afford to turn many of those contract positions into permanent jobs.
Instead, it gives UK undergraduates paying £9,000 a year in tuition fees (and thousands more in living costs) teachers who may not even be earning that much. Just like Greg or Parfitt, they may be juggling different classes on entirely different courses at universities hundreds of miles apart. There is some evidence to suggest that the low pay and insecure employment of the academics is affecting the education for which students are paying so much.
I have seen sections of a recent private survey of Nottingham teaching staff on casual contracts, undertaken by the local branch of the University and College Union. Like Greg, many of the respondents stress that they give their best, however much it costs. One comment reads: “Either you stick to the hours you are contracted to work and provide substandard teaching for your students, or you put in extra hours, effectively reduce your hourly rate of pay, and try to be good at your job.” But others admit they cannot perform as well as they would like. “The lack of value that I feel towards me is passed on in my feelings towards the students’ education,” writes one. “I have heard people complaining about the fact that they are paid 10 minutes to correct one exam, therefore they will use only 10 minutes to read them,” says another. A third describes being “definitely much less inclined to go the extra mile in terms of preparing for a class”. I asked the University of Nottingham how its use of casual labour affected both teachers and students. It issued a statement that reads in part: “In order for Nottingham to succeed in a globally competitive environment, it is essential that we retain the ability to operate with part of our workforce in a flexible mode to enable us to adjust and respond to changes in demand.” Like the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, it also argues that, measured by hours worked, casual academic staff are far outnumbered by full-timers. But the comparison is only superficially revealing: if a casual teaches for one day a week, he or she only counts as about one-fifth of a full timer. The whole frustration for people like Greg and Parfitt is that they can’t get full-time jobs. Trying to make an impossible situation possible, Greg finally broke down. After two years on five jobs, he fell seriously ill. He quit the litter-picking and, years later, he still won’t shop in that retail park. The teaching he carried on in a state of “permanent exhaustion”. The stress and worry also contributed to the end of his marriage. “I would shout a lot and I was angry.” Then, after over a decade at Nottingham, it offered him a permanent position. “You’re meant to feel grateful you’ve escaped,” he says. “Then you think: can I ease off a little bit now? Just a little bit?”"
2016-11-16T15:15:36Z,uk-news,UK news,"Croydon tram going three times speed limit when it derailed, investigators say","A tram that derailed in Croydon, killing seven people, was travelling at more than three times the speed limit when it overturned on a sharp bend, according to investigators. Data from the black box recorder showed that the tram was travelling at a speed of approximately 43mph when it entered the curve, having slowed only slightly and too late from the 50mph it was travelling at in a tunnel just before. The interim report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) says that there was no apparent defect in either the tram’s brakes or the track. It was dark and raining heavily at the time of the incident. However, some expected evidence has not been available to investigators. Although the tram was fitted with forward-facing and internal CCTV cameras, the equipment was apparently not working at the time of the crash. The RAIB said its investigations into what caused the tram to crash would continue, but it recommended that the speed limit zone should be extended and further signs put in place on the curve, in the meantime. Six men and one woman were killed and 51 people were injured when the south London Tramlink tram crashed on 9 November. The two-carriage tram was travelling in a 12mph speed limit zone as it exited the tunnel on to a sharp left turn just before the Sandilands tram stop.
The driver, Alfred Dorris, 42, from Beckenham, south-east London, was arrested and bailed on suspicion of manslaughter. Transport for London has offered to meet the costs of funerals for the seven people killed and pledged to do everything it can to support the families and all those affected. The passengers who died in the crash were Dane Chinnery, 19; Philip Seary, 57; Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35; Philip Logan, 52; and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington; and Mark Smith, 35, and Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon. Tram accidents on such a scale have been rare in Britain, with the last passenger death in a crash having occurred in 1959. But since the crash MPs have called for the RAIB to consider whether safety systems that exist on national rail and tube networks, such as automatic braking, should be implemented for trams or light rail too. As well as the RAIB investigation into the causes of the crash, British Transport Police are conducting a criminal inquiry, while the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, is examining whether there were any breaches of health and safety law. Earlier, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, paid tribute at City Hall to emergency services who responded to the crash, and the generosity of Londoners in supporting families of the victims. He added: “A small but united community in Croydon has been rocked by this horrific incident and we must do all we can to support them, as they fully come to terms with what has taken place.” He said that it was vital to learn lessons from the crash to ensure safety and “restore Londoners’ confidence” in the tram network. Tfl said engineers had now repaired all track and other equipment and operated trams over the repaired section. London’s transport commissioner, Mike Brown, said: “We will follow the RAIB’s advice and, before service is resumed, will implement additional temporary speed restrictions and associated signage near Sandilands to supplement existing safety arrangements. “We are continuing to carry out a thorough safety assessment and are taking the advice of an independent panel of tram experts. We will only resume services for the local community once that rigorous assurance process has been completed.” Tramlink’s operator, FirstGroup, said it was “working with TfL to follow the RAIB’s advice and provide clear instruction on this to our drivers”. The rail drivers’ union Aslef called for TfL to take over direct running of the service to put in place modern safety systems and implement any recommendations from the RAIB. Finn Brennan, Aslef’s district organiser, said: ‘‘While individuals will be held accountable for their actions, it is clear that the lack of adequate safety systems were at the root of this dreadful accident. “On the mainline railway, or London Underground, long established, tried and tested technology such as train protection warning system or automatic train protection is in place to ensure that a train traveling too quickly in a potentially dangerous area will be slowed and stopped. This technology is not in place on Tramlink. If it had been then this awful event could have been avoided.” The tram network in south London runs for 17 miles, partly on streets and partly on the kind of segregated railway where the crash occurred. More than 27 million passengers travelled on Tramlink last year."

The intervention by John Larkin, QC the region’s top law officer, means the supreme court may review last month’s decision in the court of appeal in Belfast, which upheld a guilty verdict against Ashers Bakery. The Northern Ireland appeal court will hear the attorney general’s application next Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office confirmed Larkin had used powers granted to him via the Northern Ireland devolution settlement to seek a hearing in the highest court in the UK to reconsider the judgments of both the high court and appeal court in the province. She told the Belfast Telegraph on Wednesday: “I can confirm that an application for leave to appeal to the supreme court has been listed for hearing on 22 November.” This is the second time Larkin has intervened in the case. An earlier appeal this year was suspended on a point of law that Larkin raised. In October, appeal judges in Belfast upheld a judgment made last year that Ashers Bakery had discriminated against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation. • This article was amended on 17 November 2016 to correct and clarify details of the 22 November hearing. An earlier version said incorrectly that it was at the supreme court."

Disruption was caused to cross-Channel ferries as a 500-metre cordon was placed around the unexploded German bomb found in Portsmouth harbour in Hampshire on Wednesday. As the ordnance was towed out of the harbour and into the Solent, the nearby Gunwharf Quays shopping centre as well as the Portsmouth historic dockyard – home to HMS Victory and the Mary Rose Museum – were evacuated as a precaution, along with residential areas in Old Portsmouth. The bomb was towed to an area east of the Isle of Wight where a controlled explosion was carried out by the navy’s Fleet Diving squadron at 4pm.
An area of restricted airspace was also established until the bomb had been destroyed. The discovery came after a 1,100lb German bomb was found at the end of September by the dredging barge, which caused the nearby Gunwharf Quays retail and leisure centre to be evacuated. A torpedo was also found earlier in September. Del McKnight, the squadron’s commanding officer, said: “Last year we had more than 450 callouts around the UK so this is really business as usual for us. “We’ve had more callouts to Portsmouth than we would usually see because of the extent of the dredging works being done to make way for HMS Queen Elizabeth, but we have teams on standby at 10 minutes’ notice around the UK ready to deal with these things.” A navy spokesman said: “The device was found by a dredging barge carrying out work in the harbour before the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth – the Navy’s new 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier – into the naval base next spring.”"
2016-11-16T17:41:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Qatar wins approval to turn US embassy in London into hotel,"The Qatari royal family’s property company has won approval to turn the US embassy in London into a luxury hotel. Westminster council agreed Qatari Diar Real Estate’s plan for the Grade II-listed building in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, on Tuesday. The nine floors, three of which are underground, will include up to 137 hotel rooms, shops, restaurants and bars. The US state department agreed to sell the building to Qatari Diar in 2009 to fund a new embassy in the Nine Elms regeneration project south of the Thames. Estimates put the Grosvenor Square site’s value at £500m before it was made a listed building, which would have reduced the value because of restrictions on development. Qatari Diar, part of the Qatari Investment Authority, has snapped up several high-profile London properties including the former Chelsea barracks, the former Olympic athletes’ village and most of Canary Wharf. Qatari investment interests also own Harrods and substantial stakes in Heathrow airport, Sainsbury’s, Barclays Bank and IAG, the parent company of British Airways.
Grosvenor Square has housed the US embassy since 1938, and during the second world war the square was known as Little America because it was Gen Dwight D Eisenhower’s headquarters and other US operations were based there. The current embassy, topped by a gilded bald eagle with a wingspan of more than 11 metres, opened in 1960 and was designed by the Finnish-American modernist Eero Saarinen. In March 1968, the embassy was the focal point for protest against the Vietnam war and was besieged by 10,000 demonstrators. After protesters broke through police lines, 200 were arrested and 50 people were treated in hospital. The opening of the new US embassy near Battersea power station, in south London, has been delayed and will take place during the presidency of Donald Trump, not Barack Obama’s as planned. Work was meant to finish in late 2016 but it is now scheduled for completion in spring 2017."
2016-11-16T17:53:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Police to interview Devon schoolboy who went missing,"A schoolboy who spent more than two months sleeping rough as he explored three of Britain’s biggest cities after fleeing his remote rural home faces interviews with police and local authority officials to check he did not come to any harm. Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, was reading George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London – the classic tale of living on a shoestring – when he vanished with just £350 and no electronic equipment. He finally returned following a nationwide police hunt and emotional appeals from his parents, explaining that he had been on an adventure and apologising for any trouble he had caused. He said: “I have spent the last 10 weeks exploring London, Birmingham and Manchester by foot, sleeping rough at night. “I am very grateful to everyone who has helped my family in trying to ensure my safe return. I apologise to the police for the time they spent looking for me and for the worry I have caused family and friends.” The boy was back at home with his parents, Caroline, an artist, and Jeremy Heeler-Frood, a cabinet maker, on Wednesday after finding his way back to Devon by train, where he was met on the platform by Devon and Cornwall police officers. He is expected to face questions from police, who routinely undertake a “safe and well check” when a missing child returns. The purpose is to find out if the child has suffered harm, where and with whom they have been, and to give them an opportunity to disclose any offending by or against them – though there is no suggestion Arthur has done anything wrong and his parents have said he is safe and well, if a little tired, smelly and grubby. Arthur may also take part in an independent child return interview. Such a meeting would also try to identify and deal with any harm the child may have suffered as well as understanding and addressing why he ran away. According to government guidance: “The interview provides an opportunity hear from the child about why they went missing and to understand the risks and issues faced by the child while missing.” Arthur is one of an estimated 100,000 children who go missing every year, a quarter of whom are judged to be at risk of serious harm. In a statement issued via Devon and Cornwall police, his parents said: “We are overjoyed to have Arthur home with us again – tired, grubby and rather smelly but otherwise none the worse for his experiences. We feel extremely lucky that he is safe and sound. “Many thanks to Devon and Cornwall police for their professionalism and their tireless search for Arthur. Thank you also to the media for their help in raising awareness of his disappearance and our deep gratitude to all our friends and family who have supported us through this difficult time. “We now wish to spend some time in private with Arthur to settle him back home and to make some plans for his future.” The teenager went missing after leaving his family home in a tucked-away valley near Axminster on the morning of Tuesday 6 September and failing to turn up at school. The next day a letter arrived in which he explained that he was bored with his life, asking them not to try to find him and promising to be back within the year. Speaking to the Guardian before his return, Ms Heeler-Frood said Arthur was an idealistic boy who liked the idea of adventure and may have been inspired by his older siblings, who had both travelled around Europe. But she said he had grown up in the countryside and was not streetwise. “He was bright and had a strong interest in current affairs and politics,” she said. “He was adventurous. He enjoyed all the Bear Grylls survival challenge programmes. For the last two summers his brother, Reuben, has hitchhiked across Europe. He travelled extensively into eastern Europe. His sister, Hester, went InterRailing. I think he was inspired by all that. “We think that he felt he wanted his own adventure. Hester was leaving for university and he was going to be the last one at home with us. I think he wasn’t looking forward to being left alone with us. I think he wanted to test himself, prove his abilities.” She said Arthur was an avid reader. “The book he was reading before he left was Down and Out in Paris and London. You wonder if that had been an influence. He was reading on a Kindle, which he left behind.” He appears to have been returning home on a train when he was spotted by a member of the public, who called the police, giving them the chance to get in place when he arrived at Honiton station, nine miles from home."

Sandra Major, the Batley and Spen MP’s constituency caseworker, told the Old Bailey on Wednesday: “She was shouting, ‘Get away, get away you two! Let him hurt me – don’t let him hurt you’.” She said the attacker had retreated after shooting and stabbing Cox but turned around and resumed his attack after hearing her shout. Thomas Mair, one of Cox’s constituents, is accused of killing her in Birstall, West Yorkshire. The court heard he had been captured on CCTV carrying out the attack, and that he had been arrested moments later while in possession of the knife and gun used to carry out the murder.
As Cox’s family watched from the back of the court, Major and Fazila Aswat, the MP’s assistant and office manager, described how she was repeatedly shot and stabbed in an attack that lasted seconds. The three women had driven to a meeting with constituents in the library at Birstall during the EU referendum campaign in June. Major told the court that as they climbed from the car she could see a man approaching. She said: “He had a gun in his hand. He raised his arm and shot Jo in the head. Then he got a knife out of his bag. It was black. “Jo was lying on the floor, and she sort of tried to sit up. He just started stabbing her while she was lying on the floor. Jo tried to get away. Fazila was shouting: ‘Get away from her, she’s got two little children.’ I was just screaming. I thought that if some people came, he might go away.” Cox tried to get to her feet but rolled off the pavement into the road, the court heard. At this point, Major said, the attacker threatened her and Aswat with the knife, and Cox shouted that they should save themselves. Major said: “He had started to walk away a little bit, but when Jo shouted out, he came back. He started stabbing her again. She was on the floor. She didn’t get up again.” Occasionally fighting back tears, Aswat said she first realised Cox had come under attack when she saw her lying on the ground. She said: “A man stood over her with a knife. I knew something was completely wrong. Then there was a gunshot. I said: ‘Jo, you need to run.’ She said: ‘I can’t run, I’m hurt.’ Then he came back.” Aswat, who told the jury that she retreated behind the Vauxhall Astra in which they had driven to the library, added: “I heard two further gunshots, and you could see his arm going to her. He actually shot her from close range, because he was standing over her. “It was at the end he stood up and said: ‘Britain first, Britain will always be first.’” In a statement read to the court, Bernard Carter-Kenny, a retired miner then aged 77, described how he was stabbed when he tried to help Cox. His statement said that he heard a bang he thought sounded like a gun but must have been a car backfiring. He added: “When I saw Jo roll into the road, I could see blood. I jumped out of the car. My first feeling was he was kicking her and brandishing a knife. She was on the floor and he had a knife in his hand. People were shouting: ‘Get help, get help.’” Carter-Kenny said he ran across and wanted to jump on the attacker’s shoulder. He said he saw a 9in “dagger” in his hands and that the attacker shoved it into his stomach. He said: “The blood started pouring out between my fingers. I saw the blood and I thought: ‘Oh my God’.” “I didn’t turn my back on him in case he came after me. I just flopped on to the steps of the sandwich shop. I was lying on the floor.” Aswat, who held Cox as she lay dying, said: “Jo was in my arms. It was probably only two or three minutes before the police and ambulance arrived but it felt like a lifetime.” Earlier, the Old Bailey heard that Mair had thrown his hands in the air and declared himself to be a “political activist” when approached by police moments after the attack. When he began to lower his hands, two unarmed officers tackled him to the ground. Craig Nicholls, a constable with West Yorkshire police, told the court that he and his colleague, PC Jonathan Wright, had been instructed to search for a man involved in the shooting. They saw Mair walking nearby, got out of their car and ordered him to drop the black holdall he was carrying, said Nicholls. “He put his arms up and just said: ‘It’s me,’” said Nicholls. “We ran towards him. He came to put his hands towards his shirt. We rugby-tackled him to the ground.” When Wright found a firearm in the holdall, Mair said: “I am a political activist,” according to Nicholls. Mair was handcuffed and arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. He was taken for treatment at Leeds General Infirmary for a head injury before being taken to a police station for questioning. Simon Russell Flint QC, defending, put it to Nicholls and Wright that Mair had not said anything to police at any time during his arrest. Both officers said he had.
The jury heard that police recovered a sawn-off .22 rifle from the bag. It contained two rounds in its magazine and a third in the chamber, and the safety catch was off. Two knives were also recovered and a plastic bag containing a number of .22 bullets was found in Mair’s pocket. Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, is charged with the murder of Cox, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to Carter Kenny. He declined to enter a plea when he appeared at the Old Bailey last month. As a result, not guilty pleas to all four charges were entered on his behalf. As the court viewed CCTV footage showing Mair’s movements on the day of the attack, the defendant sat in the dock, apparently ignoring the screens arranged around the room. The court heard Cox was shot three times and suffered 15 stab injuries. She was 41, and had two children, then aged five and three. She had been elected in 2015, and had supported the campaign to remain in the EU. In the days before the attack, Mair allegedly spent time in Birstall library, accessing a string of websites about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen-SS, Israel, matricide and serial killers. The jury heard Mair had also viewed Cox’s Twitter feed and looked at the Wikipedia entry for Ian Gow, the Conservative MP murdered by the IRA in 1990. The prosecution says Mair viewed pages about .22 ammunition, including one that offered an answer to the question: “Is a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human’s head?” Items later recovered from his home showed he had strong political and ideological interests, said Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting. The trial continues."
2016-11-16T19:24:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Pacifist white poppies: record sales this year,"White poppies, worn as a symbol of peace on remembrance day, sold in record numbers this year, exceeding all previous sales over the last 83 years. More than 110,000 white poppies were sold by shops and cafes, and ordered online across the country, in the run-up to 11 November. The Peace Pledge Union, which makes the poppies, was so overwhelmed by the demand it was unable to fulfil all the orders and thousands of people received an apology this week for not getting their artificial flowers.
Symon Hill, a coordinator for the union, said he was sorry that not everyone was able to get a white poppy, but celebrated the level of demand for what has become for many an alternative symbol for remembrance day. “It is really good news,” he said. “The last time we sold out was in the mid-80s when Margaret Thatcher made a statement in parliament expressing deep distaste for the white poppies. That led to the Daily Star attacking the white poppy campaign and we sold all our poppies. But back then that was 40,000.” In the last three years sales of white poppies have been gradually increasing, with the previous record of 110,000 set last year. “We are still crunching numbers but it is looking likely that we will exceed this in 2016. We have had a huge surge in demand and a big spike in orders. On one weekend alone we had more than 1,000 orders, that is without precedent, ” said Hill.
The biggest rise in demand came at the end of October, when the Royal British Legion launched its red poppy campaign. Hill said many on social media who tweeted using #whitepoppy commented on how they felt the campaign was too militarised and were seeking an alternative. In Exeter the Peace Shop had such demand it reordered its white poppies four times. Hill said next year the union would get its systems updated in order to meet the increased demand. Social media, used as part of the white poppy campaign for the first time in a concerted way this year, was partly responsible for the huge increase in sales, he said. “Many of those who were commenting were talking about a rise in hate crime and racism and how they wanted to wear something different to symbolise their opposition to all that this year.” White poppies were first distributed in 1933 by the Women’s Cooperative Guild, due to the concerns and conversations held between the partners of injured and dead soldiers from the first world war. Thatcher condemned the poppies as deeply distasteful during a prime minister’s questions session in 1986 following a question by Robert Key, MP for Salisbury, who expressed his disgust at the “insulting symbol”. This article was amended on 16 November 2016. It originally gave the name of the Peace Pledge Union coordinator as Symon Hall."
2016-11-17T00:01:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Justin Welby to help UK thinktank build vision of post-Brexit economy,"The archbishop of Canterbury will spend the next two years as part of a commission launched by a left-leaning thinktank that aims to rewrite the rules for Britain’s post-Brexit economy. Justin Welby will join other leading figures including the general secretary of the TUC, Frances O’Grady, and the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, Sir Charlie Mayfield, on the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) programme that will seek remedies for six key UK weaknesses. Launching its commission on Thursday, the IPPR said the apparent success of the economy masked fundamental problems: weak investment compared with rival countries; a huge trade deficit; a budget deficit that would get bigger as the population ages; the capture of the fruits of growth by a small minority; the gap between the south-east and the rest of the country; and poor progress in meeting the UK’s climate change ambitions. The IPPR said none of the six problems identified were a recent phenomenon, with each getting worse for at least a quarter of a century. Tom Kibasi, the IPPR director, said: “The economy belongs to us all but it isn’t working for everyone. We need a new national economic vision and policy that the whole country can get behind. “The Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump shows we must build an economy with economic justice at its heart. The problems we face aren’t temporary weaknesses in an otherwise sound model. “The foundations of our economy need to be rethought and the rules of the economy need to be rewritten. We need big, bold and ambitious change. Rethinking by half just won’t do.” The thinktank said a specially commissioned YouGov poll showed that 51% of Britons thought the UK economy was unfair for the majority. The IPPR’s move has echoes of the thinktank’s commission on social justice, which deliberated in the 1990s and was seen as preparing the ground for Tony Blair’s government when it came to power in 1997. The IPPR believes its new investigation into Britain’s deep-seated problems will also be of interest to the government, which has said it wants to make the economy work for the whole country. Sources said Downing Street was keenly interested in the commission’s work. Welby said: “I am very pleased and honoured to be part of the commission on economic justice. I believe this is a unique opportunity to reflect on the vision for our economy for the next 20 years and, in a time of significant change and uncertainty, seek to put our economy on a foundation of values and virtues. “I am hopeful that this commission’s work can lead to a tangible and hopeful set of recommendations, that go beyond party politics and make the case for an economy that delivers for the common good.”"
2016-11-17T10:33:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Durham teaching assistants to strike for second time over pay cuts,"Teaching assistants in County Durham are to strike for a second time in a month over a new contract that unions say could result in their pay being cut by nearly a quarter. The committee of County Durham Teaching Assistants Activists announced on Wednesday that the 48-hour industrial action would take place on 23 and 24 November. More than 100 schools across the county, mostly primaries and nurseries, were affected by strike action earlier this month, with 43 closing completely and others being forced to cancel lessons or close partially. The walkout follows a long-running dispute over plans by Durham county council to sack 2,700 classroom assistants and re-employ them on termtime-only contracts, which their unions claim could result in them losing up to 23% of their already modest salary. The cuts, approved by the Labour-led council in May, initially included one year’s compensation for loss of earnings, and were revised in September to include a “final offer” of two years’ compensation. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) has accused the council of forcing low-paid teaching assistants to choose between a pay cut of up to 23% if they do not agree to work longer hours, and a 10% pay cut if they agree to longer hours. Union bosses say this would make teaching assistants in Durham some of the lowest paid in the north-east. The ATL says that some teaching assistants in Stockton-on-Tees and Newcastle-upon-Tyne earn £3,363 to £4,501 more a year than their counterparts in Durham. Durham county council has said that it has to alter the teaching assistants’ contracts or it will face equal pay claims from other staff working in schools. A joint statement from the unions representing the teaching assistants said: “This decision is not one that has been taken lightly, but when we have seen how much others value us, it is only fair that our employers do too. We simply ask to be regraded to mitigate our losses and have never asked for more.” Councillor Jane Brown, Durham county council’s cabinet member for corporate services, said she was extremely disappointed to hear about the second round of industrial action. “It is particularly frustrating given that, despite offering to talk to Unison again last week, further industrial action has been announced,” she said. “We appeal to the unions and the teaching assistants not to progress with this action but equally we would hope that, as was the case last time, the vast majority of schools will be open and the majority of teaching assistants will be at work as normal.”"
2016-11-17T12:45:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish galleries in Â£4m drive to buy Monarch of the Glen painting,"Scotland’s national galleries are to launch a £4m fundraising campaign to buy the famous painting Monarch of the Glen, after brokering a knockdown price with its current owner, Diageo. The multinational drinks company, which has owned the work by Sir Edwin Landseer for decades, has agreed to gift half the painting’s estimated value of £8m after initially planning to sell it on the open market to the highest bidder. The Monarch of the Glen, which was painted in 1851 and depicts a royal stag – one with 12 points on its antlers – standing in a mist-hung Highland glen, is one of the most recognisable and widely reproduced “Scottish” paintings. For its admirers, it has come to exemplify the romance, natural beauty and nobility of the Highlands, yet Landseer was English and it was commissioned for the House of Lords in London. It had been due to be auctioned at Christie’s next month with a potential price of £10m or more. Bidding was expected to be fierce, raising the strong chance the piece would end up in a private collection overseas unless the government placed a temporary export bar on it to allow a British buyer to come forward. The deal will instead bring the piece into public ownership for the first time, and allow the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) to put the painting on permanent display. It has been on long-term loan from Diageo for the past 17 years to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Sir John Leighton, the director general of NGS, said he was delighted by Diageo’s “grand gesture”. “It offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this major work to be acquired for the nation,” Leighton said. “The Monarch of the Glen is an iconic image which is famous across the world. The ideal home for such an important and resonant picture is the Scottish National Gallery where it can be enjoyed and admired by millions of visitors in the context of the nation’s unrivalled collection of Scottish, British and European art.”
The piece ended up in the hands of Diageo, the biggest producer of scotch whisky and one of the world’s largest drinks companies, following a series of mergers. It had been a trademark for Dewar’s and then Glenfiddich whiskies. The oil painting had been on display in London in an exhibition celebrating Christie’s 250th anniversary: the auction house had first sold it 100 years ago, the last time in its 160 years in private and corporate hands that it had gone on the open market. Christie’s has supported the new deal to hand it to the NGS. When the proposed auction was announced earlier this month, Peter Brown, Christie’s international head of Victorian and pre-Raphaelite art, described the artwork as “one of the greatest pictures of the 19th century and known worldwide”. “Yes, of course it has a universal currency in that it has been so widely reproduced,” he said. “But it is an extraordinarily masterful piece of painting … the brushwork is superb, the way the mist parts round the beast, the dew on the antlers, the realisation of fur, the way the heather sparkles in the morning light. “There is an incredible sense of command and destiny there and it is those qualities that lift it out of the ordinary and make it so beloved.”"

2016-11-17T13:59:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Number of care workers on zero-hours contracts jumps to one in seven,"The number of care workers on zero-hours contracts has jumped from one in 10 of the sector’s workforce to one in seven in the past year, according to an analysis of official data.
The increasing use of zero-hours contracts is revealed as a trade union boss described the abuse of minimum wage laws in the care sector as “endemic”. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said hourly pay was often reduced to levels below the legal minimum because care workers who visited the homes of those needing help to live independently were paid only for time spent with each client. They receive no pay for time spent travelling between appointments. “Without this exploitation and the sheer dedication of the workforce, the social care system would collapse,” Prentis said. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that between April and June this year, about 113,000 of the 769,000 workers who provided at-home care for vulnerable people or were employed in care homes were on contracts with no guaranteed hours. At approximately one in seven, that total represents a substantial and rapid increase on 2015, when one in 10 care workers were on zero-hours deals.
The analysis is published as part of a Guardian series investigating the increasing number of people in precarious work in the UK. Earlier this week it was revealed that more than one in five workers, or 7.1 million people, now work in conditions where they could lose their jobs suddenly. Prentis accused HMRC of failing in its duty to ensure that workers receive the minimum wage. “The abuse of minimum wage laws is endemic across the homecare sector because the non-payment of travel time drags already low wages below legal minimums,” he said. “HMRC is meant to ensure all employers comply with the law, but it is failing to do so.”
The union is particularly concerned about underpayment to workers who travel to people’s homes to prepare food, get them in and out of bed, and help with other tasks that allow them to live independently. These workers are often paid an hourly rate – but only for the time they are in people’s homes. Time spent travelling between appointments is not paid. Workers who are paid less than legal minimums – £7.20 a hour for those aged over 25 – can take their complaints to Acas, which will refer them to HMRC to investigate. More than 130 care firms are currently under the scrutiny of HMRC; in the two years to 31 March 2016, it found employees were owed almost £1m in missed pay as a result of breaches of minimum wage law. The Labour MP Paul Blomfield, who has raised the issue of care workers’ wages in parliament, said he believed the practice of not paying workers for the time they needed to travel between visits was widespread. Blomfield said he knew of one resident in his Sheffield constituency who was “crisscrossing” the city to visit clients but not paid for her journey time: “She was working for eight hours or so, but being paid only for four hours.” Prentis said the government, HMRC and councils all knew that non-payment for travel time was commonplace. He called on the government to “ensure that pay laws are properly enforced and give social care the resources it needs in this month’s autumn statement”. Blomfield also criticised HMRC for not having a formal process to revisit employers who had flouted minimum wage laws and for dealing only with the complaint of the employee who had raised a concern about their wages – rather than checking the payments received by all employees of offending firms. In a letter to Jane Ellison, financial secretary to the Treasury, the MP says: “From the 36 social-care employers that have been named and shamed to date, 21 of these employers have had just one worker identified as being owed arrears.” He added: “There is a likelihood that other care workers at these providers may not have been paid what they are historically owed, and so checks on their position would seem appropriate.”
Haringey council and the care agency Sevacare are currently facing a case brought by 17 employees who say they were earning as little as £3.27 an hour for providing live-in care or visiting people’s homes. Sevacare said it paid the staff “an average hourly rate, that is at least the minimum wage. Earlier this year Sevacare was involved in another case where a care worker in Manchester was awarded more than £3,000 for unpaid hours while making house visits. Judith Montgomery, the care worker who brought that case, said she regularly spent longer than the scheduled appointments and did a 50-hour week for 30 hours’ pay. “In a 15-minute appointment you would be expected to get somebody up, get them washed and dressed, give them their medication and fill in the paperwork,” she said. “You could be there for 25 or 30 minutes but you would only be getting paid for 15.” Unison’s Prentis said cases like Montgomery’s were rare, but only because it was so often difficult to decipher the information on payslips. “Cases against employers are rare because payslips are so difficult to understand, and the widespread use of zero-hours means employees are reluctant to complain, for fear their hours may be taken away.” Blomfield has also met with the government as part of a move to make payslips easier to read. In some cases payment advice runs over many pages and can be almost impenetrable. On one typical payslip seen by the Guardian, a worker appeared to be listed making two visits at the same time.
A number of care workers told the Guardian that their hours – and income – could fluctuate markedly and reported they were afraid of taking time off, even to deal with family crises, in case they upset their employers and lost shifts as a result. Citizens Advice said it had heard from many workers in the sector who had problems linked to the insecurity of their jobs. Gillian Guy, chief executive of the charity, said: “Not knowing what hours you’re working from one week to the next, or how much money you will lose to travel costs, can make it very difficult to manage household finances. It can also cause problems with other aspects of money management, such as whether you can get a mortgage or even commit to a mobile phone contract.” According to the UK Home Care Association, which represents care providers, councils need to pay agencies £16.70 an hour to cover the cost of paying workers and provide enough profit to keep the businesses sustainable. The average paid by councils which provided data was only £14.58. Blomfield said: “We can’t allow care workers to be bearing the brunt for decisions made way above their heads about how much we are willing to pay for social care.” A HMRC spokesman said: “All businesses, irrespective of their size or business sector, are responsible for paying the correct minimum wage to their staff. HMRC continues to crack down on employers who ignore the law. At the start of the year HMRC had 130 open investigations into care providers as a result of complaints made by employees and as a result of our targeted enforcement campaign, ensuring that care workers receive the wages they are entitled to. As part of this we are taking targeted action against some of the biggest social care providers. “If anyone is concerned that they are not receiving the minimum wage, they can contact ACAS, in confidence, on 0300 123 1100. The Acas helpline is open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 8am to 8pm, Tuesday 8am to 6pm, and Saturday 9am to 1pm. Cases can be dealt with anonymously, with no risk of employees being identified.”"
2016-11-17T13:59:58Z,uk-news,UK news,A day in the life of a care worker: 23 house calls in 12 hours for £64.80,"It’s 6.30am and still dark, and Jean is setting out for her job as a home care worker. When she returns in 12 hours’ time she will have made 23 house calls to sick and elderly people, driven 20 miles between appointments and earned £64.80 before tax. Jean isn’t her real name. Along with fellow care workers in this northern town she is on a zero-hours contract and fears losing work if her employer is unhappy with her. She fears that speaking out about how she has to race between visits, cutting short her appointments in order to earn the “national living wage”, might result in an immediate loss of earnings.
Jean is one of an army of care workers who go into people’s homes every day to help with tasks that enable them to keep living independently. As the population ages it is a growing industry, and more than 600,000 people are now employed in the care sector. Those working on the frontline – often for agencies working on council contracts – do jobs such as preparing food, making beds, prompting people to take their medication and tidying up. These jobs are often advertised on minimal rates of pay, and typically they involve no guaranteed working hours. The agency, as she describes it, is a hard taskmaster. “I leave home at half six and I’ll probably get home at about seven and I’ll get about £270 a week,” she says. “The clients are all lovely and sometimes you go out of your way to do more for them, but it’s hard because there’s no time to get from one place to the next.” Jean works 12 days on and two days off. Her list of appointments comes through on a Friday but can change during the week as people are discharged from hospital and added to her client list, or admitted to hospital and removed. She may also be asked to cover a colleague’s visits if they are off. With a zero-hours contract, there is no minimum guarantee of work, and Jean’s days can shrink or grow. She cannot be sure from one day to the next how long she will work or how much she will earn. It can even change while she is on a shift: on the day that I trailed her she was expecting a six-hour shift in the morning but saw an appointment disappear from the roster on her phone while she was at another house. That meant she was instantly down £1.80 on the amount she expected to earn for the day. “Probably once a week you get a cancellation or they will ring you up and ask, ‘Can you do extra?,’” she says. Some agencies offer higher rates of pay than Jean is on, but the tendency to offer zero-hours contracts still causes problems for workers. One care worker on the London living wage of £9.40 an hour told the Guardian that her weekly pay fell by almost £70 after she lost seven hours’ work. The cuts to shifts come as patients die or are taken into hospital, and workers can wait weeks to be allocated new visits. In her role as a care worker Jean visits some homes three times a day, making breakfast, lunch and tea, and providing some of her clients with their only human contact all day. Her phone roster lists the jobs scheduled for the day and the length of each appointment. Typically there is a mix of 15-minute and 30-minute visits, although sometimes she is booked at a house for longer. Councils typically pay agencies for visiting time. When Jean arrives at a house she swipes her phone to say she has arrived, and she swipes again when she leaves. She is paid for the time that is shown on the roster, rather than how long she is actually providing care. The phone tracks her movements throughout the day. The roster allows no time for travel between appointments – and she is not paid for it. To stay with each client for the full appointment time and make it to the next one on time would require some kind of teleporter – in reality she has to cut every one of them short so that she can leave the house, sometimes put a key back into a safe, get back in her car and travel to the next address. As a result, sometimes appointments scheduled for 30 minutes actually last only 20 so she can stay on schedule. “I’m going to be running around like a headless chicken later,” she says, looking at the afternoon’s roster of short appointments. On the day I shadow Jean, she works nine hours over two shifts and takes home £7.20 an hour for that time – exactly the national living wage, but only because she cuts appointments short to travel between clients. She says it is a good day. The morning appointments are straightforward and with people she has visited before, so she knows where they live and how to find things in their homes. But it is not always like that. “If I have a new patient I have to read the care plan, so that takes longer,” she says. “And I’m often in a home for longer than is scheduled. If I have to call an ambulance for someone I have to wait for it to arrive and I don’t get paid for that time. If I go over by five, 10, 15 minutes on a call then I don’t get paid for that.” For Jean and other care workers, payment for transport expenses is erratic. She gets some money for petrol, she explains, but the amount varies and is never more than £10 a week. Business insurance cover for her car, along with wear and tear, all add to her costs. In London, one worker told the Guardian she received 56p to cover a week’s visits to a patient done by bus and on foot. A single fare costs £1.50. For Jean, there are larger concerns than transport costs. It is stressful work, she says, and she feels she has little support. One of the worst things, she says, is the isolation. “It’s a lonely job,” she says – while she may see her colleagues driving past to their calls, she rarely has a chance to speak to them. “You are in the car on your own, you get to people’s houses and often face problems on your own. They tell you all of their worries and then you take them home. Often at night I’m tossing and turning worrying about them.” But despite this she says: “I love my job – I’m completely attached to it.”"
2016-11-17T14:48:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jo Cox killer walked away calmly after brutal attack, court told","The man who murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox walked away from the crime as though he “didn’t have a care in the world” after shooting and repeatedly stabbing and kicking her, the Old Bailey has heard. Witnesses told the court that he held passersby at bay with a long-bladed dagger before cocking his firearm, shooting the politician as she lay on the ground and then stabbing her several times more. Tracy Bywood, who was at work in a care home overlooking the scene of the murder, said the attacker calmly left the scene. “He was just so peaceful. He was just so calm as if he hadn’t done anything wrong.” The attacker looked “cold”, and “just walked away” said another witness, Stephen Connolly. A third, David Honeybell, said: “He just walked away as if he didn’t have a care in the world.” Many of the witnesses said they initially had difficulty comprehending what they were seeing and hearing. Clarke Rothwell, a publican, said that when he heard the first gunshot while driving through the market town of Birstall in West Yorkshire, he thought it was a car’s engine backfiring. Adam Howard, working across the road at his family’s accountancy firm, said he thought he must have heard a car crash. Bywood initially thought she was overhearing a domestic dispute. Connolly, who was inside the town library, said: “It sounded like a gun, but the rational side of me said: ‘No, this is Birstall.’ You expect that to happen in other cities, you don’t expect something to happen like that in a little market town in West Yorkshire.” He stepped out of the library and saw the attack in progress. “He cocked what looked like a lump of wood, and although I couldn’t see Jo’s face – I didn’t want to see more than I had to – he shot her in the head.” Rashid Hussain, a taxi driver, walked up to the assailant when he saw him stabbing his local MP, thrusting the knife from different angles. “I said: ‘What are you doing, what has she done to you? What’s wrong with you?’ He said: ‘Move back or I’m going to stab you.’” The attacker fired two shots and then said “Britain first”, said Hussain. “I was trying to call the police and ambulance, but I was so nervous I couldn’t even dial the number. When I did I said: ‘Our MP Jo Cox has been stabbed.’ They said: ‘Are you sure?’ I said: ‘Yes, I know her.’” Some of the witnesses also described how what they saw has affected their lives. Bywood said she saw the attacker wrap his victim’s hair around his hand as he tried to drag her off the pavement to a place between two parked cars. “She went down on the floor like a sack of potatoes. It was awful to see a lady get such animosity towards her. It was horrible, what I saw. This man destroyed my life.” The jury heard a 14-minute recording of a 999 call that one witness, Darren Playford, made after seeing the attack on Cox. After explaining that people had been shot and stabbed, and asking that police be rushed to the scene, Playford could be heard catching his breath before telling the operator that he was watching the attacker walk away from the scene. At one point, Playford informed the operator that the gunman had disappeared behind a pub, The Vault. When the gunman emerged moments later, Playford told her that he was no longer wearing his jacket, and had switched his white baseball cap for a black one. She urged him to be concerned for his own safety, telling him that if necessary he should run, hide or barricade himself inside a building. Thomas Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, is alleged to have been the attacker. The court has heard that the attack was captured on CCTV. He is charged with the murder of Cox, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence and possession of a dagger, and the grievous bodily harm of a passerby, Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, who was stabbed in the stomach but survived. Mair declined to plead during a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey last month. As a result, not guilty pleas to all four charges were entered on his behalf. The court has heard that Cox was shot twice in the head, once in the abdomen and suffered 15 stab wounds. She died at the scene. She was 41, married with two children, aged three and five at the time, and had represented the local constituency, Batley and Spen, since 2015. Several witnesses say they heard the attacker say “Britain first” and “this is for Britain”. Subsequent examination of computers that he used at the town’s library showed that in the days before Cox was killed he had accessed a number of websites about Nazis, far-right politicians, Israel, the Ku Klux Klan, and shooting people in the head with .22 ammunition. The trial continues."
2016-11-17T15:23:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Rail passengers claiming compensation for delays to be given an easier ride,"Claiming compensation for delays will be made easier for rail passengers, ministers have pledged, as figures showed that £45m was paid out last year for late-running trains – although two in three eligible passengers still do not make claims. The government said passengers were more willing and able than ever before to obtain fair compensation for delays or cancellations. According to surveys from the consumer group Transport Focus, the proportion of eligible passengers claiming compensation has almost trebled over the past three years, from 12% in 2013 to 35% this year. Some train operating companies, such as C2C and Virgin, have introduced automatic repayments for delays for customers who have smartcards or have booked specific journeys by credit card. But the majority of passengers still do not claim for delays. A 15-minute threshold for compensation is to be introduced on commuter services, starting with the long-suffering passengers on Southern’s franchise, which has the worst performance record of any in the country. The rail minister, Paul Maynard, told the Commons that the 15-minute rule would be included in all future rail franchises, while the Department for Transport would look to bring it in during this parliament for other regions. Maynard said: “We are determined to ensure passengers are confident in the service and value they will get if they choose to travel by rail. Of course, we must constantly strive to improve punctuality but if things go wrong, passengers need to know that they will be compensated fairly. “We have been working with partners in the rail industry to ensure passengers are aware of their right to recompense for disruption and, at the same time, we are making the claim process simpler and swifter so that it is easier and more attractive to apply.” Responding to a super-complaint by the consumer group Which? that prompted an investigation by the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, ministers said they wanted the industry to make “rapid progress” in telling passengers about their rights and how to claim. It will also encourage direct cash refunds rather than rail vouchers. Transport Focus found that 57% of 7,000 eligible passengers they surveyed were still not aware they could claim compensation for delays, or did not think about it, and only 38% thought the train company had done enough to inform them. The watchdog’s chief executive, Anthony Smith, said: “The rail industry has made some improvements in telling passengers what they are due after delays, but they still have a way to go. Another obstacle is the perceived effort involved in claiming. Train companies now need to do more to make it easier for passengers to claim.”"
2016-11-17T16:02:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Why are there so few women working behind the scenes in Scottish political life?,"With women leading three of the parties in the Scottish parliament, and a female first minister committed to legislating for gender balance, equality campaigners could be forgiven for taking their foot off the gas. But Women 50:50, Scotland’s campaign for equal representation in parliament, councils and public boards, has proved herself admirably unwilling to rest on her laurels, and on Wednesday evening held a revealing and energetic debate titled Backroom Boys, looking a why so few women hold powerful positions behind the scenes in Scotland’s political life. Ahead of the debate, Women 50:50 released a set of figures highlighting the scale of the problem: 59 different people have been government special advisers since 1999; 13 have been women there were 6 women out of 31 special advisers during the Labour/Lib Dem coalitions (19%) the SNP have had 7 female special advisors out of 28 (25%) first minister, Nicola Sturgeon has 33% female special advisers the first Holyrood parliamentary session under Donald Dewar had no female special advisers. Commenting on the figures, Talat Yaqoob, chair and co-founder of Women 5050, said: “Having women at every level of politics in Scotland is the only way we can ensure real representation and inclusiveness, but we need them beyond the chamber. The influencers behind the scenes are, in the main, men, we need women in these positions influencing policy and decision making”. The evening was chaired by Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale with a panel of speakers including writer, broadcaster and former newspaper editor Lesley Riddoch, Valerie Livingston, former SNP Westminster press officer turned political consultant and Natalie Coupar, former Scottish Liberal Democrat staffer, now comms manager.
Lesley Riddoch called on her experience of both print and broadcast journalism to ask what we want from spads, and why women are deemed not to measure up. Some - though not all - women remain unwilling to put their heads above the parapet when it comes to opinions, she suggested, perhaps because opinionated women tend to be treated differently to their male counterparts, not least in terms of online response. But women are aware of the world outside the room, said Riddoch, and thus often attracted to activism rather than formal politics: so their experience is not valued, or else their areas of experience are not represented in formal politics. Many of the women present nodded along when Riddoch also raised the obvious point that backroom jobs - be that political advisers or news editors - demand 24-7 attendance: “No human being wants to do that for long, and women are more prone to being human.” Valerie Livingston, who walked away from the Westminster bubble to start her own business, with all the flexibility and autonomy that brings, recalled how little sense of career progression she had: “Undoubtedly politics can be very macho but a bigger problem is failure to develop staff.” This was echoed by Natalie Coupar who said that now she was working in the private sector, with appraisals and support structures and standard interviewing procedures to prevent bias, she’s amazed by how things were done in the world of politics, with no formalised processes for championing diversity and inclusion. Coupar added that she often found herself to be the only woman in the room, and noted that when she joined the Scottish Lib Dems there was only one female print journalist in the Holyrood press corridor (this has since increased to roughly a quarter, something that the newly formed Women in Journalism Scotland is also hoping to tackle). Couper recalled “those moments when you’re in a meeting and you look up and go ‘wow, this is history and its also all men!” But she also emphasised the need to be hopeful: “the most most dangerous message to go out from tonight is that its too difficult.” Steering the conversation towards some practical conclusions, Dugdale first asked whether 50:50 in elected positions was still the right focus: “We need to get women behind the scenes too, is there too much focus on public-facing roles?” Likewise, she and other women discussed the problem of “the pipeline”, ie how to make sure that women are ready to step up into those roles, and in particular how to make mentoring expansive enough to reach BME and working class women who are so appallingly represented at every level of politics. Scottish Labour’s Lorna Finlayson asked whether women are pigeon-holed into organisational/diary roles rather than being promoted to strategic ones, whilst academic and blogger Meryl Kenny described how men’s informal networks can circumvent the formal equality work that women do, leading to calls for men to act as “allies not bystanders”. The evening’s discussion, with a roomful of women including serving party staffer from across the Holyrood spectrum, drew out some fascinating threads and resulted - as is not often the case with such events - in an actual action plan."
2016-11-17T16:07:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Met defends decision to heavily redact Operation Midland report,"The Metropolitan police have defended their decision not to publish more than 80% of a scathing report into the failures of the force’s investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. A redacted summary of the report by Sir Richard Henriques on Operation Midland found the inquiry was launched on the basis of a single witness and made 43 separate errors. Last week during a debate in the House of Lords, peers argued that the report should be published in full. But on Thursday the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, told the London assembly’s police and crime committee that publishing more of the report would risk “compounding damage already done to reputations” of those wrongly accused.
He said the Met had apologised to former army chief Edwin Bramall, former Tory MP Harvey Proctor and to the widow of the late former home secretary Leon Brittan. After the report was published he said all were “innocent of the offences of which they were accused”. Asked if the Met had been “a bit free with the black marker pen”, Hogan-Howe said: “I don’t think so.” He pointed out that the 491-page report could not be published in full because it could prejudice an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into five officers Henriques criticised and a separate investigation by Northumbria police into the lone complainant known as Nick. He also cited data protection issues. “Those are fundamental reasons why you see the black marker,” Hogan-Howe said. He pointed out that redactions included graphic descriptions of sexual abuse. “Our view is that it wouldn’t be right to put that in the public domain. Particularly as no criminal case has resulted against those accused of those assaults,” he said. He added: “If it doesn’t go before a court is it right for us to put that very sensitive information into the public domain just to demonstrate our openness?” Appearing alongside him, Helen King, the assistant commissioner, insisted that redactions were not made to muffle criticism of the Met. “None of the redactions are motivated by a desire to hide any of the criticisms,” she told the committee. She revealed that the full report had been shown to several people including up to 10 senior Met officers, as well as the inquiry into historic sexual abuse, the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, and Sophie Linden, London’s deputy mayor for policing and crime. Hogan-Howe said he accepted criticisms of the “serious failings” highlighted in the report. But he warned against an overreaction. He said: “Two years ago the police service, the establishment generally, was being criticised for not listening to children 20 or 30 years ago. In this case the police are being criticised for going too far. “We all need to consider that we don’t shove the pendulum completely the other way. We have got to think about the victims here who want to be reassured that they will be supported when they come forward and we will investigate fearlessly regardless of who those people are. If we all react by shutting the whole system down again that would be very unwise. A balanced response would be helpful for everyone.”"
2016-11-17T16:58:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow braces for protests by climate campaigners and locals,"Heathrow airport is braced for protests and disruption on Saturday as climate campaigners join locals in a march on the airport, with one group planning direct action that could delay or cancel flights. The airport said it was monitoring the situation closely. Operations at Heathrow were halted last July when a group of 13 protesters chained themselves together on a runway, and the subsequent decision to approve a third runway has swelled the ranks of activists. More than 100 people are believed to have pledged to take direct action this weekend. Demonstrations against the airport’s expansion plans, approved by the government last month, will start with a rally in Richmond, south-west London, on Saturday morning addressed by Zac Goldsmith, who resigned as the local Conservative MP in protest. Residents of surrounding villages and campaigners are expected to later join a peaceful march on the airport’s perimeter. But the airport will be more concerned by the unspecified action, for which protesters expect to be arrested. Instead of reaching the runway, a possible tactic could be to block the tunnels and approach roads to Heathrow, stopping airline and airport staff as well as passengers from reaching the airport. A spokeswoman for the airport said: “Heathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues together with the smooth running of the operation is paramount.” The protest has been called by the campaign group RisingUp!, which said it would coordinate blockades in protest at the proposed development of the third runway, which it called “a red line for the climate”. The campaigners say expansion at Heathrow will cause the UK to break its own national laws to reduce emissions and undermine international climate commitments. One of the organisers of the accompanying protest is Neil Keveren, 55, a resident of the village of Harmondsworth, which will be largely bulldozed for the third runway. Keveren, who has an injuction preventing him joining further direct action after he blocked a tunnel leading to the airport, said: “The only reason people take direct action is to create a platform to speak. “We had prime ministers elected on no-ifs-no-buts promises, and now even Theresa May, with the cabinet she chose, it’s not democracy is it? People have an expectation that their politicians will do what they have promised historically.” Keveren, who was born in the adjoining village of Sipson, said longstanding residents would not voluntarily leave their houses if construction was ever to go ahead, adding: “I don’t think that May or the electorate have any stomach to see elderly people forcibly removed from their homes of a lifetime.” Alex Sharpe, 27, a fellow campaigner who has been living in Sipson as part of the long-term Transition Heathrow protest project, said: “The government’s decision to go ahead is absolutely disastrous and flies in the face of all science on climate change. It’s a gross injustice both locally and globally, whether it’s the hundreds of homes locally or the 300,000 people a year dying through the effects of climate change.” The government has approved in principle Heathrow’s proposed £17.6bn third runway, although there will be further consultation and a parliamentary vote on a national policy statement on aviation before the airport can seek planning permission. The extended airport would see an extra 240,000 flights a year. Meanwhile, four local councils and Greenpeace have taken the first step in their legal challenge to the decision. Hillingdon, Richmond, Wandsworth, and Windsor and Maidenhead councils, backed by the environmental group, have written to the transport secretary giving notice of judicial review proceedings. Earlier this week the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, indicated he was backing the move and could join in legal action to stop the third runway."
2016-11-17T17:45:13Z,uk-news,UK news,"MPs spent £640,000 on security after Jo Cox killing, figures show","MPs spent nearly £640,000 on additional security measures in the four months following the killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox, according to figures released by parliament’s expenses watchdog. Figures show that £637,791.63 was spent through the security assistance budget of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) from 16 June to the end of October, four times as much as in the whole of the previous year. Cox was killed outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, in front of her staff and shocked residents on 16 June. Thomas Mair, 53, stands accused of repeatedly shooting and stabbing the 41-year-old remain campaigner a week before the EU referendum vote. The statistics released by Ipsa show a huge increase on the total £160,000 spent on security for MPs in the 2015-16 financial year, which itself was more than double the £77,000 in the previous year. The body said 124 applications for “lone worker” devices had been approved for MPs and their staff since 16 June and 66 MPs had been granted “enhanced security packages”. In total, MPs were paid £113.6m for expenses and business costs by Ipsa – up from £106m in 2014-15. This figure does not include security spending, or the £172,600 for disability assistance. The watchdog said the increase on the previous year could be attributed to the one-off costs of winding up MPs’ offices after the 2015 general election and starting up new ones. The money included more than £80.2m on staffing, £11.2m on office costs, £7.2m on accommodation, £4.8m on travel and £10m on “other costs”. The spending watchdog has altered its procedures for sign-off on new security measures after criticism from MPs after Cox’s killing. MPs no longer have to get two quotes for prices from locksmiths if they seek to change the locks on constituency offices and homes, a move designed to quicken the approval process."
2016-11-17T18:26:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland could offer Northern Irish women access to free abortions,"Nicola Sturgeon has told the Scottish parliament that the devolved government would explore the possibility of giving women from Northern Ireland access to abortions in Scotland’s health service free of charge. Responding to a question from Green party MSP Patrick Harvie on Thursday, the first minister said: “I am happy to explore with the NHS what the situation is now in terms of the ability of women from Northern Ireland to access safe and legal abortion in NHS Scotland and whether any improvements can be made. “Like Patrick Harvie, I believe that women should have the right to choose, within the limits that are currently set down in law, and that that right should be defended. When a woman opts to have an abortion – I stress that that is never, ever an easy decision for any woman – the procedure should be available in a safe and legal way.” The health service has so far refused to pay for abortions for women from Northern Ireland who travel to Britain for terminations. The procedure is only available in Northern Ireland’s hospitals when there is a direct threat to the mother’s life if the pregnancy continues. In all other cases, it is illegal. Harvie pointed out that women from Northern Ireland had to fund their own private terminations, which can cost from £400 to £2,000. He asked Sturgeon if she would “agree that the national health service in Scotland should be exploring what can be done to ensure that those women are able to access abortion in Scotland, if that is where they choose to travel to, without facing that kind of unacceptable financial barrier?” The supreme court in London is currently considering an application from a Northern Irish teenager who, as a15-year-old, had to go to England to terminate a pregnancy. She is challenging the NHS’s refusal to fund abortions for women from Northern Ireland. Amnesty International welcomed Sturgeon’s offer. Patrick Corrigan, its Northern Ireland programme director, said: “Given the utter human rights failure of Northern Ireland’s ministers to provide free, safe and legal abortion healthcare for women and girls here, we welcome the commitment of Scotland’s first minister to explore what can be done via NHS Scotland. “The UN human rights committee recently ruled that Northern Ireland’s laws prohibiting and criminalising abortion constitute a human rights violation. The Scottish government could help lessen the harsh financial impact of that violation by allowing women from Northern Ireland to access abortions free of charge on the NHS.” Corrigan said Sturgeon’s offer of help should not, however, allow Northern Irish politicians to do nothing on the question of abortion. “While this would be a welcome and helpful step, it is no substitute for the Northern Ireland executive putting its own house in order with respect to significant reform of our scandalous abortion laws,” he said. “The fact that Scotland’s first minister is now exploring what she can do to help women and girls from Northern Ireland is an indictment of the failure of Northern Ireland own’s first minister, executive colleagues and the assembly.” Last November, a high court judge ruled that Northern Ireland’s abortion laws violated the rights of women and girls in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities or where a pregnancy was the result of a sexual crime. An estimated 2,000 women a year have to raise the money to travel to private English clinics and hospitals from Northern Ireland to have terminations. However, there is strong opposition across the floor of the Northern Ireland assembly to liberalising the province’s strict anti-abortion laws. The Abortion Act 1967 was never extended to Northern Ireland and an attempt to ease the law to include cases of fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancy via sexual crime was rejected earlier this year. Genevieve Edwards, director of policy at Marie Stopes, said: “I’m delighted they’re going to look at this in Scotland and I’d hope NHS England would consider following suit and mitigating, in part, this huge inequality for women in Northern Ireland by funding their treatment. “Of course, women also face travel costs, and the additional upset of having to travel outside their country often at very short notice, for a procedure which is available on the NHS to every woman in England, Scotland and Wales. “Ultimately, politicians in Stormont hold the power, and the responsibility, to make a reality of women’s reproductive rights in Northern Ireland. But until then, I’m delighted to see politicians in other parts of the UK stepping up to the plate.”"
2016-11-18T07:39:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Hammond to give boost to 'just managing families' in autumn statement,"Philip Hammond is preparing to offer modest giveaways to families that are “just about managing” in next week’s autumn statement, as the cash-strapped government struggles to make good on Theresa May’s promise to improve the lives of ordinary workers.
The chancellor will be forced to reveal a grim set of economic forecasts in his first set-piece House of Commons statement, as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility makes its first projections of the impact of Brexit on growth and the public finances. But the prime minister has asked Hammond to send a strong signal that the government will take action to help families who are “working around the clock” to make ends meet and the Treasury has been under pressure to make resources available to a group of people who have been dubbed as “just about managing” – or Jams. Policies under consideration including freezing fuel duty for motorists, boosting support for childcare and helping low-income families to save – and Hammond will also confirm that he will meet several Conservative manifesto pledges, including increasing the tax-free personal allowance.
Whitehall insiders stressed that any giveaways announced on the 23 November would be modest. The Treasury’s dire downbeat forecasts for the impact of Brexit on the health of the economy, published during the referendum campaign, have not yet been realised – but chancellor is keen to reserve more radical measures to be used only in case a serious downturn materialises. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has calculated that there are almost six million working households who could be described as the “just managing” – with a net income of between £12,000 and £34,000 – and that their living standards have barely risen in a decade. Resolution’s chief economist Matthew Whittaker suggests the best way of targeting these households would be to undo planned cuts to universal credit set in motion by Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne and to suspend the four-year cash freeze in working age benefits. Hammond is under pressure from his own backbenchers to unpick some of the planned welfare cuts, with Conservative MPs using a debate in the House of Commons on Thursday to urge the government to take action. No MPs voted against the SNP’s backbench motion to stop the planned cuts to employment support allowance and universal credit, with 127 MPs voting in favour, though the motion is purely symbolic.
Heidi Allen, the Conservative MP who has led the charge for a rethink, said she could think of no other issue “so regretted by colleagues on my side of the House.” “I have a guiding principle in life,” she added. “Always listen to the loudest voice in your head. I think we all know what that voice is saying. Let’s just pause these cuts. The risk of damage is high. The financial cost to pause is low. What kind of a government do we want to be?” Labour is also seeking to increase the pressure on Hammond to reverse the cuts and take wider measures to help low income families. Frontbenchers, including Jeremy Corbyn, attended screenings of the campaigning Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake to draw attention to the challenges of life on benefits. Hammond will formally abandon Osborne’s tax and spending rules, which now look impossible to meet, and announce a new fiscal framework to allow infrastructure projects that boost economic growth to be excluded from future deficit targets. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies recently suggested the £10.4bn surplus pencilled in for 2019-20 by the OBR was now on course to be a £14.9bn deficit, leaving a £25bn gap to fill in the government’s last year in office. The official forecasts are expected to show that the UK faces an extra deficit bill of between £50bn and £114bn over the next four years, the biggest deterioration in the public finances since 2011. The chancellor will seek to deflect attention from the economic costs of leaving the EU, by focusing on his longer-term aspiration to make Britain the home of a hi-tech “fourth industrial revolution”. He will promise to boost spending on hi-tech research in a bid to equip Britain’s economy for the world after Brexit. Business group the CBI, which will host a speech from May on Monday, has been urging the Treasury to boost research spending, including by doubling funding for the taxpayer-backed research agency, Innovate UK. Tom Thackray, the CBI director for innovation, said: “This is a critical juncture for the economy and getting behind innovation will be central to the UK’s success in the years ahead, with overall R&D spending still too low.” Hammond has repeatedly expressed concern about Britain’s poor productivity performance – the key to delivering future economic growth - and plans a battery of policies to tackle it, which include improving infrastructure and skills. The prime minister, meanwhile, is keen to focus on the wider electorate. Last month, May told the Conservative party conference: “Our society should work for everyone, but if you can’t afford to get onto the property ladder, or your child is stuck in a bad school, it doesn’t feel like it’s working for you. Our economy should work for everyone, but if your pay has stagnated for several years in a row and fixed items of spending keep going up, it doesn’t feel like it’s working for you.” Separately, a cross-party group of backbenchers led by Grant Shapps, and including the Labour MPs Lucy Powell and Ian Austin, called for air passenger duty to be cut by 50% in the autumn statement – and gradually reduced over time – to boost Britain’s trade performance in the wake of the Brexit vote."

2016-11-18T13:03:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Cold weekend forecast as thundersnow hits parts of UK,"Sleet, hail and thundersnow have hit parts of the UK as the country shivered in the coldest weather of the autumn so far. Early-morning commuters battled with blizzards and icy roads in Manchester and across the north-west on Friday morning. Across the western coast, showers brought hail and thundersnow – snow that falls in a thunderstorm. Weather stations in northern England and Scotland recorded sub-zero temperatures, and in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, the mercury sank to -7.2C at 5.35am – the autumn’s lowest temperature yet. The south and east of England experienced slightly warmer temperatures, although flurries of wet snow fell as far south as Exeter.
The Met Office has has issued yellow weather warnings of ice for the Midlands, the north of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and a spokesman said the freeze was set to continue over the weekend. “The broad picture is that it’s going to be cold throughout the UK,” he said. “Temperatures at night broadly across the UK are expected to be not too far away from freezing through Friday to Saturday, and then similar temperatures are expected on Saturday and Sunday as well. “The further south you come, the more likelihood [there is] of it being slightly warmer. In Plymouth, for example, on Saturday into Sunday it will probably be hovering in low single figures overnight.” The sudden onset of cold weather brought problems on the roads around Manchester, and drivers were warned to take care due to icy conditions, local media reported. A flight from the city’s airport had to turn around after it was apparently struck by lightning.
A yellow weather warning issued on Friday morning said wintry showers would continue throughout the day and overnight, leading to the possibility of ice forming as temperatures plunge after nightfall. “Please be aware of possible tricky travel conditions,” it added.
On Sunday an area of low pressure could bring heavy rain and south-westerly gales gusting as fast as 55mph over Sussex and Kent. Possible surface water flooding and debris from trees could pose a risk to drivers. “[The front is] going to move across most of southern and central England and Wales,” the Met Office spokesman said. “If you were to draw a line from the Liverpool area to Skegness, all the area below that is going to be affected, but actually the weather north of that – northern England and Scotland – will get away from the worst of it.” Temperatures are expected to rise at the start of next week, but not by much. “The indications we’ve got there [are] slightly warmer, potentially some double figures coming up, but only low double figures,” the spokesman said."
2016-11-18T13:33:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Man denies attempted murder after wife's parachute failed to open,"An army sergeant has denied attempting to murder his wife after her main parachute failed to open during a 1,200-metre (4,000ft) jump. Emile Cilliers, 36, pleaded not guilty when he appeared at Salisbury crown court to face three charges in relation to his wife Victoria Cilliers, 40. She suffered multiple serious injuries at Netheravon airfield, on Salisbury plain, Wiltshire, on 5 April 2015. Cilliers, of Aldershot, Hampshire, denied two charges of attempting to murder his wife during the short hearing. One offence is alleged to have taken place between 24 and 31 March last year, while the second allegedly happened between 3 and 6 April last year. Cilliers also denied a charge of damaging a gas fitting belonging to his wife between 28 and 31 March last year. Judge Keith Cutler, the recorder of Winchester, adjourned the case for a date to be fixed and released Cilliers on bail. “It is likely to be a trial of five weeks’ length, perhaps in May or the summer part of next year,” the judge told the defendant. Wearing a grey suit, Cilliers, from South Africa, spoke only to answer “not guilty” to the three charges. The court heard Cilliers’ bail conditions included having no contact with his wife, not to enter Wiltshire apart from legal appointments and to surrender his passport. Christopher Hill, representing Cilliers, applied for his passport to be in the possession of police or the army, so his client could attend ski courses abroad. “There’s a ski leaders’ course in Bavaria, with a transfer by bus and ferry,” Hill said. “Then there’s another ski course in Austria. The request is that he is allowed to attend those.” The judge said the passport should be in the possession of the police and the army. “This case comes first,” he told Cilliers. “I will renew your bail in those amended terms. There’s likely to be a further hearing in probably February or March for a further administrative-type hearing.”"
2016-11-18T14:03:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Parcel label addressed to Titanic expected to raise Â£12,000 at auction","A grubby scrap of paper with a blurry postmark on its sixpenny stamp recording the date 11 April 1912 is coming up for auction and is estimated to sell for up to £12,000.
The unique label is from a parcel addressed to the Marconi wireless operator on the Titanic, never delivered because three nights later the “unsinkable” Titanic struck the iceberg in one of the most famous maritime disasters of all time. Among the 1,503 lives lost was the wireless operator, Jack Phillips, aged 25. He had stayed at his post, with his junior, Harold Bride – who survived – sending SOS messages until the sinking ship had lost almost all power. The label was posted from Chelmsford and addressed c/o the White Star Line in Southampton. The package, now lost but believed to have been a bundle of blank telegram forms for use on board, was given to the first officer of the Titanic’s sister ship Olympic to take to New York. It would then have been handed on to Phillips when the Titanic reached the port at the end of its maiden voyage. On the night of 14 April 1912, Phillips is believed to have delayed passing on a message to the bridge from another ship, warning that the Titanic was steaming straight towards an ice field, because he was working through a pile of such telegrams, relaying messages from passengers to Newfoundland.
The label was given as a souvenir by the Olympic officer and later acquired by a private collector, but its significance was only recently realised. Gary Watson, an expert at Mossgreen auctioneers which will sell the label in a postal history auction in Australia later this month, regards it as one as the most evocative postal items associated with the ship. It is being sold with photographs of the wireless equipment, and of Alec Bagot, the Marconi operator on the Olympic, the first launched of the three great sister ships, and the only one to survive for a full working life. The Britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship in the first world war, and sunk by a mine in 1916, but the Olympic continued in service until 1935, and was broken up in 1937."
2016-11-18T14:07:58Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jo Cox murder suspect was armed with hunting bullets, court told","The man accused of murdering the Labour MP Jo Cox was armed with expanding hollow-tipped bullets designed to inflict maximum damage, the Old Bailey heard. When arrested, Thomas Mair was found to have a bag containing 25 .22 rounds, of which 12 had hollow-point bullets made of lead, the jury was told. He is alleged to have shot Cox three times a few moments before his arrest, using a sawn-off .22 calibre German-made rifle. Andre Horne, a forensic firearms examiner, told the court that hollow-point bullets were used by hunters, and were considered to kill animals in a more humane fashion than bullets that might pass through the target. Hollow-point rounds expand on impact and cause larger wounds, Horne said. “They are used for hunting vermin – squirrels or rabbits. The purpose of the expanding bullet is to maximise the energy that is transferred to an animal. Or a person.” The jury was shown the Weihrauch bolt-action rifle, from which both the barrel and stock had been sawn off, that is alleged to have been recovered when Mair was arrested. They were also shown a knife said to have been in his possession. Horne said it was a replica of a second world war British commando dagger. Earlier, the jury heard a statement from Ben Raynor, a doctor who performed emergency surgery on Cox inside an ambulance at the scene of the attack after tests showed her heart had failed. “No matter what we tried, we couldn’t get the heart to restart,” Raynor said. After a 20-minute struggle, the doctor and paramedics discussed what more could be done. “Everyone was in agreement we had done everything we possibly could to save the patient.” Raynor pronounced her dead. Watched by three prison officers, Mair sat in the dock taking occasional notes as Dr Richard Shepherd, a pathologist at Leeds General Infirmary, detailed Cox’s injuries. She had suffered 15 stab wounds, mostly to the front and left side of her chest, and her abdomen. One blow struck her chest after penetrating her right arm. She had also been shot once in the chest and twice in her head, and although the bullets did not penetrate her skull, the force of the impact had damaged her brain. Two of the rounds had passed through her hands, as she attempted to protect herself. “I concluded that Jo Cox had died as a result of multiple stab and gunshot wounds,” Shepherd said.
Cox was killed on 16 June in Birstall, West Yorkshire, a market town in her Batley and Spen constituency. She was on her way to a meeting with voters, and had also been due to attend an event to raise support for the campaign to remain in the EU, a week ahead of the referendum. In the days before her killing, Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, is alleged to have used computers at the town’s library to view online material about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, far-right politicians and Israel. He is also said to have viewed material about .22 ammunition, and whether it could kill an individual shot in the head. Mair is charged with the murder of Cox and the grievous bodily harm of Bernard Carter-Kenny, a pensioner who was stabbed in the stomach after going to the MP’s aid. He is also charged with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, and possession of a dagger. The court has heard that the attack was captured on CCTV. Mair declined to enter pleas when he appeared at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing last month. As a result, not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. The trial continues."
2016-11-18T16:32:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office agrees to review plan to deport Afghan teenager,"The campaign to stop the deportation of an Afghan teenager who fled to Britain as a 10-year-old after his father was murdered has received a significant boost. The Home Office has agreed to consider fresh submissions on the case of Bashir Naderi and to review its decision to send him back to Afghanistan.
More than 13,000 people have now signed a petition calling for Naderi to be allowed to stay in Cardiff, where he is a student and has a long-term girlfriend and loving foster mother. Politicians from all four parties at the Welsh assembly, including Ukip, have called for the UK government to think again, and celebrities including the Welsh singers Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews have voiced support. Naderi’s sole memory of Afghanistan is his father being shot by the Taliban. He has no contact with family or friends, cannot speak any of the Afghan languages and claims he will not survive if he is sent back. The 19-year-old was detained by immigration officials in Cardiff – where he was brought up by a foster family – last month, taken to Gatwick airport and came within minutes of being forced on to a plane bound for Kabul when his long-term girlfriend and her family managed to win him a temporary reprieve. A spokesperson for the campaign said it was great news that the decision was being reviewed and discussions were taking place between Naderi’s team and lawyers for the Home Office. The spokesperson added: “Whilst this news represents a significant development after weeks of uncertainty and anxiety, Bash and his family are aware that this is a starting point rather than an outcome. However, it provides an opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence in support of Bash’s case.” After his father was shot, Naderi’s mother sold the family’s land to send her son to the UK. He does not know what has happened to her. It took him a year to reach Britain, where he was placed with a foster family in the Welsh capital. He flourished, attending a Catholic high school, gaining nine GCSEs and going on to study at Cardiff and Vale College. Naderi was detained after attending what he thought was going to be a routine immigration appointment, and spent 11 days behind bars at a police station in Wales and a detention centre. When it became clear that he was going to be taken to Gatwick to be put on a plane, he resisted, was restrained with some sort of belt and suffered a wrist injury, meaning his lower arm needed to be put in a cast. Naderi’s girlfriend, Nicole Cooper, said: “We have been so amazed at how Bash’s petition has raised 13,000 supporters. We had no idea this could be done and are so grateful for the words of support on Facebook and Twitter and for the public support from assembly members, from MPs, from celebrities and from so many members of the public across Cardiff, Wales, the UK and even further afield.” Cooper, 24, added: “It has been very comforting and helps us stay strong, so we really would like to thank all of them for what they are doing to support Bash.” Immigration is not a devolved issue but responding to an urgent question on Naderi’s case, the Welsh government’s cabinet secretary for children and communities, Carl Sargeant, said: “I hope the home secretary will take note of the views expressed here and among the wider Welsh public.” A report from the Refugee Support Network published this year said that since 2007 more than 2,000 youngsters had been forcibly removed to Afghanistan. It monitored 25 and found that most had struggled to find work or to access education and suffered mental health problems. If an unaccompanied child qualifies for asylum, they are granted limited leave to remain, normally for a period of five years. Once the child turns 17½, the Home Office expects them either to start making preparations to return to their country of origin when they turn 18 or to make a further application for leave to remain. These applications are considered on a case by case basis. A Home Office spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases."
2016-11-18T17:08:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland campaigner to challenge Brexit in supreme court,"A campaigner for the victims of paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland has won the right to challenge Brexit in the supreme court. Three judges in a Belfast court ruled on Friday that Raymond McCord should be allowed a hearing in the highest court in the UK to oppose the triggering of article 50 that would lead to an exit from the EU. McCord had argued that because Northern Ireland voted 56% in favour of remaining within the EU, Brexit would be against the consent of the people in the region. The Belfast man has worked for the victims of terror groups, both republican and loyalist, ever since the Ulster Volunteer Force murdered his son, Raymond McCord Jr, in 1997. Speaking outside the court, McCord said: “This is a major step forward for our people and for victims. “The three judges believe I have a right to an opinion, unlike political people who have criticised me.” He had come under sustained criticism from unionist politicians for taking part in a legal challenge to block Brexit. “The people of Northern Ireland should be deciding whether we stay in the EU or leave – 56% of the people here voted to remain,” McCord added. His lawyer, Ciaran O’Hare, said: “Essentially the question posed is whether or not there can be any Brexit for Northern Ireland, based on the fact we have our own constitution consisting of the Northern Ireland Act and the Good Friday Agreement. “We say the people of Northern Ireland are sovereign on constitutional change.” McCord had joined pro-EU political parties and community groups in a legal case during which they argued that Brexit would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. The 1998 peace accord was endorsed by people in both states on the island of Ireland but, most crucially, would only be ratified if a majority in Northern Ireland backed it. The supreme court will now consider whether withdrawal from the EU without the consent of the Northern Ireland population fundamentally negates that agreement. Meanwhile, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny said his meeting with Northern Ireland’s first and deputy first ministers on the implications of Brexit for the island were the best he had so far. The taoiseach attended the north-south ministerial council in Armagh alongside first minister Arlene Foster and deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. Kenny announced the appointment of a high-level group of civil servants and officials from both sides of the Irish border who will draw up practical plans to cope with Brexit’s impact. Ahead of the meeting, Martin McGuinness said the re-imposition of a “hard border” would “be totally and absolutely unacceptable”. But the Sinn Féin deputy first minister said there was now a realisation among the political parties in Northern Ireland that “we need to be together to go forward” in dealing with Brexit’s implications. However, one of Northern Ireland’s leading economists warned on Friday that if the UK leaves the European customs union then a hard border between the region and the Irish Republic was inevitable. Ulster Bank’s chief economist in the province, Richard Ramsey, also told a Dublin Business School conference on Brexit on Friday that the Northern Ireland government’s policy of a low corporation tax – 12.5%, as in the Irish Republic – has “fallen far down the agenda” due to the UK voting to leave the European Union. Speaking in the Mac arts theatre in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter, Ramsey said: “The customs union is looking at the trade in goods and common tariffs coming into that area. If you leave that you then have to have some sort of hard border on how you can check up things like, for example, Argentinian beef. “Say that beef was infected by some bacteria and if you didn’t have border checks then that meat could come into Northern Ireland, go across the border into the south and that would mean it was now inside the EU. Some people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but I just cannot see how that would work. If we were to leave the customs union then a hard border even for those practical reasons would be inevitable,” he said."
2016-11-18T18:38:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Child abuse inquiry 'to continue' despite survivors' withdrawal,"The troubled national inquiry into child abuse has mounted a fightback after a large survivors’ group withdrew from participation, condemning it as a “stage-managed and contrived” investigation. In a series of television interviews, senior panel member Dru Sharpling said the inquiry would continue. She apologised to hundreds of victims of child abuse in Lambeth children’s homes – the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association – who announced they were pulling out of the proceedings on Friday because it was “failing publicly and tragically”. But Sharpling insisted the investigations would go on without the group. She said: “The Lambeth investigation will continue. I am very sorry that they have decided to leave. I hope that they will come back, but we will continue to do that work. There is evidence being forwarded to us now which enables us to undertake this inquiry and I hope that, as time goes by, their confidence in the inquiry improves, as others have.” It is understood she was referring to the documents being submitted on a weekly basis to the inquiry by Lambeth council as a result of its statutory powers to demand information. Lambeth, she said, was one of 13 investigations the inquiry was carrying out and its importance could not be elevated above any of the other institutions being examined.
Sharpling suggested the inquiry maintained the confidence of other victims. She said: “There are seven other organisations who we are working with and over 150 individual victims and survivors in relation to our ‘public hearings project’,” she said. “People are also coming forward for our other project, the ‘truth project’. They are giving accounts of child sexual abuse all over the country as we speak. We’ve had universally good feedback from that and it is an important element of the inquiry.” A spokesman for the prime inister, Theresa May, made clear she unreservedly backed the inquiry under its chair, Prof Alexis Jay. “We are going to be continuing with the inquiry,” said Sharpling. “The work is so important. The more people come forward particularly to give accounts of child sexual abuse, it gives us the passion that we need to take it forward … although it has been a difficult start for this inquiry, we are determined to see it through no matter what.” Sharpling defended Jay after Labour MP Chuka Umunna – whose constituents were abused in Lambeth children’s homes – demanded that the former social worker should stand down as chair in favour of a senior judge. “In Rotherham, no organ of government, no institution, had uncovered the scale and the depravity of child sexual abuse that had occurred over many years,” Sharpling said. “One woman uncovered that abuse – and that was Alexis Jay. I think she is one of the few people who is ideally qualified for the job.” Sharpling’s public statements came after weeks in which the inquiry has been rocked by a series of departures of leading lawyers, allegations of bullying and racism by its former chair Lowell Goddard, the announcement that a public hearing into the late Greville Janner would be postponed and on Friday the departure of the Shirley Oaks survivors from the process. Umunna, who until now has been supportive of Jay as chair, said he had lost confidence in her ability to run the investigation and she should step down in favour of a senior judge. “There has been an ongoing concern about the fact that she has come from three decades of social work,” he said. “For many of the survivors that is a problem because many of the perpetrators came from that profession. Now you can’t just sweep that under the table and it’s never been dealt with by the panel properly.” In an article for the Times Jay said she was “genuinely saddened by the [Shirley Oak Survivor Group’s] decision, but “the inquiry’s door would remain open to it”. Raymond Stevenson, who set up the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, explained why they had finally decided to withdraw after twice threatening to pull out of proceedings. “Having watched the IICSA unpalatable circus stumble and lurch from crisis to crisis … it no longer matters whether we think the inquiry is just another stitch-up because it is clearly a botch job that needs a drastic overhaul if it is ever to achieve its initial objectives,” he said in a statement. Stevenson said he was not comfortable putting his members before an inquiry which was “failing tragically, failing publicly”. He said: “The inquiry needs to sort itself out. They need to get rid of Alexis Jay, who has been parachuted in by the Home Office, and we need to get someone else.” He also raised concerns about the presence of so many Home Office staff on the inquiry – 36 of the 183 staff are Home Office officials. He said: “For any inquiry to be truly independent and engender faith in its integrity, the Home Office either needs to come clean about its own role in covering up historical child abuse and staff the inquiry with independent employees instead of its secondees or hand over the task of overseeing the inquiry to a less tainted government department.” Despite Sharpling’s confidence that other victims supported the process, Phil Frampton, who is a core participant in the inquiry as part of the Whiteflowers group of victims, said the departure of Shirley Oaks came amid “seething discontent” among survivors over the lack of material support for them and the “contemptuous” way they were being dealt with. He called for survivors to be fully funded to attend all meetings with their legal representatives, for guaranteed access to counselling from the first moment preliminary hearings began and a clear timetable of hearings to come. The announcement that Shirley Oaks survivors had formally withdrawn was the latest setback for the public investigation. It is on its fourth chair since it was established in 2014 and has had at least three people resign from its legal team."
2016-11-18T19:32:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Police and boat crew praised after saving drowning man from Thames,"Police officers and the crew of a passing cargo ship have been praised for their fortitude and skill after rescuing a drowning man from the Thames. With the temperature in the water dangerously low, an officer helped save the man’s life by holding his head above the water, before falling in and needing to be rescued herself. Both of them have been discharged from hospital after the incident, which took place in west London in the early hours of Tuesday. Having spotted the man in the water calling for help, the crew of the 700-tonne Polla Rose manoeuvred into a position to help him, throwing him a life ring and a rope. But they were unable to pull him aboard. Police officers on the bank boarded the ship. Recognising the seriousness of the situation when the 40-year-old man’s head kept dropping face-down into the water, PC Ky Bukhari ignored warnings to stay on the deck and climbed down the pilot ladder to grab hold of him. She tried to hold him up until a police boat could make it from east London. The water was said to be around 10C, flowing faster than normal and with an exceptionally strong tide, which the Polla Rose was fighting against. The ship began to drift dangerously and PC Nick Bultitude on the police boat had to position himself carefully in order to rescue the man without crushing him against the ship’s hull. With the Polla Rose reversing, Bukhari fell into the water between the ship and the police boat and Bultitude’s colleagues had to rescue her from between the two moving hulls. The officers then pulled the man to safety as well. Insp Chris Green, from the Metropolitan police’s marine policing unit, said: “This was a fantastic effort by all the officers involved. Their heroic actions resulted in saving a member of the public’s life. PC Bukhari did not think twice about putting her own life in danger in order to help the man in the water. The officers from the marine policing unit’s quick thinking played a vital role in not only rescuing the casualty, but their own colleague as well.” The Polla Rose’s owners, Thames Shipping Ltd, told the London Evening Standard that they commended the crew for their “instinctive reactions”. They added: “This is a testament to their calibre and their commitment to their profession. To manoeuvre this vessel appropriately and conduct an effective rescue is simply brilliant.”"
2016-11-19T00:01:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Pension cold calling to be banned after rise in scams,"A ban on cold calling to sell pension products will be introduced in next week’s autumn statement, after changes brought in by former chancellor George Osborne led to a surge in scammers tricking people out of their retirement savings. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, will use his first budget statement to announce the new rules, with the intention of ending approximately 250m scam calls a year leading to pensions fraud of almost £19m in 2015. There has been a surge of fraudulent cold calling targeting pensioners since Osborne’s reforms of the pension system to make it easier for people to withdraw sums without penalty. The scams tend to be presented as unique investment opportunities, such as putting your pension pot into a new hotel in an exotic location or supposedly ethical projects that promise huge returns.
Under the changes due to be announced by Hammond, all calls relating to pension investments where a business has no existing relationship with the individual will be forbidden. Similar rules already cover cold calls relating to mortgages. Companies flouting the ban could face fines of up to £500,000 from the information commissioner, although the watchdog does not have powers to tackle firms operating outside the UK. Pension firms will be given more powers to block suspicious transfers, preventing people’s life savings from being transferred without any checks. The rules will also stop small self-administered schemes from being set up using a dormant company as the sponsoring employer. Some research has suggested that scammers could be behind as many as one in 10 pension transfer requests. Hammond appears to be acting after a petition signed by thousands of people, including former pensions ministers Ros Altmann and Steve Webb, Martin Lewis of the website Money Saving Expert, and a number of independent financial advisers, requested pension cold calling be made illegal. Michelle Cracknell, head of the government’s Pensions Advisory Service helpline, also called for a ban, saying every customer should refuse to take pension cold calls."
2016-11-19T07:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Black Friday deliveries may be hit by packaging workers' strike action,"Parcel and pizza deliveries could be hit over the busiest online shopping weekend of the year after thousands of cardboard packaging workers voted for strike action over pay. Workers at about 40 corrugated packaging factories operated by DS Smith, Saica and Smurfit Kappa have rejected a 2% pay rise, claiming their rewards have fallen behind as the companies increased profits. The GMB and Unite unions, which represent about 2,500 of the 3,000 workers at the factories who are all covered by a national pay agreement, said they planned an overtime ban from Saturday 26 November and a day of strike action on Monday 28 November. The action could affect parcel deliveries during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping days of the year. Amazon and Domino’s Pizza are major clients of the factories.
Stuart Fegan, the GMB national officer, said: “We don’t want to cause problems for peoples’ Christmas shopping – but if we have to, we will. “Our members are clearly fed up of seeing their employers make increasing profits in this sector while their wages fall behind in real terms. “We urge the employers to get back around the negotiating table and make an offer to our members in respect of their pay claim which recognise the profits these companies are making and the contribution of our members towards those profits.” Packaging companies have benefited as the volume of parcels sent out by retailers has risen. This year 12% more parcels are expected to go through the system as online sales rise 16% to £1.27bn, according to the online retail industry body IMRG. Ian Tonks, Unite’s national officer, said: “Clearly these are profitable companies and our members recognise their contribution towards that profitability and their efforts need rewarding.” DS Smith, Saica and Smurfit Kappa were unavailable for comment."
2016-11-19T08:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,German businesses in UK worry about Brexit's impact on their market,"Birmingham’s Christmas market is thriving. Crowds of people are drinking glühwein, eating bratwurst and enjoying the traditional atmosphere of the kind found at this time of year in Dresden, Nuremberg or Leipzig. The Midlands city is celebrating 50 years of being twinned with Frankfurt. It has hosted a Christmas market since 1997 – it is now the biggest outside Germany – and there are no signs that Brexit will change that. But while business is booming at the marker, other German firms in the UK are worried about what the future holds. No one can predict what rules will govern foreign enterprises once Britain leaves the EU. Will the UK have access to the single market? If not, what tariffs will be imposed? Will foreign workers be allowed into the UK and under what conditions? All these questions have still to be decided. Mark Dodsworth, the director of Europartnerships, a small business that advises companies trying to grow exports into and from the UK, has a gloomy answer. The company, which works on behalf of the German chambers of commerce, has seen fewer clients this year. “It was a quiet year for us,” says Dodsworth. “People who are supposed to make decisions just wait and thus delay investments.” Ulrich Hoppe, the director of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce (GBCIC) in the UK, agrees. “While the big firms remain committed to the UK, there is also uncertainty and reluctance about major investments in the future. Heads of companies wait and see,” she says. German subsidiaries employed almost 400,000 people in the UK and accounted for £200bn total sales, according to 2013 figures from the GBCIC. Among the biggest German manufacturers in the UK, it is business as usual for those that operate mostly within the country, while the companies that rely on imports and exports are increasingly nervous. Tom Blades, the chief executive of Bilfinger which provides engineering and services in the UK and has about 4,000 employees, says: “Because these services are primarily provided locally, a Brexit would have little direct impact.” The dairy products firm Müller, which is proud of making all its British products with milk from the country’s farms, says it has plans to invest and grow its business here. But those who rely on international supply chains are less calm. Emma Begley, a spokeswoman for BMW, says: “The result of the EU referendum creates uncertainty for the automotive sector in general and for overseas investors in particular. Uncertainty is not helpful when it comes to making long-term business decisions.”
Uncertainty is also an issue for the engineering and infrastructure group Siemens. Its spokeswoman Anne Keogh says the fact that it has a significant presence in the UK means “we hope a speedy and amicable agreement can be worked out within the promised timescale”. Alexander Moscho, the chief executive of the chemicals and pharmaceuticals firm Bayer UK, says: “Nervousness will grow with time passing over preparations and we would prefer clarity about the terms of Brexit so stability can be brought to the market.” “It is crucial to have reliable conditions,” he says because it takes 10 years to develop a new medicine. Discussions with Bayer’s global headquarters about forthcoming projects “have naturally become more intensive”.
The UK is an important location for Bayer in several areas, including research and especially clinical and agricultural product development, according to Moscho. “We have partnerships with leading UK universities. When the EU grants such as the Horizon 2020 programme subside, if they are not substituted by local funding, the sustainability of the excellence of our partners’ science could be at risk,” he says. Moscho says he has noticed that international candidates for top managerial positions have started to pull back. “I hope that this will not hurt the competitiveness of UK companies in the long run.” Siemens, BMW and Bayer are not the only businesses closely monitoring what happens during Brexit negotiations. When the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, spoke in Berlin this week at an annual meeting of German employers, she said there should be no exceptions to the principle of free movement of labour for the UK. “Then the other countries would also want exceptions,” she said. Some businesses, led by banks and financial services companies, are already taking precautions for a hard Brexit. Eric Menges, the chief executive of the company that promotes Germany’s Frankfurt Rhine-Main region, was in Birmingham this week, not for the Christmas market but to make contact with UK business people. Frankfurt has opened an office in Birmingham and is seizing the chance to attract banks and financial companies based in the UK. “We are not here to lure away business from the UK,” says Menges, “but if enterprises are willing to open subsidiaries in Frankfurt we are ready to help. We are well connected with the airport, have international schools and we are located in the midst of Europe. We are just the ideal site.” • Anna Lehmann is a political correspondent at the Berlin-based daily newspaper taz.die tageszeitung and currently works in the Guardian’s offices on the George Weidenfeld bursary, an international journalists’ exchange programme"
2016-11-19T13:50:30Z,uk-news,UK news,City of Brussels set to honour killed British MP Jo Cox,"The Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed in her constituency, is to have a street, square or building in Brussels named in her honour. Cox features in a long list of illustrious women drawn up by Brussels city council from which it will name newly created public places. The move is part of an initiative to increase female representation in the names of streets and squares in the Belgian capital. Cox, who was stabbed and shot outside her constituency surgery shortly before the EU referendum in the UK, lived in Brussels for about six years. She spent two years advising Glenys Kinnock, who was then a member of the European parliament, before working for the charity Oxfam. The College of Burgomaster and Aldermen of the City of Brussels adopted the list of women this week. According to the Brussels Times, the two aldermen who drew up the list, Alain Courtois and Mohamed Ouriaghli, said the local authority was deeply moved by Cox’s killing, describing it as a “horrendous deed”. Joanna Maycock, the secretary general of the European Women’s Lobby, an umbrella organisation of women’s associations supporting the initiative, said: “Jo was a close friend and exactly the kind of person that we want to see in politics: feminist, extraordinary, brilliant and fearless; motivated by a passion for women’s rights and social justice; and carries the conviction we can, and that it is our duty to fight for a safer, more just and egalitarian society.” Brussels city council launched an action plan for “female and male equality” in 2014. Other political figures on the list include the Belgian feminist Léonie La Fontaine; the founder of the Egyptian Feminist Union, Huda Sharawi; and Gabrielle Petit, a Belgian who spied for the British secret service during the first world war. There are also artists, sportswomen, scientists and writers. Ouriaghli, the alderman for equal opportunities, said: “It is clear, by the patriarchal structure of our society, that men have appropriated the power, and by corollary decision making. “Although during the last decades a more egalitarian organisation tends to emerge at the different levels, representations in public space are predominantly masculine. It is important to balance this by highlighting famous people, both male and female.” On Friday the Old Bailey heard that Thomas Mair, the man accused of murdering Cox, was armed with expanding hollow-tipped bullets designed to inflict maximum damage."
2016-11-19T13:54:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Has Pembury Circus done the London housing trick?,"Near my corner of Hackney, on bus routes I often use, stands a cluster of five new buildings that might be a bit of a model for London’s housing future. Pembury Circus is a mixed use development containing 268 flats, a community hall, a nursery and some shops, including a branch of the Co-op. Nearly half of the flats - 119 of them - are designated “affordable” of some kind, which is an unusually high proportion. There is no provision for car parking on the site, other than a few bays for disabled people and a car club. It is a high density development, though the block that forms the highest part is not, at 12 storeys, particularly tall. It is heated from a low carbon energy centre and it is “permeable” - which basically means you can walk or cycle all the way through it to connect with the surrounding area - and it is striking to look at, with different blocks built in different styles in an effort to fit in with neighbouring older buildings. Pembury Circus has attracted plaudits from a clutch of housing and design organisations and recently won the Best Mixed Use Development Award from the prestigious Leading European Architects Forum (LEAF). It’s not easy to be high-density, car-free, good-looking and provide a large amount of affordability all at the same time, but Pembury Circus has managed it. Is it everything new London housing ought to be? If so, what’s its trick? The backstory begins at the end of the 1990s when the large, adjacent Pembury estate was transferred from Hackney Council to the Peabody housing association as part of the Labour government’s stock transfer programme, aimed at upgrading social housing. Part of the deal was that one section of the estate, comprising 42 of its nearly 1,300 dwellings, road and car parking space and a little open land, would be redeveloped. This is where Pembury Circus now stands. The 42 estate flats were demolished in 2004 and the site was landscaped for the time being. Eventually, in 2011, Peabody and commercial developer Bellway came forward with plans. There were two of them: one proposed garage parking for 80 cars, the other proposed none. Hackney’s planning committee preferred the latter. Some 95% of housing developments in Hackney are now car-free. Pembury Circus is believed to be the largest of that type in Europe. Work began in 2013. The deal included the council being able to widen a pavement on a street that goes past the site and the developers paying for forthcoming improvements to the five-way junction that part of the development faces on to. By early 2014 Pembury Circus was recognised as a destination in on-board bus announcements and by 2015 it was complete. Every unit has now been let or sold. The project is a local outcome of a national housing policy begun in the last century that continues to split opinion: for some, stock transfers are always to be opposed as a form of privatisation, though other assessments, such as one for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2009, have found them to be mostly beneficial for residents. The 42 Pembury estate homes knocked down, all of which had been for social rent, were considered sub-standard by the council and their environs had an unhappy reputation as a crime spot. The open space that replaced them became valued by local people, some of whom were unhappy to see it go. Now, the 268 homes of Pembury Circus fill the same piece of land. Of the 119 “affordable” ones, 21 are for traditional social rent, 58 for the higher “affordable rent” variety, ranging from 55% to 75% of local market levels, and 40 are for shared ownership. Relevant context: nearly 45% of Hackney households rent from a social landlord, be that the council or a housing association, and “affordable rent” tenants, can be eligible for help from housing benefit. Some of the rented homes were reserved for older estate residents and others who wanted to move to somewhere smaller. The different tenures are in different sections of the development - a set up you often find in the capital these days, given the need for sales of one housing type to help subside others - but, thanks in part to the building materials used, Pembury Circus looks more “tenure blind” than “poor doors”. Different people will take different views about it for a range of different reasons, some of them historical. But judged on its own, contemporary terms within the exacting framework of, in particular, Inner London housing financing, Pembury Circus meets several desirable criteria: a high level and wide spread of “affordable” tenure types; good environmental standards; pretty to look at; efficient and creative use of available space. There could be more of this kind of development on its way across London. London could certainly do a lot worse."
2016-11-19T15:59:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Benefits, tax, rates, investing … will the autumn statement make a difference?","Philip Hammond’s so-far-short tenure as chancellor will come under the spotlight this week when he spells out his budget plans for the rest of the parliament and sets a course towards a Britain cut loose from Brussels. The uncertainty created by the Brexit vote has left the public finances with a looming black hole that could mean the Treasury borrowing more than £100bn over the life of the parliament. But a loosening of the purse strings in Hammond’s autumn statement is still possible. The economy is in a robust state and a little extra spending will not prevent him from closing the deficit – the gap between government income and expenditure each year. He could grab the opportunity to bury the legacy of his predecessor George Osborne, or play it safe and do little more than ease planned cuts for poorer families and repair some potholes. We’ve asked expert, campaigners and industry representatives what they think should feature in Wednesday’s statement. The economist
Martin Beck EY Item Club forecasting group Hammond has an opportunity, according to Beck, to put George Osborne’s six years of “tricks and fiddles” behind him and set a course towards fiscal stability, rather than an arbitrary balanced budget target, where income and spending are perfectly aligned. “There is no pressing need to launch a huge stimulus package, because the economy has shown much more resilience than the Treasury expected,” he says. “But, that said, the economy is due to slow down, and there is no reason not to alleviate the worst effects on those who are ‘just about managing’.” Working-age benefits are due to be frozen from next April for the rest of the parliament. The chancellor should consider a two- or three-year delay to help low- and middle-income families. Beck adds: “Not only will they be the worst-affected by rising inflation, but will also spend the money, boosting economic growth.” Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, says Hammond should take public investment spending back up to 2% of GDP, at a cost of £6bn. The chancellor should also claw some money back by halting a planned cut in corporation tax – already the lowest among major economies – from 20% to 17%. Firms likely to be hit by Brexit could be offered tax breaks for investment spending. He agrees with business lobby group the CBI that an investment allowance for small and medium-sized businesses – so they pay no tax on investments worth up to £200,000 – should be raised to £1m for a couple of years. Banks should also be encouraged to stay in London with a cut in the corporation tax supplement, currently 8%, and the bank levy. The thinktank
Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at Resolution Foundation Hammond said soon after taking up his post that he would scrap George Osborne’s fiscal rule, which committed the government to a balanced budget by 2020. His replacement is expected to be unveiled this week. Whittaker says the chancellor needs to establish a new rule based on bringing down the government’s annual expenditure, while sparing investment spending – such as that on roads, rail and energy. “Given where we are with low productivity, there needs to be a way for him to boost investment,” he says. The government’s annual outlay is largely composed of departmental spending and transfers to the public, mostly in welfare payments, Whittaker adds. Trimming that expenditure and protecting investment spending will ensure that £17m remains available for long-term projects over this parliament. Next, Hammond should cancel further income tax giveaways, including raising the personal tax threshold to £12,500 and the higher-rate threshold to £50,000, saving him £2bn by 2020. Like Beck, Whittaker would cancel the corporation tax cut, scrap freezes on in-work welfare benefits, and leave unchanged the amount people can earn before they begin to lose the new universal credit benefit. The Treasury plans further cuts to the pay levels by which universal credit is calculated, after reducing them in April this year. Housing is another area that needs attention. The biggest squeeze in recent years on disposable incomes has been rising housing costs, says Whittaker. Instead of offering tax incentives to housebuilders, the government should simply commission them to build, and intervene directly in the development of land for the benefit of local communities, he says. The manufacturing analyst
Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF, the manufacturers’ association No need for fireworks or fiscal bazookas in the autumn statement, says Hopley. Not unless the economic situation worsens next year. In the meantime lots of practical measures could be brought in to support manufacturers, including abolishing the immigration skills charge – a pre-referendum measure that will slap a £1,000-a-year bill on employers for every migrant worker they give a job to from next April. Small firms and charities were told to pay £364 a year for each job. This was expected to raise £240m for government training schemes. Hopley says the apprenticeship levy, which will raise £3bn, has superseded the immigration charge. Hopley urges Hammond to expand the road investment strategy – a fund to improve local roads. She points out that employers struggle when heavy traffic on poor roads means staff are late for work and goods are delayed. She also proposes a unit to promote tech investment. It should, she says, be funded without the usual demand that it create jobs – which would allow it to invest without restrictions. The retail industry
Bryan Johnston of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) Business rates are one of retailers’ biggest costs. An adjustment of rateable values – based on property prices – will take effect next April and will increase average bills, especially in London and the south-east. The Treasury has limited the impact in the first year, but it plans to increase bills each year in line with the retail prices index (RPI). Johnston wants this scrapped in favour of the lower consumer prices index (CPI), which is not due to replace RPI until 2020. Johnston says retailers are keen to understand the complex plans to devolve business rates revenue to councils. At the moment, local authorities are encouraged to offer discounts to help regenerate their town centres, and can keep 50% of the money that generates. Reforms proposed by Osborne will bring that to 100%. But few councils have taken advantage of what they see as a race to the bottom. Johnston wants Hammond to reform the system so that councils can offer discounts without compensation for lost tax revenues, especially since public spending cuts reduced funds for vital local services. Retailers have also been hit hard by the “national living wage” (NLW), which pushed up the minimum hourly pay for over-24s from £6.70 to £7.20. Johnston says BRC members want Hammond to pledge that future rises be left to the independent Low Pay Commission to implement. The commission is due to report in the next few weeks on plans to evaluate the impact of annual increases in the NLW, and avoid political interference. The younger generation
Georgia Rigg, Reclaim charity, Manchester Reclaim aims to give working-class children leadership skills so they can compete with peers from wealthier backgrounds. Rigg says the cost of student loans means asking “young people and their families to walk blindly into tens of thousands of pounds of debt when that is culturally taboo”. She says: “The scrapping of maintenance grants and the proposed increase in tuition fees for teacher training will have an adverse effect on the poorest students and further damage social mobility. Our latest report, Educating All, shows that financial stress can be a factor in mental health problems and trigger additional wellbeing needs.” Hammond also needs to go further than just funding apprenticeships. “We need to be looking at which young people are being employed and where. How many working-class young people are recruited into top companies? Numerous reports indicate that the class ceiling is alive and well, with some employers using a ‘poshness’ test when recruiting, favouring well-travelled individuals with ‘well-spoken’ accents. How will the government tackle the invisible barriers that working-class young people face when seeking employment?” The anti-poverty charity
Peter Tutton, head of policy at Stepchange Formerly the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, Stepchange is a national charity that has advised more than two million people with debt problems over the past 20 years. Tutton says seven out of 10 people who call for help are in work, but have suffered an income shock. “We are worried about changes to tax credits from April that limit child benefit to two children.” Like Beck at the EY Item Club, he wants freezes on tax credits and the new universal credit to be lifted. Capping child benefit at two children from April 2017 will also prove disastrous, he says. “About 17% of clients with more than two children cannot make ends meet, even when we’ve helped them with their debts. We estimate that figure will shoot up to 90% after April, when they will lose on average £300 a month.” This loss of income will come on top of extra costs from rising inflation. “When inflation is rising more than wages,” he says, “safety nets just have to work.” The chancellor can also help indebted people by offering them cheaper credit. “The government offers mortgage buyers cheaper credit through Help to Buy; why not people who are in an often temporary financial hole that becomes permanent when they are forced to use high-priced credit to pay off previous loans?” The pensions expert
Ros Altmann, former pensions minister Pensioner incomes have risen sharply in the past 15 years, and fared particularly well after the 2008 crash. But now it is time to end the triple-lock policy that has guaranteed the UK’s 12 million over-65s a 2.5% annual rise if inflation or earnings are lower, says Altmann. Dropping that guaranteed increase would free funds for care of the elderly, which she says is bringing the health service to its knees and threatening to become a 21st-century scandal. Altmann says the first strategy note she wrote as pensions minister called for the integration of the health and social care systems to cope with the growing scandal of elderly care: “It is going to cost billions to cope with the rising cost of looking after the baby boomer generation, and the chancellor needs to offer tax breaks to better-off taxpayers so they can save for their own care.” If those who can save are not encouraged to put funds aside, they will find themselves selling their home to pay for their care. The government could allow savers to put as much as £50,000 in a pot ring-fenced for care. These policies could be aimed at families, and their use could be encouraged by structuring the pots to avoid inheritance tax. “We must change the way people think about this. Governments have ignored it for too long.”"
2016-11-19T18:36:41Z,uk-news,UK news,John McDonnell backs revamp of Buckingham Palace as petition grows,"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has backed the publicly funded £369m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. The republican Labour MP declared the Queen’s main residence a national monument and said no government would allow it to fall into disrepair. “It’s a national monument ... national heritage. It’s going to be treated that way, in the same way as the House of Commons. When you have these old buildings they have to be looked after,” McDonnell told LBC radio. Asked if the Queen should pay for the work, instead of the money coming from a 66% increase in the sovereign grant, he said: “She may well consider that. I am a republican, but when it comes to decisions like that I think they are left to her.” The Treasury announced a 66% increase in the annual sovereign grant on Friday to meet the cost of the 10-year refit, which will include the replacement of decades-old electrical wiring, lead piping and boilers at the central London palace. An online petition urging the royal family to fund the refurbishment of the palace privately has collected more than 50,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. Mark Johnson said in his petition, addressed to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that the royal family should pay for the revamp themselves. A copywriter and former journalist, he said it was the first time he had done anything like this, but that he had been outraged by the timing of the news. “I am all for protecting Buckingham Palace, but at a time when the public purse is so pressured, and on a day that temperatures dropped overnight, when the elderly are freezing in their homes and children have damp mould on their bedroom walls, to fund it publicly is something out of a Charles Dickens novel,” he said. ”It’s up to the royal household how they fund it privately, I don’t think it will be hard to find the money, not as hard as it would be for the NHS to fund.” The crown estate, not including inherited private residences such as Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, is worth £11bn and made a £304m profit in its most recent financial year. One petition signatory wrote: “This decision spits in the face of the majority of people in this country.”
The occupied royal palaces are held in trust for the nation and are not owned by the Queen, with the cost of maintaining them borne by the taxpayer. Whitehall claimed it earned a multibillion-pound boost from the 500,000 people who visited Buckingham Palace during the summer and the millions who came to see the changing of the guard. The fire at Windsor Castle in 1992 resulted in a five-year restoration, the Treasury said, and rectifying similar damage to the palace would cost up to £250m for a single wing. The sovereign grant for the royal family is equal to 15% of the crown estate’s annual profits, which were £45.6m most recently. This will increase to a 25% share until the renovation finishes in 2027, after which it will revert to the lower amount. A Treasury spokesman said: “If there was a fire, it would cost the taxpayer a lot more than this and the grant is not for the royal family’s personal use.” When asked why the renovation could not be funded by private assets, he pointed out that the duchy of Cornwall’s revenue already went to private charities, adding: “The monarchy can’t sell property because it’s managed by the crown estate commissioners.”"
2016-11-20T00:04:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Bolton’s joy over young England Test star Haseeb Hameed,"Bolton can still barely believe it. The exploits of 19-year-old Haseeb Hameed have united a community in admiration and astonishment. This weekend, Hameed is playing his second Test match for England against India, in front of a packed, passionate crowd in Visakhapatnam. For many avidly following his progress in the former mill town where he grew up, his story is akin to a fairytale. “It was written in the stars,” Hameed’s elder brother Safwaan, himself an accomplished cricketer, told the Observer. “The pride that we and this community feel in him is so overwhelming. He has done it – for himself and for us.” Maybe it was the nicknames Little Master and Baby Boycott – picked up while still a child with a plastic bat – or perhaps it was the crowds watching him play in the local park or the queues of children lining up to bowl at him. But Hameed seemed set for stardom when he was barely past his toddler years. When he was just five, Hameed would pick up his bat and follow his brothers and father out to the park near their Greater Manchester home to practise. During the long summer nights after Hameed had finished school and returned from mosque classes, locals would gather to watch the family play. A queue would form – made up of children itching to bowl to the youngest and most talented Hameed. Even in the winter, the family would clear the snow so that they could have a game. Fourteen years later, that dedication has paid off. Hameed now faces the best bowlers in the world. He made his England Test debut against India in Rajkot, only a few miles from his father’s ancestral village, making 31 and 82 on his maiden appearance and becoming only the second teenager to make his debut for England since 1949. But what is remarkable about Hameed’s journey is his success in a historically elitist sport as a young British-Indian man hailing from one of the most deprived areas in UK. Those who know him say this background helped create the steeliness that has carried him to the highest levels of the game. John Hutchinson, secretary of Bolton league club Farnworth Social Circle, where Hameed played and trained, said the teenager’s rapid progression had been staggering. He said: “It was obvious right from the off that we had someone here who was exceptional. In the whole time that I had been coaching I had not seen anything like it. “It was particularly outstanding because of his background. This was a young boy who came from one of the most deprived areas in Bolton, possibly in Lancashire, but rather than hinder him, this brought out in him a determination to succeed and a fearlessness which I had never seen before. He was infallible. I knew then that he would play for England.” One man in particular has played a starring role in Hameed’s rise – his father Ismail. Born in the village of Umraj, in the state of Gujarat, Ismail emigrated to Bolton in 1969 with his wife Najma and worked in the town’s cotton factories. The couple had five children and lived in a two-up, two-down house in the deprived Halliwell area.
A few years later they were able to move to a larger house, but still in the same area, near Rawsthorne Park. It was to this park that Ismail would take his three sons almost every day to practise, hoping that one day they would succeed like his cricketing idol, Geoffrey Boycott. The older sons Safwaan and Nuaman, now both in their 30s, went on to play professional cricket in lower league teams, but it was the youngest boy who caught the eye of talent scouts in the area. Safwaan said: “Whenever we would go to practise, he would be there waiting by the door with his little plastic bat and ball, and he would pester my dad to give him throw-downs [balls thrown from a short distance]. We could see the park from our upstairs window and we’d always keep an eye on whether it was free and then we would all head down. People would gather around to watch when Haseeb was batting – there would be a queue of young lads wanting to bowl to him.” Ismail had spotted the fascination with his youngest son’s batting ability and, a former league opening batsman himself, he decided to quit his job in the factory and became a driving instructor so that he could spend more time coaching Hameed. At nine, Hameed was taken on by Lancashire and scored his first century only a year later, beating a record previously held by another famous Lancastrian cricketer: Andrew Flintoff. Hutchinson remembers a studious and humble young man. On the pitch, he said, there was never any hint of arrogance but instead a supreme self-assurance. But even then the young right-handed batsman sometimes struggled with timekeeping. Last month, Hameed landed himself in trouble with the management on his first day of the tour, when he held up the squad’s departure for practice by being 10 minutes late for the England team bus after oversleeping. It would seem this is a family trait. Neil Taylor, his former coach at Farnworth, said: “It was always just the two of them, father and son, and it was always last-minute as Ismail would always be working. The match would start at 6pm and Haseeb would arrive at 5.55pm. He would get out of the car in all his gear and go straight out on to the field. He was exceptional. It was all cricket, cricket, cricket and he would spend hours practising. His teammates were usually not up to his standard but Haseeb was never aloof, always the humble one, and everybody wanted a piece of him.” Shortly after he made his first century for Lancashire Under-11s against Kent, he was approached by Worcestershire, who were ready to invest £100,000 in his education by sending him to the private Malvern college, where he would have been a boarder. But the bidding war was won by Lancashire, who responded by creating a cricket scholarship for the year 8 student. Hameed left his local state comprehensive to go to Bolton school, catapulting him from the inner city into the life of a public schoolboy. But Hutchinson said Hameed’s feet remained firmly on the ground. “It did not change him one bit and he continued practising with his dad and friends. The education helps but it was not the reason for his success – that is all down to his personality and the fact that he strives to succeed because of where he comes from.” Hameed is just the latest in a long line of sporting stars from Bolton, perhaps the most celebrated of whom in recent years has been Amir Khan, the former world light welterweight champion boxer now approaching the end of an illustrious career. Hameed looks to have all his greatest years ahead of him."
2016-11-20T00:05:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Revealed: Chilcot inquiry was set up ‘to avoid blame’,"The Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war was designed to “avoid blame” and reduce the risk that individuals and the government could face legal proceedings, newly released documents reveal. The papers show the thinking and advice at “the highest level of government” prior to Gordon Brown’s announcement of an inquiry. They were disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, after the Cabinet Office lost a two-year battle during which it stated that disclosure threatened to “undermine the inquiry”. They confirm that many officials who took part in the events that the inquiry investigated, including former spy chief Sir John Scarlett, were involved in setting it up. And they reveal that Sir (now Lord) Gus O’Donnell, cabinet secretary under Brown, went against Whitehall protocol when he appointed a civil servant with significant involvement in Iraq policy during the period covered by the inquiry to the key role of inquiry secretary. The documents, a series of memos by Whitehall officials, cover a four-week period in May and June 2009. They show the officials favoured from the outset a secret inquiry to be conducted by privy counsellors, based on the Franks inquiry into the Falklands war. In a memo to O’Donnell, Cabinet Office official Ben Lyon advised that the format, scope and membership of the inquiry could be designed to “focus on lessons and avoid blame”. He noted that politicians and campaigners, including Plaid Cymru and the SNP, were seeking other types of inquiry with some advocating “a full public inquiry that would place blame on individuals”. Chris Lamb, a freedom of information campaigner from Bristol who won an information tribunal ruling in May requiring the Cabinet Office to disclose the papers, told the Observer: “Avoiding blame is civil service code for not holding people accountable.” Despite the inquiry being designed to “avoid blame”, the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, subsequently claimed it could blame “whoever it likes”. Lyon noted that former foreign secretary Lord Hurd had suggested a parliamentary inquiry. But Lyon warned that would “attract a daily running commentary”, like the 2003 Hutton inquiry into the death of Iraq weapons inspector David Kelly. In a subsequent note to Brown, O’Donnell repeated the “daily commentary” warning and advised against a full public inquiry for other reasons, including cost, that it would “threaten legal liability for individuals” and, ironically, “take a long time”. “The deliberate lack of transparency and attempts to use price to justify further secrecy is deeply concerning,” said Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. O’Donnell also advised against appointing judges or lawyers who would adopt a “legalistic” focus. He recommended using the inquiry’s terms of reference to prevent it reaching “any conclusion on questions of law or fact, which create circumstances which expose organisations, departments and/or individuals to criminal or civil proceedings or judicial review”. No such instruction to the inquiry was ever made public. Lamb told the Observer: “This shows the inquiry was hobbled before it even started, with tight restrictions on what it could do that were not fully made public.” In June 2009, Brown announced a secret Privy Council “lessons learned” inquiry, as officials had recommended. However, a public and political backlash forced him to agree to some hearings being held in public. In another memo to O’Donnell, Lyon advised that the inquiry’s secretariat, though drawn from the civil service “should not have been involved in Iraq policy since 2002”. However, he conceded that appointing staff with “understanding of the nature of the business to be addressed” had advantages. This concession paved the way for appointment of Margaret Aldred, a Whitehall official who had chaired the Iraq senior officials group during the period Chilcot was investigating, as the inquiry’s secretary. Many others who helped design the inquiry had also been closely involved in the issues it would investigate. They included current cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who was Tony Blair’s parliamentary private secretary until 2003, and Scarlett, former chairman of the joint intelligence committee who had become chief of MI6 in spite of his central role in producing the notorious dossier on Iraq’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction."
2016-11-20T07:58:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Angus brings heavy rain and 80mph gusts to south coast,"Storm Angus, the first named storm of the season, has hit the UK bringing winds of up to 80mph along the coast.
The vigorous area of low pressure brought heavy rain to southern areas on Saturday night and wind speeds exceeding 50mph. The storm was pushing north over Saturday night with the worst of the weather set to hit south-east England on Sunday morning.Residents were told to prepare for travel disruption, power cuts and possible damage to buildings. Devon and Cornwall police declared a “major incident” at 4.15am on Sunday and evacuated a residential park when rain caused the river Mole to burst its banks. The water flowed through the Mill on the Mole chalet park in South Molton, Devon, and at its peak was 4ft deep, the force said. Just over an hour after the incident was declared the rain stopped, the flood subsided “very rapidly” and residents were allowed to return home. The Met Office issued an amber warning for 2am to 11am in West Sussex, Kent, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex and the Isle of Wight as Storm Angus approached. A wider yellow warning beginning just after midnight covered a swath of southern and south-eastern England, including London. Drivers should beware of flooding and debris from trees, the Met Office said. Simon Partridge, a Met Office forecaster, said Angus was identified and named early on Saturday as meteorologists tracked an area of low pressure sweeping in from the Atlantic. As it drew closer, they realised how deep it was, he said. Up to 1.6in (40mm) of rain was being predicted in some areas and Partridge warned of localised flooding because of leaves blown down by high winds blocking drains. Gusts of 70-80mph in the worst hit areas were of greatest concern as the first storm threatened to bring down weak tree branches, he said. “It is the first storm of the season, coming quite late at this time in November,” said Partridge. “This will be a bit of a shock to the system for most people in terms of wind and rainfall. “Any weak branches are likely to come down in the first storm.” The amber warning, only for wind, stretched from Portsmouth, in Hampshire, through to Sussex and the whole of the Kent coast, Partridge said. Forecasters expected gusts of 70-80mph. “Be prepared for disruption to travel services, interruptions to power supplies and some damage to buildings,” the warning said. The yellow warning covered an area roughly from Ipswich to Plymouth, with winds of 45-55mph expected inland and 60-65mph on the coast. Rainfall of up to 40mm was possible over the hills in the areas covered by the warning, but the majority of the wet weather was predicted to clear the east coast by about 10am on Sunday, with some blustery showers to follow. “It’s one of those: comes and goes pretty quickly. It does rattle through at a fair speed,” Partridge said. “Obviously there will be some localised effects. There could be some disruption to transport, roads with some localised flooding.” Forecasters predicted the storm would move off quite quickly into the North Sea towards Europe, with conditions set to improve from around midday Sunday. However, further wind and rain, expected to move north across England and Wales on Monday, could bring more flooding.
In the north, the cold spell continued with light winds and clear skies expected. Drivers crossing the Pennines were confronted with a covering of snow at high levels on Saturday morning, and winter wonderland scenes greeted walkers above 1,000ft (305m) in areas of the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales. There were also some light snow showers on lower ground in West Yorkshire. The pop band Scouting For Girls were trapped in Britain’s highest pub, the Tan Hill Inn, which stands at 1,732ft in the Yorkshire Dales, where they were entertaining a 200-strong crowd. The group were among about 40 people forced to spend Friday night sleeping in cars and on floors after the Children In Need gig, which raised £6,500. The band were back on the road to their next show in Scotland on Saturday after gritters were called in to clear the roads. The pub’s manager, Vanessa Houghton said: “We have managed to boot them out now. We did a convoy this morning and got everybody on the road by lunchtime … It was all good fun and everybody wants to come back next year.”The UK’s coldest temperatures were in Scotland. Braemar in Aberdeenshire dropped to -8C (17.6F) on Friday night, and -10C was expected in sheltered areas in Scotland."
2016-11-20T08:30:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Julie Hambleton on the Birmingham pub bombings: ‘I owe it to my sister to fight’,"I remember 21 November 1974 as one of the befores and afters of my childhood. It was the night before my ninth birthday and my mum was out with some friends in Birmingham where we lived. News came through of a devastating bomb attack in two city centre pubs – the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town near New Street station. My dad was never a worrier, but that night he obviously became desperate for news – long before mobile phones – that my mum was safe. We sat up waiting to hear. In the event, she returned home in the early hours having been stuck in traffic while the city was shut down. It was the first time I remember of really imagining the worst. My birthday was all about relief and might have beens as the awful news of what had happened came through. For 21 families in Birmingham though, that sense of relief never arrived. Julie Hambleton’s family was one of those 21. Julie was 11 at the time. Her elder sister Maxine was in the Tavern in the Town, and died at the scene from horrific injuries. Forty-two years on, when I meet Julie, in a bar not far from New Street station, she is still very much living with the fallout of that night. For a long time, the family couldn’t talk about Maxine (who they all called Mackie) at all. The convictions of the men who became known as the Birmingham Six seemed to have offered a semblance of justice – but when those men were released in 1991 after Chris Mullin’s long campaign to prove the convictions unsafe, that sense was denied again. Julie’s brother Brian, who was a year older than Maxine, started a lone effort to have the case reinvestigated, and though the rest of the family – their mum and two more brothers and a sister – were sympathetic, they couldn’t face the anguish that a campaign might bring. “We don’t use the word closure,” Julie says now, “But when they were released it certainly split the wounds open again. If they didn’t do it who did? And why is nobody looking for them?”
Something changed for Julie in 2009. She can date the moment precisely. “I was watching the TV and there was news of all these public inquiries going on, one after the other. I’m thinking – excuse my language here, I never swear in public – but there is no other way of saying it: ‘What the fuck?’ Twenty-one people were murdered in Birmingham and no one seems interested. My sister didn’t hurt anyone, never did anyone any harm. I felt angry to the extent that I nearly put my boot through the telly. So I sat down and wrote a letter to the chief constable of West Midlands police, Chris Sims. I had a response six weeks later from his chief inspector basically saying he was too busy to talk to me.” And so it began. Though she works at the university, the past seven years of Julie’s life have also been devoted to making people talk to her. She is a vivid and friendly presence – not a natural troublemaker, she says – but the more she got told no, the more her determination grew. She got passed down through the ranks of the West Midlands police, and for months and years no one seemed willing to even give her a meeting. An intervention by her MP, Khalid Mahmood, didn’t help. After the Birmingham Six were released the murder case was declared open, but there was apparently no appetite to get to the truth. “The contempt with which we have been treated by West Midland police is palpably disgusting,” Hambleton says. “We are talking about what was the biggest mass murder on the British mainland in the 20th century. The police were, like, just shut up and go away. Not on my shift.”
In 2011 she started a couple of e-petitions with a view to getting a parliamentary debate on the issue; that was unsuccessful but the petitions led to a BBC documentary, Who Murdered Maxine? and a meeting that proved cathartic for Julie. The documentary-makers persuaded her family to meet Paddy Hill [the highest profile face of the Birmingham Six]. “I really didn’t want to do it,” she says, “because at that time, despite everything, we were still half-convinced he was one of the bombers. That was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. As we walked into the room I was inconsolable. I couldn’t breathe for crying. I thought I was being a traitor to my sister and to my mum.” As it has turned out, Hill has become a close friend and a keen supporter in the fight for justice, which now involves 10 of the families. Julie continued her letter-writing campaign; lords, MPs, the prime minister. “David Cameron responded last January,” she says. “He wrote me the usual letter saying his diary was too full – a few days later he flew to Paris to show solidarity for the victims of terrorism. You couldn’t make it up.” One of the difficulties Julie and her campaign have faced is the question of whether the bombings fall under the Good Friday Agreement, which included a vaguely worded understanding between the British and Irish governments for the early release of prisoners serving sentences in connection with paramilitary groups, but no amnesty for crimes that had not been prosecuted. The Birmingham bombings appeared to fall into a grey area of this already opaque understanding. For one thing, the IRA had never claimed responsibility for the attacks, for another there had been the unsafe prosecution of the Birmingham Six. The long campaign of Justice4the21 finally started to gain some traction this year, in part because of the long hard fight for truth by the Hillsborough campaigners, in part because it was picked up by Jess Phillips, the straight-talking MP for Birmingham Yardley, “the first real person who is also a politician that we have come across,” Julie says. After new evidence emerged, Phillips has been helpful in pushing their case for reopening the inquest. Two witnesses in particular have come forward to say that they warned the Birmingham police that there would be an IRA attack in the city that day; but not only did their warnings go unheeded, no record of them appears to exist. The coroner made a judgment about that evidence on 1 June this year. That morning, Julie appeared on the BBC’s Today programme in one of the most memorable and heartfelt pieces of live radio I’ve ever heard. Her fellow guest was the former IRA intelligence coordinator Kieran Conway, who now practises as a barrister. Conway quite blithely admitted that he believed he knew some of those responsible for the Birmingham bombs – and that he had committed terrorist acts himself. The plot leader, Mick Murray, was dead, he said, but others are “walking free” and living in and around Dublin. ”Everybody knows who they are,” he claimed. “But there is no evidence. The only way that there could be convictions would be if one or more of the bombers were to present themselves to the UK police station and make full confessions. I don’t believe that will happen.” In any case, he didn’t see the bombers as murderers. “I take the view that appalling and all as the bombs were, the volunteers who carried them out were relatively blameless in that their only fault was that they carried out the instructions of their commander,” he told the programme. “Their only fault was that they didn’t – and this would have been elementary, I was trained in bomb-planting myself and planted a few in my time – in advance check that they had working phone boxes [to send warnings] in case of difficulty.” Julie Hambleton was speaking to the BBC studio from her kitchen at home. She smiles when I recall this confrontation. “I was so, so angry listening to this,” she says. “I’ve got a zillion things running through my head that I want to say. And I’m thinking, ‘Oh God, what would my sister Jane want me to say? What would Brian want me to say?’” What she said was this, her voice steely with outrage: “Men – or women, we don’t know – planned, prepped, put together bombs, walked into two pubs and he claims it was an accident? How dare he be on the other end of the line and make such claims? I wonder if one of his kids was killed beyond description – when all their skin has literally been stripped off their body, they’ve got no legs, they’ve got no arms, you can’t recognise them by their face because their injuries are such that they’ve already been partially cremated – how dare he make such harrowing and horrendous statements over the airwaves.” She went on to challenge Conway on the bombs he had planted, called him and the other bombers “gutless cowards” and left him rattled and grasping for platitudes. She recalls that moment with incredulity. “He’s admitted on radio that he has planted bombs himself. And then after the interview he gets up and walks away. Where else in the world would it be possible to do that?”
Later that day, the Hambletons and the other families received the best news they’d yet received when the coroner, Louise Hunt, granted the reopening of the inquest, saying: “I am satisfied that the inquest should be resumed. I have serious concerns that advanced notice of the bombs may have been available to the police and that they failed to take the necessary steps to protect life.” The inquest is due to start at the end of this month, but the campaign’s lawyers, working pro bono, remain locked in a dispute with the Home Office and the attorney general over the question of whether the families will be granted legal aid to have proper representation in the inquest, which could last more than a year.
The families had a meeting with Amber Rudd, newly installed home secretary, in September to make their case. “I don’t think it went as she imagined at all,” Julie says. “She didn’t seem to have been briefed. I said, ‘It’s just as well my mother’s not here because by now she would have turned the tables over’. She is 82, only a dot but she has the fire in her. Amber Rudd was saying ‘I’m here and I’m listening’ but she clearly wasn’t. I was sitting closest to her. I had a picture in my bag of Maxine. I was so aggravated I jumped up and went searching in my bag. The others told me later they thought I was going to take a swing at her because I was that mad. I got the picture and I shoved it under the home secretary’s nose. ‘That’s my sister: she was 18. What were you doing when you were 18? You were at university in Edinburgh weren’t you? My sister didn’t have that opportunity…’” Rudd promised to write to the justice secretary, Liz Truss, to set out their case. Unable to find out whether that had happened, Julie spotted Truss as she stood in line to get into the Tory conference in Birmingham a week later. She set out her case, and gave Truss one of her business cards which has the 21 names of victims on the back and on the front a heart which her niece designed with 21 cracks of heartbreaks on it.
“She just looked straight through me,” Julie recalls. “She knew nothing about us at all. She turned her back and introduced me to her special adviser.” Rudd called her later that week to say that the families were not to be granted legal aid according to the precedent set by the Hillsborough campaigners, without giving a reason. The families’ lawyers are appealing against that decision. Without that provision being granted they argue that a further delay in the inquest will be necessary. “What they are trying to do is do it on the cheap,” Hambleton says. “We have got the inquest itself to be resumed. That in itself is a huge feat. But the government, it appears, are constantly trying to create delaying tactics. To stop us getting to the truth.” Why does she believe they are making it so difficult? She says she believes that “they know their predecessors’ hands were dipped in blood. That they were aware that these bombings were going to happen. Our loved ones were cannon fodder. Imagine if people got to know that the government knew there were going to be terrorist attacks and didn’t step in to stop it…” Officially there are no files about the case to reopen; unofficially Julie has been made aware that they are under embargo for 75 years. Thirty-five pieces of evidence have been lost, the police have admitted, including a third bomb, which was discovered unexploded. In some minds the case raises questions of statutes of limitations; that the inquest is a costly exercise that may lead no closer to the truth. Julie has often heard the argument that they should not rake over what is now the distant past, that it will only cause more heartbreak. Chris Mullin, who does not support their campaign, is among those who have expressed reservations. She believes that his own campaign for the Birmingham Six uncovered a great deal of evidence about the facts of the case, which has never been tested in court. She and some of the other families eventually got their meeting with chief constable Sims in 2014, five years after her original letter. One of the questions she asked was why the police had never interviewed Mullin about some of that evidence that he had uncovered, and anything else that he knew. She says Sims suggested that he had five names of suspects for the bombing in his drawer but no evidence with which to advance a case against them. At which point, Julie heard herself saying: “Excuse me, but you are the police aren’t you?” Lawyers for the West Midlands police argued that the inquest should not go ahead, and that the coroner did not have the authority to reopen it. The coroner disagreed. One of the best things about the campaign, Julie says, is how it has brought the families of the victims closer together. “We get on really well. I lost my sister, they lost their brother or father or mother but we now have an extended family. We would prefer not to for obvious reasons but we are a community now for each other.” It has also, she believes, helped the city to heal from the darkest chapter in its recent history, which led to a mistrust not only of the police but also anger against the large Irish population of Birmingham. Local papers and radio stations have been supportive of their cause, a CD featuring 21 Brummie artists, most of whom lived through the tragedy – including Roy Wood and Steve Gibbons – is being released tomorrow. That healing, Julie believes, will only be helped by a full inquest into the new evidence. “We are up against every agency of the state,” she says. “Article six of the Human Rights Act says we should be able to pursue our case fairly. The Hillsborough families got parity of funding with the police. We believe we should have that too.”
There has been a memorial service every year for the 21 victims of the bombings in Birmingham Cathedral. The Hambletons didn’t always go because it was just too painful. “You might think I’m pretty together, just talking like this, but I’m not,” Julie says. “You just become anaesthetised to it a bit. Two weeks ago we won an award in London, the Liberty award for ‘the long walk’. I don’t like getting awards but people said I should go because it was a good platform to talk about the issues. And on the day I just fell apart, was inconsolable again at home. You know, who wants an award? You just want your sister.” She can’t help herself crying a bit now when she says that. “I was only 11 but she really was a force of nature, Mackie, she was clever, she wanted to be a lawyer,” she says. “My mum always said don’t put her on a pedestal, but I always say that’s quite hard to do. She was our big sister and she was very special. She used to make us our own clothes. In the picture you see of her with her white dress and the hat – she had made that, and she used to make us flared jeans, really good ones that made all my friends jealous. The only reason she went to town that night was to hand out some housewarming invitations she had made. She had just come back from grape-picking in France, in the champagne vineyards to improve her French for her A-levels. It’s funny Jess Phillips’s dad used to teach her at the grammar school.” She cries again and I say I’m sorry for having her go over all this again. She suggests that there is no need to apologise but that it is never far away. “Mum ID’d her, but she didn’t tell us until four or five years ago to protect us. We know what her injuries were. The police gave us a synopsis. What’s still hard is: did she die instantaneously? She would have been in so much pain. That’s something that haunts me. And little things make me sad. My mum told me recently she used to go up to town just to talk to people about Maxine when we were at school, because she felt so alone, and she didn’t want to upset us. We still don’t talk about her much as a family. It’s just too sad. But I have pictures of her all over the place now. That’s a new thing. I hit a mental brick wall about 16 years ago. I went to my doctor and he was fabulous. He said, ‘It’s because you never mourned her properly as a child’.” Does the campaign help in that way, or does she feel she has no option? “Mackie had been staying with us two days before it happened,” she says, by way of an answer. She had just moved into this house she was sharing with my brothers. I was running around because I was always late for school. Mum said to me, aren’t you going to give Mackie a kiss? So I went running upstairs and give her a hug and a kiss, and I said: ‘I love you Mackie, see you Friday at the party!’ She said: ‘Yes, see you Friday.’ That was the last time I saw her alive. That’s why I fight. Because if it was her she would have been screaming from the rooftops. That’s the girl she was. I just feel I owe it to her to do the same.” This article was amended on 20 November 2016. The original article wrongly described Liz Truss as attorney general. In fact she is the justice secretary and lord chancellor. This has been amended."
2016-11-20T11:35:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Cawsand joins St Ives as the new frontline of Cornwall’s war on second homes,"“Second home. Second home. That one’s a second home. Second home.” Alison Hall is walking along Garrett Street in the Cornish village of Cawsand reciting a litany as she passes the former fishermen’s cottages. “Second home. That’s a holiday let. Second home. These people live here all the time. Second home.” The litany becomes a lament. “Second home. Second home above. This one is lived in – they’ve got two young children, a rarity. These two are rented out as holiday lets … That one’s a celebrity second home.” Garrett Street is the latest frontline to be opened in the battle against second homes. Of the 63 properties on the winding street in Cawsand, one of a handful of villages on the Rame peninsula across the water from Plymouth, only 29% are occupied all year round; 36 of them are second homes, nine are holiday lets. Five parish councils on the peninsula have joined forces to produce a neighbourhood plan that – as in St Ives at the other end of the county – includes a provision to ensure that all newly built homes are sold as principal residences. Under the 2011 Localism Act, a local planning authority must put a neighbourhood plan in place if it wins the support of more than 50% of voters. The move comes after the high court last week upheld the St Ives Plan following a challenge from developers. In May, 83% of St Ives residents who voted were in favour of the plan. With councils across the country monitoring the result, the Rame peninsula is the first to move to introduce a similar measure. Consultations have been held and a referendum is expected in the new year. “We’ve been working on this for five years,” says George Trubody, a county councillor for the peninsula and chairman of the neighbourhood plan steering group. “If the high court had upheld the challenge, we would have dropped our plan. It wouldn’t have been worth the paper it was written on.” The rate of second-home ownership in the five parishes is among the highest in the country, with buyers drawn by the idyllic setting, the proximity to cities such as Plymouth, and comparatively low prices. While houses are expensive for locals, for buyers from London and areas of the south-east they are a bargain, with a three-bedroom house selling for around £350,000. The latest figures for home ownership in the five parishes, taken in 2009, show that in Maker-with-Rame parish, which includes the villages of Kingsand and Cawsand, second home ownership is 33.3%. St John parish, also part of the Rame peninsual group, has the second highest rate in the county, at 39.9%. “The response to the consultation was that we don’t want more houses being built that will be bought by people from up-country so that locals can’t afford to live here,” says Trubody, sipping a coffee in the Cross Keys pub, one of four in the village. “Any new development needs to be for people to live in because otherwise we will lose our community and our schools and doctors, and the peninsula will become somewhere that just opens up in the summer.”
A walk around Cawsand on a blustery November day reveals an absence of the key ingredient for a community: people. “The village is an empty shell,” says Ross Edwards, an electrician converting a seafront house to a second home. “It’s like a ghost town. Walk down the street and you’ll only see tradesmen.” Edwards was born in Cawsand but cannot afford to live there. “There’s nothing affordable, to rent or buy,” he says. “My father and uncle still work as fishermen but they detest it here. All their family have had to move on. It’s taken away their kids. It’s no one’s fault, it’s just a reflection of the inequality in the country.” Occasionally, frustration at that inequality can get the better of the locals. “Sometimes people put mackerel through the letterboxes because they know there isn’t going to be anyone in the house for months,” says Edwards. There is near unanimity in Cawsand over the threat to village life posed by second-home owners, from Brian Smith, with his range of T-shirts giving expression to his feelings about outsiders, to subpostmaster Dave Howden, who watches as visitors descend on the village without stopping at his shop. “You see the second-home owners arrive and the Waitrose trucks come 15 minutes later,” he says“We do get to know them, though, because of their attitude, which can be slightly superior, almost condescending,” says Bowden. “They can be abrupt. Everyone here says hello to everyone else, but they don’t get involved.” Walking around the village, it is easy to identify the second homes, from the exteriors boasting Farrow & Ball-style heritage paintwork to the interiors with their minimalist aesthetic. “The houses are all gutted,” says Bowden. “The outside is Cornwall, the inside is London. If you don’t like a Cornish house, why buy one? I don’t understand how you can have a housing shortage and all these houses sitting here empty.” Liz Gunn, who came from London with her husband to open the Old Bakery on Garrett Street a little less than four years ago, is one of the few to voice support for the visitors. “When we came here we had no idea who lived here or who was just visiting,” she says during a break from the day’s sourdough bread-making class, “they were all customers. I find a lot of people who have second homes here or come on holiday to be extraordinarily friendly. They’ve asked us to dinner. But sometimes you do hear the conversations and you think, oh my God, you’re from London, it’s so incongruous.”
Chris Balch, professor of planning at Plymouth University, argues that the issues around second-home ownership are an expression of the distortions of the housing market. “It’s not about xenophobia, it’s about housing being snapped up by people with 10 times the income of the locals. The government needs to address affordable housing. You can’t blame communities for doing something to rig the market. Perhaps this is some reflection of the things happening in wider society, an effort to usurp the power of the market.” Edwina Hannaford, Cornwall council cabinet member for planning, predicted that more areas would follow the lead of St Ives. “Some of these communities are past the tipping point,” she said. “It’s not just second homes and holiday lets, now it’s investment properties. This is the worst-case scenario but the high court ruling was a triumph for localism. St Minver was waiting for the ruling and they’ve pushed the button now.” St Minver includes the popular resorts of Polzeath and Rock, where 52% of homes are second homes, the highest proportion in Cornwall. Back in the Cross Keys, Steve Radley sighs as he looks out of the window at Cawsand’s deserted streets. “We’re becoming a very old community,” he says. “Socially, it’s still a wonderful place to live, but I’m looking at it as someone in their seventies. We’ve ended up as a glorified theme park. When the swallows leave, the number of houses with no lights on goes up. It really gets to you.”"
2016-11-20T11:56:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond dashes hopes of big windfalls for struggling families,"Philip Hammond has admitted that the government is facing a “sharp challenge” in the face of Brexit and cautioned against any unexpectedly generous windfalls for families who are “just about managing”. In a round of interviews ahead of his autumn statement on Wednesday, the chancellor said he needed “headroom” in the public finances to deal with the economic impact of leaving the EU – with forecasts predicting slower growth – and “eye-wateringly” large debt. Campaigners have called on Hammond to reverse George Osborne’s cuts to universal credit, which critics say will leave struggling working families up to £1,300 a year worse off by 2020. Asked if he would do so, Hammond told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I’m not going to go into details of the autumn statement that I shall make on Wednesday, but you’ve seen the forecasts, the range of independent forecasts. We’ll get the OBR’s forecast on Wednesday.
“Many of those forecasts are pointing to a slowing of economic growth next year and a sharp challenge for the public finances. “There are a range of reasons for that, and we’ve got to make sure that what we do is responsible, that everything we do is compatible with building resilience in our economy as we go into a period where there will be some uncertainty around the negotiation over our exit from the EU and focus on making sure that our economy is match-fit for the opportunities and the challenges that will lie ahead.” He was keen to emphasise the challenges of rising inflation and fluctuating markets because of Brexit uncertainty. He is also reportedly facing a £100bn black hole in the public finances. “We have to maintain our credibility. We have eye-wateringly large debt, we still have a significant deficit in this country and we have to prepare the economy for the period that lies ahead,” the chancellor told Marr. “I want to make sure that the economy is watertight, that we have enough headroom to deal with any unexpected challenges over the next couple of years and most importantly, that we’re ready to seize the opportunities of leaving the European Union.”
In a hint that he would offer some help to the so-called Jams – “just about managing” – on Wednesday, Hammond said he would support people “who work hard and by and large do not feel that they are sharing in the prosperity that economic growth is bringing to the country”. He gave away few clues, however, as to what form this help would take. Appearing on the same programme, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Hammond to reverse universal credit cuts alongside reductions in disability benefits that would leave some claimants £30 a week worse off. “Universal credit, we’re hoping on Wednesday the government will reverse that. “We’re also hoping in the first stage of our reversal of austerity, he will ensure the employment support allowance, £30 a week cut to disabled people, who are desperately seeking work, will be reversed,” he said. “That will be a first stage and I’m hoping the government will do that on Wednesday. If they don’t, we will.” McDonnell said Labour would support an increase in the 40p tax threshold from £43,000 next year to £50,000, a move David Cameron promised in 2014 to take millions of middle-income families off the higher tax rate. He said: “It looks as though the threshold will be increased on Wednesday by the government, and we would support that. It’s to people, some of whom need a tax giveaway at the moment because the mismanagement of the economy by the Conservatives is hitting them hard. “What we need is a long-term strategy. This autumn statement, we’re going back to giveaways and gimmicks again.” In terms of infrastructure, Hammond will announce a £1.3bn injection of funding for Britain’s roads on Wednesday, it emerged this weekend. McDonnell, however, said it would not be enough to generate the growth necessary to get the economy moving. “All of the infrastructure I’ve heard the government is supposed to be announcing are press releases we’ve had already,” he said."
2016-11-20T14:47:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Duchess of York seeks £25m damages over Mazher Mahmood sting,"The Duchess of York is seeking £25m in damages from News Group Newspapers over the cash-for-access sting by the undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood that destroyed her reputation, it has emerged. In court documents seen by the Mail on Sunday, Sarah Ferguson claims she was tricked by the former News of the World reporter, who was jailed last month, when she allegedly offered to introduce him to her former husband Prince Andrew for £500,000. The £25m figure is said to reflect what she has lost in earnings as a result of the sting, according to the report. Ferguson is also seeking an undisclosed sum for her distress and upset. In defence papers, lawyers for the Rupert Murdoch-owned publishing company accuse her of “dishonesty” and attempted fraud and describe her case as “defective and embarrassing”, the Mail on Sunday reported. Ferguson was secretly filmed in 2010 by Mahmood, who posed as a wealthy Indian businessman looking to invest. The video footage and recording appeared to show her agreeing to set up a meeting between Mahmood and Andrew, and also allegedly accepting £27,600 in advance, telling the reporter: “I can open any door you want.” The writ was filed in April, seven months after Mahmood was arrested. He was jailed last month for tampering with evidence in the collapsed drugs trial of the singer and X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos. A high court judge last week ruled that details of the writ could be made public.
Her lawyers claim Mahmood invaded her privacy and “used deceit” to induce her to make “unguarded statements to her detriment”. The writ states that when the News of the World ran the story, her comments were taken out of context, causing “serious embarrassment, humiliation, distress and reputational damage” and huge financial loss. News Group Newspapers (NGN) insists the story, headlined “Fergie ‘Sells’ Andy for £500K”, was both true and in the public interest. A 21-page defence document alleges that the duchess was prepared to “enter into a corrupt arrangement” to secure access to Andrew. It alleges she suggested to Mahmood that “commercial favours could be bought from a member of the royal family” and that Andrew’s then position as trade envoy could be exploited “provided the price was right and the money went to her and not the Duke of York”. The writ includes details of her earnings, the Mail on Sunday reports. It claims in the year before the scandal, she made £750,000 for speaking engagements and media work. In the year after the article, her earnings dropped to £54,000 and the following year she made nothing at all. The writ says: “The duchess has lost approximately £510,000 each year of expected income from speaking engagements and articles in the media,” the Mail on Sunday reported. “The duchess estimates her financial loss to date at £25,060,000. In addition … the duchess suffered serious distress and upset for which she is entitled to compensation,” the newspaper quoted. News Group Newspapers claims that if the duchess did suffer financial losses, they were caused by “her own illegality” and cites her “attempts to gain pecuniary advantage by deception and to commit fraud”, the Mail on Sunday said. Following the sting, Ferguson apologised for a “serious lapse of judgment” and told the US talkshow host Oprah Winfrey she had been drinking and was “in the gutter at that moment”. Buckingham Palace said at the time that the duke categorically denied any knowledge of meetings between his ex-wife and Mahmood. She and Andrew married in 1986 and separated in 1992, two months after photographs emerged of her having her toes sucked by John Bryan, described as her financial manager. They divorced in 1996. She received a £2m settlement, and earned £2m as a WeightWatchers ambassador until 2007. At the time of the 2010 exposé, she was reportedly facing financial difficulties. Mahmood is named as a defendant in the writ, along with NGN, the former News of the World editor Colin Myler, and the former News International legal affairs manager Tom Crone. Mahmood was jailed for 15 months for conspiring to pervert the course of justice over the collapsed trial of Contostavlos. Following his conviction, it emerged that News UK was facing more than 45 civil claims that could total as much as £800m from former victims of Mahmood’s stings, including the actor John Alford and former Page 3 girl Emma Morgan."
2016-11-20T19:55:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Autumn statement: what might the chancellor have up his sleeve?,"The chancellor Philip Hammond will deliver his maiden autumn statement on Wednesday against a backdrop of weaker growth prospects and a large deficit. While room for big giveaways will be limited, Hammond is likely to have some measures up his sleeve to support the economy during the negotiations to leave the EU. Hammond has already signalled a willingness to ease the pace of austerity set out by George Osborne, abandoning his predecessor’s plan to return the public finances to surplus by 2019-20. Help for Britain’s so-called Jams – those families “just about managing” – is likely to be high on his list of priorities. Here are some of the measures that could be announced:
Additional childcare subsidies, possibly by extending existing support to the working parents of one- and two-year-olds. Air passenger duty could be cut to help families facing the prospect of higher costs for foreign holidays. The current rate for a short-haul flight in economy class is £13, rising to £73 for flights over 2,000 miles. The long-haul charge is due to rise to £75 from April. Freeze fuel duty at 57.95p per litre in April. That would ease some of the pressure on motorists who have seen petrol prices rise since the Brexit vote. Infrastructure spending to improve road and rail networks, with specific projects such as an expressway connecting Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge, and an upgrade of the A303/A30/A358 corridor to Land’s End. The chancellor is also expected to make further announcements related to the northern powerhouse, masterminded by his predecessor George Osborne. An industrial strategy for Britain. This has been mentioned since Theresa May became prime minister but little detail has emerged on specific plans. Broad ambitions include new corporate governance rules – including the possibility of having workers on boards – as well as an increase in housebuilding and delivering infrastructure projects. Now could be the time for more specific commitments. Float the idea of a temporary VAT cut, from 20% currently to 17.5%. He would probably suggest this as a possibility for the spring 2017 budget, traditionally the point at which major tax changes are announced, rather than as an immediate measure. A VAT cut would limit the rise in inflation predicted for 2017, and therefore the squeeze on household budgets. Plans to ban pensions cold calling have already been signalled. The ban is aimed at protecting millions of vulnerable people, particularly the elderly, who are targeted in this way in an attempt to trick them out of their life savings. Almost 11 million pensioners are being targeted every year by cold callers according to the Treasury, with savers reporting estimated losses of almost £19m to pensions scams between April 2015 and March 2016. Training incentives where skills shortages are acute. Some areas of the economy are reporting major skills shortages, which potentially weigh on the UK’s productivity, ability to grow and competitiveness. Incentives could be targeted in construction, science and engineering. Encourage housebuilding. The country continues to face a major housing shortage. A £5bn homebuilding fund, aimed at small- and medium-sized developers, is one possibility. Encourage business investment. Hammond could announce, for example, a temporary increase in the amount firms can invest in plant and machinery tax-free, from £200,000 to £1m until the end of 2018. Changes to the personal allowance on income tax would be a headline-grabbing measure. The chancellor could accelerate plans to increase the threshold at which people start to pay income tax. The current timetable is to raise it to £12,500 by 2020. One option would be to increase the personal allowance to £11,500 immediately, rather than waiting until 2017-18. Raising the national insurance threshold from £8,060 to bring it closer in line with the personal allowance threshold of £11,000, would be another way to help lower income workers. It would cost the Treasury billions, however. An increase in taxes on employee benefits. This would be one way for the Treasury to raise money. The clampdown could include benefits such as gym membership, mobile phones and health checks in cases where workers swap pay for perks. Employers benefit from such arrangements because it lowers the amount they must pay in national insurance contributions, while employees benefit by reducing the amount of income tax they have to pay. New measures for savers. The amount that savers can put aside in an ISA before incurring tax could be raised – or the limit removed altogether."
2016-11-21T00:25:11Z,uk-news,UK news,"Royal Navy risks having 'pathetically low total' of ships, warn MPs","The Royal Navy will struggle to deal with the threats facing Britain unless the government steps up plans to modernise the country’s fleet, MPs have warned. According to the defence select committee, the UK already has a “woefully low” number of vessels available and uncertainty remains over plans to replace ageing frigates that are due to be decommissioned by 2035. The parliamentary committee’s chair, Julian Lewis, said the Ministry of Defence risked leaving the country with fewer than 19 frigates and destroyers, which he said “was already a pathetically low total”. The MPs said that dropping below that number even for a short time would be “completely unacceptable” and leave the UK vulnerable to threats from sources, including Russia and the Middle East, as well as unprepared to deal with conflicts in the South and East China Seas and to meet its Nato obligations. “The United Kingdom will then lack the maritime strength to deal with the threats we face right now, let alone in the future. We are putting the MoD on notice that it must not let this happen,” said Lewis, announcing the release of the committee’s report on Monday. In all, 13 frigates are due to leave the service at a rate of one a year between 2023 and 2035. And the MPs said they had “serious concerns” about the funding and timetable of the fleet that will replace them. They also attacked the MoD for the “extraordinary mistakes” in the design of Type 45 destroyers after it emerged they had faulty engines. The MPs accused the ministry and contractors of a “serious failing” for under-testing the system, which is unable to operate continuously in warm waters, and warned the problems had “potentially dangerous” consequences. “It is astonishing that the specification for the Type 45 did not include the requirement for the ships to operate at full capacity – and for sustained periods – in hot regions such as the Gulf,” the committee said. “The UK’s enduring presence in the Gulf should have made it a key requirement for the engines. The fact that it was not was an inexcusable failing and one which must not be repeated,” it added. “Failure to guarantee this would put the personnel and ships of the Royal Navy in danger.” Two new classes of frigate, the Type 26 global combat ship and the Type 31 general purpose frigate, are planned to modernise the fleet. “As an island nation, the importance of the Royal Navy to UK defence must not be underestimated,” the committee said. “Our starting point in this report is our conviction that the current number of frigates, destroyers and personnel inadequately reflects the potential threats and vulnerabilities facing the UK and its interests overseas.” Lewis added that the numbers of Royal Navy escort vessels have been “severely in decline” in recent decades. “The fleet is now way below the critical mass required for the many tasks which could confront it, if the international scene continues to deteriorate. What remains of our surface fleet now faces a prolonged period of uncertainty, as the frigate class is replaced in its entirety and all our destroyers undergo urgent, major remedial work on their unreliable engines.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are investing in a growing Royal Navy by building two aircraft carriers, the new Type 26 global combat ship, Dreadnought and Astute class submarines, and offshore patrols vessels. “We are also developing new class of lighter general purpose frigate so that by the 2030s we can grow the size of the fleet. This major programme of investment will ensure that the Royal Navy remains one of the world’s most modern and powerful navies, with a genuine global reach. “Type 45 Destroyers are hugely capable ships and have been deployed successfully on a range of operations worldwide. They continue to make an enormous contribution to the defence of the UK and our international partners. “We’re committed to improving the Type 45’s power and propulsion system through a series of machinery upgrades during planned maintenance, and this work is progressing well.”"

2016-11-21T12:10:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Public inquiry confirms the identities of more police spies,"The judge-led public inquiry examining the undercover infiltration of political groups has confirmed the identities of two more police spies in recent weeks. In brief announcements, the inquiry - headed by a senior judge, Lord Justice Pitchford - confirmed that the pair - who used the fake personas of “Carlo Neri” and “Marco Jacobs” - were undercover officers. Neri infiltrated anti-racist and left-wing groups between 2001 and 2005 (for background on him, see this, this and this). Jacobs spied on anarchists and social justice campaigners in Cardiff and Brighton between 2004 and 2009 (for further details on him, see this and this). It means that the number of undercover officers embedded in political groups whose identities have been officially confirmed has risen to five. This however is a fraction of the total number of undercover officers who have been sent to spy on political groups since 1968. That total has yet to be disclosed, but is estimated to be more than 100. For years, the police have fiercely resisted disclosing the identities of their undercover officers, in the face of pressure from individuals who were spied on.
The five undercover spies were only officially confirmed after they were unmasked following investigations by activists and journalists. For many involved in the public inquiry, the key question remains how open it will be - something that will be determined by Pitchford. It is too early to know what the answer to that question will be. Police have fought strenuously to try and ensure that large parts of the inquiry are held in private, and the names of their undercover officers kept under wraps (see this and this). Those who were spied on have argued for openness and have strongly criticised police for continuing to conceal the work and identities of the undercover officers (see this). More than 100 individuals who were subjected to the police surveillance have been calling for a list of the fake names of the undercover officers to be published. It was a call reiterated after Pitchford confirmed the identities of Neri and Jacobs, for example :
For those seeking an open inquiry, the announcements on Neri and Jacobs may be welcome, but the crucial test for the Pitchford inquiry is still whether he will permit the identification of all the other undercover officers. In this analysis, the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance, the alliance of those who were spied on, wondered if Pitchford’s announcements on Neri and Jacobs marked the end of the police’s stonewalling about the identities of the undercover officers. Meanwhile this commentary on the independent media website, Byline, argued that the police seem to have suffered a significant blow.
A woman has revealed how Neri proposed to her during a two-year relationship without telling her that he was an undercover officer. The woman, known only as “Andrea”, said: “I am of course relieved to have finally received official confirmation that the person I believed to be my partner of more than two years - Carlo Neri - was in reality an undercover police officer. The fact that it has taken the police so long to acknowledge this has undoubtedly caused additional stress and uncertainty within an already difficult situation for myself and my family.” Jacobs had two relationships with women while he was undercover. Jules Carey, the lawyer representing the two women and Tom Fowler, a former boyfriend of one of the women, said:
Two of the five undercover officers were confirmed in 2014 during the legal action brought by the women who were deceived into forming relationships with the police spies. They were Bob Lambert (for background on his deployment, see here and here) and Jim Boyling (for background on him, see here and here). Police have also confirmed Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated environmental groups. A sixth officer, Peter Francis, has blown the whistle on the operations of the undercover spies and in effect outed himself - the only one so far willing to do so. * If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here and here)."
2016-11-21T13:27:34Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jo Cox murder suspect collected far-right books, court hears","The man accused of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox stored books about German military history on a bookshelf topped with a gold-coloured Nazi eagle and swastika, the Old Bailey has heard. The neatly arranged books were discovered by police when they began searching the home of Thomas Mair shortly after Cox was shot and stabbed to death. The court heard on Monday that beneath the bookshelf in a bedroom in Mair’s home were drawers that contained books with Nazi and white supremacist themes. The jury was shown photographs of some of these volumes, which had titles such as SS Race Theory and Mate Selection Guidelines, The Politics of the Holocaust and March of the Titans: A History of the White Race.
Police also recovered from the house a newspaper cutting from the Daily Mail about Anders Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi who murdered 77 people in 2011; a printout of an article in the Guardian, written jointly by Cox and the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, calling for British military intervention in Syria; and a column that Cox had written for a local newspaper, the Batley News and Spenborough Guardian, in which she expressed support for the campaign to remain in the EU. Elsewhere around the semi-detached house, police found a draw-string bag containing stones bearing rune symbols, and a computer printout concerning the extreme rightwing South African organisation Die Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging.
The court heard that an examination of the computers that Mair used at his local library showed that he had been reading about the British National party; leading German Nazi figures; Dylann Roof, who has been charged with murdering nine people in a shooting attack at a church in Charleston; and individuals executed for treason. The court has previously heard that Mair had been using the computers to read about the Ku Klux Klan, matricide, and a page that offered answers to the question: “Is a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human’s head?” The prosecution alleges that the murder of Cox, 41, was politically or ideologically motivated. The jury was shown a series of photographs of the interior of Mair’s slightly sparse but very orderly home, including one of the inside of one of his kitchen cupboards, where he had lined up tins of baked beans, strawberries and evaporated milk, in regimented rows, their labels arranged to face precisely the same direction.
The court heard that Mair remained completely silent during three and a half hours of police interviews, the day after Cox was killed. “He didn’t answer any questions, and simply remained silent,” said DC Roger Williams, in a statement read to the jury. Cox was killed on 16 June in Birstall, West Yorkshire, a market town in her Batley and Spen constituency. She was on her way to a meeting with voters, and had been due to attend an event to raise support for the campaign to remain in the EU, a week ahead of the referendum.
She was shot twice in the head and once in the chest, and stabbed 15 times. Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, is charged with her murder and the grievous bodily harm of Bernard Carter-Kenny, a pensioner who was stabbed in the stomach after going to the MP’s aid. He is also charged with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, and possession of a dagger. The court has heard that the attack was captured on CCTV. He declined to enter pleas when he appeared at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing last month. As a result, not-guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. The case continues."
2016-11-21T14:10:42Z,uk-news,UK news,"Prevent strategy failing to rein in rise of UK's far right, says Diane Abbott","The government’s controversial counter-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, has failed to change the attitudes of those on the far right, the shadow home secretary has said in response to figures showing the number of referrals linked to neo-nazism is overtaking Islamic extremism cases in some parts of the UK. Diane Abbott said the figures reflected “the alarming rise of far-right activity across the country”. “It also reflects the increasing confidence of far-right groups to air their views publicly,” she said on Monday. “These figures are useful in proving what we already know, but the Prevent programme has failed to change the attitudes of those on the far right.”
Ben Wallace, the security minister and MP for Wyre and Preston North, has highlighted the increase in far-right radicalisation in England and Wales. Figures show that almost 300 under-18s were referred to officials under the Prevent strategy last year. Of these, at least 16 involved children under the age of 10. “The Prevent strategy is seeing a growth in far-right referrals,” Wallace told the House of Commons recently. “In some areas of the country, these Prevent referrals outnumber those about the other parts we are worried about.” Data released by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) under a freedom of information request from the Sunday Times shows that the number of far-right referrals in England and Wales has increased by 74%, from 323 cases in 2014-15 to 561 in 2015-16. About 292 cases, or 52%, involved under-18s. “The Prevent strategy is misconceived because it limits legitimate safe spaces for discourse, places like classrooms and lecture theatres,” Abbott said. “We urgently need an anti-extremism strategy that addresses the subversive and veiled far-right activity that is allowed to fester in private.” The NPCC figures come as Merseyside police investigate the appearance of stickers around Liverpool declaring that people were entering “Nazi-controlled zones”. The stickers, posted by a neo-Nazi youth movement called National Action, were timed to coincide with Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday.
“It’s the politics of hate. We’re seeing the rise of this sort of thing across the country, across the western world and it’s of huge importance that we all stand united against it and make sure there is no place for this sort of thing in Liverpool or anywhere,” Patrick Hurley, a Mossley Hill councillor said. Britain’s Muslim communities have criticised the Prevent strategy as a toxic brand and a “big brother” security operation, but it was recently revealed that the programme is to be toughened up rather than scaled back as part of the government’s wider reworking of its counter-terrorism strategy. The chief constable of Leicestershire police, Simon Cole, who is in charge of Prevent, said earlier this year that far-right extremists made up half of all cases in Yorkshire and 30% of the caseload in the east Midlands.
Nationwide, however, Islamic extremism is still the most common referral, with 2,810 cases making up 70% of those flagged up under Prevent. The NPCC said it was worth noting that the Prevent duty, which sets out the obligations of public-facing bodies under the strategy, was introduced in July 2015 and has resulted in a significant increase in referrals of all types. Ibrahim Mohamoud, a spokesman for Cage, an independent advocacy organisation, said on Monday: “What these figures suggest is that Muslims are still far more likely to be referred to Prevent in England and Wales. “There still seems to be a great deal of dissonance between the way the authorities understand the role of ‘extremist ideology’ or ‘radical fundamentalist thought’ in the case of Muslims, and the subscription to far-right ideology.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, has said the fallout from the 23 June vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election should serve as a warning about the dangers of whipping up hatred and prejudice in political campaigns, as MPs prepare to examine a spike in hate crime in the UK. Police recorded 41% more hate crimes in July 2016 than in the same month the previous year, with a peak on 1 July, records show. Several high-profile attacks occurred in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, including the vandalising of the Polish community centre in Hammersmith, west London, and the death of Arkadiusz Jóźwik, a Pole who was attacked in Harlow, Essex. Rashad Ali, a senior fellow specialising in extremism at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, told the Times that in some areas of Wales, the proportion of Prevent referrals from the far right were “well over” 50%. Ali said the rise in far-right extremism could be linked to the “loss of the centre ground” in today’s politics. “Whether it’s on the left or the right, the fringes are now leading the debate and the discussion,” he said.
Ali argued that Trump’s election, with the endorsement of the KKK, and the rhetoric of Marine Le Pen, the Front National presidential candidate in France, were helping to “legitimise the world view” of fascists. National Action is believed to have fewer than 100 members, but the group has a strong presence on social media, where it has celebrated Trump’s election with images of him captioned “white power”. Matthew Feldman, the co-director of the centre for fascist, anti-fascist and post-fascist studies at Teesside University, said the radical right was “starting to mainstream its narrative following the decline of the BNP as the main party-political vehicle for radical right ideas”. “This led to a proliferation of other groups like the Defence Leagues and Britain First – both of which are much more anti-Muslim than the more developed neo-fascist policies advocated by the BNP, including antisemitism and biological racism,” Feldman said. “So it is a time of change for the far and radical right in the UK, although like the US, 2016 has been a very different year than most. The Brexit vote, like that of Trump’s election, seems to have sparked, at least for some, a kind of ‘celebratory racism’ whereby some hate incidents are apparently legitimated by the ‘trigger’ event of an enormous and unexpected victory.” Feldman added, however, that the immediate context can obscure longer term developments, which may be driving the increasing far-right Channel referrals and Prevent cases over recent months and years. “Over the last decade, governmental and media focus has been overwhelmingly concentrated upon the threat from jihadi Islamist extremism and terrorism,” he said. “Given finite resources and time, this has necessarily meant that less attention has been trained upon the radical right, which has increasingly turned to the lowest common denominator of anti-Muslim bigotry since 7/7. “In this, as the BNP had already recognised in 2005, turning away from racial to religious hatred was a potential issue that could break into the mainstream. Unlike in the past, the lowest common denominator of Islamoprejudice has allowed a number of different types of radical right groups, such as the counter-jihad movement, which are street-based and party political, to work together locally in places like Dover, Swansea and Newcastle. “The increase in far-right referrals therefore comes as little surprise to those monitoring the radical right during these years of upheaval, both for radical right groups and domestic politics in Britain.”"
2016-11-21T15:48:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"Loans boss paid hackers to attack consumer website, court told","The boss of a payday loans company hired computer hackers to try to sabotage a consumer rights website after it had carried customers’ complaints about his business. James Frazer-Mann, 35, was tracked down by the FBI after he paid American hackers to launch an attack on the Consumer Action Group (CAG) website. Cardiff crown court heard Frazer-Mann, the owner of Elite Loans, also paid hackers to target websites of rival payday loan companies. Frazer-Mann, of Barry, South Wales, was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work and told to pay £530 in costs after admitting five charges of commissioning hacks. The court was told that Frazer-Mann contacted hackers after being criticised on the CAG website, a UK forum for the discussion of consumer rights. One comment relating to Frazer-Mann’s firm read: “These companies are preying on people already in a vulnerable position and making life harder, they should be shut down!!!” Frazer-Mann tracked down hackers on an online forum about hacking and paid one to try to take the website down, though it did not work. He also paid £2,000 to hackers to mount cyber-attacks against the websites of competitors. They used a tactic called distributed denial of service, which typically involves flooding the target with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload their systems. James Davies, for the prosecution, said: “The effects of such attacks are significant as the companies are so reliant on their websites to generate business.” The court was told Frazer-Mann used the Liberty Reserve payment system, based in Costa Rica, which allowed users to transfer money by giving a name, date of birth and email address. It was shut down by the US government in May 2013 amid fears it was being used by criminals. During its investigation into the system, the FBI came across Frazer-Mann’s dealings with hackers and contacted officers in the UK. The businessman’s home was raided and his computer equipment seized. Davies said: “He claims his company had initially been targeted by other companies. It’s an area of business which is highly competitive and some use unethical practices. He said he lost £1,000 a day when his website was targeted.” Ben Douglas-Jones, for the defence, told the court the consumer site had detailed the married businessman’s personal information, and encouraged users to contact him. Douglas-Jones added: “There’s a low risk of him committing further offences of this nature. He’s now working as a carpet cleaner.” The court heard Elite Loans has since stopped operating. The recorder of Cardiff, Judge Eleri Rees, told the businessman: “Over a period of two years you resorted through revenge to try and disrupt websites. You were prepared to spend quite considerable amounts of money to achieve this end.” After the hearing, CAG’s founder, Marc Gander, said: “This shows the lengths these payday loans companies will go to in a bid to silence their critics. He was upset and contacted a hacker in the US. But it was a very stupid thing to do and it failed to work.” Gander said his free website had 350,000 members who share consumer advice."

Theresa May’s government is being urged by the political leaders of Leeds,Manchester, Newcastle and Liverpool – who describe themselves as a “council of the north” – to urgently prioritise the east-west rail links between the major northern cities to boost the future of the region. We spoke to people who left the north of England to work in the south about their experiences. ‘I am starting to get frustrated at the overcrowding’ Louise, 27, associate in fund management Moved to Kennington, south London, from Cumbria I moved due to a lack of job opportunities – other than Edinburgh, there wasn’t really anywhere else I could work outside of London. Cumbria offers cheaper housing and a better standard of living. In London, I feel that my generation are infantilised compared with my northern friends who drive to work, own their own homes and dogs, and have actual hobbies. I see my London friends stumbling out of bars on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday night, queueing up for brunch the next day, going for a walk around a park, and finishing the day off with an £18 roast in a pub that normally runs out of beef and lamb by 6pm as everyone is doing the same thing, so they end up with a nut roast. They sleep off the malbec, then it’s Monday morning and it all starts again, with a squeeze on to the Northern line and an overcrowded gym class in the evening. But I don’t regret the move. I have been able to gain a lot of experience working in London, and enjoy all that London has to offer in the way of arts, music and most importantly food. However, after five years I am starting to get frustrated at the overcrowding. In the Lakes you can get truly lost, enjoy the peace and scenery, and realise that there is more to life than working, drinking and spending.
‘London is full of vibrancy and ideas’ Rose, 32, journalist Moved to London from Sheffield I had a staff job in Sheffield, but I was offered work in London and, while I’d always resisted the idea of living in the “Big Smoke”, I feel as if there is more opportunity here. I also got frustrated with the lack of investment in Sheffield city centre, and the rows that continue over plans for new buildings. Local people fight to preserve old buildings that are rundown but seen to be historic. This is to the detriment of development. Transport is really bad, too – trains to Manchester and York are slow and expensive.
I love Yorkshire and the north, and my family are there. However, I think people get set in their jobs and ways, so workplaces stagnate. I think there is so much more to do in London, and it is full of vibrancy and ideas. In the north, councils are bogged down with petty domestic arguments. People are too inward-looking, and bitter that the south attracts more investment – without doing anything to entice people to stay. I also think meeting a partner will be easier in London, as there is just a greater volume of people to choose from! I have no regrets about moving and wish I’d done it a lot sooner, although I’m glad I saved money and established a career before I came. ‘I wouldn’t change it for anything’ Name withheld, 44, transport worker Moved from Manchester to London I was made redundant from my job in Manchester, and spent a year and a half trying to find something in a similar field, but there was nothing. Eventually, opportunities started to appear but only in London, so I decided to take one. Initially, the move was a disaster, and within weeks I wanted to go back. I found myself completely unsuited to the job, suffered from depression and was bullied out of the job. I was eventually diagnosed with social anxiety, something I had suffered with since I was a teenager. I am now incredibly grateful for the experience as I have grown immeasurably, but I would never have expected things to work out this way. Now, I am settled in my life in London. I have a good job and a great group of friends. People come to me for advice on how to give presentations, whereas before I would stutter and stumble my way through them. Now, I can’t see myself leaving London. Once, I would have said the same about Manchester, but the truth is I was stagnating there. The pace of life is faster here, money doesn’t go as far and it’s very crowded, but there is so much more scope to do things in the city. I wouldn’t change it for anything now. ‘I would have preferred to stay put’ Rys Sommefeldt, 36, senior engineering manager Moved to Abbots Langley from Sheffield The only opportunity for work in the field that I love is in the south, either near London or in Cambridge. I would have preferred to stay put if the same opportunities were available in the north, as I was otherwise very happy in Sheffield. But I don’t regret making the move. I’m pursuing the career that I’ve always wanted and the opportunity that the south affords is much greater than the north. I don’t feel that the industry in which I work – hardware 3D graphics – is particularly special in this regard. There are many industries where the opportunity and reward is significantly higher in this part of the country. Technical industries, in particular, naturally gravitate here, and as a result I’m not surprised to learn of the impact, especially where it concerns skilled graduates. ‘It really was sink or swim’ James Adair, 26, film director Moved to London from Northumberland via Leeds I joined a small film production startup with two friends after graduating in Leeds. We worked successfully in sports and corporate films for a few years, but the budgets were often tight and we lived hand to mouth. Another issue was the creative opportunities within the type of work we were offered; they felt very safe. We were then signed to one of London’s biggest film production companies, and became “directors” overnight. But we started to realise clients were getting turned off by the geographical distance of Leeds and the fact that we couldn’t be in a meeting at the drop of a hat, so we discussed moving to London. For me, I think the main point of contention was the surprise that, in 2014, with our hyperconnected society, London remained the beating heart of all things film-related. I moved to the capital with £1,500 in my bank account, no projected work and a three-year contract on a rented flat. It really was sink or swim. I don’t subscribe to the rhetoric that Manchester is the “London of the north” for moving image. Beyond TV, it remains as irrelevant as everywhere else, unfortunately – and for us, that was no good. But I do regret giving up on the north. It bothers me that I drew from the state in the north, to then support the London economy. London, however, has completely changed our lives for the better, so it’s hard to remain bitter. We’re so grateful for how our careers have panned out after moving south.

2016-11-21T18:43:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Milo Yiannopoulos talk at Kent school cancelled over security concerns,"A Kent school has cancelled a talk by Milo Yiannopoulos, a former pupil, outspoken Donald Trump supporter and member of the so-called alt-right movement. It also said the Department for Education’s counter-extremism unit had been in contact with it. Simon Langton grammar school for boys, which Yiannopoulos attended, said it had pulled his address to sixth-formers due to take place on Tuesday. Yiannopoulos, 32, is a senior editor at the US-based Breitbart website, whose chief executive, Steven Bannon, is Trump’s controversial choice for chief strategist. The Canterbury school said the talk had been cancelled because of safety concerns, with almost all of the opposition to it coming from outside the school. “The decision was taken following contact from the DfE counter-extremism unit, the threat of demonstrations at the school by organised groups and members of the public, and our overall concerns for the security of the school site and the safety of our community,” a spokesman told the Press Association. “We note that, within 24 hours of advertising the event, 220 Langton sixth-formers had, with parental consent, signed up for the event and that objection to our hosting Mr Yiannopoulos came almost entirely from people with no direct connection to the Langton. The staff and students of the school were overwhelmingly in favour. “While disappointed that both the pastoral care and intellectual preparation we offer to our students has been called into question, we at the Langton remain committed to the principle of free speech and open debate and will resist, where possible, all forms of censorship.” Yiannopoulos, who was permanently suspended from Twitter in July, describes himself as “the most fabulous supervillain on the internet” on his Facebook page, where he posted on Monday: “My old high school has been bullied into cancelling my talk on Tuesday by the “counter-extremism” unit at the UK Department of Education. “Who even knew the DoE had a counter-extremism unit? And that it wasn’t set up to combat terrorism but rather to punish gays with the wrong opinions? “Perhaps if I’d called my talk ‘Muslims are awesome!’ the National Union of Teachers [NUT] and Department of Education would have been cool with me speaking.” A DfE spokesperson said: “When concerns are raised by members of the public following media coverage in advance of an event, the department would contact the school as a matter of routine to check they had considered any potential issues. The decision to cancel the event was a matter for the school.”"
2016-11-21T18:45:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Angus: floods hit south-west England – with more rain to come,"Thousands of householders, business people and travellers suffered disruption after almost a month’s worth of rain fell within hours, raising fresh concerns that not enough was being spent on flood defences and prevention measures. Homes and businesses were flooded across a swath of south-west England, schools were shut, dozens of roads closed and major rail lines blocked. By Monday evening rail travellers were being told not to try to travel to the West Country. Conservative and Labour politicians questioned whether enough was being done to make sure infrastructure in the region was robust enough when extreme weather struck. Among those forced to evacuate was the Devon and Cornwall police commissioner, Alison Hernandez, whose office in Exeter was flooded.
Though the worst of the deluge is thought to be over, more flooding was expected on Tuesday as rain that had fallen on high ground fed through rivers and streams on to lower, saturated ground. The Met Office said the wettest place in the UK on Monday was Dunkeswell aerodrome in east Devon, where 50mm of rain fell in 24 hours. In the 48 hours up to 3pm on Monday, a total of 96mm fell on Exeter airport. Only 136mm falls on Devon in the whole of a typical November. Coming hard on the heels of Storm Angus, which swept across the UK at the weekend, rivers struggled to cope with the latest deluge. As darkness fell on Monday evening there were 45 flood warnings – meaning flooding is expected, with immediate action required – in place, mainly in Devon, Somerset and Dorset. There were another 146 alerts (flooding is possible, be prepared) across England and Wales.
Devon and Cornwall police attended more than 60 road collisions during the day on Monday. Train lines were blocked between Swindon in Wiltshire and Bristol and Exeter while Bristol Temple Meads station was briefly closed because of flooding. The rail operator GWR said its services were affected by flooding at seven sites and asked passengers not to even try to travel to Devon or Cornwall. The Labour MP for Exeter, Ben Bradshaw, said: “Once again the south-west has been severely affected by heavy rain. Our infrastructure has been shown to be unequal to the task of keeping things moving and functioning on what are becoming much more regular weather events. “There have been lots of grandiose promises in recent years – following previous severe flooding and the rail line dropping into the sea in Dawlish – of investment to tackle this. Very few if any of these promises have so far come to fruition.” Stuart Hughes, Devon county council cabinet member for highway management and flood prevention, said major schemes were being undertaken – including on the river Exe near Exeter and in the north Devon village of Braunton, where there was flooding at the weekend.
But he said he hoped the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, would invest more in flood defences. “The problem is that over the last few years we have been hit by austerity cuts,” he said. “We are really stretched.” The government has been accused of failing to deliver on promises to fund natural flood management schemes, such as planting trees. A freedom of information request by Friends of the Earth to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed there was no funding earmarked for natural flood management, despite ministers saying they would fund such measures. Natural flood management schemes aim to slow the movement of water downstream to prevent flooding. This can involve creating water storage such as ponds, planting trees along water courses and restoring rivers to their original meandering path. Hughes said Devon had been talking to farmers about how they could help and was encouraging them to grow less maize – which makes the soil compact and causes water to run off more quickly – and to plant trees. Among the structures damaged over the weekend was the ancient clapper bridge Tarr Steps on Exmoor. The middle of the bridge, made up of stones weighing up to two tonnes, was washed away.
More than a dozen schools in Devon were closed. The headteacher of Otterton primary in the east of the county, Carron Saunders, said she felt she had to close the school when it was in danger of being cut off. “Only one road is open,” she said. “The other routes in are cut off.” The flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday included the river Mole, and North Molton and South Molton in Devon. Staff were clearing up at the Mill on the Mole residential park on Monday. Manager Stephen Antram said eight people were evacuated over the weekend but all were back at home on Monday. “It was quite a mess,” he said. “We had debris and mud and rubbish all over the place to sort out. The community has been brilliant. People came down to see if they could help.”
Owner Mike Vowles said he had been to meetings where officials had discussed ways of trying to do work further upstream to try to stop the river Mole flooding. “We last flooded in 2012. There was lot of talk about what to do but I think it was mostly just talk rather than action,” said Vowles. “But the Environment Agency does have a problem. These seem to be very localised events. It’s us today but it could be somewhere else next week and they haven’t got money to sort out every river, every stream in the country. I understand that.” It was not only Devon that was affected. Residents in Bristol were shocked as flood water trapped cars in Whitchurch Lane. Office supply manager Lee Gitsham, 43, said: “Parked cars were submerged in water. There were two drivers who tried to get through but got stuck. It was at wing mirror level so it must have been about 2ft-3ft of water.
“I have lived in that area for nearly 10 years. I have never seen it as bad as that. We have had a bit of flooding where the water has covered the pavement but never where it covered car bonnets.” The Environment Agency and Met Office said the flooding risk could continue into Tuesday but by Wednesday drier weather was expected."
2016-11-21T18:48:24Z,uk-news,UK news,The great northern brain drain: 'I daydream about moving back',"Promises of a “northern powerhouse” have been challenged by figures that show a decade-long north-south brain drain, with up to 310,000 graduates leaving the north to move to southern cities, despite the fact that nobody can afford to rent a box room in the south, and pints are 27 times more expensive. According to Lord O’Neill, former Tory treasury minister and one-time chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the only cities in the UK attracting graduates are London and Bristol. He is campaigning for more business initiatives and greater investment in east-west rail links between Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. The northerner who left – Rebecca Nicholson Just over a decade ago, I slid down the drain myself, moving from the motherland (north Lincolnshire – it’s the north, and I’ll fight you about it) to London for work. My family live there, so I go back often. I used to call it going home. But recently, after visiting, I asked my sister for a lift to the station so I could “catch the train home”, which was a jolt. In that moment London and I finally made it official. It was a surprise as it was only ever supposed to be a temporary fling. Somehow I haven’t quite managed to ever call it off.
London is so vast and varied that any experience of it is unlikely to be universal. Some of it reeks of wealth and privilege, some of it is trapped in cycles of poverty that should put the rest of the city to shame; these two sides may brush postcode borders, but rarely meet. My own London’s grip has loosened and tightened over the years, but it keeps a hold on me. I have loved it and loathed it, sometimes on the same day. I moved there two weeks after I graduated to do an internship at a long-dead magazine. I was broke but people saved their train tickets for me to claim back as “expenses” and I stayed on friends’ sofas. I had the best summer of my life. That summer extended into years. All the parties and nightclubs and gigs I had read about in those magazines, the bright and brash nights that had seemed like untouchable fantasies in my hometown, were real.
Now that I’m a bit too old to go out much without days of suffering what can only be called an aftermath, it seems strange to look back and think that, apart from work, nightlife was the main draw, but when you’re gay, the lure of a city is strong: you go to find your tribe. In fact, if you are different in any way, the city can be welcoming like that. Most of those clubs in which we danced away our 20s have been torn down and replaced with Foxtons flats and chain restaurants. Younger generations have found their own fun, but what keeps me here is different now: my friends, my friends’ babies, having a local, the fact that, after many years of not talking to whoever lived next door, I now know many of my neighbours. People can talk about London as lonely and isolated, and I know that this side of it exists, but what has made it a keeper for me at this point is finding a raggedy impersonation of a community. I am, however, clear-eyed and non-native enough to know that it’s a disgrace that so much is concentrated here: no wonder the country has no idea what its own face looks like when the majority of its politics and media are fixed in one place. London is not Britain; it’s a version of it buoyed by money. Calls for its independence in the aftermath of Brexit, while perhaps not entirely sincere, show the arrogance of this disconnect. And yet, in electing a Muslim mayor while much of the world shifts so far to the right that a “register” of Muslims become a possibility, I feel enormous pride in my city. It’s complicated. I daydream about moving back to the north all the time, and have done for years. I look at property websites and can scarcely allow myself to imagine living anywhere with more than one bedroom. The word “garden” takes my breath away. Yet here I am, still not quite managing to go, starting to call London home. The northerner who came back – Helen Pidd When I left home in coastal Lancashire in 1999, I had no intention of ever returning. The north of England held little interest for me. I preferred the accent, but that was about it. I was blasé about the nightly sunsets over Morecambe bay, the Cumbrian fells in silhouette, and hated the fact we lived so near the Lake District that my parents made us go walking there most Sundays.
I knew I would live in London one day, and I did, on and off, from 2004 until 2013. I thought about staying on in Edinburgh after university, but I was offered a job when I graduated and so down I went. I never even considered stopping halfway. All the national media was in London; it was where the bands I liked played; where you could get fed after 8pm somewhere other than a chippy; and it was a good few degrees warmer, too. It was in London that I started to identify as a northerner. I would bang on about how much nicer people were where I came from, how much cheaper everything was, while quietly despairing on every trip home that Lancaster, my nearest city, didn’t even have an H&M or a Wagamama. Trends took a year to reach Lancashire; when one of my oldest friends described my outfit as “very London” I was chuffed to bits, even though I knew she meant it as a diss. Equally, I quite liked the assumption from ignorant southerners that I was working class because I said bath instead of baaarth.
Then I got really into riding my bike. I had always cycled to work at the Guardian – I still do not understand how anyone stays sane when commuting by tube – yet as I approached 30, I started to miss open space. I rode to Brighton and resented the first few hours battling through London traffic. I started to fantasise about an existence where I could reach the hills on warm summer nights, passing hedgerows rather than stinking bins. The brat who spoiled every family Lakeland walk between 1990 and 1994, who dreamed of 24-hour bagel bakeries and who had memorised the Monopoly board, was craving the life she had been so determined to leave behind.
And then the Guardian’s north of England editor job came up. I wouldn’t have gone for it had the BBC not just opened Media City in Salford. It was a sign that you could operate at national level without being crammed into a grotty flatshare in Zone 3 – and recognition that there was life outside our overcrowded capital.
Now I live in Manchester, in a redbrick three-bedroom terraced house that cost less than a one-bed studio in a crappy bit of outer London. Not everything is cheaper: the other day I bought a pot of tea in the Refuge, Manchester’s trendiest new bar, and was aghast to be charged more than four pounds. A pint is approaching a fiver in many places in the city’s Northern Quarter nightlife district. Rents are going up, the pay is still way below London salaries, and most of the best graduate jobs are in the south-east. Despite rapid improvement, the restaurant scene isn’t a patch on the capital’s, either. But it’s only two and a quarter hours to London on the train if I want a fancy feed: I remember days when I would spend almost that long trying to visit a friend in south-west London from my flat in the north-east. Attitudes are just as liberal as in the capital: our Lord Mayor is a former Mr Gay UK and when a young gay couple got beaten up on the tram for singing show tunes, police helped the Lesbian and Gay Chorus stage an onboard musical singalong. I spent this weekend in the very same snow-capped peaks I used to scowl at while plotting my escape to the big city as I waited for the bus on Morecambe prom. My mum and dad can’t believe I came back voluntarily. I wonder what took me so long."
2016-11-21T19:56:03Z,uk-news,UK news,York to reopen Vikings of Jorvik attraction 16 months after floods,"It’s almost a year since Sarah Maltby, sat comfortably at home on her sofa in the sleepy days after Christmas, got a phone call to warn her that the Vikings of Jorvik were up to their waists in water. “The first I knew of it was a call from the staff on duty saying the centre was open, there were visitors inside, but water was starting to pour in and what should they do,” the director of attractions for York Archaeological Trust said. “There was only one answer. Get the visitors out and close immediately.” Jorvik, the unique visitor attraction under the streets of York and built on an archaeology site that revealed the real everyday lives of its Viking residents, has been closed ever since. It has only just announced a reopening date in April 2017. Most of York has almost forgotten the devastating floods of December 2015. Much of the city, including the area around the minster, was on higher ground, and bars and shops stayed open. Closer to the river, people were being rescued by boat from first floor windows. For those directly affected the impact was shattering and long lasting. Some of the staff at Jorvik and the Archaeological Trust are only just getting back into their homes. Jorvik lost the income from the 400,000 visitors who come from all over the world each year, adding up to 18 million over the 32 years since it opened. No one was hurt, and thanks to staff on their Christmas break wading back through the floodwaters to help, every original artefact from the 1976 excavation in Coppergate which uncovered the buried world was rescued - including the many shoes and the single sock, some of the best preserved knives from anywhere in the Viking world, combs and jewellery, carpenter’s tools and the only Viking panpipes ever found, the famous helmet - Anglo Saxon and already an antique when the Vikings came - and a silver dirham coin from Samarkand.
By the time all the objects were laid out in the offices upstairs, the electricity had failed and the reconstructed Viking streets and houses, water lapping through their windows and doors, were in pitch darkness. The mobile phone signal disintegrated. Hundreds of miles away, back in his parents’ house, marketing officer Paul Whiting set about rebuilding the crashed website to announce the disaster. A handful of the human and animal figures valued at up to £40,000 each survived, including a raven sitting on a fence, and a glum-faced man whose eyes now seem to catch viewers accusingly. “He is quite unnerving if you’re down here at night,” David Jennings, the chief executive of the trust, said. Maltby said there was never any question about whether to rebuild. They were covered by insurance, and they could use the staff and the material which had been saved to mount touring exhibitions and installations at other sites in the city, including the neighbouring church, the museum and the minster, and a special display when the Theatre Royal reopened after a major rebuild. The most radical decision was to rebuild a renewed and expanded version of essentially the same attraction which opened in 1984, where visitors sit in mechanical cars and are carried through the recreated streets peopled with models built with obsessive attention to detail. The formula was widely copied in the 1980s and 90s, but most of the imitators, including The Tales of Robin Hood in Nottingham and The Oxford Story - where visitors rode on wooden desks - have now closed. “We still had the ride itself, which survived in remarkably good shape because the mechanism was hung from the ceiling,” Maltby said. “And people really loved it. We now have visitors who came when we opened and have since brought their children and grandchildren, and I think they’d be desperately disappointed if we got rid of it.” This time, at a cost of around £5m, slightly more than half covered by insurance, the story will be a little darker and more nuanced. There will be a death bed scene, a slaughter house and among the people discussing the latest goods landed on the wharf, a slave trader. The visitors who arrive each day from all over the world to discover that Jorvik is closed will now find prominent notices promising that the Vikings will be back on 8 April, complete with crowing cocks and crying babies, smells of woodsmoke and stew pots, rotting fish and dung heaps."
2016-11-22T00:13:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Millions affected by universal credit cuts to be partly compensated by chancellor,"Millions of people affected by planned cuts to universal credit are expected to be partly compensated as the chancellor attempts to fulfil Theresa May’s pledge to support families who are “just about managing”. The prime minister and Philip Hammond have been heavily lobbied by Conservative backbenchers, including the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, to row back on £3bn worth of cuts to in-work benefits. At least 20 backbenchers have written to May urging her to reconsider the plans, claiming the cuts will hit the so-called Jams, and saying that Wednesday’s financial statement is an opportunity for the government to “put words into actions”. The Guardian understands that Downing Street is sympathetic to the calls, and while it will not reverse the cuts that have already been voted through parliament, it is looking at other ways to ease the burden on the same group of families. One senior minister has told colleagues that the government is likely to take action on another aspect of universal credit – the so-called taper rate. That determines how quickly people lose their benefits as they increase their hours at work. The Treasury has been under pressure to take action, particularly as the move would boost the incentive for people progressing in the workplace, but Hammond has been mindful of the economic circumstances. At the weekend he said it was important that he “make[s] sure that the economy is watertight”. It comes as the government announced plans to U-turn on the controversial “pay to stay” policy, under which families earning over £31,000 a year, or £40,000 in London, would pay higher rents for their council homes. The housing minister Gavin Barwell said the decision, which was welcomed by Labour and the Local Government Association, would help “working class families struggling to get by”. The autumn statement will also see a £1bn cash injection into full-fibre broadband across the UK, and investment into a wave of 5G trials, as part of an effort to boost high-tech investment. That will come alongside more money for transport.
But Duncan Smith, who quit as work and pensions secretary in anger at the scale of cuts in his department, made a final plea to the prime minister to make action on universal credit a priority. The controversy has been brewing ever since George Osborne was forced to retreat on cuts to tax credits in 2015 after a major rebellion in the Commons and Lords. However, the savings were still planned for universal credit, the government’s flagship welfare reform that is being rolled out. Duncan Smith said that if May wanted to help people “just managing” then she had to look at this group. Ministers have two options: reverse the original cuts, which were to the amount people earn before losing any benefits, known as the “work allowance”; or reduce the 65% rate at which universal credit is withdrawn as people earn higher amounts. “The work allowance is about people crossing into work, the taper is about people progressing through work. They are two sides of the same coin,” said Duncan Smith. “My preference is the allowance as that is where we took the money out, but one way or another I want them to put the money back.” He said that was the most effective way to help the Jams that May has said she wants to target. Lady Stroud, a former adviser to Duncan Smith and key architect of the government’s universal credit plans, agreed that the government had to act in this area to reach its target group. “If the budget is to support those who are just about managing, the best way of getting money to them is through universal credit. That would perfectly target those earning between £18,000 to £34,000. There are two options – you can put money into the work allowances or taper rate – both would be effective at getting money to the just about managing group,” she said. She has also suggested a £50m injection to boost the childcare element of universal credit to cover families who have three or more children. Others have been lobbying Downing Street, including Tory MP Heidi Allen, who was among those writing to May and stressing that taking action would “demonstrate to the country just how serious its focus on supporting the just managing is”. Hammond is expected to use his first major outing at the dispatch box to lay down a new, more traditional role for the Treasury, setting the broad direction of spending and leaving his cabinet colleagues to get on with making day-to-day decisions. Whitehall insiders said, unlike Osborne or Labour’s Gordon Brown, Hammond will not deliver a list of pet projects on Wednesday, but will instead allocate “strategic” spending priorities, in a deliberately hands-off approach, informed by his experience running other departments. The speech is expected to be markedly shorter than in recent years, and Hammond’s allies have played down hopes that he will pull a political rabbit out of the hat. Instead, the chancellor hopes to switch the focus on to the long-term challenges for the economy, as Britain leaves the EU. An ICM/Guardian poll suggested May was seen as far more economically competent than her Labour counterpart. Asked who was best placed to manage the economy properly, 48% said the Tory prime minister and her chancellor, Hammond, while only 15% said Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. ICM’s director, Martin Boon, said the Tory 33-point lead on this measure was even larger than it was when Ed Miliband and Ed Balls hit their low point on economic competence and found themselves 27 points behind David Cameron and Osborne. The prime minister also had a +22% approval rating compared to Corbyn’s -34%, although Hammond was also negative at -1%. However, in an interview with the Guardian, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he believed the autumn statement would be “crushingly disappointing”, and Hammond would fail to take the opportunity to ditch austerity, “once and for all”. “We were hoping he might just admit that austerity hasn’t worked, and announce a major investment programme,” he said. Instead, he said, the government were in disarray over Brexit, and recent signals from Hammond suggested any new spending plans would be modest at best. Labour has said it would seek to boost investment by £500bn over a decade, to kickstart economic growth. Citizens Advice has highlighted issues such as council tax debt, credit cards and unsecured loans, in-work benefits, energy bills and the private rented sectors as posing particular challenges for the 700,000 people it helps every year. It finds that most families have multiple issues to contend with. Gillian Guy, chief executive of the charity, said the government should simply reverse the universal credit cuts announced by Osborne. “The cut to the universal credit work allowance announced in the summer 2015 budget means some groups – such as lone working parents – will be around £100 a month worse off when they move on to the new benefit,” she said. “The most effective way to make sure these people aren’t disproportionately affected and are able to get the most from their income is to reverse these work allowance cuts.” Deven Ghelani, another key figure in the drawing up of universal credit and director of Policy in Practice, added: “Re-investing in work incentives within universal credit is the best way to help just about managing families. “£3bn would make universal credit broadly as generous as the tax credit system is today – essential for a government that wants to make work pay. “Investing in the work allowance puts more money in the pockets of lower earning households, while a lower withdrawal rate may help the prospects of those looking to progress in work.”"
2016-11-22T07:00:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Tesco store in Edinburgh accused of discriminating against state school pupils,"A Tesco store in Edinburgh has been accused of discriminating against state school children by making them queue outside while private school pupils are allowed to come and go as they please. It has been claimed that students from Boroughmuir high school, near the city centre, were made to stand behind a barrier by Tesco staff and only allowed to enter their local store in small groups. But students at the nearby George Watson’s college were not stopped at all. The issue was raised by a parent of one child at the state school, who said it was a “form of discrimination”. Neil Pollock, a professor of innovation and social informatics at Edinburgh university, said: “Everybody should queue or nobody should queue.” He told the Guardian: “My son is at Boroughmuir. He has to stand in the queue each day. He’s not one to complain but it was getting him down - so we decided to do something. He and his friends are frustrated because they have to wait outside whilst others go ahead of them. Tesco also ‘police’ the door in that they have a person there making sure they queue.” Pollock said the pupils were “pretty angry” about the situation, saying his son and his friends were “really pleased that some one is finally taking it up for them. They don’t want to get into trouble, or to present their school in a bad light but they just think it is unfair.” He said his son, who he asked not to be named, once tried to walk in behind a group of students from George Watson’s college. “The staff member sent him – but not the Watson’s boys – out of the shop.” Pollock posted his complaint on Twitter last week and a Tesco representative responded with a series of tweets, telling him: “I’ve called the store and spoke to the duty manager, John... He said the private school normally have a lesser amount of children which is quicker and easier for the store.” After Pollock indicated he was not happy with that explanation, a Tesco representative tweeted: “I agree we cannot have different rules.”
Three former pupils at Boroughmuir subsequently told the Guardian they had been made to queue outside the store, a Tesco Metro in the Bruntsfield area of the city, while they saw students from the private school allowed to enter. Each of them separately described Boroughmuir students in school uniform being told to stand behind a barrier by Tesco staff, while children in George Watson’s college uniform were allowed to enter the shop unchallenged. One former pupil, who asked not to be named, said: “My friend goes [to George Watson’s college] and, when I spoke to him about it, he said he remembers feeling so bizarre just walking in. Didn’t know whether to join the queue or not but the security said no you just go straight in.” Craig Bannon said: “I found it very unfair. I felt like it was an unfair prejudice which did not seem justified.” Another former Boroughmuir pupil, who asked not to be named, said: “Lunch is when it’s most crowded, I would walk to Tesco and once I arrive the security would be standing outside … then they would let around three school kids in at a time.” Despite initially appearing to acknowledge on Twitter that the practice existed, Tesco later denied the claims. A spokesman said: “This is completely untrue – there has never been any discrimination between state and private school children at this store.”"
2016-11-22T08:46:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Further floods threaten travel chaos across Britain,"Torrential rain has caused flash flooding and blocked roads and rain lines in swaths of the UK, causing widespread travel disruption and raising fears for a missing pensioner. The Environment Agency had 65 flood warnings in place, meaning that flooding is expected and residents should take immediate action. While most were centred on the south-west of England on Monday, householders in the Midlands, north-east, north-west, Wales and the east of England have all been told to be on guard. A further 212 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, are active. The misery also continues for passengers and crew on board a ferry that could not dock in south-west Wales on Monday because of the choppy conditions and was forced to remain out on a storm-lashed sea overnight. Rail services in the south-west and northern England were badly hit by the aftermath of Storm Angus at the weekend and Monday’s torrential rain.
On Tuesday, GWR was strongly advising passengers not to travel to and from or within certain areas of Devon and Cornwall. The line between Tiverton Parkway and Exeter St Davids in Devon was severely damaged. The Barnstaple and Looe branch lines in Devon and Cornwall were also closed. On Tuesday morning Network Rail said no mainline trains from or to London would be able to arrive at or depart from Exeter for an estimated 48 hours because part of the tracks had been swept away at Cowley Bridge in the city. Network Rail said it expected trains from Paddington would be able to get as far as Tiverton in Devon. At Cowley Bridge in Exeter the ballast was washed away from the tracks, leaving rails dangling in the air. Some electronic points equipment was also damaged.
The Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted:
The line was also flooded between Bristol Parkway and Swindon in Wiltshire. Services to and from Bristol Parkway and south Wales were subject to diversion and alterations. Speed restrictions were in place between Bristol Temple Meads and Weston-super-Mare. In the north of England, homes and businesses were left submerged in water after a month’s worth of rainfall fell in just one night in greater Manchester. Tameside and Oldham were some of the worst hit areas with three inches of rain falling overnight. Greater Manchester’s fire service had 230 calls between 4pm and 9pm on Monday during the peak of the torrential rainfall. Some homeowners had to be rescued after dozens of homes in Stalybridge were flooded – with water reportedly “neck-deep”. Rescue crews used ladders to remove trapped first and second floors of their homes. In another case on Huddersfield Road in the town’s Millbrook area, rescuers were seen using a boat to help remove people trapped within their homes. The Met Office’s yellow warning for Greater Manchester remained in force until 6am on Tuesday - although a clean-up operation will then begin in earnest across the region. Meanwhile, in West Yorkshire fire crews were called to four incidents of people being trapped in cars which were stuck in flood water and one person had to be rescued from their vehicle in Otley. Metrolink was forced to suspend all services on its East Didsbury line after a tree fell on the tracks and a slipway on the M60 at Cheadle was also blocked by another collapsed tree.

Rail services from Manchester to Sheffield, Leeds and Scotland were disrupted by problems including a fallen power line at Oxenholme Lake District. A woman who was rescued from the sea at Folkestone is thought to be in a life threatening condition, Kent police said. Folkestone and Dungeness coastguard, Dover lifeboat and a helicopter were scrambled at 6.54am after reports that a woman was in the water off the harbour area. A Kent police spokesman said: “South East Coast Ambulance Service went to the scene and a woman has been taken to a local hospital. Early reports suggest she is in a life threatening condition.” In the Irish Sea, passengers and crew on a Stena Europe ferry were forced to stay on board after the vessel failed to dock in Fishguard harbour, Wales, at 12.30pm on Monday after sailing from Rosslare, Ireland, at 9am. A Stena Line spokeswoman said on Monday night: “The health and safety of passengers and crew is of paramount importance to Stena Line, therefore the 87 passengers and 59 crew members will remain on board overnight until a second attempt at docking takes place at midday tomorrow.”
The Met Office said the wettest place in the UK on Monday was Dunkeswell aerodrome in east Devon, where 50mm of rain fell in 24 hours. In the 48 hours up to 3pm on Monday, 96mm fell on Exeter airport. Only 136mm falls on Devon in the whole of a typical November. Wind warnings issued by the Met Office were still in place into Tuesday morning after gusts of up to 70mph recorded on the Isle of Wight. Squally weather is due to persist throughout Tuesday, with gusts of about 50mph expected to continue over higher ground and coastal areas in the south-east, forecaster Greg Dewhurst said. “We have seen the area of low pressure that brought heavy rain to the south and west moving into southern Scotland and the north-east overnight,” he said. “Throughout today the wet and windy weather within that low pressure area will slowly move into the North Sea. “Behind this most places will still see showers, some heavy but getting lighter during the day. Away from the low pressure we should see some sunshine around Northern Ireland and western Scotland.” Devon and Cornwall police attended more than 60 road collisions during the day on Monday. Fourteen schools in Devon were forced to close. Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said between 4pm and 9pm operators dealt with about 230 calls. Firefighters rescued a man from his car after it became stuck in flood water in Oldham and escorted another man to safety after his van became stuck in the floods in Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside.
The GMFRS was also called to flooded homes in Stalybridge. Crews gave advice to people who became trapped inside their homes on Huddersfield Road in the town and made electrics safe in flooded properties on Honeysuckle Drive. In south Wales, fading light and treacherous conditions forced police to suspend the search for a pensioner who vanished on Sunday morning. The search for Russell Sherwood, 69, from Neath, will resume on Tuesday. North Yorkshire fire and rescue service said on Monday firefighters attended 22 incidents involving flooded properties in Craven, Harrogate, Hambleton and the east of the county. They rescued eight people from cars stuck in flood water. In west Yorkshire, police said standing water was causing problems on the M62 motorway. Roads in other parts of the county were blocked by several feet of flood water. Conditions were due to improve into Wednesday as the unsettled conditions pass, with colder nights expected under clearer skies. Temperatures of 5C (32F) are predicted in the Scottish Highlands, while many could wake up to frost on Wednesday."
2016-11-22T09:57:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Are you affected by travel disruption in the UK?,"Rail commuters and motorists across the country are facing a difficult and potentially dangerous day after heavy rain and strong winds led to roads and train lines becoming blocked. Southern Rail’s union members have also walked out for 48 hours causing delays to commuters.
By first light on Tuesday the Environment Agency had 75 flood warnings in place, meaning that flooding is expected and people should take immediate action. While most were centred on the south-west of England on Monday, householders in the Midlands, north-east, north-west, Wales and the east of England have all been told to be on guard. There were a further 207 flood alerts (flooding is possible) in place. Rail services in the south-west and northern England were badly hit by the aftermath of Storm Angus at the weekend and Monday’s torrential rain.

2016-11-22T10:07:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Caldey Island records first crime after visitor hits son,"A small island off the Welsh coast famed for its order of perfume-making monks and sense of tranquility has recorded its first crime in living memory. Police were called to Caldey Island (population: 40) off Pembrokeshire in south-west Wales after an incident at the chocolate makers. The officers had to be taken on an RNLI lifeboat to the island, 2 miles off the resort of Tenby, to make an arrest.
The crime was revealed when a visitor on a day trip from Dudley, West Midlands, appeared in Haverfordwest magistrates court on the mainland to admit assault. The man was visiting the island when he struck his “misbehaving” seven-year-old son during a visit to the “chocolate factory”, a large kitchen where some of the monks produce handmade treats. John Cattini, 65, the island’s commercial manager, said: “This is the first crime in court I can recall and I’ve been here more than 40 years. “I’m glad to say I didn’t witness it but I’m sorry to say I was told about it. It is very sad. We are happy to say we live here very peacefully. This person was a visitor and is a sign of the modern world, I expect.” The monks were described as being concerned by the assault. Caldey, which is a mile and a half long, has been a religious retreat since the first monastery was set up there 1,500 years ago. The monks take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and observe a rule of silence between the hours of 7pm to 7am.
Before the assault, the crime rate was zero. Traffic offences are also at zero, unsurprisingly given there is only 300 metres of road. During the court hearing, Dennis Davies, prosecuting, said other visitors told police that the father attacked the boy as they stood outside the chocolate factory. “The man was said to be shouting at the boy before lifting him up with an outstretched arm by the throat.” He then put him down, slapped him on the back of the head and “frogmarched” him away. The court heard that another visitor shouted: “That’s child abuse.” The father, 45, told police his son was “being naughty and wouldn’t listen”, and almost fell down the steps at the chocolate factory. Davies said: “He told police that in no way did he intend to hurt him, but accepted that he had been unreasonable.” The defence solicitor, Mike Kelleher, said: “The boy said that his daddy hadn’t put his hands around his throat and that he was really good to him. The father is deeply upset and didn’t want to hurt his son.” The father was released on bail until next month for reports to be prepared. After the hearing, a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys police said: “We acknowledge that the crime rate on Caldey Island is very low, but we take all reports of crime seriously and as such investigate them thoroughly.” The island is home to nine monks in the monastery and a handful of farmers. It hosts more than 3,000 people between April and October, who visit to sample the home-made chocolate, perfume and shortbread made by the Cistercian monks. • This article was amended on 23 November 2016 to correct the number of monks on Caldey Island."
2016-11-22T15:33:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Pregnant woman and children robbed at knifepoint in their home,"A heavily pregnant woman and her six-year-old daughter were held at knifepoint in their home, it has emerged. Fatima Bibi, who is due to give birth on Wednesday, told how one of two robbers held a machete against her stomach and said: “Pregnant lady, I’m going to kill you.” Bibi was at home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with her four children – Mohammed, 13, Hasnain, eight, Hooria, six, and five-year-old Asra – when they heard a knock at the door. Hasnain opened the door and two men stormed into the house, dragging Hooria upstairs, where they held a knife to her throat. Bibi, 36, said: “From the stairs, I saw one masked man holding my six-year-old girl from the neck, and he had a big knife in his hand, dragging her upstairs. “And one person behind him. They both came upstairs and they held me there. He asked me: ‘Where’s your safe? Where’s your money?’ He still had my girl in one hand around her neck, with the knife pressing against her skin. At that time I was so scared and crying. “I was begging them: ‘Don’t do anything to my girl. I don’t have any safe. I don’t have any money.’ “One person started searching, and the other person put the knife on my stomach and he said: ‘Pregnant lady, I’m going to kill you. Tell me quickly, where’s your safe, where’s your money.’ “The person started searching in my bedroom. The other masked man with the knife dragged my daughter downstairs and I ran behind him, because my other three kids were in the living room.
“He told my kids not to scream, and he waved the knife at them as well. The other person finished searching and then came down and said: ‘Let’s go.’” The robbers burst into the house at about 7.30pm last Friday. After stealing an iPhone 5s, they ran out and across the road down an alleyway. The first man is described as white, taller than 6ft and of heavy build. He was wearing a black wool balaclava, a dark baseball cap with the hood of his jacket up and a sleeveless black quilted jacket and dark top, black wool gloves and dark blue jeans. He spoke with a local accent. The second man is described as white, about 5ft 5in, 25 years old with light-coloured eyes, an oval-shaped face, short patchy ginger beard, and of medium build. He also spoke with a local accent. He was wearing a black wool hat pulled down to just above his eyebrows, with the hood from his red jumper over the hat, a black sleeveless quilted coat, black gloves and brown chinos. Bibi said the incident has given her sleepless nights and left her children traumatised. She said: “Me and my kids were at home alone, and we were the most vulnerable people at that time. It is not easy to forget that moment, it is frozen in my mind. “They knew we are Asian people, that we buy jewellery and keep it at home. I’m going to hospital tomorrow to have my baby girl, and I’m worried because I’m leaving my kids at home with my husband. “Nobody should be allowed to do that to kids in our society. I just hope people come forward and do their part. Today I’m the victim, tomorrow it might be someone else.” Detectives have released CCTV footage of two men approaching the house. DI Kenny Blain, from Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said: “This was an atrocious attack on an innocent family in their own home. The mum is due to give birth any day and the stress this would have caused her could have potentially threatened the life of her unborn child. How anyone could hold a knife to the throat of a six-year-old is beyond comprehension.”"
2016-11-22T17:18:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Jo Cox murder trial: jury set to start deliberations on Wednesday,"The jury in the Jo Cox murder trial is expected to begin its deliberations on Wednesday morning. Thomas Mair, the man accused of murdering the Labour MP, opted not to give evidence at his trial at the Old Bailey in London. The judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, said he expected to finish his summing up on Wednesday when the jury would retire to consider its verdict. Earlier, the jury was told that the murder in June had brought two extremes of humanity “face to face” after Mair allegedly shot and stabbed Cox in a brutal attack in her constituency. The court has also heard that Cox’s killing was politically motivated and cowardly. “The sheer brutality of her murder and the utter cowardice of her murderer bring the two extremities of humanity face to face,” said prosecuting counsel, Richard Whittam QC. In his closing speech, Whittam added that the attack had “brought out the best of the people who were with her” – the two members of staff and Birstall residents “from all walks of life” who tried to protect Cox. As Cox’s family looked on in court eight, Whittam said that, despite being armed and having the “element of surprise”, Mair failed in his first attempt and came back to shoot and stab Cox again. “Perhaps he underestimated Jo Cox’s tenacity and courage,” said Whittam. He concluded by telling the jury that all the evidence “compellingly establishes Thomas Mair was her murderer”. The court was told that Mair had declined to appear as a witness in the trial. In the defence closing speech, Simon Russell Flint QC said Cox had been brutally and callously murdered and her death had had a huge impact on hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, including her husband, parents and young children. He said it was the jury’s duty to decide whether Mair was responsible beyond reasonable doubt. “It is you and you alone who have been charged with the responsibility in determining what are the true verdicts in each of the counts on the indictment.” Earlier, a written statement from the MP Stephen Kinnock was read to the jury, in which he described how Cox had become a good family friend. “She was an incredibly well-liked and popular person and always found time for people despite her busy life,” the statement said. Mair is accused of killing Cox on 16 June in Birstall, West Yorkshire, a market town in her Batley and Spen constituency. She was on her way to a meeting with voters, and had been scheduled to attend an event to raise support for the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU, a week before the referendum. She was shot twice in the head and once in the chest, and stabbed 15 times. Mair, 53, an unemployed gardener from Birstall, is charged with her murder and the grievous bodily harm of Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, who was stabbed in the stomach after coming to the MP’s aid. Mair is also charged with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, and possession of a dagger. The court has heard that the attack was captured on CCTV. The court was told that Mair remained silent during three and a half hours of police interviews the day after Cox was killed. “He didn’t answer any questions, and simply remained silent,” said DC Roger Williams in a statement read to the jury. Mair declined to enter pleas when he appeared at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing last month. As a result, not-guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. The Old Bailey also heard from DS Andrew Cass, who was at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June, when Mair first appeared accused of Cox’s murder. He told jurors that when asked to confirm his name, Mair replied: “Death to traitors. Freedom for Britain.” The officer said: “He was asked again and repeated the same words again.” The case continues."
2016-11-22T17:51:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Torrential rain and floods continue to disrupt travel across UK,"A woman has died after being pulled from the sea and concerns are growing over 69-year-old man feared drowned as rough seas, flash floods and swollen rivers continued to cause problems across swaths of the UK. Although drier, colder weather is expected, the Environment Agency warned homes and businesses that have escaped so far may still be hit by flooding as water makes its way through river and stream systems. It highlighted particular concerns for Dorset and York. Travel to some parts of the country is expected to remain difficult for much of the rest of the week, with the south-west of England particularly badly hit. There were calls in Devon and Cornwall for more money to be spent on infrastructure after part of the mainline between London and the West Country was washed away and is likely to remain impassable until Thursday.
The Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted:
The Local Government Association has also called for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to devolve control of money for flood defences to ensure it is directed to exactly where it is needed. Police in Kent are investigating how a 39-year-old woman came to be in the wind-whipped sea near Folkestone pier on Tuesday morning. She was pulled from the water by a coastguard helicopter, having been in the sea for about an hour, and taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition but later died.
On Tuesday night police said a vehicle believed to belong to Russell Sherwood, 69, who has been missing since setting off on a car journey from his home in Neath on Sunday, had been found in the swollen river Ogmore. A South Wales police spokeswoman said the search had been stood down for the night owing to dangerous conditions and would resume on Wednesday morning. “Mr Sherwood’s family have been kept fully informed of the developments and are being supported by specially trained officers,” she added. At the peak of the flooding on Tuesday, more than 70 flood warnings – meaning flooding is expected and residents should take immediate action – for the Midlands, Wales, and the north-east, north-west and east of England were in place. The number dipped as the day went on but the Environment Agency said people still needed to be prepared. In Dorset there were concerns about the river Stour and in York the upper river Ouse was expected to reach its peak level on Wednesday, which may cause flooding. Clare Dinnis, national flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “People in the south-west and north-east need to be aware of the potential for further flooding. The weather is due to improve later this week, but we want to remind people not to risk driving through floodwater, walking near large waves or near swollen rivers. “Environment Agency teams have been out in their communities throughout the night working to reduce flood risk. Temporary flood defences have been deployed and we are continuing to maintain flood defences, clear blockages in watercourses and monitor water levels.” There was some good news after a ferry from Ireland stranded in Cardigan Bay for more than 24 hours with almost 150 passengers and crew on board finally docked at Fishguard. In Greater Manchester, homes and businesses were left submerged after a month’s worth of rain fell in one night. The Press Association journalist Rich McCarthy tweeted:
Andy Vaughan and his wife, Shelley, had to be rescued from their home in the village of Millbrook, near Stalybridge, in a fire service boat after their cottage was overcome by floodwater. The front door caved in during a rush of water which flooded into the village from the nearby Walkerwood reservoir after it had become blocked and overflowed. The family are now homeless. While some were mopping up or bracing for flooding, the questions over whether enough was being done to prevent flooding began.
The leader of Cornwall county council, John Pollard, said it was ridiculous that the main track to the far south-west of Britain had once again been damaged by flooding, two years after the line at Dawlish in south Devon was left dangling in the air following storms. “Clearly the mainline should not be that vulnerable,” he said. Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, said he was fed up with south-west rail lines being left dangling in the air. “South-west Tory MPs should stop backing HS2 until our 19th-century lines are resilient,” he said. Members of the South-West Peninsula Rail Taskforce had to drive to London on Tuesday to launch a 20-year plan to make the system less likely to break down. Gerard Duddridge, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall branch of the campaign group Railfuture, said: “The railway can never be 100% foolproof against the weather, but there are things that can be done to reduce disruption.” He called for more work to be done on the section of the line affected this week but also said an alternative route from Exeter to London via Yeovil ought to be improved."
2016-11-22T19:54:58Z,uk-news,UK news,"Wales unveils means-tested university grants of up to Â£11,000 a year","Welsh undergraduates from the poorest families will receive maintenance grants of up to £11,000 a year in return for taking on the full cost of university tuition fees, as Wales overhauls its student funding. Kirsty Williams, Wales’s education secretary, announced that the country’s universal £5,100 tuition grant is to be scrapped and replaced with a mix of generous means-tested benefits and loans based on students’ family incomes from September 2018. “We are looking to introduce the most generous and progressive system anywhere in the UK. If you want to go to university, this system will allow you to do so,” said Williams, the sole Liberal Democrat cabinet member in the Cardiff assembly’s coalition government.
“I am proud to confirm our intention to deliver the first system in the UK that is consistent, progressive and fair in its support for full- and part-time undergraduates, and for postgraduate students,” she said. The new regime, which will apply only to students ordinarily resident in Wales, will see students from families earning under £18,000 a year, or who had previously been in care, receiving up to £8,000 in grants, a figure equivalent to the “national living wage”, based on 37.5 hours a week over a 30-week academic year.
Williams said the government would largely adopt the recommendations of a review of student funding published in September, which argued that the current regime – which has protected Welsh students from the imposition of £9,000 tuition fees and loans since 2012 – failed to directly help those from the worst-off households. The existing universal tuition fee grant, costing the government about £250m a year, had been available to all Welsh students, including those who travelled to other parts of the UK to study. The Welsh government estimates that about 70% of students will be eligible for a portion of means-tested grants, with the level of benefit tapered down to a maximum income of £59,000.
All students will receive a universal maintenance grant of £1,000, regardless of family income, and will be able top up grants with loans. Students studying in London would receive a 25% boost to their maintenance grants, so that those from the poorest families would receive a maximum of £11,000. Unlike other parts of the UK, the funding will also be available to part-time and postgraduate students as well as those studying full-time. “Academic ability should determine whether you go to university, not your social background. Students from Wales will be supported to meet their daily living costs, something they continually tell us puts them off going to university,” Williams said. The announcement enjoyed broad cross-party support, with both Conservatives and Plaid Cymru welcoming the move. The new funding formula had been outlined by Prof Ian Diamond, vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, in a review commissioned by the Welsh government. The new formula could be ready for students starting in September 2018, depending on the government’s consultation, Treasury approval and the ability of the Student Loans Company to administer the scheme."
2016-11-22T20:04:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland wins battle to end voluntary work programme sanctions,"Unemployed Scots taking part in newly devolved, voluntary work programmes will not face sanctions, after the Scottish government won its battle with Westminster to exempt those taking part from having their benefits stopped or reduced. The Scottish government’s minister for employability and training, Jamie Hepburn, welcomed this as “a great relief to individuals who have had to cope with this unnecessary stress and harm in the past”. Hepburn said: “I am delighted that the Scottish government can give people an assurance that they will not be sanctioned through our employment programmes. We can now show that our programmes are an opportunity and not a threat.” The newly devolved welfare powers, which were agreed under the Scotland Act, allow Scottish ministers to design their own employment services for disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment, beginning in April 2017. These transitional arrangements will be made before a full Scottish programme of employment support launches in April 2018. Although sanctions will still be Westminster’s preserve, Hepburn has been pressing the UK government to clarify its position on whether Scots taking part in work programmes could be exempt because of the voluntary nature of the schemes. According to research by the Scottish Greens, 80,000 sanctions have been issued to people on employment programmes in Scotland since 2010.
Hepburn added: “While we won’t have the powers to prevent people from being sanctioned by the UK government, we can make sure we take a distinctly Scottish approach through our employment programme.” The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, confirmed the Scottish exemption in a letter to the convener of Holyrood’s social security committee, Sandra White, on Tuesday. Reiterating his belief that conditionality and sanctions “contribute to a fairer society” and are “an important part of our benefits system”, Green said that the Department for Work and Pensions would make referrals to the devolved programmes on a voluntary basis, meaning that a sanction would not be applied for failure to attend or participate. Green wrote: “DWP does, however, remain interested to see how the Scottish government will achieve delivery of an effective system which both secures value for money, and provides successful outcomes for those at risk of long-term unemployment, where engagement is on a purely voluntary basis.” Last month, Hepburn said his government “doesn’t want to facilitate the UK government’s sanctions regime” when he met a group of single parents at the Edinburgh offices of One Parent Families Scotland. He said he was planning work programmes that were voluntary and took into account the complexity of individual circumstances, after hearing the parents describe sleepless nights under threat of sanction and the practical difficulties of finding even entry-level jobs that were compatible with childcare. Marion Davis, head of policy at One Parent Families Scotland, welcomed the result, saying: “We are very pleased that the Scottish government has taken a stand against benefit sanctions that force many single parents into low-paid and poor-quality work. “But there are still tens of thousands of single parents who are not in paid work and facing the risk of being sanctioned. They don’t need the threat of destitution to get them into work but need flexible and affordable childcare and better paid work.”"
2016-11-22T22:15:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Chancellor to crack down on letting fees in autumn statement,"Millions of families who are being charged hundreds of pounds by agencies to cover the supposed administrative costs of renting will be offered relief when Philip Hammond promises to ban letting fees. The chancellor will unveil the measure in the autumn statement on Wednesday alongside a £1.4bn investment in affordable housing as he tries to deliver on Theresa May’s promise to help families who are “just about managing” – or “Jams”.
The boost for housing, in addition to a fund that is already worth £4.7bn, is expected to help build 40,000 new homes and would allow providers more flexibility to offer people lower rents. The eye-catching ban on letting fees, which would come into place after a consultation, follows campaigns by both the Labour party and a Lib Dem peer, Olly Grender. They claimed that renters were being asked to pay hundreds of pounds for questionable reasons such as inventory checks. However, just two months ago the housing minister, Gavin Barwell, tweeted that such a move would be a “bad idea – landlords would pass cost to tenants via rent”.
Other measures designed to target the so-called Jams include: Ploughing over £1bn into universal credit over five years by reducing the rate at which benefits are taken off people as they progress through work, following demands for action by Conservative backbenchers. Increasing the national living wage from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour from April 2017, slightly below the £7.60 estimate by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Allocating £4.3m a year towards strengthening minimum wage enforcement. Hammond is also expected to use the first major financial statement of a chancellorship likely to be dominated by Brexit to announce sharply weaker forecasts for GDP growth and the public finances. The figures from the OBR follow predictions from City forecasters that economic growth will slide from around 2% this year to little more than 1% in 2017. Meanwhile, the city credit ratings agency Moody’s warned that just managing families may find themselves unable to service their car loans and mortgages as a result of by rising inflation caused by Brexit. The ban on letting fees comes despite Barwell’s comments and the fact that the Conservative government led by David Cameron fiercely resisted calls by the Labour party for the change just six months ago. The Conservative party press office put out a statement saying that Ed Miliband’s policy would “lead to higher rents” while the same message was delivered by the local government minister, Marcus Jones, who is still in position. He told MPs in the House of Commons: “Banning or capping letting agent fees would not make renting any cheaper for tenants – tenants would still end up paying but through higher rents.” The issue is disputed with National Landlords Association chief executive, Richard Lambert, agreeing that the cost would “boomerang” back on to private tenants. While he admitted that some unscrupulous agents have got away with excessive fees, Lambert said: “Agents will have no other option than to shift the fees on to landlords, which many will argue is more appropriate, since the landlord employs the agent. But adding to landlords’ costs, on top of restricting their ability to deduct their business costs from their taxable income, will only push more towards increasing rents.” He said Hammond “lacks an understanding of how the whole sector works”. However, Shelter – which found letting fees are on average £300 but can reach more than £500 – insisted that the evidence from Scotland, where a ban is already in place, is that rents did not rise. The charity welcomed the moves on housing in the autumn statement but said the “devil will be in the detail”. “At Shelter we see the impact of our chronic shortage of affordable homes every day, with increasing numbers of people left with no choice but to fork out most of their hard-earned wages on expensive private rents, and wave goodbye to the chance of a stable home,” said the charity’s chief executive, Campbell Robb. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, added that his party had long backed “ending sky-high letting fees for renters” and pointed out that Conservative MPs, including May and Hammond, had voted against the move. Lady Grender, who is the author of a private members bill on renters’ rights that proposed the change and was being discussed in parliament as recently as Friday, said: “Our relentless campaigning to get tenants’ letting fees banned has finally paid off and the government has recognised this is the right thing to do. The upfront costs of renting are far too high, pushing many people into debt just to pay the fees, and stopping others from being able to move into a rented home.”
She wrote to the prime minister to highlight the issue when she first came into office, and received a response in which May said: “I appreciate your comments regarding the private rented sector and I agree that tackling concerns about housing will be an important part of building a country that works for everyone.” Sources said the chancellor was expected to spend Tuesday evening putting the finishing touches on his speech at No 11, having moved into the Downing Street flat less than a fortnight ago.
Hammond’s speech will start at 12.30pm after prime minister’s questions and is likely to be significantly shorter than those of his predecessor, George Osborne. The so-called red book of fiscal measures will also be slimmer, reflecting a desire to focus on broad-brush headline measures rather than micromanaging the spending of departments. Ahead of the event, Hammond has spoken to more than 100 businesses and organisations to get a sense of their perspective on the post-referendum economy. His big theme on the day will be boosting spending on infrastructure and productivity, as well as the string of small measures to help families that are just managing. After the speech, David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will be sent out on to the airwaves to explain the overarching points of the statement. He is a veteran of the Treasury and was often used in a similar way by Osborne after big announcements."
2016-11-23T00:01:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Chancellor aims to catch the eye with help for 'just about managing',"The most eye-catching policies in Philip Hammond’s autumn statement are those designed to help the “just about managing” families – from a ban on letting agents’ fees to slightly softening the blow of benefit cuts for those in work. The most significant move is a change to the new universal credit welfare system that softens the pace of withdrawal of in-work benefits for claimants as they increase their hours. It will help about 3 million people, although experts from the Resolution Foundation thinktank have warned it will in no way compensate for the scale of cuts to the work allowance – a benefit replacing tax credits – that hits new claimants on universal credit. A second flagship policy for the just about managing families – known as Jams – is a proposed ban on fees for letting agents.
This policy was opposed by Conservative ministers until very recently. David Cameron’s election team put out a press release in April 2015 saying Ed Miliband’s plan to do the same would increase rents for “hardworking families”. A large affordable housing programme is a third measure for the Jams, who tend to be defined as households earning £15,000 to £30,000 a year. There will be an additional £1.4bn to encourage construction of 40,000 such homes, although Labour said it was “too little, too late” given the deep cuts to housing investment in 2010, which have meant that the supply of affordable places to live has never caught up. Another measure for low earners is a boost to the “national living wage” announced by George Osborne earlier this year. It will go up from £7.20 per hour to £7.50, although the pace of this increase does not appear to be enough to reach the target of £9 by 2020 promised by the former chancellor. A crackdown on fraudulent whiplash claims is an additional modest measure aimed at helping the Jams, as it is designed to bring down car insurance costs by about £40 annually. The Ministry of Justice has proposed either scrapping the right to compensation for minor whiplash injuries or putting a cap on the amount people can claim. Infrastructure investment will be the second major plank of Hammond’s policy announcements, particularly aimed at improving productivity of the workforce. The chancellor will deploy more than £1bn to boost broadband speeds for up 2 million homes and businesses – despite the fact that millions of other homes are not yet connected at all – and another £1.3bn of new investment in roads, primarily targeted at small projects to relieve traffic congestion."
2016-11-23T00:01:49Z,uk-news,UK news,What to look out for in the autumn statement,"The economy GDP Economic growth is slowing. A 2% forecast for next year is expected to be revised down to nearer 1%. Disposable incomes Household spending power has risen in the past two years after wages rises of 2% to 2.5% outstripped zero inflation. Inflation is now expected to hit between 2% and 3% with wages growth at around 2%, eating into disposable incomes. Exports The amount the UK sells abroad has fallen as a proportion of GDP for decades. The OBR will want to avoid accusations of political interference if it forecasts a post-Brexit acceleration of the trend.
Fiscal targets The annual deficit A shortfall that reached £155bn in 2009/10 was forecast in March to fall to £55.5bn in 2016/17. The OBR is expected to say its forecast was wrong, and it will be nearer £65bn. Public investment Ahead of the autumn statement, the chancellor has announced around £5bn of extra spending, but there could be more to come. Whitehall departmental spending After a deep cut in 2014 and a boost last year, another easing in austerity is expected. Welfare spending Universal credit will taper for longer, Hammond says, allowing recipients to keep more of the benefit. Pensions costs keep escalating, pushing up the overall benefits bill. Productivity From 2010 onwards the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury’s independent forecasting unit, has assumed a 2% annual gain in productivity. It hasn’t happened and another downgrade is expected. Personal finance Personal allowance The chancellor could begin to honour the Conservative manifesto pledge to raise the threshold at which individuals start paying income tax to £12,500, or raise the £8,060 level where national insurance kicks in. Higher rate threshold The manifesto also promised to raise the threshold for the 40p rate to £50,000 by the end of the parliament after a succession of freezes during the coalition years. Fuel duty The car lobby wants a cut in fuel duty to offset inflationary rises in petrol, but a freeze is more likely. Insurance premium tax A favourite target of George Osborne, it is a below the radar tax rise on households and could be used again to raise money. Air passenger duty A cut is possible to help families hit by dearer holiday costs. Pensions cold calling The government’s pension freedoms sparked a stampede by savers to extract cash from their pension pots. Fraudsters sought to exploit this situation by cold calling to sell dodgy vehicles for the money. A ban is on the way. Employee benefits An increase in taxes on employee benefits would be one way to prevent tax “leakage”. At the moment millions of people can swap taxed salary for bike purchases and gym membership. This perk could be scrapped, saving tens of millions of pounds. New measures for savers The amount that savers can put aside in ISAs before incurring tax could be raised. Infrastructure Housebuilding A £5bn homebuilding fund was mooted to deal with Britain’s housing shortage. But the chancellor has put forward a £1.4bn “injection” to support the building of 40,000 homes. Transport A £1.3bn road improvement scheme will aim to tackle bottlenecks and fix potholes. Digital A £1bn scheme will push ahead with trials for 5G mobile access and superfast one gigabit broadband. Business R&D Theresa May said there would be £2bn extra for science and R&D spending over the next four years – the chancellor will provide details. Corporation tax The Conservatives want to bring the headline rate down from 20% to 17%, and Theresa May has hinted she wants it lower – but it is already the lowest in the G20 and the chancellor could delay further cuts. Business rates New rateable values come into effect next April. Businesses, especially those in expensive parts of the south-east, have lobbied for the government to delay implementation. Bank levy Reductions in the levy scheduled over the next five years could be accelerated as banks consider whether to stay in the UK post Brexit."
2016-11-23T00:01:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond rejects calls to reverse Â£3bn annual cut to work allowance,"Philip Hammond will cushion the blow of deep cuts to in-work benefits for “just about managing” households, as he delivers his first autumn statement. The chancellor will seek to placate backbench rebels, including former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, by reducing the so-called taper rate at which universal credit is withdrawn as recipients’ earnings rise, from 65p to 63p in every pound. The measure will cost the Treasury a total of £1bn over the next five years. But Hammond will reject calls to reverse the other key plank of his predecessor George Osborne’s cuts: the much larger, £3bn-a-year reduction in the work allowance – the amount recipients can earn before their benefits start to be taken away. Campaign group 38 Degrees has gathered more than 218,000 signatures on a petition to reverse the planned reductions to universal credit set in train by Osborne. Trish Murray, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: “Our members are really worried that if the cuts to universal credit go ahead, it’ll become impossible for people that are already struggling to make ends meet. Rising food bills and sky high rents mean it’s already difficult for many families to afford the basics – and people from across the country have told us these cuts will make paying the bills even harder. The Resolution Foundation thinktank welcomed the concession from the Treasury but warned that it would still be more than outweighed by the losses from the lower work allowance. Its analysis suggests a full-time worker on the government’s “national living wage” would gain up to £250 a year from Hammond’s 2p reduction in the taper rate, rising to around £500 a year for a family earning £30,000. That compares to losses of up to £2,800 a year from the work allowance changes. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “When it comes to boosting ‘just [about] managing’ family budgets, all roads lead to universal credit. The most effective way to support families would be by reversing the £3bn cut to work allowances announced by the last chancellor. He said a modest reduction in the taper rate would instead “leave a bittersweet taste among just about managing families”. Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested the partial U-turn would cost £700m a year by 2020/21 — compared with the £3bn a year taken out of work allowances previously announced. Alfie Stirling, IPPR senior economic analyst, said: “Any change to reverse some of the impact of cuts to universal credit is to be welcomed, but the government are only giving back a small slice of what has previously been cut.” The chancellor has been under pressure to soften cuts pencilled in by Osborne after last year’s general election, as he sought to meet the Conservatives’ manifesto pledge to slice £12bn from the cost of the welfare state. Osborne, who was sacked by Theresa May in July, was forced into an embarrassing U-turn at last year’s autumn statement over planned reductions to tax credits. But he left in place reductions for universal credit – the new benefits system that is being slowly rolled out across the country. The announcement is the latest of a series of decisions made by May’s government to moderate the impact of some of the harshest aspects of the welfare system overseen by David Cameron. Work and pensions secretary Damian Green, a close ally of the prime minister, has made a series of changes – including scrapping six monthly check ups for chronically ill patients claiming disablity benefits and pledged that there will be no additional welfare cuts in this parliament. But cuts such as thesharp reduction in the “benefits cap”, which limits the total amount a single household can claim, will cost 88,000 families more than £2,000 a year and have already been implemented. Conservative backbench rebels, who have been urging Hammond to reverse the cuts, signalled that they welcomed the changes to taper rates – but would not give up the fight to make the system more generous. Critics including Heidi Allen, David Burrowes and Johnny Mercer had all expressed concerns that increasing the taper rate would undermine work incentives for struggling families. Duncan Smith, who resigned in the wake of Osborne’s final budget in March over cuts to disability payments, had urged Hammond to make changes. Allies said he would welcome any move to plough money back into universal credit, the system he designed. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “It would appear that this autumn statement is set to fail our first test to provide actual support for those on low and middle incomes.” “If all the chancellor is offering is a 2% change in the taper rate then it will be too little, too late for those working families who have had to bear the brunt of six wasted years of failed Tory economic policies.” Osborne’s controversial redesign of the universal credit system was one of the most contested elements of his deficit-reduction strategy, which Hammond is expected to rewrite on Wednesday. The Conservatives fought the 2015 general election on a pledge to cut £12bn from the welfare bill, but without detailed proposals about how they would do so. As well as universal credit, the Labour frontbench, and Tory MPs, have been pushing for changes to planned cuts to the employment support allowance for disabled people."
2016-11-23T06:00:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Five key charts you need to see before the autumn statement 2016,"The UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will deliver his maiden autumn statement against a backdrop of weaker growth prospects, rising inflation and a large deficit. Scope for headline giveaways will be limited but Hammond is likely to signalmeasures to help so-called Jams – those families who are “just about managing”. Here are five key charts to consider before he stands up. 1. Growth has been steady … but is likely to slow in 2017
Britain has enjoyed steady growth over recent years, with 15 consecutive quarters of expansion. The economy has been more resilient in the months since the Brexit vote than many commentators were expecting. Back in August, the Bank of England was predicting growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter, but it actually came in at 0.5%. It ruled out a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of contraction) in the second half of 2016, as consumers appeared to shrug off any uncertainty resulting from the result of the June referendum. But 2017 is expected to get tougher as household budgets are squeezed by a combination of rising inflation and weak wage growth. When the then chancellor George Osborne presented his budget in March, the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, was forecasting growth of 2.2% next year. That now looks very optimistic and the Treasury’s independent forecaster will undoubtedly revise the figure down on Wednesday. 2. The UK leads the G7 in 2016 … but not for long
Britain will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2016, according to the forecasts published in October by the International Monetary Fund. As the chart shows, the UK economy is expected to grow by 1.8% in 2016, just ahead of Germany at 1.7% and the US at 1.6%. The Washington-based fund admitted its prediction of a post-Brexit-vote crash had proved overly pessimistic. It’s a different story in 2017, when the Brexit blow begins to be felt and the UK slips down the international league table, with growth of just 1.1%. That would be the slowest rate of annual growth since 2009, when the UK economy shrank by 4.3% in the depths of the financial crisis. 3. Wage growth is weak … and inflation is rising
The financial crisis took a heavy toll on living standards, with real pay falling for six years from 2008 as inflation outpaced wage growth. As the chart above shows, by 2015 things had started to look up for UK consumers. Pay growth was subdued, but inflation was even weaker, providing some respite for households. But living standards are expected to decline again in 2017 as pay growth remains weak but inflation rises. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise from a current rate of 0.9% to close to 3% next year, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote pushes up import costs and feeds into higher prices on the high street. 4. Unemployment forecast to rise from its 11-year low
Unemployment rose after the financial crisis but not as much as feared. After hitting a peak of more than 8% in 2011, the jobless rate has been steadily falling and currently stands at 4.8% – the lowest since 2005. Economists and policymakers, including those at the Bank of England, are now expecting unemployment to rise as business takes a more cautious approach while Britain attempts to negotiate its way out of the EU. The Bank is predicting the jobless rate will rise to about 5.5% in the middle of 2018. 5. Borrowing expected to be £100bn more than anticipated
The chart above shows the path for the public finances forecast by the OBR at the time of the March budget. That was two months before the UK surprised the world by voting to leave the EU, changing both the economic and fiscal backdrop in the months and years ahead. The OBR itself said last month its forecast for borrowing of £55.5bn in 2016-17 was “very unlikely to be met”. That point was underlined by the latest figures, which showed the total for the first seven months of the fiscal year to October had already reached £48.6bn (as shown above). But it will have to rip up the forecasts for subsequent years too, taking into account the impact of weaker growth on the public finances. The chancellor has already abandoned previous plans to return the public finances to surplus by 2019-20. Economists believe the OBR’s revised figures could put borrowing at £100bn more over the next five years than it was predicting in March. The surplus shown in the final two years in the chart above is therefore likely to be erased."
2016-11-23T07:00:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Is the chancellor about to spring an autumn statement surprise?,"In the final few, frantic days before a “fiscal event”, as budgets and autumn statements are known at the Treasury, civil servants are usually locked in seclusion. They may hand out the odd carefully crafted teaser to hungry hacks – a few quid for broadband here, a small business tax cut there – but the most eye-catching giveaways are reserved for the chancellor to announce himself, with a theatrical flourish, on his big day. Yet on Tuesday lunchtime, a shopping list of tasty handouts for Britain’s Jams – the “just about managing“ households Theresa May has promised to help – dropped into journalists’ inboxes, to be splashed across the front pages at midnight. None of the measures are very costly for a Treasury battling to balance the books, and several – a ban on letting fees; a 30p an hour increase in the national living wage – are free, to the taxpayer at least.
But any one of them would have made an upbeat news story for autumn statement day. It is hard to remember an occasion when more positive measures have been pre-announced before the chancellor has even opened the door of No 11 Downing Street to set off for the House of Commons. So what is the new chancellor up to? One theory is that he has an even bigger political rabbit to pull out of his red box on Wednesday: a bumper cut in fuel duty; a faster-than-expected increase in the tax-free personal allowance; or a generous cut to air passenger duty, for example. But Hammond’s team has been keen to stress that he is a no-nonsense chancellor who will make a slimmed-down, gimmick-free, matter-of-fact statement: more of an Alistair Darling, then, than a George Osborne. So that seems unlikely. A second possibility is that Hammond knows he will have to spell out the economic risks of Brexit in his statement – with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility expected to say that growth and tax receipts both look markedly weaker, and more uncertain. If the forecasts look particularly grim, and Hammond’s team believes the headlines everywhere will be “Brexit blows black hole in Hammond’s budget”, they may feel it’s worth getting the good news out of the way first. All the more so if he opts to pencil in more spending cuts at the end of the parliament to make good the shortfall. And as the cabinet’s self-appointed captain of caution where Brexit is concerned, perhaps Hammond really does want the focus to be the state of the economy, through Brexit and beyond – a quaintly old-fashioned approach compared with that of his predecessors. The key measure in Osborne’s final budget was compulsory academisation for schools – a plan which the government later had to drop. If Hammond objects to twiddles and gimmicks – and especially if some of these have been inserted into the autumn statement at the insistence of May and her team – perhaps he was keen to get them out of the way, and clear the decks for the serious stuff. But the blizzard of pre-announced handouts, albeit modest ones, also raises a more intriguing thought: is there something else the chancellor will tell us in his first set-piece statement that the Treasury spin doctors believe will eclipse any reassurance Hammond has to offer the Jams? A clearer vision for how the government will approach Brexit, for example? We’ll soon find out."
2016-11-23T08:14:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond set to unveil giveaways and gloomy forecasts,"Philip Hammond will make his first set-piece speech as chancellor on Wednesday, offering modest giveaways for “just managing families” that are expected to be overshadowed by difficult economic forecasts. In the autumn statement, the chancellor is expected to confirm a ban on letting fees for millions of families who are being charged hundreds of pounds by agencies to cover the supposed administrative costs of renting. This will be accompanied by a softening of cuts to the universal credit welfare system and a package of support to encourage the construction of 40,000 new affordable homes.
Hammond is also expected to announce an increase in the “national living wage” from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour from April 2017, although this is slightly below the £7.60 figure that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates would be necessary for it to stay on course to match the pledge of £9 an hour by 2020. However, the modest measures for “just about managing” families, known as “Jams”, are expected to be accompanied by sharply weaker forecasts for GDP growth and the public finances. Predictions from City forecasters suggest that economic growth will slide from about 2% this year to little more than 1% in 2017. Meanwhile, the credit ratings agency Moody’s said that Jams may find themselves unable to service their car loans and mortgages as a result of rising inflation caused by Brexit. The softening of in work benefit cuts was welcomed by those campaigning for a reversal but there is already pressure for bigger changes. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, told the BBC’s Today programme: “I consider this a down payment. This is not game over.” Sources said the chancellor was likely to spend Tuesday evening at No 11 putting the finishing touches to his speech, having moved into the Downing Street flat less than a fortnight ago. Hammond’s speech will start at 12.30pm after prime minister’s questions and is likely to be significantly shorter than those of his predecessor, George Osborne.
The so-called red book of fiscal measures will also be slimmer, reflecting a desire to focus on broad-brush headline measures rather than micromanaging departmental spending. Ahead of the speech, Hammond has spoken to more than 100 businesses and organisations to get a sense of their perspective on the post-referendum economy. His big theme on the day will be boosting spending on infrastructure and productivity, as well as the string of small measures to help Jams. Other measures due to be confirmed in the speech are a boost to broadband investment and billions for road infrastructure to ease traffic congestion. After the speech, David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will be sent out on to the airwaves to explain the overarching points of the statement. He is a veteran of the Treasury and was often used in a similar way by Osborne after big announcements."
2016-11-23T08:59:52Z,uk-news,UK news,'I worry about money all the time': the Jam reality in Birmingham,"“Does it just mean that I’m in a sticky situation?” Rachel Sherman, mother of four, asks, wondering if her household classifies as a just-about-managing family, or in the dispiriting new political acronym, a Jam. She is in a difficult situation financially, but questions whether the family should be described as just about managing, or more realistically, as one that is teetering on the edge of catastrophe, a Toteoc, or as one which is not OK by any stretch of the imagination, a Nobasoti (neither expression yet in political usage).
She is due to start a new job this week in a furniture shop, but has only been given an eight-hour-a-week contract, which leaves her and her husband (struggling to find work after a heart attack) with a huge shortfall, since the lowering of the overall benefit cap earlier this month reduced her housing benefit payments from about £640 a month to 50p. It is not yet clear how they will manage. She forced a smile when each of her children had to take in a £1 donation last Friday for Children in Need, eating into the small pot now set aside for food. “Our whole family as a unit is in need,” she says. “I agree with the idea of people getting off benefits and into work; I understand and that’s right, but this pressure is making it harder. My husband has applied for well over 100 jobs this month, and he can’t get an interview.”
From the bottom of the income scale to families with a reasonably good income who are still struggling, a wide spectrum of families in Birmingham are hoping that they might be the just-about-managing families that Theresa May and Philip Hammond have in their sights for extra support in the autumn statement. Expectation is huge, and the disappointment is set to be palpable. The constituency of Erdington voted strongly Brexit in the EU referendum and is one of the poorest in the country, with pockets of acute deprivation. Because of its location close to the Jaguar Land Rover Castle Bromwich site, it also has relatively well-paid workers, many of whom are finding that wage stagnation and rising living costs have also left them in difficulty. Lauren Hampshire, 28, employed here as a family support worker, is capable, ambitious, professional and stuck. With a degree and postgraduate qualifications in early-years education, she works full-time, helping families who need advice with parenting and budgeting. Meanwhile, at home, she is worrying about her own budgeting issues as she tries to keep up mortgage payments and pay for nursery for her 18-month-old son. “I did my education, I’ve bought a house, I’ve tried to do it all the right way, but there isn’t a lot of support when you’re left as a single parent. I’m just getting through each week, trying to manage,” she says. Planned local authority cuts for 2017 mean her job in the Castle Vale children’s centre is under threat, as the council decides which children’s services to shut down. “I feel there is nowhere for me to go, there is no ladder for me to climb up. Nursery schools and children’s centres are at risk of closing and if they don’t actually close, they are at risk of massive budget reductions. Staff will be lost,” she says. “If I lost my job it would be devastating. I could apply for other jobs, but it is hard, because everyone is looking for budget cuts in this line of work so everyone is in the same boat, including management. If you think about it too much you can get quite down about it.”
For the moment she is just about managing by being careful not to buy new clothes for herself and by eating meals at her parents’ house whenever they are offered. Clare Yates, 30, who has two daughters, one 14 months and the other three years old, is also hoping for more help with childcare costs. She lost her job with a catering company contracted to make breakfast for Jaguar workers when she was pregnant with her second child. “They said I wasn’t up to standard, that I was working too slowly, but I think they wanted me out because I was pregnant,” she says. Worries about her family’s financial situation have recently pushed her to ask her doctor for antidepressants, which she says are helping with the anxiety. “I worry about money all the time. It would help if there was more free childcare, so I could go back to work.”
Fifty-year-old Anne (who asked for her real name not to be published, because she was uneasy about talking about her financial predicament), a senior teaching assistant in Erdington who has worked in the same nursery school for 27 years, is also finding keeping up with her mortgage payments difficult. She extended the mortgage twice to meet household bills as she brought up three children, the youngest of whom is 16. She recently received a letter from the bailiffs over costs related to late payment of council tax, and although she has decided to ignore it, the worrying memory of the letter keeps popping back into her mind. She has considered taking up a second job, but her hours at school are already quite long. She loves her job and is puzzled that, given how crucial the work is, her pay (more than £20,000) leaves her barely managing at all. “I’m up at 6am and usually at work until five. At the end of the day you have to sleep,” she says. “I do struggle on what I get. I live in my overdraft, which is ridiculous. The wages come in, and the overdraft gets paid off and there’s nothing left. We haven’t been on holiday for five or six years because there hasn’t been extra money. We go to the market now to buy trainers, not to JD’s. I buy ‘smart price’, own-brand cornflakes, rather than Kellogg’s, and I still get to the checkout and think, ‘That’s come to a lot again.’”
She says her salary hasn’t risen much in a decade – “You don’t notice your annual increment, it’s just pennies” – and she also worries that her job will be at risk next year with the next round of council cuts threatening nursery services. In central Birmingham, at the National Express depot, senior skilled workers, whose wages used to put them automatically in a comfortable bracket, are also considering whether their current income makes them the kind of workers that the prime minister wants to offer extra support. Peter (also not his real name, because he was worried about saying anything that might upset his employer) has been working for the company as an engineer for more than three decades since he was a teenage apprentice. He says his £12-an-hour rate no longer goes as far as it once did. He is grateful to bosses who this year allowed him to increase his overtime schedule so he now works Saturdays and Sundays to boost his take-home pay – he never previously had to work both days of the weekend. “I work hard, but the family struggles when you work weekends,” he says. A father of two whose wife works part-time in a shop, he has only been able to meet his mortgage payments because he puts in long hours and works antisocial shifts. He voted leave in the referendum, concerned about the impact of immigration. “I haven’t got a problem with immigrants. I’m all for getting people into this country who will make a difference, but you shouldn’t go flooding the country, otherwise schools and hospitals won’t be able to cope,” he says. A Labour voter, he is not expecting much from the autumn statement, but he wishes the government would speed up the implementation of Brexit. “In a democracy, don’t you go with the majority?”"

The woman was shot in the leg by the gunman in the doorway of her home. Merseyside police said the woman – who was in a stable condition – was shot by one of two men on a motorbike at about 6.10pm on Tuesday, before the pair rode away from the scene in Peckmill Green in the Netherley area of the city. Detectives from the Matrix serious organised crime unit were investigating the shooting. The motive was said to be unclear but the attack was believed to be targeted. DCI Mark Tivendale said: “We are keeping an open mind as to why this has happened and the investigation is in its early stages. Our priority is to establish who is responsible and to bring them to justice. “Criminals who choose to settle their disputes with a weapon do not care about the widespread fear they bring to their own communities. We cannot and will not stand by and let people like that rule the roost. “But to achieve safer streets we need the public to tell what they know about the criminals and I promise we will take robust action and put these people before the courts and into the prisons.

The woman was airlifted to hospital but died. The death is being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), Kent Police said. Police received a call concerning the welfare of the same woman at around 6.30pm on Monday and referral to the IPCC was “mandatory” in such circumstances. The Environment Agency (EA) is warning people across England who live close to rivers and streams to remain vigilant following this week’s heavy rain as water feeds through the system in the coming days. Though much of the UK was enjoying drier weather on Wednesday morning, almost 100 warnings and alerts remained in place from Cornwall through the Midlands, up to Greater Manchester and the north-east. Twelve warnings were in place that flooding was expected and immediate action required. The EA said water levels on the river Stour from Sturminster Newton to Wimborne in Dorset were continuing to rise. Flood warnings were also in place on the river Ouse at Naburn Lock in York and stretches of the river Severn in Gloucestershire. The mainline train track between Tiverton and Exeter in Devon remained closed after the track was washed away in seven places by the torrential rain.

2016-11-23T10:21:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Seven 'migrants' rescued in boat in Folkestone harbour,"Seven people, thought to be migrants, were rescued in a boat in Folkestone harbour in the early hours of Wednesday morning after at least three began suffering from hypothermia. The small boat they were sailing in was found in the harbour after a distress call was made while it was out at sea. It is believed the boat reached the shore without assistance. Kent police said they were called to the scene just after 5.30am because of concerns about the boat. They said: “The Coastguard coordinated a search for the boat which was located at Folkestone harbour and seven suspected migrants were also found.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a search-and-rescue operation had been launched after a call was received from a boat reporting that people on board were unwell. A spokesman said: “A boat with seven people on board, including three with suspected hypothermia, was then found.”
The recovered boat was a small red and black rib (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) with an outboard motor, according to the BBC reporter Simon Jones. The South East Coast ambulance service was also called. “The matter has been passed to Home Office immigration enforcement,” the statement from Kent police added. The Home Office has yet to comment. Speaking to Kent Online, a spokesman for the Kent coastguard said: “There are seven people, possibly immigrants, all males. One was on shore, the others were in a boat. We are now trying to find out where they originated from.” Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, said the incident highlighted the need to protect UK borders following the closure of the Calais refugee camp. He said: “This is yet another sign of the extreme lengths people will go to, risking their lives trying to break into Britain. Crossing the English Channel in a small boat as winter sets in is about as dangerous as it gets. “It’s clear that although the camp at Calais has been cleared, we now need to be more vigilant than ever. This incident underlines the need to ensure we scan our seas for people smugglers, protect our borders and to strengthen our intelligence effort with France.”"

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information about the attack, which happened in an alleyway near the Bow Bells pub in Bow Road, Bow, just before 9.30pm. The officer was said not to be in a life threatening condition on Wednesday. Police say the quartet, who ran off after the attack, may also have been involved in a separate incident nearby, outside Devons Road station on the Docklands Light Railway network, where a motorist was threatened with a knife. He was able to drive away and notify police. One male, whose age has not yet been made public, was later that evening arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody. London’s air ambulance and the London ambulance service attended the scene of the stabbing. The injured officer, in his 40s, was taken to an east London hospital, where he remains. The Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command is investigating. Detectives do not believe the attackers knew their victim was a police officer. Police said they may have been socialising in the area before the attack. The temporary deputy assistant commissioner Richard Martin, from specialist crime and operations, said: “Fortunately, the officer is recovering well in hospital, as his injuries could have been a lot worse. “I’d like to appeal for any information or witnesses to the attack that took place. “If you saw or heard anything that may help us catch the people responsible then please get in touch.” Anyone with information about the attack is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2016-11-23T12:13:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Dear prudence comes home as May praises autumn statement,"Theresa May has welcomed Philip Hammond’s “prudent” approach to running Britain’s economy, as he prepares to deliver his first autumn statement, reviving a favourite catchword of Gordon Brown’s.
Hammond set out his plans for his first set-piece parliamentary event as chancellor to his fellow ministers at Wednesday morning’s cabinet meeting. He is expected to announce sharply weaker economic forecasts and reveal the full extent of the deterioration in the public finances likely to be caused by Britain’s exit from the European Union. The Treasury has already announced a series of modest giveaways, including a partial reversal of deep cuts to in-work benefits. The chancellor is expected to confirm a ban on letting fees for millions of families who are being charged hundreds of pounds by agencies to cover the supposed administrative costs of renting. Hammond is also expected to announce an increase in the “national living wage” from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour from April 2017, although this is slightly below the £7.60 figure that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates would be necessary for it to stay on course to match the pledge of £9 an hour by 2020.
However, the modest measures for “just about managing” families, known as “Jams”, are expected to be accompanied by sharply weaker forecasts for GDP growth and the public finances.
Predictions from City forecasters suggest that economic growth will slide from about 2% this year to little more than 1% in 2017. The softening of in-work benefit cuts was welcomed by those campaigning for a reversal but there is already pressure for bigger changes. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, told the BBC’s Today programme: “I consider this a down payment. This is not game over.” Hammond told colleagues his approach was “focused on preparing and supporting the economy as we write a new chapter in the country’s history”, and on tackling the productivity shortfall, which means Britain’s workers are “working longer hours, for less pay”, compared with similar countries. The prime minister’s spokeswoman said May had welcomed his remarks, and said: “This is a balanced and prudent autumn statement that will make sure that Britain is open for business and the government is on the side of ordinary working people.” She said it would help to deliver on the Conservatives’ pledge of creating “an economy that works for everyone”. Hammond’s colleagues, as is traditional, banged the table in approval of his plans, the spokeswoman said. Fiscal prudence and tackling Britain’s long-term productivity shortfall were key themes of the Treasury’s work during Brown’s tenure as chancellor. May’s spokeswoman also highlighted that Hammond’s colleagues had welcomed the way he and Treasury officials had worked constructively with other departments, and the renewed focus on the long-term weaknesses of the economy. Hammond has consciously sought to reject the meddling approach of former chancellors, and insiders say he will allow his colleagues more leeway over how they spend their budgets. He is also expected to deliver a slimmed-down statement, with few gimmicks."
2016-11-23T12:31:59Z,uk-news,UK news,The slow-burning hatred that led Thomas Mair to murder Jo Cox,"Reclusive, nervous and by his own account gripped by feelings of worthlessness, Thomas Mair struck his neighbours and many of his relatives as odd but quite harmless. “Tommy’s nowt to worry about,” they used to say on the Fieldhead estate in Birstall, West Yorkshire. “He wouldn’t hurt a fly.”
In truth, Mair was racist and a terrorist in the making, his home stuffed with far-right books and Nazi memorabilia and his mind brimming with a belief that white people were facing an existential threat. “The white race,” Mair once wrote, was about to be plunged into “a very bloody struggle”. His greatest obsession, however, and his deepest bitterness was over those white people whom he condemned in his writings as “the collaborators”: the liberals, the left and the media. The seeds of the hatred that drove him to murder his MP, Jo Cox, appear to have been sown years earlier, when he began to acquire the means to kill. They germinated during the febrile countdown to the EU referendum. Brexit campaigners were claiming that a remain vote would result in “swarms” of immigrants entering the UK, that it could trigger mass sexual attacks. Just hours before the murder, Ukip unveiled its infamous “breaking point” anti-immigration poster. Mair came to regard Cox as one of “the collaborators”, a traitor to his race. The passionate defender of immigration and the remain campaign was a legitimate target in his eyes. Mair was an extremely slow burner. He appears to have fantasised about killing a “collaborator” for more than 17 years, drawing inspiration from another rightwing terrorist, David Copeland.
Over 13 days in April 1999, Copeland planted three nail bombs in London, targeting first black people, then Asians and finally gay people. Three died and more than 140 were injured, some losing limbs. Copeland was a former member of the British National party (BNP) and an admirer of the late William Pierce, once the leader of a US neo-Nazi organisation, the National Alliance. Pierce’s novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts an apocalyptic race war, had been particularly influential. Copeland was arrested on 30 April that year, shortly after planting his third and final bomb at the Admiral Duncan, a gay pub in the Soho area of the capital. He appeared in court four days later. The bombings were front-page news and dominated the airwaves. It is fair to assume that Mair would have been following events. On 13 May 1999, 10 days after Copeland’s first court appearance, staff at the National Alliance offices near the small town of Hillsboro, West Virginia, were packing a consignment of goods to be sent to Mair’s home on the Fieldhead estate. A packing slip subsequently obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a US civil rights body, showed Mair had bought a range of items from the organisation. They included manuals on the construction of bombs and the assembly of homemade pistols, six back issues of the Alliance journal called Free Speech, and a copy of Ich Kämpfe, a tract handed out to Nazi party members in 1943, the year that Germany’s wartime fortunes began to wane.
Having been galvanised by Copeland’s attacks, Mair took his first steps on the long road that would lead to his own hate crime. Other records the SPLC obtained show this was one of a series of purchases that Mair made from the National Alliance over a four-year period. He began to subscribe to Free Speech, and other publications with titles such as Secret of the Runes and We Get Confessions were packed up in Hillsboro and sent to the semi-detached council house where Mair had been living alone since the death of his grandmother three years earlier. In total, he spent more than $620 (£500) on Alliance purchases. Mair amassed a small library about the Nazis, German military history and white supremacy, which he kept in a bedroom at his home on a bookshelf topped by a gold-coloured Third Reich eagle with a swastika. SS Race Theory and Mate Selection Guidelines was the title of one, fairly typical text. Uniforms and Traditions of the Luftwaffe Volume Two was another. He also subscribed to a rightwing magazine called SA Patriot, which was initially published in South Africa by the Springbok Club, but moved to the UK and became SA Patriot in Exile in 1991. That year, Mair had written a letter to the magazine in which he railed against the killing of loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and attacked the UK media’s coverage of South African affairs “which … never fails to present whites in the worst possible light”. He tried to end his letter on a positive note: “Despite everything, I still have faith that the white race will prevail, both in Britain and in South Africa.” But then his pessimism got the better of him: “I fear that it’s going to be a very long and very bloody struggle.”
Eight years later, around the time Mair purchased the bomb-making manual from the US, the magazine ran another of his letters. He praised the publishers for “carrying on the struggle”, before returning to his ultimate obsession. “I was glad you strongly condemned collaborators in the white South African population. In my opinion the greatest enemy of the old apartheid system was not the ANC and the black masses but white liberals and traitors.” The Springbok Club still runs a blog, which just two weeks before Cox’s murder urged UK readers to vote to leave the EU in order to renew links with their “ethnic brothers and sisters” elsewhere in the world. The magazine’s editor, Alan Harvey, told the Guardian: “He sent us a fiver, which would have been enough for about five issues, but I’ve never met him. I know nothing at all about him.” Because Mair was so reclusive, few people do. Far-right links Thomas Alexander Mair was born in the Scottish town of Kilmarnock in August 1963, the son of James, a machine operator in the lace industry, and Mary, a factory worker. He was named after his grandfathers. The Mairs had a second son, Scott, but the marriage did not last long, and Mary and the boys moved to Birstall, a mill town eight miles south-west of Leeds. Mary remarried, and Mair has a half brother, Duane St Louis. Mair’s links with far-right groups in the US and South Africa are well documented, but his associations with similar organisations closer to home appear more tenuous. He told the SA Patriot in Exile that he had had some contact with the National Front in the early 1990s, he was seen at an English Defence League rally and attended a meeting of nationalists in London. Supporters of various far-right organisations in West Yorkshire deny, however, that Mair was ever part of the local scene, and anti-fascist campaign groups say he had not crossed their radar. “He’s not on any of our lists,” a spokesman for one such group said, before adding quickly: “Not that we keep any lists, you understand.”
Nor had he ever come to the attention of the police. He had no previous convictions. Speaking after the verdict Det Sup Nick Wallen, from West Yorkshire Police, said Mair had never had so much as a conversation with the police. He described him as a “loner in the truest sense of the word.” “This is a man who never held down a job never had a girlfriend never any friends to speak of.” Wallen said Mair had had never had “so much as a conversation” with the police. There would have been no shortage of opportunities for Mair to make common cause with rightwing extremists in his area. The demographic changes in the towns and villages around Birstall and nearby Batley happened a generation or more ago, but it has remained fertile ground for the far right, for whom the many Muslims in the area represent a highly visible enemy. In the mid-90s, one local man formed an offshoot of the National Alliance, which he called the National Socialist Alliance. In 2006, after a jury at Leeds crown court cleared Nick Griffin, the then BNP leader, and another party member of inciting racial hatred, Griffin hailed West Yorkshire as “an unusually radicalised” part of the UK; meaning, apparently, that he believed a considerable proportion of people there shared his views.
Three years later, when a list of BNP members was leaked, significant numbers were found to live in the towns and villages west of Leeds, with a couple of dozen near Birstall. A year after that, police discovered 54 homemade bombs and a dozen firearms at a house in Batley. The occupant, Terence Gavan, a BNP member, was jailed for 11 years after admitting a series of offences under the Terrorism Act 2000. The court heard that Gavan showed “strong hostility” towards immigrants. Since then, a number of smaller fringe groups – the British Movement, National Action, the National Front, the Yorkshire Infidels and Liberty GB – have recruited members in the area. The NF, the BNP and Liberty GB fielded candidates in the byelection triggered by the Labour MP’s murder. The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Ukip all declined to stand. Members of the far right have staged several marches in the area over the past two years. Such was the level of concern this year at the local authority, Kirklees council, that it asked Tell Mama, an organisation that monitors anti-Muslim incidents, if it could help devise a strategy to ease community tensions that were being caused or exacerbated, in part, by the far right.
It appears that Mair, however, had little to do with such groups, perhaps because he was so reclusive. He preferred his relationships with the far right to be long-distance affairs. He was a frequent visitor to Birstall’s public library, where he used the computers. One of the librarians, Beverley Fletcher, recalled how he would walk in and simply utter the word “computer”. “Thomas Mair doesn’t engage in conversation and he doesn’t give much eye contact,” she told police. “And I don’t remember him ever getting a book out of the library.” Earlier this year he was using the library’s computers to research such matters as the BNP, white supremacists, Nazis and public shootings. In the days before the murder he sought out information about the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen SS, Israel, serial killers and matricide. He read up on the death of Ian Gow, the last MP to have been murdered, killed by an IRA car bomb in 1990. He accessed the Wikipedia page of the former foreign secretary William Hague, a Yorkshire politician who, like Cox, supported the campaign to remain in the UK. Mair had acquired a firearm, a German made Weihrauch .22 bolt-action rifle, from which the stock and most of the barrel had been removed. It was stolen from the boot of a sports utility vehicle in nearby Keighley in August 2015. But detectives admit they still do not know how “true loner” Mair, who had no social network, got hold of it. “How he came to be in possession of that gun is an active line of inquiry for us,” said DS Wallen after verdict. Mair had carried out online research into .22 ammunition, reading one page that offered an answer to the question: “Is a .22 round deadly enough to kill with one shot to a human’s head?” He also bought a replica British army second world war dagger. Mair was particularly fascinated by the Norwegian Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in gun and bomb attacks in 2011, and kept newspaper clippings about the case. Despite his identification with violent figures of the far right, however, he made little effort to make any real contact with others of a like mind. Mental health In the immediate aftermath of the murder, there were suggestions among some neighbours that Mair had a history of mental illness. According to members of his family, he had been treated for obsessive compulsive disorder, and it is said that he was so anxious about cleanliness that he had been known to scrub himself with pan scourers.
Police discovered evidence of behaviour associated with OCD when they searched his home. It was sparse and obsessively orderly, and inside his kitchen cupboards, tinned food was carefully arranged in precise rows, with each label pointing in exactly the same direction. Mair himself claimed to be in need of treatment for mental health problems. In 2010, while volunteering at a country park near his home, he suggested to an interviewer from the Huddersfield Examiner that he had previously received such treatment. “Many people who suffer from mental illness are socially isolated and disconnected from society,” he said. “Feelings of worthlessness are also common, mainly caused by long-term unemployment.” After his arrest, he was examined by a psychiatrist who could find no evidence that his mental health was so poor that he was not responsible for his actions. He was essentially a sane man.
Mair is clearly an extraordinarily troubled individual. Some psychologists who have studied people responsible for acts of “lone-wolf terrorism” have concluded that they frequently identify strongly with one group so strongly that they are prepared to make considerable sacrifices for what they see as the good of the group. The authors of one study wrote that “positive identification with a group, combined with the perception that this group is being victimised, produces negative identification with the group perpetrating the injustice”. This appears to chime with Mair’s belief that “collaborators” were operating to the detriment of white people. The authors also found that individuals who are radicalised by a sense of grievance “can be steady, planful and workmanlike – as indeed many lone-wolf attackers seem to have been”. Those in Birstall who believed Mair to have been odd but harmless say he was devoted to his mother, who lived nearby, and many commented on the way he tended elderly neighbours’ gardens. Neighbours, who knew nothing of his links with white supremacists, said they had no reason to believe he was racist. His half-brother, Duane, whose late father, Reginald, was originally from Grenada, said he had never heard him express racist sentiments. Others in the town tell a different story. A number of Asian taxi drivers say Mair would utter insulting comments to them. “He’d been reported by a few taxi drivers for making racist remarks,” said Zein Ali, a controller at Oakwell and Rex taxis. “When they dropped him off and he was paying them, he’d say racist things. We always thought he was a racist.” The books and magazines that police recovered from his home and the examination of library computers on which he had browsed the internet left no room for doubt. Turning to murder The question remains as to why Mair turned to murder in June, 25 years after he first made contact with the Springbok Club and 17 years after he purchased a manual describing the assembly of a homemade pistol. Copeland was also a slow burner, taking a number of years to convince himself that he should turn to terrorism. At his trial, the prosecuting counsel said he had told police that the seed had been planted in July 1996, when the Olympic Games in Atlanta were bombed. The following month, during the Notting Hill carnival in west London, Copeland found himself fantasising about a bomb exploding among the crowds. “To start with he treated the thought as a joke, but he could not get it out of his head,” said Nigel Sweeney QC. “The thought became stronger. He woke up one day and decided he was going to do it.” It appears that Mair also woke up one day and decided he was going to do it. Cox was a vocal supporter of the remain campaign. Her constituency is a place where anti-European feelings run high, and each day during the referendum campaign, Mair was surrounded by red and orange Vote Leave notices. St George’s cross flags fluttered from windows. His “death to traitors” outburst during his first court appearance shows he regarded Cox as one of “the collaborators”, the white people who had betrayed their race.
Perhaps he was provoked by the far-right literature he devoured. It is possible that, like Copeland, he hoped to become the spark that would ignite a racial war. One of the last searches he conducted on Birstall library computers was into people who had been executed as traitors. On 16 June, on a warm and sunny afternoon, Mair stepped out of a shadow as Cox walked towards the library where she was due to hold a surgery for constituents. He raised his sawn-off rifle and shot her. Then he pulled her to the ground, dragged her between two parked cars, and stabbed her repeatedly with his dagger. When Bernard Carter-Kenny, a 77-year-old passerby, tried to intervene, Mair stabbed him too. He then stepped back a little, as if he had finished. But when he heard Cox warn her two assistants to flee – shouting “get away, let him hurt me, don’t let him hurt you!” – he stood over her and shot her twice more, and stabbed her again. Cox was shot twice in the head and once in the chest. Rounds passed through both hands as she tried to protect herself. Some of the eyewitnesses gave evidence at Mair’s trial, but one became so unwell as a consequence of what she saw that she could not attend. Mair was said to have appeared calm throughout. “Cold” was the word one witness used to describe him. They saw Mair swing the knife again and again as he stabbed Cox 15 times in her heart, lungs and abdomen. One blow pierced her chest after passing through her right arm. He did so, according to the eyewitness, while saying: “Britain first, keep Britain independent, Britain will always come first.” Finally, he yelled: “This is for Britain.”"
2016-11-23T12:39:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Jo Cox's friends say her energy for life was 'immeasurable',"Jo Cox may have been petite (“she wasn’t 5ft, she was at least 5ft 1in or 5ft 2in on a good day,” joked her husband, Brendan, during a tribute), but to all who knew her she was a towering figure, and not just in politics. Gemma Mortensen remembers a younger Jo firing out “kit list” emails to friends ahead of trekking adventures, ordering one person to carry huge blocks of cheddar cheese, another to stock up on that “disgusting beanfeast stuff” and someone else to bring along bags of wine.
Then they would be off, some of them amateurs in the trail of energetic Jo and her tireless husband, on a sleeper train that would spit them out in remote parts of Scotland to tackle yet another Munro. Mortensen’s memories are of Jo lugging along a rucksack twice the size of her, which would stretch down below her knees as she marched along “beaming” and singing folk songs. “On rucksack to body mass ratio she was unquestionably the most hardcore,” says Mortensen, laughing sadly about what she says are among the most special memories of her life.
Then she remembers a simple and touching image of Jo after giving birth to her first child, Cuillin, that she feels sums her up: of her friend standing under a rain cover, breastfeeding her baby, at the top of a mountain. “She was authentic, not just in work, but in life,” Mortensen adds. Only Jo could have mastered the so-called Inaccessible Pinnacle and then abseiled down while fighting morning sickness from a pregnancy that had just begun. She and Brendan had a dream to climb all the Munros together. During a painful trial, he reached the top of what would have been her 100th – Ben Oss – placing her hat at the top and insisting that she would have “loved the adventure, the snow and the peace”.
Most of her friends keep returning to the same themes as they talk of Jo: of a woman with the perfect mix of idealism and pragmatism; who knew nothing of tribalism but would instead share her conviction that politics could change the world with politicians of any stripe; who cared deeply for others; and to whom family – Brendan, Cuillin and daughter Lejla – and others, were everything. And there’s no friend who shows the slightest hint of surprise about that final act of kindness, revealed in court, of protecting her colleagues with the shout of “get away you two – let him hurt me”. Her husband said simply: “This is who Jo was.” “She was very giving,” adds Lucy Powell, a fellow Labour MP who had known Jo since they worked together as parliamentary researchers in the 1990s. “Always, always putting others before herself. Not a shred of me, me, me.”
Jane Brady, a close friend and one of Jo’s 15 best women at her wedding, who has been alongside her family at the trial, tells a similar story. “Her energy for life was immeasurable, her humanity and genuine desire for good unmatched,” she says. “Most of all though, she was a mum who deeply loved her children and wanted the world to be a better place for all children.” She remembers the last time they spoke, when Jo “was very tired, the kids had been poorly and she wondered if she really was making a difference. I just want to say to her, ‘Look at the world, Jo! The world is so much better for having had you in it.’”
For Mortensen, “the faultline running through it all” was fairness. She talks of Jo and Brendan being a rare couple who “lived out their ideas”, getting married on a remote peninsula, followed by a camping celebration, and then making a barge their home. Later they raised their children on a houseboat – named Ederlezi after a folk song – which was moored in east London, near Tower Bridge. And every year on the summer solstice they would invite more than 100 friends and dozens of children to their remote cottage by the Welsh border. It had no electricity or water and guests carried drinks and food by foot or canoe. Mortensen describes her friend as a joyful person who was grounded by her children, deeply empathetic, and who “loved to dance”. She was deeply passionate about driving change – from journeys to witness the injustices in Palestine, to fighting to get more women into positions of significance, to the civilian suffering in Syria or the sorrowful stories of loneliness in Yorkshire that were to become her key campaigns in parliament.
Everything about Jo was infused with a touch of Yorkshire, where she grew up with a mother who was a school secretary and a father who was a factory worker. There was nothing metropolitan or elite about the upbringing of a woman who would go on to study at Cambridge and become a passionate campaigner for the EU, before heading to Brussels to work with the MEP Glenys Kinnock and then for Oxfam. Her work as head of policy for the global charity turned heads across the sectors and politics. And Kate Norgrove, a friend who worked with her, called her an amazing mentor who constantly tried to help support those around her. Jo later moved to work for Sarah Brown’s White Ribbon Alliance, focused on maternal mortality, and then chaired the Labour Women’s Network, which aimed to drive up the number of female MPs. After having two children, she was looking to set up a thinktank aimed at helping women to organise and represent themselves. In her “non-sectarian” way, she was emailing friends asking for advice about not just Labour but “Tory/right-of-centre men and women” to take part. Then she was given the chance to go for a job that had always been the dream: to represent her home constituency of Batley and Spen. And she spilled into parliament with an excitement and enthusiasm that inspired all those around her, from dozens on the Labour benches to many whom she worked with across the floor, like Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, who called her a “5ft bundle of Yorkshire grit”. “Jo built friendships as if it were her job. She always wanted us to have a plan to be better MPs, better feminists, better friends to each other,” says the MP Jess Phillips, who says she misses her friend every day, and whom she still imagines running in huge heels down the halls. Jo shared an office with fellow MP Stephen Kinnock – a friend from her days in Brussels, when she worked for his mother. He remembers the “raucous laugh and infectious good humour” of a “political soulmate”. What would Jo think now, he often muses, imagining her arriving at work after the election of Donald Trump. “She would be saying: ‘What the hell is happening in our world? What should we be doing?’ and ‘What does it mean about the values we cherish?’” They would have had a field day over the president-elect’s suggestion of ambassador Farage, he says. Stories from Kinnock and Powell, and Jo’s parliamentary assistant, Ruth Price, make it clear how much her motherhood was spread through her work. Kinnock remembers fondly reading to the children in the office, while Powell talks of school holidays when they would “tag-team” to vote in the chamber. Price remembers a parliamentary Christmas party where Jo and the children raced through parliament, their faces painted as tigers as they roared at each other. Now Jo will be remembered by the Jo Cox Foundation, whose director, Iona Lawrence, sums up what will be done: “One of the joys of Jo was that she cared about a huge raft of issues – domestic and international. The thing that connects them is Jo. “To start with was her drive to focus on civilian protection in Syria and on loneliness in the UK, as well as her passion about getting more women into public service and anything that could be done to make Westminster more family friendly.” The campaigns will draw on Jo’s now-famous comment that diverse communities in Britain had “more in common” that that which divides them. Brendan’s most recent tweet reminds people that “Jo would not want to rest in peace” but forever be an activist and passionate force for good in the world. Kirsty McNeill, director of policy at Save the Children and a close friend, says: “In the midst of our grief we want Jo to be lionised, but not dehumanised. She wasn’t some two-dimensional figure, but was humanity itself – impish, playful, energetic, determined, vibrant, loving, funny and strong. She never just said ‘What do you think?’, always ‘What should we do?’. On any question, whether it was getting more women into politics or dealing with appalling attacks on civilians around the world, Jo never, ever thought the path was impossible. “So please don’t remember her as a symbol, but as somebody always in motion, always creating waves, always pushing us to do and be better. We’re left with our memories and her example as a guide in the years ahead.”"
2016-11-23T12:42:46Z,uk-news,UK news,At a glance: autumn statement – 26 key points,"Growth 2.1% in 2016 – higher than forecast in March. In 2017, the Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting growth of 1.4%. Hammond said growth would be 2.4 percentage points lower than would have been the case during the forecast period. Growth is forecast to be 1.7% in 2018, 2.1% in 2019 and 2020, and 2% in 2021. Previous forecasts were 2.2% for 2017 and 2.1% for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The chancellor blames the lower growth forecasts for next year on higher predicted inflation and economic uncertainty, mostly attributable to the vote to leave the EU. That will annoy the Brexiters who dismiss the economic impact of the referendum, but it is still not forecasting a recession predicted by remain campaigners before 23 June. Borrowing New draft charter for budget responsibility. Forecasts for borrowing: £59bn next year, £46.5bn in 2018-19 and £21.9bn in 2020, to reach £17.2bn in 2021-22. No longer a surplus by the end of the decade. Previously the government was aiming for surplus by the end of the decade. The forecast was for £56bn of borrowing in 2016-17, £39bn in 2017-18 and £21bn in 2018-19. RM: Philip Hammond said the government was committed to maintaining fiscal discipline, prompting scornful laughter from the opposition. The lack of a firm date for returning to a surplus ditches the last of George Osborne’s old budgetary targets, which he repeatedly broke and delayed. Welfare No plans for further welfare savings measures in this parliament beyond those already announced. RM: Hammond is keeping Osborne’s idea of a welfare cap but does not resist a dig at his predecessor as he raises it to a more ‘realistic level’. He commits to no further welfare cuts than those already announced but the retention of a cap will dash the hopes of those MPs, including some Tories, who want him to reverse cuts to universal credit. Infrastructure £23bn national productivity investment fund over five years. RM: The chancellor is channelling Gordon Brown and Ed Balls as he focuses heavily on solving the productivity problem that means UK output lags behind those of other developed nations. There are few details yet on how this will be distributed but Hammond says the aim is a ‘high-wage, high-skill economy that will deliver higher living standards’. Housing White paper to be published. Unlock land for housing. £2.3bn housing infrastructure fund to create 100,000 new homes in areas of high demand. £1.4bn to construct 40,000 affordable homes. Pilot of right to buy for housing association tenants. RM: Successive chancellors have tried to give a boost to housebuilding but Hammond has had a very positive reception from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, who say this plan means he has listened to calls for more housing for rent and affordable homes to buy. Transport: road and rail £1.1bn in English local networks. £200m for traffic pinch-points. £450m for digital signalling on trains. £390m for low-emissions vehicles. RM: This appears to be part of the way Hammond is aiming to address productivity problems, as workers and businesses are hampered by poor transport links. Digital infrastructure 100% business rate relief on new fibre infrastructure. £1bn for broadband. RM: Again, Hammond is prioritising infrastructure aimed at improving business output. Money is going towards ‘hyper-fast’ broadband, although some may be frustrated that millions of rural households still do not have good connectivity. Exports and small firms Double export finance capacity. £400m for the British business bank to invest in fintech (financial innovation) firms. RM: Innovation is another big theme of this autumn statement, with Hammond stressing the need for long-term investment in industries for the future. English regions £1.8bn from the local growth fund to go to regions. New borrowing powers for local authorities. RM: Local authorities will welcome more money for infrastructure. Councils are also getting more devolved powers, including control over the adult education budget. However, with this control comes greater responsibility for carrying out cuts. Rest of UK More than £250m to the Northern Ireland executive. £400m to the Welsh government. £800m to the Scottish government. Wentworth Woodhouse Gets £7.6m grant. RM: This is a naked piece of political mudslinging as Hammond spends several minutes extolling the greatness of the mansion that inspired Jane Austen’s Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice, which he claims was threatened by opencast mining nearby that was authorised by a previous Labour government. However desperate the need for repairs, there may be eyebrows raised at the sum going to the house and prominence given to one residence during Hammond’s short speech. NHS spending £10bn of additional funding a year by the end of 2020-21. RM: This is simply meeting a pledge made under David Cameron but there is a lot of analysis suggesting it will not be enough, especially given the pressure that social care cuts are putting on the NHS. Spending cuts £3.5bn of cuts as previously announced but Ministry of Justice to get funding for more prison officers. RM: May’s government has clearly anticipated a problem in prisons that could quickly spiral further out of control, and acted to put more money into prison safety. Libor fines and tampon tax £102m from Libor fines to be given to army charities. £3m from the tampon tax for Comic Relief to go to women’s charities. Corporation tax Fall to 17% as planned by 2020. RM: Some had interpreted Theresa May’s comments that she wanted the UK to have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20 as a sign that she could slash it as low as 15% – the rate promised by the US president-elect, Donald Trump. However, Hammond has held off for now. Insurance premium tax Rise to 12% in June from 10%. Crackdown on fraudulent whiplash claims to save £40 on car insurance. RM: The crackdown on fraudulent whiplash claims was a widely trailed measure aimed at helping ‘just about managing’ families. But it looks like this could be offset at least partially by the higher consumer tax on insurance premiums. Employee perks Salary sacrifice schemes to be scaled back, with some exceptions such as cycling schemes. RM: This is a revenue raiser for the Treasury as employers will have to pay national insurance on benefits like mobile phone contracts and gym membership. Experts suggest the incentive for businesses to offer work perks will plummet. Tax avoidance Raise £2bn over the forecast period, £630m from targeting schemes such as the flat rate VAT scheme and use of employee shareholder status. There will also be a new penalty for repeated use of tax avoidance schemes. RM: Another year, another crackdown on tax avoidance. The measure is a good one though. It is specifically aimed at closing down the scheme the Guardian exposed last week where employment agencies make windfalls by exploiting the flat rate scheme. National insurance From April 2017 align the employee and employer NI thresholds at £157 per week. RM: This will raise a significant amount for the Treasury and cost employers on average £7.18 per worker. This is because the earnings threshold above which a business has to pay NI contributions will not rise with inflation but a modest £1 next year, bringing it into line with the threshold for employees. Tax thresholds Plan remains to raise the tax-free allowance from £11,000 to £11,500 in April and £12,500 by 2020. Hammond reiterates commitment to raise the top threshold to £50,000. RM: Hammond built this passage up so much that it sounded like he was about to announce another big rise in the personal allowance. However, he is simply confirming Osborne’s previous pledges. National living wage Rise from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour in April. RM: This was another widely trailed policy. It will be good news for workers on minimum wage jobs but the rise is not big enough to keep pace with Osborne’s promise that the rate will reach £9 by 2020. Benefits The taper rate at which universal credit is withdrawn as earnings rise to be reduced from 65p to 63p at a cost of £1bn from April. RM: This is designed to incentivise people on part-time jobs to increase their hours, as it will slow the rate at which in-work benefits are withdrawn for those on universal credit. It has been welcomed by campaigners as a first step, but Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, has said it does not go far enough. Consumers Ban letting agency fees. Keep close watch on retail energy market. Ban pensions cold-calling. RM: This is an agenda to help the ‘squeezed middle’ that could have been outlined by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband. In fact, when Miliband proposed the ban on letting agency fees, the Conservatives claimed it would lead to higher rents and less choice for tenants. Savers New NS&I bond offering 2.2% interest rate on three-year product, to be announced in the budget. RM: This may be the help for savers that Theresa May hinted at in her Conservative conference speech when she claimed savings were being eroded by monetary policy. That appeared to be an unprecedented intervention in the activities of the Bank of England. However, she might simply have had this retail offering from the government in mind. Fuel duty Cancelled for the seventh consecutive year. RM: It is becoming quite politically impossible for a chancellor to raise fuel duty, given the annual pressure against any more rises from Tory backbenchers and the rightwing press. Abolishing the autumn statement (sort of) Budget to be moved to the autumn from March. There will be a spring statement. RM: Hammond has a reputation for being dull but this seemed to be an attempt at a dry joke. He announced dramatically that he was about to abolish the autumn statement, giving the impression he was about to resign, before simply switching to an autumn budget and spring statement. The spring statement will no longer be a major fiscal event but a response to economic forecasts produced twice a year by the OBR."
2016-11-23T14:45:28Z,uk-news,UK news,London mayor urged to act over tower that 'compromises' St Paul's view,"Sadiq Khan is being urged to halt the construction of a skyscraper because it mars a centuries-old view of St Paul’s Cathedral. Conservationists are calling on the London mayor to take action against a 42-storey tower in Stratford, east London, which they say damages the view of Sir Christopher Wren’s landmark from King Henry’s Mound in Richmond Park.
The charity Friends of Richmond Park has written to Khan urging him to halt the construction of Manhattan Loft Gardens, designed by SOM and described on its website as “Europe’s most ambitious residential tower”. It comprises three extensive sky gardens, a 145-bedroom hotel, almost 250 residential units, and retail and restaurant space.
The charity said current planning rules should have protected the view, which has existed for more than 300 years and draws crowds of visitors to Richmond Park. Under the capital’s overarching planning document the London Plan, the London view management framework (LVMF) states that any development in the background of St Paul’s should be “subordinate to the cathedral and that the clear sky background profile of the upper part of the dome remains”. However, photographs released by Friends of Richmond Park show that the emerging skyscraper in Stratford is clearly visible behind the cathedral.
The charity said on its website: “The new development clearly and substantially compromises the profile of the whole of the dome of St Paul’s and, for almost the entire east side of the building, the clear sky background is obliterated.”Its chairman, Ron Crompton, said in a statement: “It is a tragedy that such a wonderful and iconic protected view, between two of London’s most historic landmarks and created over 300 years ago, should be destroyed not just for today but for many years to come.” Crompton’s letter to Khan calls for an urgent investigation into how GLA officers allowed the proposal to win planning, in contravention of the LVMF. He has also called for the housing and planning minister Gavin Barwell to ensure that future applications relating to the sight line are referred to English Heritage and the mayor.
Historic England, the UK’s statutory adviser on heritage, has also protested against the development and said it was not consulted. Its London planning director, Emily Gee, told the Architects’ Journal (AJ): “In the wrong places, tall buildings can do serious, irrevocable harm to important views and the special character of London. “We are very concerned that this has happened and see it as a failing of the current approach to the planning for tall buildings.” The AJ reports that the planning application for the tower was referred to the GLA in 2010 by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), which was acting as the planning authority in the run-up to the London Olympics. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan Loft Corporation told the Guardian the developer went through a transparent and public process to gain planning permission, adding that that maps of the LVMF protected view indicated that the background area to be protected beyond St Paul’s was 3km (1.86 miles) long whereas its tower was 7km (4.35 miles) beyond. “Throughout the planning process we found the GLA and all the other planning bodies to be very supportive for such an aspirational residential project,” the spokeswoman said. “As planning approval was achieved [on] 18 July 2011, we were never asked about the LVMF background view impact. “However, SOM has a long history of working with the St Paul’s view corridors and the more recent London Plan LVMF document. “We would recommend that the King Henry VIII’s Mound also be illustrated as seen from the naked eye where the distance to St Paul’s Cathedral is 15.5km (and Manhattan Loft Gardens is an additional 7km beyond).” A spokesman for Khan said: “We are currently looking into the issues involved with this development.”"
2016-11-23T15:14:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond admits Brexit vote means £122bn extra borrowing,"Philip Hammond has admitted that the Brexit vote’s blow to the economy would force the government to borrow £122bn more than hoped as he pushed back government plans to balance the books in his autumn statement. In the government’s first major economic announcement since the vote in June to leave the EU, the new chancellor said the economy was faring well in the wake of the referendum result but growth would slow markedly next year on the back of weaker business spending and a squeeze on household budgets from rising living costs. “Our task now is to prepare our economy to be resilient as we exit the EU and match-fit for the transition that will follow,” said Hammond, who replaced George Osborne as chancellor in the political crisis that followed the referendum. Labour said Hammond’s statement was an admission that the government’s long-term economic plan had failed. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said it showed “the abject failure of the last six wasted years”.
Hammond began his speech with a robust defence of the economy’s performance following the 23 June referendum, saying it had “confounded commentators at home and abroad with its strength and resilience since the British people decided, exactly five months ago today, to leave the European Union and chart a new future for our country”. But the chancellor soon began outlining a very different picture, saying the government had “more work to do to eliminate the deficit”.
Hammond dropped Osborne’s target for a surplus on the public finances by the end of the decade but announced his own fiscal rules that kept a focus on bringing down borrowing over a longer period. He unveiled three new rules of his own: for borrowing to be below 2% of GDP by the end of the parliament; for public sector net debt to be falling by the same time; and for welfare spending to remain within an OBR-monitored cap. The economy would grow 2.1% this year, faster than the 2.0% forecast in March, Hammond said as he unveiled a new outlook from the the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). But the growth forecast for next year was cut to 1.4% from 2.2%.
“That’s slower, of course, than we would wish, but still equivalent to the IMF’s forecast for Germany, and higher than the forecast for growth in many of our European neighbours, including France and Italy,” Hammond said. That slowdown would have a knock-on effect on the government’s finances and so borrowing was expected to be significantly higher than at the time of Osborne’s final budget back in March. The OBR now expects government borrowing this financial year alone will be £68.2bn, well above the previous estimate of £55.5bn. A forecast for the public finances to be back in surplus by the end of the decade was abandoned and in total the new forecasts amount to £122bn of extra borrowing over the next five years compared with the outlook before Britain voted to leave the EU. “In view of the uncertainty facing the economy, and in the face of slower growth forecasts, we no longer seek to deliver a surplus in 2019-20,” said Hammond. “But the prime minister and I remain firmly committed to seeing the public finances return to balance as soon as practicable, while leaving enough flexibility to support the economy in the near term.” Hammond used his his first set-piece speech as chancellor to announce measures to drive up the UK’s woeful productivity growth with a £23bn innovation fund and investment in rail, telecoms and housing. There were also giveaways for “just managing families” and relief for motorists hit by rising pump prices as Hammond cancelled a planned rise in fuel duty.
He announced, as expected, an increase in the “national living wage” from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour from April 2017. That is slightly below the £7.60 figure that the OBR estimates would be necessary for it to stay on course to match the pledge of £9 an hour by 2020. He confirmed widely trailed plans for a ban on letting fees and a package of support to encourage the construction of new affordable homes. The chancellor said the government’s independent watchdog, the OBR was now forecasting a weaker outlook than at the time of March’s budget. Its main predictions, compared with before the Brexit vote, are now: Extra £122bn of government borrowing over next five years. Public finances no longer expected to be back in surplus by 2019-20. Economy to grow 1.4% in 2017, compared with 2.2% forecast in March. Economy to grow 1.7% in 2018, compared with 2.1% forecast in March. Economy to grow 2.1% in 2019, compared with 2.1% forecast in March. The forecast for growth of 1.4% next year compares with a Bank of England prediction of 1.4% and an IMF forecast for 1.1% growth. The OBR’s new outlook painted a more benign picture on the prospects for inflation next year and beyond than some other forecasters have done. It predicts inflation will rise from 0.7% this year to 2.3% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. That compares with the Bank of England’s forecasts for inflation of 2.7% in 2017 and in 2018. The OBR forecasts unemployment will edge up from 5% this year to 5.2% next year and 5.5% in 2018.
Summing up the government’s latest plans, the OBR said: “Confronted by a near-term economic slowdown and a structural deterioration in the public finances, the government has opted neither for a large near-term fiscal stimulus nor for more austerity over the medium term.” In one potentially significant move for the future, Hammond indicated a possible end to the “triple lock” that guarantees pensions always rise by whatever is the highest of the rate of inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%. This would remain in place for this parliament, along with guarantees on spending for defence and foreign aid, the chancellor said. He added: “But as we look ahead to the next parliament, we will need to ensure that we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability. “So the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next parliament in the light of the evolving fiscal position at the next spending review.” While Hammond began the speech with a promise of no “rabbits from hats”, he ended on one surprise – announcing that his first autumn statement would also be his last. The 2017 budget would be the last held in spring, with the event moving to autumn from 2018, he said. There would be a spring statement, but this would be a lower-key update on forecasts, rather than a time for major changes.
The chancellor belied his sober reputation with a series of jokes, one aimed at Boris Johnson’s failure to become prime minister. More predictably, he also took aim at the pre-statement requests of McDonnell. Hammond contrasted these with the efforts of the former shadow chancellor turned Strictly Come Dancing favourite Ed Balls. “We used to think on this side of the house that Ed Balls’ demands were an extreme example,” Hammond said. “But I have to say, the current shadow chancellor has outperformed him in the fiscal incontinence sweepstakes. What we don’t know, of course, is whether he can also dance.” Responding to the statement, McDonnell said the chancellor was offering “no hope for the future”. “The verdict could not be clearer – the so-called long-term economic plan has failed,” the shadow chancellor said. “As the Treasury’s own leaked paper revealed, the government knew it had failed before the referendum result was announced. We now face Brexit, the greatest economic challenge of a generation, and we face it unprepared and ill-equipped.” The government had “no answers to the challenges facing our country following Brexit, and no vision to secure our future prosperity,” McDonnell said. He added: “The chancellor must now do the right thing for British workers and businesses. He must insist on full, tariff-free access to the single market. He and the Treasury know that’s what will give the best deal for jobs and prosperity here. “It may not be in the chancellor’s nature, but in the national interest I urge him to stand up to the prime minister and the extreme Brexit fanatics in her cabinet.”"
2016-11-23T16:17:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond's autumn statement is a welcome reality check,"Philip Hammond’s message was stark and clear. The result of the EU referendum in June means the economy has arrived at a reality checkpoint. Deep-seated weaknesses will be exposed as the government negotiates a Brexit divorce between now and 2019. The chancellor was candid about Britain’s woefully poor productivity record. He admitted that infrastructure was deficient. There was no attempt to disguise the fact that there is a prosperity gap between London and other major cities. He used his autumn statement to address some of these long-term issues rather than to provide immediate help to the “just about managing” households, the so-called Jams, championed by the prime minister.
To be sure, there was the pre-announced increase in the national living wage, the inevitable freezing of fuel duties for a seventh straight year and a change to universal credit to make the cuts announced by his predecessor less severe. Most of George Osborne’s welfare savings will go ahead, however, with Hammond deciding the best way to help the Jams is through an economy that generates higher-paid jobs.
He has also left money in the bank in case he needs it during what are certain to be tricky times for the economy during the two-year article 50 process. In all, Hammond announced that borrowing will be £122bn higher over the next five years than the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted in March. In part, that’s down to growth being less tax-rich than previously thought. Britain has been good at creating low-skilled employment, but members of the precariat don’t earn enough to pay all that much tax. The overshoot is also driven by the increases in infrastructure spending Hammond announced. These are modest given the backlog of work that needs to be done, but welcome nevertheless. The chancellor has also left himself a sizeable amount of wriggle room should the economy’s slowdown over the next two years prove more pronounced than the OBR fears. The OBR thinks the economy will grow by 1.4% in 2017 and 1.7% in 2018, down from the 2.2% and 2.1% respectively it pencilled in at the time of the March budget. Inflation is predicted to be 0.7 percentage points higher at 2.3% next year.
The figures could prove wrong, perhaps significantly so, which is why Hammond has made contingencies. By ditching Osborne’s plan to run a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, he has given himself scope to borrow £56bn more in 2021 than under the pre-referendum plans. Of that, around £20bn will be absorbed by slower growth and just under £10bn has been spent on the measures in the autumn statement. That leaves £26.5bn as a rainy day fund in case the economy performs less well than forecast or he wants to provide more giveaways. That’s a smart move. In the current circumstances, economic forecasting is even more of a mug’s game than usual."
2016-11-23T16:49:24Z,uk-news,UK news,UK government right to refuse release of secret documents - high court,"The government can keep secret “super-sensitive” documents from Britain’s spy agencies that might shed light on the mystery death of a fugitive Russian, the high court has ruled. Justice Cranston upheld an application by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, who is refusing to release documents from MI5 and MI6 concerning Alexander Perepilichnyy, who collapsed and died in November 2012 outside his home in Weybridge, Surrey. Surrey police have said there was nothing suspicious about the death of the 44-year-old, who had been out jogging. They were unable to find a cause. However, in 2015 it emerged that traces of a rare and deadly plant poison, Gelsemium elegans, were found in Perepilichnyy’s stomach. The poison has been used by Russian and Chinese assassins, a hearing was told. The judge said he could not see “cogent or solid reasons” for rejecting the government’s application for “public interest immunity” or PII. He said he agreed with the home secretary’s view that disclosing the intelligence files would cause “real and significant damage to national security”. Cranston added that the position of the coroner, Richard Travers, who had brought the application to see the secret evidence was “now untenable”. But the government had refused, merely showing him a “gist” or vague summary of its contents. The ruling comes after an unusual one-day hearing at the high court. The judge heard some of the case in public, before considering the unknown secret material in a closed session. Travers will now be replaced by another coroner who has gone through direct vetting and is security-cleared, the judge indicated. The new coroner will be allowed to see the “sensitive material” before a three-week inquest takes place in March, he added, at a court in Woking. The judgment is likely to dismay several of the participants in the inquest who opposed the home secretary’s secrecy application. They have pointed out that the official position is baffling. The government is refusing to release sensitive files in the case of a man who – according to Surrey police – wasn’t murdered. The Guardian argued that there was an overwhelming public interest in transparency, given the fact that several high-profile Russians have died in recent years on UK soil. The judge said the newspaper’s submissions were “invaluable” in resolving what he called “this very difficult application”. The ruling comes on the 10th anniversary of the murder in November 2006 of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, killed with a radioactive cup of polonium tea. It follows a warning by Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, that Russia is aggressively using propaganda, espionage and subversion across both Europe and the UK. In the run-up to his death, Perepilichnyy received many death threats. He revealed details of a $230m (£160m) fraud carried out by a Russian crime gang with links to the Kremlin. The money was stolen from taxes paid by the investment company Hermitage Capital to the Russian treasury. Perepilichnyy shared this information with Swiss prosecutors. They had frozen several Swiss bank accounts involved in the fraud. Shortly before he died, Perepilichnyy – who had fled to the UK from Moscow – took out life insurance worth £2m. Perepilichnyy’s stomach contents were thrown away after an inconclusive autopsy."
2016-11-23T16:54:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Port's freedom to kill raises difficult questions for the Met,"All of Stephen Port’s four victims were young, gay men. They all died from an overdose of the date-rape drug “liquid ecstasy” – GHB or G. All four were found near Port’s home; three in a churchyard 400 metres away, and one outside the communal entrance to his flat. All were propped against a wall in the same sitting position. All had signs of having been dragged there. All were missing their mobile phones. All but one were found with a little bottle of liquid ecstasy. Three were found over a four-month period.
To believe the deaths to be unfortunate coincidence offended common sense, the jury heard. Yet that was initially perceived to have been the case. Port remained at large after police failed to spot striking similarities in the victims’ deaths. Missed opportunities by detectives – who had arrested Port for lying after the first body was found – may have led them earlier to the door of his one-bedroomed flat in Barking, east London. The deaths were originally investigated by Barking and Dagenham borough police, though after the fourth the inquiry was taken over by the Met’s homicide and major crime unit. Aware of the “potential vulnerabilities” in its response to the deaths, the Met has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). As that IPCC investigation continues, it is likely to be asked to examine whether the force was influenced by institutional homophobia, or blinded by prejudice towards the underground culture of promiscuity and risk-taking the case exposed.
Detectives had Port in their sights, questioning him over the lies he told over the first death, in June 2014. Yet he slipped through their grasp and went on to kill three more times. Port’s first brush with police was three weeks before his first killing in June 2014. The 41-year-old chef was seen helping to walk a young man to Barking station. The victim, 23, was shouting incoherently, vomiting, and could barely walk before he collapsed at the railway station where staff called an ambulance and police. British Transport police interviewed both men. Port told them he had found the man in that state outside his flat, and brought him to the station to make sure he got home safely. As no allegation against him was made, Port was allowed to leave.
Three weeks later, on 19 June, Anthony Walgate, 23, a fashion student and occasional male escort, was found outside the communal entrance to Port’s flat. Port had made the 999 call without giving his name. Walgate had clearly been dead for some time. His top was pulled up, as though he had been dragged to the spot, his underwear was in disarray and the zip on his jeans was undone. In a black holdall, police found liquid ecstasy, but no phone. The cause of death was GHB intoxication.
When officers worked out it was Port who made the emergency call they found him asleep in bed. He gave various explanations. The first was he had returned home from his nightshift, found Walgate unconscious, thought he was drunk or suffered a seizure, propped him up, dialled 999 and then gone to bed. It was exactly the same scenario he had given police three weeks earlier at Barking station. Here was another young man Port had just happened upon outside his flat. When police discovered he had hired Walgate as a male escort for the night, Port changed his story. Now, he said, Walgate had taken drugs himself and become ill. Port had woken to find him cold and rigid and, not wanting to believe he was dead, had taken him outside and called an ambulance. Asked why he moved him, he said he panicked because “if he’s dead, they’re gonna think I murdered him”. Port was charged with perverting the course of justice by making a false police statement, and released on bail. He would plead guilty to the charge in court on 23 March 2015 – but by then two more young men were dead.
Ten weeks later, on 28 August, Barbara Denham, a Barking resident walking her dog, found the body of Gabriel Kovari. The 22-year-old, originally from Slovakia, had linked up with Port online and visited his flat five days previously. Port told friends he was his “new Slovakian twink flatmate”. Later, he told the same friends, Kovari had gone off with another man, a “soldier guy”. Kovari was found in Abbey Green, an area of parkland 400 metres from Port’s flat that contains St Margaret’s church, a graveyard and the ruins of Barking abbey. His body was propped against the perimeter wall of the graveyard, an area not covered by CCTV. His upper clothes had ridden up as though he had been dragged. There was no mobile phone. Cause of death was given as mixed drugs toxicity, including GHB and mephedrone (known as M or meow meow). The death was treated as “non-suspicious but unexplained”. Despite the similarities, no connection was made to Walgate’s death 10 weeks previously. Three weeks later on 20 September, Denham was once again out walking her dog by the graveyard when she came across a second body. “I saw him there and thought it cannot be the same thing again, in exactly the same place, lying in exactly the same position,” she told the court.
Daniel Whitworth, 21, a chef from Gravesend in Kent, had chatted online with Port before going to his flat on 18 September. Almost in exactly the same location, propped in a seated position, his clothing ridden up as though he had been dragged, Whitworth was found with a small bottle of liquid ecstasy and no phone. High levels of GHB and antihistamine found in Nytol sleeping tablets were found in his blood. It seems even Port was concerned that two bodies in three weeks might look suspicious. So on this occasion he placed a fake suicide note in Whitworth’s left hand. The note claimed Whitworth had killed himself because he felt guilty at killing Kovari by giving him an accidental overdose of GHB during sex. Two elements of the note were extremely odd. It included the sentence: “BTW, please do not blame the guy I was with last night, we only had sex, then I left. He knows nothing of what I have done.” It added: “I dropped my phone on the way here so it should be in the grass somewhere.”
If Port was concerned his DNA could be found on Whitworth – and his semen was on the bedsheet in which Whitworth was wrapped – he need not have worried. Police took the note at “face value”, the prosecution said, and did not investigate further. “In particular, Daniel’s movements prior to his death were not checked, and no attempt was made to trace the person referred to in the note as ‘the guy I was with last night’,” said Jonathan Rees QC. Had they done so, detectives would have discovered it was Port, a man already known to them. As for the reference to dropping his phone, police did not appear to consider that an unusual observation in a suicide note. No phone was found. Shortly after the two men were found, a senior officer reassured the local newspaper that although the deaths were “unusual and slightly confusing”, there was nothing to suggest they were suspicious. Port must have been hugely relieved when, in June 2015, the note was accepted as fact at an inquest for the two men, headlined in the Barking and Dagenham Post as “Double drug overdose killed Barking lovers found in church grounds”. An open verdict was recorded. Only months later, following the death of a fourth young man, did handwriting experts examining the suicide note conclude it was written by Port and on paper from a pad found at his flat. On 25 March 2015 Port pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook crown court and was sentenced to eight months for making a false statement in relation to Walgate’s death. He was released with an electronic tag less than three months later on 4 June. As details of the eight young men who survived their encounters with him illustrated to the court, in the time between Port’s first known victim to his last he surfed websites, hooked up on gay apps and continued to administer GHB to unsuspecting young men he raped, videoing some of them unconscious as he had sex with them. Port’s apparent freedom to pursue his victims will raise difficult questions for the Met, which has faced criticism in the past over its handling of murders in the LGBT community. In 2007, a review of 10 murders of gay men or transsexuals said in some cases police inquiries were hampered by lack of knowledge, reliance on unfounded stereotypes and personal prejudices. The report, written by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender advisory group, did acknowledge the force had substantially improved its dealings with those communities, but warned more radical steps were needed.
Jack Taylor, 25, a forklift driver who lived with his parents in Dagenham, east London, and who was yet to come out as a gay man, hooked up with Port on the Grindr app in the early hours of 13 September 2015. Less than 36 hours later he was found by a refuse collector, propped up in the same grounds, his shirt riding up above his stomach as though dragged, a small bottle of GHB nearby, and his phone missing. He died from a mixed drug and alcohol overdose. On this occasion, CCTV at Barking station, where Port met Taylor’s taxi, captured the two men walking towards Port’s flat. On 15 October 2015, Port was finally arrested. The question police must answer now is why had it taken so long. Peter Tatchell, LGBT rights campaigner, said of the police investigation: “If four young middle-class women had been murdered in Mayfair, I believe the police would have made a public appeal much sooner and mounted a far more comprehensive investigation. The killing of low-income gay men in working-class Barking was treated very differently. Police officers stand accused of class, gender and sexuality bias. “Although police relations with the LGBT community are vastly better than two decades ago, this case is a wakeup call regarding the ongoing slapdash, negative attitudes and behaviour of some officers in some police districts”."
2016-11-23T17:06:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Profiles of Stephen Port's victims,"Anthony Walgate An aspiring fashion designer from Hull, Walgate, 23, occasionally worked as a male escort and featured on the website Sleepyboys. He was a popular and talented second year fashion student at Middlesex University. Friends said he was “choosy” about his clients and turned down jobs he felt were risky.
His mother vented her anger and frustration at the police investigation nine months after his death, telling her local paper she had been given no information about why Stephen Port had been arrested at the time. Port was later jailed for eight months for lying about how he found Walgate’s body. Gabriel Kovari The 22-year-old had left Slovakia because he felt people were “conservative and intolerant”, and briefly worked in a Slovakian shop in London.
In a statement to his inquest, his mother, a pharmacist, and brother, described him as a gifted artist who wanted to make a difference. “He was full of love and care for others,” and loved the company of his friends, they said, adding that he “had been a very inquisitive and special child, gifted in arts”. Daniel Whitworth The 21-year-old from Gravesend, Kent, was “an active and intelligent outdoors boy who loved days on his bike exploring leafy byways”, his father, Adam Whitworth, told the inquest into his son’s death. “Those who knew him were shocked by this terrible news.”
The former Dartford grammar school student loved his job as a chef at One Moorgate Place and Canary Wharf in London, and was passionate about cooking. He had been in a relationship with a live-in boyfriend for three years, and his friends insisted he would never have taken his own life. Jack Taylor The 25-year-old lived with his parents in Dagenham, east London, and worked as a forklift truck driver at a warehouse for the company London City Bond. He was not “out” as a gay man.
He was a regular at the Trades Hall club in Dagenham, where he had spent Saturday night before returning home, calling a minicab and travelling to meet Port in Barking in the early hours after online contact. CCTV footage released by police of the two men walking from the station at 3am helped lead to Port’s eventual arrest."
2016-11-23T17:22:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Port convicted of murder of four men,"A chef who drugged, raped and killed four young men after using a string of fake online dating profiles to lure them to his flat has been found guilty of murder. A Old Bailey jury convicted the serial killer Stephen Port on Wednesday of the murder of four men after drugging them so he could satisfy his appetite for sex with unconscious boyish-looking men. Port, 41, of Barking in east London, killed Anthony Walgate, a 23-year-old fashion student from Hull; Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia; Daniel Whitworth, a 21-year-old chef; and Jack Taylor, a 25-year-old forklift truck driver.
Despite striking similarities between the four killings, which were carried out over 15 months, police failed to link them. Three of them were carried out over a four-month period. All four men died from overdoses of the date-rape drug GHB, also known as G or liquid ecstasy. The body of Walgate, Port’s first victim in June 2014, was found just outside the communal entrance to his one-bedroom flat. The other three were discovered in a churchyard near his home. All were propped up in a sitting position, with signs they had been dragged there. None had their mobile phones. Port was convicted of 22 offences against 11 men, including four murders, four rapes, four assaults by penetration and 10 of administering a substance. He was cleared on three counts of rape.
Scotland Yard has admitted “potential opportunities” were missed and that investigators who failed to see “striking similarities” between the deaths had only patchy knowledge of the use of drugs linked to the gay sex scene. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an investigation, and will examine whether homophobia played a part. Seventeen police officers are facing investigation for possible misconduct over the catalogue of failures in catching Port. The Metropolitan police is now re-examining 58 unexplained deaths involving the drug GHB from a four-year period across London in case signs of suspicious death were missed. Commander Stuart Cundy, who leads the Met’s specialist crime and operations command, said: “We can’t rule out the fact there may be other victims out there who suffered at Port’s hands and have yet to come forward. We would appeal for them to contact us as soon as possible.” He said he could not say “categorically that lives could have been saved or other victims protected. All I can say is from the evidence we’ve heard at trial there were potential opportunities that were missed. The IPCC investigation will carefully consider those”. Cundy said it was not appropriate to pre-empt the IPCC’s findings, but that actions had already been taken “in areas where we know we could have done better”. He is to write personally to the families to apologise for “missed opportunities to catch Port sooner”. He also offered to meet them. The IPCC appealed for witnesses to come forward. Its commissioner, Cindy Butts, said: “It is important we establish whether the police response to the deaths of all four men was thorough and appropriate in the circumstances, including whether discrimination played any part in actions and decisions..” The family of Taylor, the fourth man to be killed, plan to sue the force and believe Port would not have been stopped if they had not fought for a full investigation.
Taylor’s sisters, Donna and Jenny, said of the police investigation: “We just think they thought Jack was gay and a druggie, and that was it. “If it had been a woman, then more would have been done. We had to fight from the beginning. We kept pushing for an investigation.” On Wednesday, the family said they felt only hatred for Port, who showed no remorse and had spun a web of lies. “He’s very cold. Knowing we are all sitting there and going through his stories is just very cruel,” they said. Police arrested Port in June 2014 for lying over the death of Walgate, whom he had hired as an escort for the night. They charged him with perverting the course of justice and released him on bail. He went on to kill Kovari and Whitworth in August and September, the court heard. The killings were driven by his fetish for sex with younger gay men drugged unconscious, an appetite fuelled by drug-rape pornography. He met his victims via apps such as Grindr, expressing a sexual preference for young, slim, boyish-looking men known as “twinks”. Once at his flat, he drugged them with GHB by spiking their drinks or injecting them in the anus. Eight men who survived encounters with Port gave evidence during his trial. On some occasions, he filmed himself having sex. Port, a chef at a bus depot in West Ham who appeared on the BBC’s Celebrity MasterChef serving meatballs when the programme was filmed at his work canteen, described himself as “100% gay”. He was prolific on gay dating sites where he hooked up with much younger men, often using false names and fake profile pictures and claiming to be many years younger than he was. Self-conscious about his looks, he wore a blond toupee to cover his baldness. In March 2015, Port was found to have made a false statement to police about finding Walgate collapsed outside his flat when in fact he had died inside. He was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice, but then released on an electronic tag in June. He killed Taylor in September.
Kovari had been staying for a few days at Port’s flat, and his body was found by a dog-walker in St Margaret’s graveyard in Barking on 28 August 2014. The same dog walker found Whitworth’s body in the same location three weeks later. Taylor’s body was also found in St Margaret’s graveyard. Port was arrested a month later in October 2015, after CCTV footage showed him walking toward his flat with Taylor in the early hours of the morning on the day he disappeared. A fake suicide note found on Whitworth’s body, which said he had killed himself in guilt over having accidentally given Kovari an overdose of GHB during sex, was accepted at “face value” by police, who did not investigate further, the court heard. It was subsequently found to have been written by Port. Whitworth’s stepmother, Mandy Pearson, said the family had endured unspeakable grief and would continue to press investigators. “The fight goes on until all our questions are answered,” she said. Eight other victims who survived encounters with Port told of drinks being spiked, or of him using a syringe to inject drugs into their anuses. Police retrieved 83 videos from Port’s phone, six of which showed him having sex with unconscious men. DCI Tim Duffield, who led the successful homicide investigate, described Port as a “probably one of the most dangerous individuals I have encountered” and a “voracious sexual predator” who was “highly devious, manipulative and self-obsessed”. “Throughout both the criminal investigation, many days of police interviews and during the course of a long trial, he has never once shown a shred of remorse for his victims or indeed their families.,” he said. Port met his victims via social media. Investigators found at least 25 accounts that he had used with different names and examined 100 media devices as part of the inquiry. The case highlights the potential dangers on using apps to meet strangers for sex, and police stressed that users should meet for the first time in a public place and not someone’s home, inform friends where they are going and be careful about what they eat or drink. Port denied all the charges against him . Described as quiet and withdrawn, he had been bullied at school and came out as gay to his family in his 20s, his sister Sharon told the court. She said it had upset their mother. He studied for a year at a local art college before having to leave because his parents could not afford the fees. He went on to work as a chef and catering manager, and his last job was as a stock-taker at local stores. He earned significant sums of money as an escort, charging £150 per hour or £350 for an overnight with “full service”, and enjoyed spending his earnings on sports cars, gadgets and Transformer toys, which he collected. He told the court he was aware of the dangers. “I would never accept a drink or anything to eat off a client, and I always took my own lube, condoms and poppers,” he said. Peter Tatchell, the human rights campaigner, said of the police investigation: “If four young middle class women had been murdered in Mayfair, I believe the police would have made a public appeal much sooner and mounted a far more comprehensive investigation. “The killing of low-income gay men in working-class Barking was treated very differently. Police officers stand accused of class, gender and sexuality bias.” The force’s appeal for public information in 2015 was a year too late and police let Port “slip through their fingers”, he said.. Friends of Kovari and Walgate raised concerns with the police at the time but “felt fobbed off ”, Tatchell said. A friend of Kovari’s had contacted the PinkNews website and the gay police monitoring unit Galop to ask them to press the Met for answers. “They did so, but were told by officers that it was not foul play and there was no serial killer,” he said. During his evidence, Port was accused of “playing God” with the lives of his victims and telling “lie after lie” about their deaths. “You just cannot bring yourself to accept the truth of what is going on here. To the families, lie after lie, that’s what is being played out here in this court,” the prosecutor, Jonathan Rees QC, said. Port admitted he had lied to police when questioned over the deaths. “The truth sounded like a lie, so I lied to make it sound like the truth,” he said. Port’s drug dealer, Peter Hirons, 48, who is believed to have unwittingly supplied him with the drugs used to kill at least one of his victims, was jailed at Snaresbrook crown court for two-and-a-half years earlier this month, it can now be reported. He had admitted six drugs charges and one of possession of criminal property."
2016-11-23T17:29:24Z,uk-news,UK news,What the chancellor gave the Jams … and what he took away,"The gains and losses for the “just about managing” households in the 2016 autumn statement. The gains Universal credit The chancellor said 3m households will be better off due to changes to universal credits, which he described as a “targeted tax cut worth £700m from 2021-22”. From April, the “taper rate” on universal credit will drop from 65% to 63%. Effectively this means those on low incomes can hold on to an extra 2p in every additional pound they earn. Minimum wage The “national living wage” will rise from £7.20 an hour to £7.50 an hour from April. Personal allowances The starting point for basic rate tax will rise from £11,000 to £11,500 from April 2017, with a promise to raise it to £12,500 by the end of the parliament in a pledge first set out by George Osborne. Petrol prices Fuel duty was frozen again, saving 2p a litre or £1.36 on filling the average tank. Letting fees Renters will save around £300 each from the ban on fees to tenants, plus there was a total £7.2bn package in measures to support housing.
The losses Work allowance This is the amount recipients of the universal credit can earn before their benefits start to be taken away, and Hammond continued with Osborne’s already-announced cuts. The £3bn in cuts far outweigh the £1bn giveaway from reducing the taper rate. A single parent with one child, earning £15,000 a year, will lose around £3,000 from the planned cuts, according to the Child Poverty Action Group. Children Universal credit will be limited to two children from April 2017. Housing support for under-21s within UC will also be removed from the same month. Neither were mentioned in the speech, as they were announced in 2015. Insurance tax The typical car insurance premium will rise by £10.70 a year, said the AA, after insurance premium tax was hiked to 12%. Buildings and contents cover will also increase in price."
2016-11-23T17:49:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-Barclays banker alleges unfair dismissal after interview with SFO,"A former senior Barclays banker claims he was unfairly dismissed after the Serious Fraud Office shared with his employer a 900-page transcript of interviews he gave to criminal investigators probing the bank, a tribunal has heard. Richard Boath, who until his dismissal earlier this year was Barclays’ co-head of global finance, gave a lengthy interview in March 2014. It took place as part of the SFO’s investigation into the bank’s £7.3bn emergency capital-raising in 2008, at the height of the banking crisis. The transcript was kept private for more than two years, but earlier this year it was shared with Barclays when the SFO used Boath’s interview to support an application for a warrant to search the bank. Jonathan Cohen QC, Boath’s lawyer, told a preliminary tribunal hearing in east London on Wednesday that his client had been pushed out after Barclays learned what Boath had told the SFO. “We say that Mr Boath’s position was severely jeopardised,” Cohen said. This was as a “direct result” of the SFO sharing a transcript of Boath’s interview. Cohen added: “He will say, ‘The reason I find myself out on my ear ... is because the SFO did that’.” The transcript is now the focus of a dispute about whether Boath’s forthcoming unfair dismissal case should be heard in private. At a preliminary hearing on Wednesday, lawyers for the Guardian and other media argued that the case should be heard in public. But lawyers for the SFO told the hearing that holding the tribunal in public would threaten the agency’s ongoing investigations and any potential prosecutions. They argued a public hearing raised the prospect of potential witnesses or defendants – who might feature in a future trial – learning the details of Boath’s SFO interviews and, as a result, amending their own statements. No charges have been brought by the SFO, which is focusing on allegations concerning certain fees paid in relation to Barclays’ deals in 2008 to raise capital from sovereign funds in Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Without this extra capital the bank would have been forced to accept a UK government bailout. Boath is seeking to make his employment claim against Barclays under whistleblower protection laws. If successful, the scale of any resulting award would be unlimited. Lawyers for the bank said Barclays did not accept Boath was a whistleblower. The tribunal heard Boath had been interviewed by the SFO under caution, a practice used for potential suspects. The preliminary tribunal hearing continues."
2016-11-23T17:55:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland's transport minister apologises to rail travellers,"Scotland’s embattled transport minister has apologised to passengers who have had “a bad experience on our railways” while insisting ScotRail had learned lessons as he made an emergency statement to Holyrood hours after Glasgow commuters faced severe disruption because of a damaged overhead power line. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government’s minister for transport and the islands, has come under increasing pressure in recent months as a catalogue of delays, overcrowding and disruption caused by major works from the Dutch-operated franchise has caused chaos across the country. Delivering an emergency statement on Wednesday afternoon, Yousaf was accused by critics of trying to avoid scrutiny while political attention was focused on the chancellor’s autumn statement in Westminster.
Yousaf, considered a rising star of Nicola Sturgeon’s administration, had been mocked as out of touch after claiming earlier this week that Scottish travellers were not experiencing a poor service in comparison with the rest of the UK, while train drivers’ union Aslef last week called for him to be sacked. The minister was then accused of trying to deflect attention from his own performance by announcing during a television interview on Sunday that he planned to invite unions and other political parties to talks on setting up a public sector train operator. Yousaf told Holyrood that while he did not intend to underplay the slide in service quality, overall performance for the last year – since Dutch firm Abellio took over the franchise – had been 89.8%, higher than the current UK average of 87%. He told MSPs: “The actions we are taking and the long-term transformation we have planned underlines this government’s commitment to improving the service received. That is why I instructed an improvement plan.” ScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below expected standards. Abellio took over the franchise last year on a 10-year, £6bn contract that includes a break clause that Yousaf has said he would consider invoking. Yousaf added: “We have accelerated £16m to upgrade key junctions, track and signalling equipment, for example at Glasgow central station. This week, points and circuits are being renewed at Cowlairs and Dunblane, while £14m is being spent to improve fleet reliability. “Overcrowding is frustrating, that is why, from mid-December, we have introduced more services to and from Inverness and are finalising details to provide more carriages on peaktime service on the Borders Railway.” The minister added that he stood by his invitation to discuss a not-for-profit bid for the franchise at a later date. But he faced further criticism as he set out a series of actions and investments, including 200 extra carriages by 2019 and 70 new electric trains from 2017 on the main Edinburgh–Glasgow route, none of which amounted to new announcements or involved fresh funding. Scottish Labour’s transport spokesperson, Neil Bibby, said: “Humza Yousaf had lots of promises to make about the future but very little to say about what action he was taking to deliver a better service for passengers now. What the minister announced today will do little to placate passengers facing a miserable commute this side of Christmas.” Calling on the minister to publish his improvement plan in full and make a commitment to when services would get better, Bibby added: “The facts are that Humza Yousaf demanded an improvement plan and then ScotRail services have become worse. His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions.” Abellio also hit back at suggestions that it was profiting from poor services. It made public an email it had sent to Bibby, which read: “All of that money has been reinvested in the franchise, so you will understand our frustration that this fact is occasionally misrepresented. The notion that money is somehow being spirited to the Netherlands is not true and we will robustly challenge any suggestion to the contrary.” Mike Connelly of Abellio UK told Bibby that the firm was dealing with a legacy of underinvestment and attempting to keep people moving at the same time. He added: “We believe it is unrealistic to expect the scale of infrastructure investment and modernisation to be undertaken (the largest of its kind since Victorian times) with little or no disruption to the travelling public.”"
2016-11-23T17:56:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Man is fined for punching five-day-old girl at Tesco,"A man who punched a five-day-old girl in the face at a supermarket has been fined after being convicted of assault. David Hardy, 64, was told to pay a total of £1,500 after hitting Elsie Temple as she lay asleep in her carry cot inside a trolley. The attack happened at a Tesco store when Elsie’s mother, Amy Duckers, beckoned to a friend to look at her “beautiful baby”. Duckers told the court Hardy had rushed over and punched her daughter with a “clenched fist”. She told Manchester magistrates court: “He came rushing up and as I looked over my shoulder he punched her in the face. I heard the slap of the punch as well. I said: ‘You have hit my baby,’ and he said: ‘No I didn’t.’” Duckers said Elsie had instantly cried out. The attack on 5 September happened in front of her older daughter, Libby Brown, seven, who was said to be hysterical and was heard asking: “Is she going to die?” Security guards at the supermarket in Baguley, Greater Manchester, summoned police and paramedics, the court heard. Elsie was taken to Wythenshawe hospital and kept in overnight. In a Facebook post that went viral, Duckers, a 27-year-old carer, described the attack and called Hardy “sick, twisted and vile”. She said the incident had left her “absolutely distraught”. Hardy, a company director, at first denied hitting the child before claiming he believed that she was a doll. He later apologised. In a police interview, Hardy said: “I saw a young girl hanging over the shopping trolley. I honestly thought it was her dolly. I said: ‘I’m going to wake your baby up.’ It looked like a doll to me. It wasn’t moving. I didn’t punch it; I just tapped it in its face.” He told the court that he curled in his fingers and “flicked” at what he thought was a doll. He added: “I thought I was just going to make the girl laugh. I don’t know why I thought that.” He added: “I can remember the mother crying and quite rightly so. I would be devastated myself. It was like a state of disbelief. Her husband came and I said: ‘I’m really sorry, pal.’” Hardy, who had pleaded not guilty to common assault, was fined £900, and ordered to pay £100 compensation and £500 towards prosecution costs. Elsie’s family reacted with fury in the public gallery when the district judge, Sam Goozee, announced he was prepared to fine the defendant rather than give him a community sentence. The judge said he accepted that the attack had been an isolated incident and “completely out of character”. Finding him guilty, Goozee told Hardy he found his explanation for the attack implausible. He said: “I’m satisfied, so that I’m sure, that at the point you struck out you did so … knowing Elsie was a baby, not a doll.”"
2016-11-23T18:00:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Hammond warned against Brexit and no one listened. Now it's payback,"“The economy is strong and resilient,” Philip Hammond began. Lurch’s face then cracked into a half smile. He’d been only kidding. The economy was actually in a complete mess and he couldn’t have been happier. He’d warned his colleagues of the dangers of Brexit and no one had bothered to listen. So now he was going to spell out the consequences to them and they’d just have to sit there and suck it up. The 10 cabinet members sitting alongside him all looked pretty pleased about it too; then they had also all voted to remain in the EU. Coincidence? Hardly. This autumn statement was to be a day of reckoning for the Brexiteers.
First in line was Boris Johnson. “I suspect I will be no more adept at pulling rabbits from hats than my successor as foreign secretary has been at retrieving balls from the back of scrums,” he sniggered. Lurch knew it was just gratuitous sadism to openly mock Boris’s hapless effort to become prime minister, but he was having too good a time to stop himself. Besides, Johnson had managed to annoy just about everyone in the cabinet over the past few months, so giving him a kicking now counts as a team-building exercise in the Tory party. Lurch then went on to list a litany of failure. Sterling depreciation. Growth slower than expected. Everything the last chancellor had done binned. The budget deficit up to £120bn. The cost of Brexit an extra £60bn. Tax receipts lower. Even the lazy French and Italians were more productive than us. “Members of the House may be interested to know ... ” he said. But they weren’t. At least not those on his own benches. They just wanted him to sit down and shut up as soon as possible. This occasion was meant to be an opportunity for the chancellor to boast how brilliant he had been. Not an excuse to admit that everything had gone badly wrong.
Having got most of the really bad news out the way, Lurch moved on to the merely bad news. Old infrastructure schemes that had already been announced got re-announced. The minimum wage was increased by less than the last chancellor had promised. People on welfare would still probably die; the only saving grace being that it might take them a little bit longer to do so. “I have deliberately avoided giving a long list of projects,” Lurch declared, apparently unaware he had just done so. Quite a lot escapes him. Half an hour into his speech, most of the House was nodding off. Lurch is one of the few politicians dull enough to make a death spiral sound boring, and vain enough not to notice. After ploughing through a particularly turgid passage in total silence, Lurch thought to interrupt himself. “That bit was complicated,” he said. “But it was actually good news.” Theresa gave him an embarrassed nudge. Lurch’s empathy skills have often left a little to be desired and he’d mistaken sleep for incomprehension.
By now the few Tory backbenchers who were still alive were getting desperate. They wanted something to cheer. Anything. So when Lurch announced he was going to hand over £7.5m to save Wentworth Woodhouse, an old pile near Rotherham, they became ecstatic. Getting over-excited about the survival of a stately home wasn’t really what they had had in mind, but it was the only orgasm on offer.
Too bad the “just about managings” wouldn’t have enough spare cash to go to visit the place when it was finally done up. There again, they probably wouldn’t want to anyway. “It is said to be the inspiration for Pemberley in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice,” Lurch had said. Only it wasn’t. Lurch had just gone and saved the wrong palace. Lurch lumbered slowly on, enjoying the looks of horror on his own side of the house. It was all going even better than he had planned. Most chancellors choose not to leak all their good news stories in advance and save one or two for the speech itself. But Lurch had out-thought everyone. For him the bad news was the good news. The country had voted for Brexit and the country could pay for it. For the next 10 years or longer. “I do have one last cunning plan,” Lurch said as he came to the final page. Some Tories perked up. Maybe there was to be salvation after all. “My cunning plan is to rename the autumn statement as the autumn budget and the spring budget as the spring statement.” Genius. Not with a bang but a whimper."
2016-11-23T18:01:49Z,uk-news,UK news,"Austerity, Brexit and 'Jams': readers react to the autumn statement","Philip Hammond’s autumn statement has given us a look into government’s post-Brexit plans for the economy.
We hear from readers - including those “just about managing” - on how the announced policies will impact their lives, alongside arguments on Brexit, austerity and whether Hammond’s plans mark a genuine departure from the Osborne era. Banning upfront letting agency fees
Widely trailed as a plan to help “just about managing’ familes, the government’s plan to ban spiralling letting agency fees will benefit renters if it is introduced as planned. But some readers were unconvinced that this would make much of a difference - echoing the view shared by housing minister Gavin Barwell just two months ago. Whilst Hammond’s planned intervention regarding estate agent fees is welcome, it will only offer short term relief in this unregulated sector. Estate agents will employ teams of lawyers to re-brand these fees and/or rise rents to plug the ‘shortfall’ they will incur. But more importantly, tenants will continue to be treated in a patronizing, heartless, and nakedly manipulative manner until the government learn that property exists to act as a home first and an asset second Joseph Dunne, 31, Walthamstow, London A rise in the national living wage from £7.20 an hour to £7.50
George Osborne’s ‘National Living Wage’ - not to be confused with what campaigners consider to be a genuine living wage - will be raised from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour in April. Although I have a degree and other professional qualifications, I am reduced to a minimum wage Saturday job as I have to care for my autistic 25-year-old son. My husband, who is a social care support worker, has no contract and works 30 hours a week which aren’t guaranteed. We struggle as we also support a son on an apprenticeship and a daughter who’s just graduated but can’t find work other than in Tescos - which again only provides the minimum wage and offers under 20 hours of work. Kate Lowe, 45, Winterton
An increase in the income tax threshold from £11,000 to £11,5000
Not a new announcement as such, Hammond confirmed a rise in the income tax threshold to £11,500 by April and £12,500 by 2020. Some readers were happy with the [re] announcement - others, echoing Polly Toynbee, were less so. My wife is self-employed (much encouraged by the Tories), but her work is now very precarious as it often relies on EU companies as clients. If the income tax threshold goes up, watch out for a change in national insurance. Filling out your own returns is a sobering reminder of just how much of that “tax-free” allowance is taken by HMRC. Mike Pratt, 38, Norfolk
Balancing the books?
The government no longer expects to balance the budget by 2020 - that particular Osborne pledge has already been shelved - but Hammond introduced three new fiscal rules. If he is serious about being in surplus at some point in the next parliament, austerity measures introduced sine 2010 are likely to continue. “Austerity was originally meant to be over within a single parliament of five years,” writes Aditya Chakrabortty in our panel, but “it will now last for up to 15 years. It will certainly carry on into a third parliament.
The impact of Brexit
Finally, the elephant in the room - how Britain’s Leave vote will impact the UK’s economy in the months and years to come. The OBR forecasts aren’t pretty. Ed Miliband called the OBR figures a “salutary warning” against the kind of “hard Brexit” wished for by some Tory figures. It’s a theme that was picked up in the comments.

Port tells police he found the victim like that and called 999 because he thought he might be drunk, collapsed or suffering a seizure. 26 June Port is arrested after police discover he hired Walgate as an escort.

2016-11-23T18:16:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland gains £820m in funding to improve infrastructure,"The Scottish government has gained £820m in extra capital funding after Philip Hammond’s boost to infrastructure investment, partially offsetting a forecast decline in the overall economy. The chancellor’s focus on greater roads, housing and digital infrastructure spending in England is also due to increase capital spending for the Welsh and Northern Irish governments by £400m and £250m respectively under the Treasury’s formula for funding the devolved administrations. Optimism about the benefits of that capital spending boost was dampened by gloomy forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that Scotland’s overall economy would be hit directly by leaving the EU. It said Scottish income tax receipts would be £2.4bn lower across the next five years than it had forecast in March, before the EU referendum.
Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, added that the capital spending increase would still lead to a real-terms cut of 8% in his capital budget, alongside a 9% real-terms cut in day-to-day spending measured against what ministers expected in 2010 they would get. UK government sources said that the Scottish capital budget was now 25% higher in real terms than forecast last year. Mackay insisted that the extra £820m only moderated the existing cuts. “The real cost of Brexit has now been revealed – and it is a cost which will be paid through lower growth, lower tax revenues, higher borrowing, higher debt and higher inflation. That is the future the autumn statement revealed the UK faces as a result of leaving the European Union,” he said. “Above all, this was a massive missed opportunity to end austerity. The chancellor has failed to ease the punitive cuts that are hitting so many Scottish families. Instead he has continued the damaging austerity that is slashing the budget for public services, hammering family finances and failing to revive the economy.” Although income tax receipts would slightly increase in cash terms, the OBR said they were likely to be £581m lower in 2020/21, at £5.34bn. That is likely to put the very complex fiscal framework funding deal agreed by the Treasury and Scottish government earlier this year under further strain.
That fall in tax receipts is likely to fuel calls for a full renegotiation of that funding formula, which is already anticipated once the UK government resumes control over agriculture and fisheries support, university research and structural funding from the EU after Brexit. That cash currently flows directly into the Scottish government’s accounts from Brussels, with Scottish farmers and universities receiving more support than the UK average, but would need to be reallocated once the UK quits the EU. Hammond added that he was pressing on with plans to award a city deal to Edinburgh and surrounding towns , and offer a city deal to both Stirling and the Dundee area. Alongside modest cash transfers under the current fiscal framework, that would increase UK government spending in Scotland by £235m over the next five years. The Treasury said there would be additional knock-on spending at Scottish universities from Hammond, a £2.2bn increase in research and development spending, and a share of £3.3m for charities from fines for Libor interest rate manipulation by banks. Analysts with the accountancy firm PwC said the increase in Scotland’s capital budgets, forecast to rise by £257m in 2020/21, will help Nicola Sturgeon’s government boost its faltering infrastructure programme. Scottish ministers lost nearly £400m in capital spending after the Office of National Statistics ruled they had wrongly assumed major new privately-financed roads and hospital projects would not go on the public books. Larger capital budgets will now allow ministers to finance more public sector projects.
Lindsay Gardiner, regional chair for PwC in Scotland, said: “The extra £800m will give the Scottish government some extra options for improving the country’s infrastructure if they choose to use it in that way – and this will be doubly welcome given that many of the current projects including the Queensferry Crossing and M8/M74 work are nearing completion.” The Scottish National party was far more critical, however, attacking Hammond for failing to give further help to the North Sea oil industry. “Philip Hammond has failed to move on loan guarantees, failed to encourage exploration and failed to deal with decommissioning; risking the future of the industry and the many jobs it provides,” said Callum McCaig, the SNP MP for Aberdeen South and party energy spokesman. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh government’s finance secretary, said the extra capital funding was of some help. “Although today’s announcement doesn’t go as far as we had hoped, this extra investment goes some way to restoring the cuts we have seen to our capital budget over recent years.”"
2016-11-23T18:29:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour pours scorn over autumn statement for ignoring sick and old,"John McDonnell accused the chancellor of failing the sick and elderly after his autumn statement gave no additional money to the NHS or social care, despite warnings from the opposition party that both are at a tipping point. The shadow chancellor said he feared a crisis in funding and care over this Christmas, after Hammond offered £23bn for infrastructure but no additional help for health services. “Tonight, many elderly people will remain trapped in their homes, isolated, and lacking the care they need because of continuing cuts to funding,” McDonnell told the Commons in his response to the autumn statement. “You can’t cut social care without hitting the NHS ... “Across the country, hospitals are facing losing their A&Es, losing their maternity units, losing their specialist units. This Tory government is failing patients and failing dedicated NHS staff. “It is the first time healthcare spending per head has declined since the NHS was created.” Hammond mentioned the NHS in his autumn statement speech once to confirm the government’s commitment to spending an extra £10bn a year by the end of this parliament. There was no mention of social care and no additional money for either, despite warnings that shortages in funding are pushing hospitals to a tipping point.
In his response, McDonnell poured scorn on the small scale of measures to help families that are “just about managing” and highlighting a raft of struggling public services. But it was Hammond’s failure to mention social care that caused the biggest response amongst Labour. Andy Burnham, the Labour former health secretary, said it was astonishing that Hammond could prioritise funding for new grammar schools over properly funding social care. “Quite frankly, it is unbelievable that the chancellor could find no mention for social care today [after] six years of cuts of social care have left a record number of older people in hospital and the NHS on the brink,” he said.
Luciana Berger, the former shadow health minister, said there was not one single mention in the 72-page autumn statement document that accompanied Hammond’s speech to the Commons of the words NHS, public health, social care, or mental health. “The chancellor cannot ignore the fact our health and social care services are in crisis facing massive, massive deficits. Surely the many economists in his own department will have told him it is economically illiterate to ignore the massive decrease in people receiving social care in the community and the cuts to NHS and staff training. Why was the NHS missing from his autumn statement today?” she said. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, said she wanted to get away with a divisive debate on social care and called for a cross-party consensus on solving the problem.
Wollaston also said she was “disappointed” that extra funding has not been brought forward at the autumn statement, although she welcomed the signals that this is now under consideration. During the debate, Hammond criticised Labour MPs for being “fond of talking about cuts to social care budgets” when local councils, not central government, are in charge of managing their own funding. “What we’ve done is created a ‘Better care fund’ that by the end of this parliament will be delivering a £.15bn a year into social care and allowed local authorities to raise a social care precept that by the end of this parliament will be delivering an extra £2bn a year,” he said. “That is £3.5bn a year of additional funding into the system. What I would accept is there is an issue that local authorities are saying about the profiling, about how this large amount of money ramps up. It’s an issue we are aware of and are discussing with them.”
He later dismissed the idea that there was any “crisis or looming chaos”. Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association and Tory leader of Warwickshire county council was also critical. “Councils, care providers, charities and the NHS have all called on the government to use the autumn statement to properly fund adult social care,” she said. “The government’s failure to act today means social care remains in crisis, councils and the NHS continue to be pushed to the financial brink and face the prospect of more care providers leaving the publicly-funded market or ceasing trading. “Tragically, the human cost of this will be elderly and vulnerable people continuing to face an ever uncertain future where they might no longer receive the dignified care and support they deserve, such as help getting dressed or getting out and about, which is crucial to their independence and wellbeing.” The criticisms were echoed by Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, who said the government had “chosen to ignore social care, preferring to look the other way as a growing number of elderly people are getting no care at all”. “Scrimping on social care is a huge false economy. Older people are often stranded in hospitals, unable to go home, using beds needed by other patients. This turns up the heat on our already overstretched NHS, which has also been forgotten about today,” he said. Prentis said the funding crisis would be made worse because of the increase in the minimum wage for care workers without an equal increase in overall funding. “With no extra resources for local councils – whose budgets will be down £6.1bn by the end of the decade – the minimum wage increase means unbearable pressure on care budgets. The losers will be older people needing care and the dedicated workforce struggling to look after them,” he said. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, told the Guardian’s politics weekly podcast: “Everyone has been pointing out that the social care sector is in crisis, on the verge of tipping points, lots of organisations including the chief executive of the NHS has been calling for extra investment in social care and he’s done absolutely nothing. Nowt. Zilch. It is unbelievable.” Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, added: “Despite emergency funding for prisons, today we saw little indication of how the chancellor will address the ticking time-bomb in other public services, like health and social care.” • This article was amended on 24 November 2016 to restore the words “not one single”, which had been lost during the editing process."
2016-11-23T18:41:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Autumn statement: brill for builders, perturbing for pensioners","Philip Hammond’s first autumn statement has delivered winners and losers. But who are they? GOOD NEWS FOR … Builders The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) called Hammond’s spending on infrastructure “modest”. But an extra £2.3bn infrastructure fund for a promised 100,000 new homes is good news if you know how to build a wall or lay sewage piping, or employ lots of people who do. See also the promises of funding for 40,000 extra “affordable” homes, a new road linking Oxford and Cambridge and more broadband fibre installation in homes and businesses. Jane Austen fans A niche demographic, perhaps, but every vote counts. The most conspicuous rabbit Hammond pulled from his hat was £7.6m to “save” Wentworth Woodhouse, described by the chancellor as “one of the UK’s most important historic houses”.
The house, Hammond said, was the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice’s Pemberley, although it is not the only stately home to make such a claim. People “just about managing” on low incomes are certain to be delighted. Civil servants Hammond is setting aside £412m to help Whitehall wonks “strengthen trade policy capacity” and “support the renegotiation of the UK’s relationship” with the EU in the run-up to Brexit. This is surely unrelated to a memo leaked last week that suggested the civil service was struggling to cope with the enormous task of leaving the EU, or to the suggestion by a number of former senior mandarins that the service is unprepared for the task. Drivers To cheers, Hammond announced he would “stand on the side of the millions of hardworking people” by cancelling the rise in fuel duty. The fact that this is the seventh year in a row in which the government has done so may lessen the surprise somewhat, but the chancellor boasted this would save the average driver £130 a year. Motorists may also be cheered by the £220m to help solve traffic “pinch points” on strategic roads and a commitment to resurface 80% of the strategic road network.
BAD NEWS FOR … Letting agents It couldn’t happen to a more popular bunch. Shares in some of Britain’s biggest estate agencies plummeted in response to the chancellor’s move to ban “as soon as possible” the large fees charged by agents when letting properties to new tenants. The move was welcomed by campaign groups including Shelter, but others warned that agents and landlords could pass on the expenses in the form of higher rents – an argument advanced, notably, by the housing minister Gavin Barwell in September.
Gym bunnies If your gym membership is through your job, that is. To “promote fairness”, the government is ending the tax and national insurance breaks available for a range of workplace benefits, including gym memberships, phone contracts, computers and private medical insurance contributions. Pension arrangements, childcare vouchers and the cycle-to-work scheme are protected, but perks for company cars (except low-emissions vehicles), school fees and accommodation will be excluded from 2021. Get on that treadmill while you can.
Pensioners What seemed like a promise was really more of a threat. Pensioners have benefited since 2010 from the so-called “triple-lock”, a guarantee that the state pension will go up every year by either inflation, the average rise in earnings or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. This is great if you’re older, but not if you’re a 20-something on a low wage who feels the baby boomers are still hogging all the good stuff. Hammond vowed the government would “meet our pledge” to protect pensions until 2020; after that, however, it will need to look at “the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability”. Which sounds awfully like a warning. Whiplash Everyone’s favourite soft-tissue neck injury has been quite the thing over the past decade, during which time claims to car insurers have soared by 50%, costing them about £1bn a year and motorists around £40 each in increased premiums. This, the government says, is “unacceptably high”. What’s more, it doesn’t – shock! – believe all the claims are genuine. It’s looking at scrapping or capping the right to compensation. Insurers have promised to pass on the savings, according to the government. No, honestly, they really will."
2016-11-23T18:48:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Over £400m extra funding set aside for Brexit process,"Philip Hammond has set aside up to £412m of additional funding to help Whitehall deal with leaving the European Union following criticisms that the civil service cannot cope with Brexit. The chancellor’s autumn statement said that the Department for Exiting the EU, or Dexeu, will receive £51m this financial year and an extra £94m from 2017/2018 until the UK’s exit is complete. Additional resources of £26m each year by 2019/20 will be provided to Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade and the Foreign Office.
It follows concerns from senior civil servants and thinktanks that Whitehall does not have the staff or the skills to cope with the volume of work necessary to ensure that Britain leaves the EU. The top civil servants’ union said that the money would do little to ease the problems because of impending cuts of 18% that were announced in 2015 by the then chancellor George Osborne. Dave Penman, head of the civil servants union, the FDA, said: “With no additional funding, departments will once again be asked to deliver ever more with ever less.” Whitehall currently has a shortage of trade experts. Civil servants have not handled trade negotiations directly for 40 years because these were negotiated by the EU. Extra money to Fox’s department will take its budget to just over £400m a year when combined with resources moved to the new department from UK Trade and Investment and the old business department. Budgets for other departments will not change, as the chancellor announced that the 2015 plans would remain in place.
The Institute for Government, the Whitehall thinktank, said it was too soon to say whether the additional money would help Whitehall prepare for Brexit as the government had not yet explained how Brexit negotiations will be approached or what resource will be required. “The government still has a huge number of commitments to deliver on top of Brexit. Despite emergency funding for prisons, today we saw little indication of how the chancellor will address the ticking time-bomb in other public services, like health and social care,” a spokesperson said. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron added to recent warnings that Whitehall was not sufficiently equipped to cope with the extra demands of leaving the EU. It comes after a note for the Cabinet Office from Deloitte, a professional services firm, was published last week suggesting an extra 30,000 people could have to be hired to deal with the additional work."
2016-11-23T19:05:14Z,uk-news,UK news,A hard times chancellor with little to give away | Anne Perkins,"The chancellor brings the air of an undertaker to the despatch box. His suits are dark, his expression glum and his sense of humour, although unexpectedly sharp, is deployed only sparingly. This is a chancellor for hard times, and in his unshowy way, hard times are what he predicted. This chancellor is the antithesis of his predecessor George Osborne and so was his autumn statement. The only rabbit pulled from Philip Hammond’s topper was that the number of opportunities for rabbit pulling – what the Treasury calls fiscal events – is to be cut from two to one. This was Hammond’s first autumn statement, and it is to be his last.
Hammond is a new chancellor in a new government working in a wholly new context. Leaving the EU, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)’s newly released forecasts - which are based on Brexit happening in April 2019 - will mean sharply declining growth and falling revenues. The OBR expects rising inflation and squeezed household incomes as the value of the pound continues to decline in a less trade-intensive economy. The slower growth and higher borrowing illustrate one of the most profound ironies of the referendum result. Many of those who voted to leave, the “just about managing” people that Theresa May first described on the steps of Downing Street, are exactly the ones who will bear the brunt of Brexit under the chancellor’s plans. There has been a failure in expectation management this week that would never have happened in the Cameron-Osborne years when the prime minister marched in lockstep with his chancellor, who doubled as political strategist. Stories have been circulating all week that No 10 was pressing the chancellor next door for a handout to the Jams, the brand new acronym for a familiar but freshly defined demographic. The Jams appear to owe their origin to the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank now chaired by the former Tory minister David Willetts, whose director is Torsten Bell, a former aide to Ed Miliband. Resolution published a piece of research to coincide with the Conservative party conference in October that provided the evidence to underpin May’s description of just managing families in July.
Resolution estimates that there are about 6 million Jams living in households where at least one member is working, based away from metropolitan centres in smaller towns from Lancashire to Devon, probably not in professional jobs, most likely not college educated and whose life choices are restricted by low pay that has not significantly increased since the crash in 2008, while house prices have soared out of control. In the hands of the former chancellor, trails like those of the past week of giveaways – even modest ones – would have been the cue for headline-grabbing initiatives. In Hammond’s autumn statement package the surprise was that there was no surprise. The small concessions that were made were already in the pipeline. Tax thresholds will rise, as Osborne set out, and the national living wage will go up from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour in April next year – slightly less than the rise needed to increase it by regular increments to 60% of median earnings by 2020. Fuel duty is frozen for the seventh year in a row. Insurance premiums are meant to come down through legislation to restrict compensation for whiplash injuries, but insurance premium tax will rise. Agents’ letting fees will be banned. There are also some large and consequential decisions that will make the next four years hard indeed. Weeks of Tory backbench pressure on Hammond to soften Osborne’s cuts to universal credit have been rebuffed. Instead the work allowance, beyond which it starts to be withdrawn, was left unchanged. Though the rate at which it tapers off as earnings increase is very slightly slowed from 65p to 63p in the pound, according to House of Commons figures, that means a working family with two children could be £800 instead of £1,100 a year worse off,. A lone parent in work with two children could be £2,300 a year instead of £2,500 worse off.
Childcare for three and four year-olds is being extended from 15 to 30 hours a week from next September, but Osborne’s decision to limit universal credit to two children from next April still stands. The Child Poverty Action Group predicts that working families will be worse off, and more children will grow up in poverty. This is scant comfort for May’s Jams. Hammond has put his ambition of a “match-fit” economy ahead of their needs. The match in question is the world after Brexit. So the best hope for the Jams is in the wider and longer-term plans to try to ease the metropolitan-market town split that was revealed by the result of June’s referendum. The chancellor promised a further attempt to rebalance the economy away from London through measures such as the allocation of £1.8bn from the Local Growth Fund to local enterprise partnerships in the English regions. There is to be an extra £1bn for local transport networks, and £2.3bn will be invested in infrastructure that new housing developments need. But this is slow-burn stuff. Meanwhile there was nothing to divert the looming catastrophe in social care that has left a million elderly people without adequate support in their homes, and hospitals struggling with patients stuck in hospital because there is no safe place for them to go. Councils had pinned their hopes on more from the Better Care Fund, the pot of money that is supposed to be joining up hospital and social care, but they were not even given permission for a further increase in the precept they can levy to meet the cost of the paying the national living wage. Instead the chancellor was adamant that the NHS had had the extra money it asked for, a view disputed by the Tory chair of the Commons health committee, the King’s Fund and every expert on health spending. He dismissed projections of a deficit in NHS England trusts of £680m as a mere drop in the context of a budget of more than £100bn a year. He spoke sharply about the size of the NHS’s contingency fund. This was a continuity autumn statement. Hammond is even more concerned about borrowing and fiscal rebalancing than Osborne was. His anxieties have outweighed May’s pledges to the Jams. This is the first guess at tailoring Conservative economic consequences to the prospect of of Brexit from a chancellor operating even more in the dark than his predecessors. The pace of leaving, the impact on trade, investment, growth and borrowing are all even more uncertain than when an earlier chancellor, Denis Healey, denounced the autumn forecast – which he introduced – as “an extrapolation from a partially known past through an unknown present to an unknowable future, according to theories about the causal relationships between certain economic variables which are hotly disputed by academic economists”."
2016-11-23T19:41:46Z,uk-news,UK news,'It’s all right for the big boys': Lancaster's traders react to the autumn statement,"With two universities and two strongly performing grammar schools, an arthouse cinema and a theatre, the Georgian city of Lancaster is one of the more affluent areas of the north-west of England. It is a thriving and popular place to live, and students make up about 15% of the 141,000 residents of the district, which includes the poorer seaside towns of Heysham and Morecambe, and the town of Carnforth, near the Cumbrian border. It is these smaller, more deprived areas that probably account for the relatively low average pre-tax personal income of £22,300, £5,100 below the national average, as well as the district voting for Brexit. Lancaster voted 51.1% in favour of leaving the EU, surprising many on the Labour-run city council, which includes eight Green party councillors. Unemployment is about the same as the UK average, with 1.8% of the population claiming out-of-work benefits, compared with 1.9% nationally. The town centres of many leave-voting areas of the north of England can be a depressing sight, dominated by pawn shops, charity shops, takeaways and bookies. But with a healthy mix of independent shops and most of the major chain stores, Lancaster’s city centre has weathered the recession and the rise of internet retail better than most. Penny Street is one of the main pedestrianised shopping zones, with three bank branches, several pubs and cafes, an M&S and a McDonald’s. The Guardian asked local shoppers and traders what they wanted from Philip Hammond’s first autumn statement, and what they thought of the measures he announced.Jahid Patel, owner of Sneaks menswear
I’ve had a menswear shop in various locations across Lancaster for 10 years and I’ll tell you what’s a killer: business rates. Philip Hammond didn’t really say anything about that. I now pay £12,300 a year for this shop, and that’s before I pay the rent, the electric, wages. It’s all right for the big boys, your Costa Coffees and the like – they have hundreds of branches and can benefit from economies of scale. But for an independent business trying to operate on the high street, it is really difficult. We are competing with online businesses who don’t have to pay business rates. I think a lot more people would give starting a business a go if they were lower. I’d like to see VAT cut, too. He’s giving £1bn for broadband, but my broadband is fine. I wish people would realise that business owners like me aren’t loaded. If they keep buying online rather than shopping locally, we won’t be here in six months, the high street will die and they’ll have to go to Preston or Manchester to do their shopping. I voted to stay in the EU. I think we need to be able to trade with the EU. I haven’t seen a knock-on effect from Brexit yet, but it will come. A lot of our brands, such as Nike, are US companies, and I am expecting it to cost more to buy from them next year. Malcolm Willis, 75, retired musician from Morecambe
I’m officially retired, but I can’t afford to run my house on my pensions, I get the basic state pension and a small private one, so I still work. People say, ‘you’re 75, you shouldn’t have to work’, but I’m fit and I can, so I do a bit of dealing in musical instruments and building for local pensioners. I don’t mind that there wasn’t really anything in the autumn statement for pensioners. We get plenty. Of course, if someone offered me an extra £50 a month, I wouldn’t turn it down, but we get enough. People in this country want too much. My wife has worked as a missionary in Africa and there were ministers there with no shoes on their feet. People here don’t realise how wealthy they are. I’d say I’m a radical person. I think Trump is the best thing that ever happened and I think we should get out of Europe as quickly as possible. Thank God that Theresa May appears to be a Christian and another Margaret Thatcher. But I do think it is important to get rid of the deficit. We need to get out of the red and into the black, and I am prepared to do my share of watching the pennies to get there. Kinsey Aikman, 22, co-owner of Town House gallery
The autumn statement wasn’t as bad as I was expecting. The bit about building new homes sounds good. In Lancaster they have been building houses, but they are mostly luxury apartments on the quayside. They’re mostly high end and out of my budget. I rent, but off my dad. One of the things that put me off renting privately was the fees the letting agents charge, plus the fact they wanted three months’ rent upfront. So I think getting rid of letting agency fees is a good thing. The more money people have in their pockets, the better for businesses such as ours. We need people to have disposable income if they are going to treat themselves to art and luxury items. I don’t really mind that they have given up on running a surplus by 2020. It’s just fictional money to me. It doesn’t make a difference for real people, unless it leads to another recession. Lynne Whitworth, branch manager at Skipton Building Society
Most of our clients are in the older age range and what they complain about most is interest rates. They remember the good old 90s, when mortgage rates were at 15% and so was interest on savings. Like all the other banks and building societies, we have cut our interest rates. The best rate we offer is 1.25% on the five-year Isa. They are not happy about that at all, but then again, I don’t really see what the government can do about interest rates. What we are seeing is customers coming in and using their savings to make lump sum reductions on their mortgages or increasing their monthly payments. The older generation are doing an awful lot of gifting money away, giving to their children and grandchildren, who they fear will never get on the housing ladder without it. Stewart Cook, area commercial manager for Yorkshire Bank
I’ve been in banking for 36 years and worked through three recessions, the last one being the worst – 2008 was tough for everybody – but there’s a lot of confidence locally. Business is vibrant. Agriculture has had a difficult time, particularly dairy farmers, but things are getting better. It was good to see more commitments around the “northern powerhouse”. It’s a project that businesses here are really keen to get involved with. They think it’s positive for the region. I look after small and medium businesses: companies that make widgets, who bash metal, agriculture. They will welcome the cut in corporation tax to 17%. They can use the savings to invest. Our customers are investing in their businesses and we are helping them do that. There was a mixed reaction locally to Brexit. Exporters are seeing the biggest benefit because of the exchange rate, though there aren’t a lot of exporters in Lancaster. I think business people took a breath in the immediate aftermath of the vote, but they realise they need to invest to grow. We are helping our customers buy premises, buy machinery. We haven’t seen any drop in loans since the referendum. Graeme MacLeod, managing director of Cumberland Estate Agents Banning agency fees will be a bit of a body-punch for landlords who are already reeling from stamp duty hikes and diminishing tax relief over the next four years. Now they’re going to have to fund, to a degree, the application and referencing process. But it’s definitely a good thing for tenants. I’ve seen some of the charges that have been exposed in the press. Apparently the average is £340 nationally, which is three times the average that we charge. We charge about £100 plus VAT. The industry does not have the best of reputations and when you see what some people have been charging, it does show that letting agents haven’t really been looking at tenants as customers. They’ve been looking at them as an opportunity to make money. More housebuilding is always welcome. The supply of housing is lower than I’ve ever seen it and people are always going to want to own their own homes. Brexit might have made a slight difference to supply in the housing market and made people more reluctant to sell, but we’ve seen growth pretty much on everything. Rents, prices and mortgages. It’s all very buoyant. Michael Thomas, 32, manager of Gingernut Cafe and Bistro
I’m disappointed there aren’t more measures for people like me. I’ve just had a baby boy and we’ve struggled to manage dealing with the loss of my partner’s income while she went on maternity leave. I’ve had to take a second job as a head chef at a new restaurant in Kendal. I would have liked to see something done with VAT on sales. Basically it just takes away the incentive to do that bit better because as soon as you earn over the £89,000 mark you have to pay 20% on every penny that comes in. I think it should be in stages. It was a big struggle for me earlier in the year. I started opening nights and an extra day a week just to cover the VAT bill. I’ve got no idea what effect Brexit will have on my business. In my opinion, politicians talk so much crap anyway that if you pick one over the other, is it really going to make much difference? Dian Dzhinski, 34, manager of Just Hair salon I came to Lancaster from Bulgaria two and half years ago and set up my business in May with help from friends. Business is going OK at the moment, but it’s early days. I would have liked to see taxes on businesses cut, but everyone would want that. Brexit has had no impact me and my business so far. I think it will make more of a difference to bigger companies. I came here because I thought it would be easier to set up a business here than in Bulgaria, but now I’ve realised that it’s the same as everywhere else. I don’t expect to get more help from the government. I wanted a business in order to be self-sufficient. Billy Howard, 20, free range egg supplier
I set up the business when I was 16 – I run a stall in Lancaster two days a week and supply free range eggs to local cafes and shops. Business is up at the moment. We’ve got a lot of regular customers and without them we don’t have a business. I’m pleased about the announcement that they will be cracking down on tax avoidance schemes. We pay our taxes – why do others get away with it? Sometimes I feel that once I’ve paid my expenses, paid for the van, paid my taxes, there’s not much left. It’s good that they’re going to build more houses. I’m saving to buy a house at the moment, but getting my deposit money together is hard and I still need a lot more. I’ve got a help to buy Isa, but that’s only going to help a bit. Me and my girlfriend would like to move to Lancaster from Bentham, in the Yorkshire Dales, and the areas we’re looking at are expensive: you’re talking £120,000 minimum. Karen Chaplin, 57, plant stall manager
I’d hoped for a reduction of VAT. It’s really killing a lot of businesses. If they could reduce that down to 17.5%, or even to increase the threshold, that would be helpful. The living wage doesn’t affect me because I always pay anybody who works for me £9 an hour. I just think you should treat people fairly and I think £9 is a more realistic living wage. Jackie Stobbart, 55, manager of the Penny Bank pub
I’d have liked to see a reduction in beer prices. Here our beer prices are very low because we’ve got a good relationship with the suppliers, but other places can’t compete. If the beer prices were brought down I think you’d get a lot more custom in public houses, which would generate more jobs. We’ve struggled with the increasing national living wage. I know people have to live, but at the same time small businesses, because we’ve only got a certain amount of money we can use for wages, will employ fewer staff and put the beer up to compensate."
2016-11-23T19:47:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Autumn statement more Fifty Shades of Grey than Pride and Prejudice,"Philip Hammond’s first and last autumn statement was a sombre affair. The chancellor largely dispensed with political theatre to tell it straight. Britain’s economy is dysfunctional. Austerity has failed. Welfare cuts are going to bite. Brexit will be a £60bn drag on growth and the public finances. That’s the way it is.
The one small nod towards gimmickry was the £7m the government has made available to save Wentworth Woodhouse, a stately home in South Yorkshire said to be the inspiration for Pemberley in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. A different chancellor would have milked the literary allusion for a few cheap laughs. Not Hammond, though. At root, his statement was all about how the vulnerabilities of the British economy have been exposed by the decision to leave the European Union. There is a 30% productivity gap between Britain and Germany. Prosperity is concentrated in London and the south-east. There has been insufficient investment in research and development, in transport infrastructure, in superfast broadband and in housing. These deficiencies explain why the government has struggled in vain to eliminate the record peacetime budget deficit it inherited from Labour in 2010 and why the UK’s balance of payments deficit is running at 6% of national output. In or out of the EU, they would need to be addressed. Brexit has made tackling them more urgent. The vote on 23 June has given Hammond the chance to break with the past. Although the economy is expected to slow over the next two years, the chancellor has decided to borrow to invest. The government has put aside £23bn for infrastructure projects over the next five years, a relatively modest sum in the context of a £1.8tn economy but welcome nevertheless. Money has become available because Hammond has dispensed with George Osborne’s plan to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament in 2019-20. By pushing deficit reduction beyond the next election, the chancellor has given himself scope for some additional public expenditure while at the same time holding something back in case the relatively benign forecasts for the economy from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) prove optimistic. Before the referendum, Osborne made dire predictions for the economy should Britain vote to leave the EU. The Treasury suggested there would be an instant recession necessitating an emergency budget involving £30bn of tax increases and spending cuts. In the event, strong consumer confidence has meant the economy has beaten expectations. The OBR has slightly raised its growth forecast for 2016, a year in which the UK’s economy looks likely to expand more quickly than any of its G7 rivals. Next year it is a different story. The OBR thinks the fall in the value of the pound will result in dearer imports, higher inflation and a stalling of real income growth. It also expects uncertainty caused by the Brexit divorce negotiations to result in weaker private investment.
Both these assumptions look plausible despite Hammond’s autumn statement measures. Higher government spending on infrastructure is designed to compensate for the hesitancy of the private sector to commit to new capital projects, while the higher national living wage, the modest adjustments to universal credit and yet another year of frozen fuel duties are intended to support the consumer. But the impact of these moves should not be exaggerated. There was a strong element of continuity in the autumn statement: the bulk of the cuts announced by Osborne will still go ahead. There was no extra money for the struggling NHS and thin gruel for the so-called Jams (just about managing households) despite the hype. The Child Poverty Action Group has calculated that a single parent with one child and no housing costs earning £15,000 a year will be £170 a year better off as a result of the new universal credit regime. But the same person stood to lose out by £3,170 a year as a result of the summer 2015 budget. Hammond has the scope to provide more help for the Jams during 2017 when there will be both a spring and an autumn budget. The OBR says the delay in balancing the budget until the next parliament means he has the scope to borrow £56bn more by 2020-21 than Osborne was planning. Of that, £20bn will be soaked up by lower growth and a further £10bn has been earmarked for higher spending, mainly on infrastructure. That leaves Hammond £26.5bn to play with. The autumn statement, in other words, is not a self-contained work like Pride and Prejudice, but more a trilogy with parts two and three to come next year. Which one? Well, the economy is shrouded in fog, the government believes that fiscal pain will be worth it in the end and the chancellor makes a virtue out of being Mr Ordinary. Simple really: Fifty Shades of Grey."
2016-11-23T20:30:03Z,uk-news,UK news,A reality check for both wings of the Tory party,"As the chancellor sat down, commentators and politicians began to muse whether they had just witnessed a true heir to Tory predecessor George Osborne, or a man intent in following in the footsteps of Labour’s Ed Balls. Philip Hammond was clearly not mimicking the dancing style of the former Labour MP. However, he did seem comfortable announcing almost Keynesian large-scale investment projects and high levels of borrowing to invest, in a statement that, unquestionably, had an interventionist touch. That alongside, at best, moderate action for just managing families and stark forecasts in the face of Brexit uncertainty left Hammond facing possible angst from both sides of his party. One Conservative MP, making his way from the House of Commons’ chamber to an office in Portcullis House, parliament’s glass-roofed annexe, admitted that he was a little concerned. “There is some worry about them shifting to a more interventionist position, especially among those of us who are more free marketeers,” said the politician. “I can see why they want to do it. It is seductive to step in if an industry is in trouble. But they have to be careful not to go too far.” Nearby, a Tory on the left wing of the party was critical for a different reason. “What was there for just managing families?” they asked, shrugging their shoulders and rolling their eyes. “The sandwich didn’t have much jam!” And yet, while there was the odd grumble, the backbench concern did appear to be largely muted. Most Tory MPs wandering around the Commons seemed relatively pleased with what they had heard. Heidi Allen, a key figure who has been pushing hard for the government to offer relief to universal credit recipients who are facing massive cuts, seemed satisfied with what she had heard. Although Labour said a change in the benefit’s taper rate fell well short of undoing the damage caused by the original decision, Allen insisted that it was a start. “You are always a little bit disappointed because you dream of utopia and I hoped we might have more,” she told the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast. But alongside continued increases to the personal allowance and a rise in the minimum wage, she argued that “a billion pounds into universal credit plus” was pretty good. Others simply felt that the chancellor had done what he had to. “Philip Hammond delivered the autumn statement you’d expect him to,” said backbencher James Cleverly, a Tory MP who backed Brexit. “It was not flamboyant, there were no bells and whistles. There was some difficult economic news, but still with spending on areas that Conservatives care about – transport, broadband, fuel duty.”
Nicky Morgan, who supported remain and has been an increasingly vocal member of the backbench awkward squad, also described it as “steady as he goes”. Backbenchers also pointed to Hammond’s expectation management, through which he made sure the media, but also Conservatives, weren’t clamouring for much. It was noted that Hammond had addressed a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee where he stressed to colleagues that showmanship (think rabbits, sweets, gimmicks) wasn’t his style. And so gone were the four to five pages that Osborne would have dedicated in the “green book” to regional giveaways (through which the A14 appeared to have been resurfaced several times). Hammond’s approach was to focus on investment in specific industrial areas, not parts of the country. And then there was Brexit. Even those who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU admitted the economic news was tough. But the argument was that Hammond provided the Conservatives with a “bullet-proof” messenger given that he had campaigned to remain. Brexit-supporting MPs also argued that the borrowing figures were over a long period, and pointed out that Hammond would have pleased leavers by starting his speech with a booming introduction about the robust health of the British economy. On this thinking, Hammond’s cautious approach to the question of Brexit so far (critics have accused the chancellor of being a doom-monger) also gives him the advanage that people take him even more seriously when he sounds upbeat. But perhaps MPs are hearing what they most want to. While Brexiters have seized on Hammond’s positive start, remainers were instead taken by a more worrying end. As one MP fighting for a soft Brexit put it: “This was the first reality check about just how difficult this is going to be for the British economy.”"
2016-11-23T20:39:09Z,uk-news,UK news,"Brexit will blow £59bn hole in public finances, admits Hammond","Philip Hammond conceded that Brexit will blow a £59bn black hole in the public finances over the next five years, as he outlined plans to boost investment in infrastructure and housing to equip the UK economy for life outside the EU. In his first fiscal statement, the chancellor, who had supported remain, sought to strike a cautiously upbeat tone about the country’s prospects, saying the economy had “confounded commentators at home and abroad with its strength and its resilience” since the referendum result last June. But the first official projections conducted after the vote of the likely impact of leaving the EU pointed to significantly weaker growth after Brexit. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced that there would be a cumulative £122bn of extra borrowing over the next five years, with £59bn of that as a direct result of Brexit. Other factors included weaker-than-expected tax revenues, and policy changes, including Hammond’s decision to spend more on infrastructure. George Osborne was expecting to achieve a surplus of £11bn on the public finances by 2020-21; instead, the OBR is now forecasting a £21bn deficit – and public debt is expected to peak at more than 90% of GDP.
With little cash to spare, Hammond offered only modest handouts to the “just about managing” families (Jams) Theresa May’s government had said it wanted to help, although he repeatedly used the mantra of “building an economy that works for everyone”. The chancellor announced a renewed freeze in fuel duty, to help motorists – largely paid for with an increase in insurance premium tax from 10% to 12% – and a partial reversal of planned cuts to universal credit. But Labour said there was no cash for either the NHS or social care, which are under increasing strain with winter approaching. Instead, the main thrust of Hammond’s first set-piece outing at the dispatch box was how to help Britain withstand the challenges of leaving the EU.
Instead of a headline-grabbing gimmick, Hammond ended his speech with the surprise announcement that he had delivered the final autumn statement. In future, budgets will be held annually in the autumn, with a more slimmed-down update in the spring, meaning that there would be two budgets in 2017. Hammond told the Commons that the Brexit vote “makes more urgent than ever the need to tackle our economy’s long-term weaknesses, like the productivity gap, the housing challenge, and the damaging imbalance in economic growth and prosperity across our country”.
The chancellor added: “In the real world, it takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five; which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts.” Hammond said he would set aside £23bn over the next five years, to be spent on areas such as new housing projects and hi-tech research, funded by extra borrowing. A Treasury spokesman, lifting a phrase more commonly used by Labour, said “he is borrowing to invest”. Labour pointed out that other policies, including a ban on letting agents’ fees, were taken from its 2015 manifesto, as Theresa May’s government deliberately takes a more interventionist approach to what it regards as failing markets. Hammond also promised to take another look at the household energy market, where consumer groups have repeatedly warned customers are being ripped off. In a sign that the government expects the public finances to continue to be fragile, the chancellor also hinted that costly pledges, including the “triple-lock” on pensions, would have to be reviewed before the Conservatives draw up their manifesto for the next general election. “As we look ahead to the next parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability,” Hammond said. “And so the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next parliament in light of the evolving fiscal position at the next spending review.”
Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank, said: “The government remains hamstrung by its desire to further reduce the fiscal deficit at the same time as Brexit-related uncertainty is likely to rise. For this reason, it will prove difficult to help the Jams who suffered under George Osborne’s tenure as chancellor.” The OBR warned that Brexit would lead to weaker growth and lower tax receipts, because of higher inflation, slower immigration, and a decade-long slowdown in trade growth. It has assumed “that the negotiation of new trading arrangements with the EU and others slows the pace of import and export growth for the next 10 years”. In total, the OBR said it expected the chancellor to have to borrow an extra £122bn over the next five years – with almost half of that, £59bn, attributable to the impact of Brexit. Austerity is now expected to continue into the next parliament: more than a decade after Osborne promised to tackle the deficit run up during the financial crisis. The OBR said it had been forced to base its forecasts on “broad-brush judgments” about the likely path of Brexit, because of the lack of clarity from the government. It asked for “a formal statement of government policy as regards its desired trade regime and system of migration control,” but the government directed it to public statements from Theresa May, who has repeatedly refused to give a “running commentary” on Brexit. OBR projections also showed economic growth sliding to 1.4% in 2017, from the 2.2% the OBR was expecting in March, before recovering to 2.1% by 2020. But the OBR warned that there was more uncertainty than usual surrounding its forecasts – and some commentators suggested there could be worse to come.
With the public finances expected to deteriorate, Hammond could have made emergency spending cuts; but instead he formally abandoned George Osborne’s target of dragging the public finances back into the black by the end of this parliament in 2019-20, and introduced new, looser tax and spending rules. Under the new framework, the budget deficit is now not expected to be eliminated until some time in the next parliament. In the autumn statement “green book”, the Treasury said its approach “strikes the right balance between restoring the public finances to health in the medium term whilst providing sufficient flexibility to support the economy in the near term”. Treasury sources said this approach would leave him room for manoeuvre to take emergency measures, if the economy weakens more sharply than expected, as article 50 is triggered next year. In the House of Commons, Hammond’s predecessor Osborne, who rose from the back benches to congratulate him on his “assured delivery”, said: “The independent OBR has given us a very sober assessment of the economic and borrowing challenges that Britain faces and the chancellor is right to keep his powder dry.”
While Hammond unravelled some of Osborne’s policies, including his strict tax and spending rules, he reaffirmed several of his predecessor’s key pledges, including raising the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 a year by the end of this parliament, and cutting corporation tax to 17%. Most of the welfare cuts Osborne planned, including a cash freeze in working-age benefits, and a £30-a-week cut in employment support allowance for disabled people, will go ahead. Labour MPs repeatedly challenged Hammond about the price of Brexit. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the new forecasts were “a salutary warning to us about the decisions we take in the coming months”, adding “isn’t it a very strong argument for us to remain as close as possible to our largest trading area, the single market, and inside not outside the customs union?” Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “Today’s statement places on record the abject failure of the last six wasted years and offers no hope for the future. The figures speak for themselves: growth, down; business investment, down; and their own deficit target, failed; their debt target, failed.” Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, said: “This wasn’t a Brexit budget, it was a Brexit uncertainty budget. Almost all the dire economic and fiscal news that was revealed today was the result, not of Brexit itself, but of the referendum decision and the pending article 50 negotiation. This could be just the start.”"
2016-11-23T21:57:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Man survives 750-volt shock after falling on to live rail,"A man has described how he was “sucked” on to an electrified rail track, causing multiple cardiac arrests and the near-amputation of his leg. After an evening out with friends, Chris Dos Santos from Totton in Hampshire crossed railway tracks and fell on to the “third rail” that powers trains. “I received a 750-volt electric shock through my leg and into my body. Because the power is DC [direct current], it actually sucks you to the power source, so my leg was stuck to the rail and I couldn’t get off,” he said. The current caused Dos Santos, a landscape gardener and father, to have a cardiac arrest. Three of his friends tried to help, but also got electric shocks. “They thought I was going to die. I remember the smell of burning skin. It was awful. I received severe burns to my legs, back and arm. I continued to have cardiac arrests and when I got to hospital they thought they were going to have to amputate my leg,” he said. Dos Santos spent three months in hospital recovering from the accident, which has left him on crutches and with considerable scarring. “I didn’t want my girlfriend to come and see me. I also didn’t want my kids to see me the way I was.” He has depended on a friend to help keep his landscaping business going during his recovery. The 29-year-old decided to go public to try to prevent others making the same mistake. “If I could go back to that night, I would never have walked along the railway. People should understand how dangerous it is. If my story can make just one person more aware of the dangers, then it’s worth sharing,” Dos Santos said. Becky Lumlock, Network Rail’s route managing director for Wessex, said Dos Santos’s story highlighted the dangers of the railway: “Taking risks at level crossings and running along platforms can have life-changing impacts, so we’re urging anyone who uses the railway to keep a clear head and stay safe.” Trespassing on train tracks is the biggest cause of accidental death on UK railways, Network Rail warned. As well as the danger posed by touching high-voltage overhead lines, the electricity they carry can also “arc” or jump up to three metres. Passengers are also reminded that trespassing occurs if they jump off the platform to pick up a phone or other object that has been dropped. Network Rail is the company that owns and runs the 20,000 miles of track, 40,000 bridges and viaducts and the thousands of signals, level crossings and stations that make up the UK railway."
2016-11-24T07:00:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish exam invigilators threaten to resign over low pay,"Scottish exam invigilators are threatening to resign after the national exam board refused to increase their fees in line with the “national living wage”. Invigilators have accused the Scottish Qualifications Authority of knowingly underpaying them by understating their actual working hours, despite a series of complaints raised since last year about low pay. Their warnings came as SQA executives conceded to MSPs on Holyrood’s education committee that, in some exam sessions, invigilators earned an effective hourly rate of under £7 following a Guardian investigation into the pay complaints. SQA executives admitted they had to rely on informal checks at each school to ensure the board’s 6,500 invigilators were properly paid and that they had no way of monitoring their hours. The executives were only now introducing a mechanism for properly measuring the exact working hours for each invigilator after an investigation was launched by the Scottish living wage watchdog, the Poverty Alliance.
One chief invigilator said their resentment had grown this week after the SQA failed to increase their fees for next year’s exam season, keeping them at a pay rate which had remained unchanged since 2010. Many more were close to quitting. “I am giving serious consideration to not accepting next year’s appointment. If I do, many of my long-term team members will do the same, leaving the school with insufficient invigilators to conduct the exams,” he said. His deputy said she too was likely to resign following next spring’s exams after being persuaded by her supervisor to stay on for a final year. “I am [considering resigning], very seriously. In fact at the end of the last exam diet I said I have had it… I actually came out and said I’m done, it’s not worth the hassle.” The invigilators said they were shocked the SQA had ignored the increase in the national living wage next April to £7.50 an hour, confirmed on Wednesday by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the new Scottish living wage of £8.45, which will be mandatory for all Scottish public bodies from April 2017. For the eighth year running, ordinary invigilators will receive £27.15 per half day session or £54.30 for a full day while deputy chief invigilators will be paid £31.65 per half day. A chief invigilator’s rate is based on a sliding scale which can reach £60 per half day. Daniel Johnson, the Labour MSP for Edinburgh Southern, has asked HM Revenue & Customs to investigate whether the SQA is in breach of minimum wage legislation after the agency admitted it had no way of proving that all invigilators were properly paid. In a significant admission about the impact of those pay rates, Linda Ellison, the SQA’s finance director, told MSPs on Holyrood’s education committee that for the longer exams those fees meant invigilators received an effective hourly rate of under £7 for that session. Pressed by Johnson during the committee hearing, Ellison insisted that it was very rare for invigilators to receive a low hourly rate for covering an exam. She said that since they covered a range of exams during each exam season, with many only an hour or two long, their effective rate was frequently up to £9.05 an hour. Janet Brown, the agency’s chief executive, told Johnson: “What you have highlighted is that we don’t have that reporting mechanism and that is what we’re putting in place. So I do agree with you that there is a reporting structure that needs to be put in place to address that.” She added: “And over the full pay period, they are all being paid the living wage.” Ellison said that only 30 minutes was needed for administration on each exam. But three invigilators working at different schools said that was grossly underestimating the time needed to prepare for an exam, to collate and record papers, which would routinely take an extra 45 minutes. The invigilators said there was also frequently added time given for pupils with additional needs, which could add an hour or more to each exam, with some running over by 50% for pupils being given extra time. The chief and deputy invigilators said they started work at 8am and frequently worked without a lunch break. There was “absolutely no way” the SQA was accounting for that extra time in the fixed rates they used, said one. Another invigilator said he was “quite surprised” the SQA had failed to increase the fee in line with the rise in the minimum and living wage. “If you’re going to be doing such an important job, you should be paid a reasonable remuneration, which should be the living wage, particularly given that government departments are being told to pay it,” he said. “Why is it one rule for us and another rule for others?” Asked about their threatened resignations, a spokesman for the SQA said chief invigilators should work closely with their teams “to create balanced schedules” and were now providing further guidance and revised claim forms to ensure that exam sessions for each invigilator were “balanced across the examination period … We actively encourage invigilators to discuss their individual circumstances with their chief invigilators.”"
2016-11-24T08:27:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Port conviction prompts police warning over dating apps,"A senior police officer is warning people who use dating apps to take extra security precautions as concerns grow over the scale of violence and sexual assaults linked to their use.
The conviction of Stephen Port for the serial killings of young men he met via a variety of dating apps, including Grindr and Gaydar, comes after the case of Stefano Brizzi, who killed a police officer, Gordon Semple, whom he met via the Grindr app. The use of dating apps by perpetrators of sexual violence is one of the National Crime Agency’s emerging threats to the general public. Recent figures showed the number of allegations of rapes linked to dating websites have risen sixfold in the last five years. The NCA said in its most recent figures that 184 people had reported being raped by someone they had met via a dating app or website in 2014 – up from 33 in 2009. Twice as many people now report being raped by someone they met online as are attacked by a bogus taxi driver – a danger once seen as so great it attracted a huge public awareness campaign. The Norfolk chief constable, Simon Bailey, national police lead on violence and public protection, said there was a direct connection between the use of dating apps and a rise in crime. “The rising popularity of online dating apps and websites has contributed to an increase in the number of recorded crimes,” said Bailey. “We strongly encourage users to report offences and seek support if they become a victim of any type of crime. “I would urge those who use online dating apps to be as security-conscious as possible and not to share personal data with anyone until they are sure about those they are communicating with.” Port was a prolific user of gay dating apps including Grindr, Gaydar, FitLads, SlaveBoys, Hornet and Badoo. His case highlights how individuals with violent intentions can exploit the apps to gain the trust of victims. Port used a false name and a fake profile picture in some of his personal information to gain the trust of the men who were to meet him. He used the names “shyguy”, “top fun Joe”, “Basketballguy” and a variety of others and cited his preference for “under 30” and slim men. In one profile, he claimed to be an Oxford graduate. In another, a special needs teacher. “I am a shy, polite guy. Enjoy keeping in shape, love to have a good time. I am romantic, caring and would take good care of my partner. I am successful, educated and determined,” he wrote. “I’m looking for fun/date/bf who is between 18-24, slim, smooth twink type, not too camp tho .... who has plenty of energy and enjoys a good time.” Bailey said the greatest danger was often at the first face-to-face meeting. He urged men and women who use dating apps to take security precautions when they met their “date” for the first time. “If you are planning on meeting someone for the first time, take precautions and meet in a public place,” he said. “Individuals should stop all communication with anyone who attempts to pressurise them into something they are not comfortable with. If this happens you should contact the dating app provider immediately to discuss your concerns and always report any criminal activity to the police.” The vulnerability of victims who meet people with violent intent via dating apps was starkly illustrated by the Port case. Having enticed his victim with a fake profile, Port would use his first meeting with the men to slip GHB into their drink, or in some cases, he would tell them it was lubricant. Within 15 minutes, they would be unconscious. GHB, an anaesthetic, is popular on the dance and club scene, and is available in liquid form [liquid ecstasy] or powdered form. In low doses, it is reported to produce euphoria, to lower social inhibition and increase libido. At higher doses, euphoria gives way to sedation. Still larger doses can induce coma. In some cases death can arise as a result of respiratory depression or inhalation of vomit. It is particularly dangerous when taken in conjunction with other sedatives, such as alcohol, or sleeping pills. Port worked as a male escort – and was well aware of the power a stranger with violent intentions could hold over an unwitting victim. When giving evidence he was asked about his safety rules as an escort. He replied: “I would never accept a drink or anything to eat off a client. And I always took my own lube, condoms and poppers.” It was just such vulnerability he exploited in the victims he targeted."
2016-11-24T09:04:34Z,uk-news,UK news,London and the chancellor's 2016 autumn statement,"Look at it this way: UK economic growth is slowing, public borrowing will be higher than expected and the government no longer thinks it can balance the budget by 2020. Much of this is down to Brexit. Good old Boris. We’ve got our country back. Now we are free to scavenge for consolations from an autumn statement that seeks to limit the damage done by the referendum outcome, including in resilient London, the Remain City on which Leave Nation may depend more heavily than ever in the worrying years to come. Chancellor Philip Hammond remarked that “for too long, economic growth in our country has been too concentrated in London and the south-east”. True, but that is also what you would say to a British euroscepticism that often goes hand-in-hand with hostility towards the capital. And though Hammond gave London’s mayor, its boroughs and its politicians of almost every type nothing like the transformative devolution package they desire, he did do some things to suggest that the government grasps that it cannot afford to ignore the capital’s pleas for more autonomy. He also observed that it is “one of the highest productivity cities in the world”, with Britain’s other big urban centres lagging far behind. Sadiq Khan has been fairly positive about what Hammond announced, no doubt partly sincerely but also very mindful that his City Hall looks like having to keep on doing business with Conservative governments for at least as long as Jeremy Corbyn leads the Labour Party. He offered the glass-half-full view that the chancellor’s measures are “the first steps towards a major devolution deal for the capital”. In her own words, so did London Councils chair Claire Kober. We’ll see. Top of the mayor’s thank you list for now is the £3.15bn the Greater London Authority will receive to help start the building of over 90,000 “affordable” homes by financial year 2020-21. As a single sum, this is the largest yet devolved to a London mayor, though the headline figure is slightly misleading in that it partly confirms funds already agreed as well as including an additional settlement for the future, covering the rest of Khan’s mayoral term. Essentially, City Hall’s share of national spending on housing has been renegotiated and, in all, the capital has now got over £2bn more heading its way than it had before. It’s what the mayor was hoping for, and gives Khan and his team not only more cash but also - thanks to their new best friend, housing and London minister Gavin Barwell - greater flexibility to fund a range of what the mayor describes as “new homes for low cost rent, London Living Rent and shared ownership”. But hear the silence where even Boris Johnson once called for councils to be given more leeway to borrow to build for social rent. A lost cause, for now, it seems. Hammond has also said he will devolve the adult education budget to London government from 2019-20, something else London politicians of more than one party have been in favour of for some time. The same goes for the transfer of the budget for the work and health programme - forthcoming successor to the plain old work programme - to London subject to “meeting certain conditions” (the same arrangement has been made for Greater Manchester, by the way). This should enable London’s boroughs to better help the 19,000 hard-up households to be pinched by the benefit cap. Whitehall, though, is holding on to the money for 16-18 year old skills training. London would like that too. Khan has also welcomed further investment - to the tune of £492m to London and the south-east combined - in the London local enterprise panel, through which the mayor, businesses, the boroughs and Transport for London (TfL) collaborate on facilitating employment and growth and he expressed approval for a £1bn nationwide fund for digital infrastructure. Like Shelter’s Kate Webb, he was pleased by the abolition of letting agency fees (and I gather that City Hall is considering what that means for the mayor’s own, planned not-for-profit lettings agency). But he’s expressed disappointment that nothing was done to make childcare in London more affordable and that control over south London suburban rail is not to be handed down to TfL, though in the latter case he might not be much surprised. Crossrail 2? Nothing doing. Hammond put Birmingham and the “Northern Powerhouse” first, but at least invited capital to produce its business case, which the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry says it is pleased about. Nothing much for London’s GPs and patients either, according to Michelle Drage of their representative body, which says that 35 practices have closed in the capital in the past 12 months and 45 since the last general election. Add to that the complete absence of help across the UK for NHS and social care services as a whole and the outlook for London as it wrestles with the latest reform programme has not been brightened. Meanwhile, local government in general continues to be savaged by cuts. Devolution is good. Pity it sometimes looks like the only way London can make the best of a bad national job."
2016-11-24T09:38:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Philip Hammond defends 'doom and gloom' Brexit forecast,"Philip Hammond has said the government cannot ignore the £59bn black hole in the public finances directly related to Brexit, as pro-leave Tories criticised the economic forecast as overly pessimistic. Speaking after his first autumn statement, where he outlined plans for modest further borrowing to boost investment in infrastructure, Hammond said forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for the costs of leaving the EU were based on a “a very high degree of uncertainty in the circumstances we are in”.
Eurosceptic Conservatives including the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the OBR forecast was “another utter doom and gloom scenario” and criticised the advisory body, which he said “simply hasn’t got anything right”. “The key thing is that the OBR has been wrong in every single forecast they have made so far,” he told Sky News. “On the deficit, on growth, on jobs, they have pretty much been wrong on everything.” Though cautioning that economic forecasting was “not an exact science”, Hammond said the Treasury was preparing for “very challenging fiscal circumstances”. “We should certainly not ignore it but look at it as one of the possible ranges of outcomes we need to plan for. We should note what it says about the strength of our economy, and the OBR has upgraded its forecast for our economic growth this year,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Hammond said the OBR’s forecasts, a £21bn deficit with public debt expected to peak at more than 90% of GDP, were not only based on the uncertainty linked to the Brexit negotiations but also the election of Donald Trump and his attitude to free-trade agreements with the rest of the world. “There’s uncertainty around the future course of policy in the US, uncertainty about global trade, uncertainty about the growth rate of the Chinese economy,” he said. “We should have a plan, and that’s what I outlined yesterday, which both invests in our economy to build on strengths but provides for perhaps a little more rainy day next year and the year after as the OBR forecast says.” The government itself was unable to accurately predict what the outcome of negotiations with the EU would be once the UK triggered the two-year article 50 process for leaving the bloc, Hammond said. “It’s not about what we want the outcome to be. It’s going to be a negotiation. We are going to sit at a table with the representatives of the European Union and no one can say for certain what the outcome of that negotiation will be,” he said. “That’s what creates the uncertainty.”
The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, an arch-Eurosceptic, said the economy had consistently outperformed predictions since the Brexit vote in June and the OBR’s forecasts were “particularly gloomy on the prospects for financial services”. “Suspicion of experts goes back into antiquity. Experts, soothsayers, astrologers are all in much the same category,” he told the BBC. His fellow Tory MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the figures were created by “throwing into a pot and coming up with a set of potential outcomes ... predictions that have come out of the Treasury, the OBR and even the Bank of England have proved to be wildly inaccurate at times”. The Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who chairs the pro-Brexit Change Britain, said: “Predictions for a loss of investment and trade for the next 10 years do not seem credible. “Outside of the EU’s single market we can look forward to an even stronger economy – with better regulation and free trade deals with some of the fastest growing economies in the world. This will benefit businesses large and small and help to create jobs and spread prosperity across the country.” The former Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised the leave campaigners for their attacks on the OBR, tweeting:
Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Today programme the OBR’s forecasts were “considerably more optimistic than those we have from most independent forecasters, and significantly more so than those we have from the Bank of England”.
“We really don’t know very much about where we will be, certainly after 2019,” he said. Speaking earlier on the programme, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Hammond had some wrong economic priorities given the uncertain economic climate. “They have given tax giveaways on capital gains tax, corporation tax, inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and corporation, cutting universal credit to people they call Jams – just about managing – people going into work, looking after their families, doing everything they ask for,” he said."
2016-11-24T10:50:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Autumn statement: what the economists say,"The chancellor Philip Hammond has delivered his first major set-piece on the economy and public finances. Growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were revised down by the the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, while government borrowing was revised up. Six economists give their take on the autumn statement. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte: This statement makes clear that the big theme of economic policy under Hammond will be improving productivity. He wants to send a powerful signal that the UK is open for business and that the government has a plan to grow the economy through this parliament. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: Unsurprisingly, the OBR’s revised forecasts paint a more pessimistic picture of the UK economy. Despite this, in our view the OBR is slightly too optimistic about the UK’s near-term prospects. We think that the outlook for business investment is likely to be materially weaker than the OBR is currently predicting, with higher inflation and continued uncertainty over Brexit likely to stifle business growth intentions over the next year. Yael Selfin, head of macroeconomics at KPMG in the UK: The chancellor proved a bigger spender in his first autumn statement and focused on one of the fundamental challenges facing the UK economy beyond Brexit – productivity. It is a pity that there was not more focus on education. If the government intends to make the UK less reliant on non-UK workers post Brexit, the readiness of the local labour force will need to improve. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, the trade body representing human resources professionals: The economic forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility show that low growth and weak productivity will persist until at least 2018. The forecasts also show that real wage growth over the next two years will be close to zero. Even this may prove optimistic, as continued uncertainty, difficult market conditions, and higher unemployment are likely to constrain firms ability or need to pay more. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturing trade body: Including plant and machinery in the calculation of business rates represents a tax on productive investment that is out of step with international practice. The chancellor’s lack of action on this issue represents another missed opportunity to support long-term capital investment and improve the attractiveness of the UK as a competitive location for manufacturing at a time when both are desperately needed. Martin Ellis, economist at Halifax: The measures announced by the chancellor to boost housebuilding will support reducing the country’s housing shortage, alleviating the upward pressure on house prices and helping to make homes more affordable. The Halifax house price index has shown that annual house price growth has nearly halved from a peak of 10.0% in March this year, but remains robust at 5.2%. Whilst house price growth may ease further in the coming months, low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties available for sale should help support price levels."
2016-11-24T11:44:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Eight charts to help you understand the autumn statement,"A shortfall between government spending and income that reached £155bn in the aftermath of the banking crash was forecast in March this year to fall to £55.5bn in 2016-17. The Office for Budget Responsibility said its forecast was optimistic and it will now be £68bn.
The allocation of more cash for road maintenance, digital infrastructure, and research and development has reversed cuts in government investment spending that formed a large part of the previous chancellor George Osborne’s last austerity budget.
After a deep cut in 2014 followed by a boost last year, departments have been spared further austerity. But with the NHS under extreme pressure and budget reductions for unprotected departments still in place, the squeeze on the state will continue well into the next parliament.
A cap on welfare spending was lifted slightly after an easing of universal credit cuts. The overall bill is expected to continue rising. However, pensions costs, which are outside the cap, are to be kept in check from 2018.
Britain’s national income this year is expected to be slightly higher than the forecast in March predicted, but downgrades for the next two years are expected to deny the government vital tax receipts.
This a key measure of household spending power and watched closely by the Treasury now the economy is driven largely by consumer outlay. Steadily rising inflation is expected to offset wages growth and limit future growth.
Exports have fallen as a proportion of GDP for decades. Forecasts show the ratio is expected to continue to fall, limiting the country’s ability to buy goods from abroad without running up a balance of trade deficit.
For the last six years the government has expected a rise in productivity – the value of products made or sold by a worker in an hour of work – to bolster profits and workers’ earnings. It hasn’t happened. This year the recovery in productivity has been downgraded again."

2016-11-24T13:16:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Drivers on two London Underground lines to strike in December,"A 24-hour strike by drivers on two London Underground lines is to go ahead in early December. The RMT union announced that its drivers on the Piccadilly and Hammersmith and City lines would walk out from the evening of Tuesday 6 December. The strike – in two separate disputes over what the union terms a “wholesale breakdown in industrial relations”, alleging breaches of procedures and bullying and harassment of staff – will coincide with another strike on Southern rail. With 400 Piccadilly line drivers belonging to the RMT, the move is likely to particularly affect services on that line, the fourth busiest on the tube network. Steve Griffiths, London Underground’s chief operating officer, said: “We urge the RMT leadership to work with us constructively on the issues it has raised rather than disrupt our customers with strikes. “The announcement of strike dates is premature given that we have pre-arranged talks planned at Acas tomorrow to discuss the RMT’s concerns on the Piccadilly line, and on the Hammersmith and City line we are waiting for the RMT’s response to our proposals to end that dispute.” Only 43 drivers out of 265 on the Hammersmith and City line voted for strike action, as did just 168 out of 408 Piccadilly line drivers. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said the union remained available for talks in both disputes."
2016-11-24T13:49:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Why did the chancellor stump up Â£7.6m for Wentworth Woodhouse?,"It was one of the few surprises in Philip Hammond’s autumn statement: a £7.6m pledge to save what he described as one of the UK’s most important historic houses – Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham. The chancellor told MPs that the Georgian residence, believed to be the largest private house in the UK, with a 23,000 sq metre (250,000 sq ft) footprint and a 185m facade, was “at critical risk of being lost to future generations”. While hundreds of thousands of visitors flock each year to Chatsworth House, 30 miles down the road in the Peak District, Wentworth Woodhouse is South Yorkshire’s forgotten gem. A public footpath runs along the drive, but the house has only been open to visitors in the last decade or so – though for a short period until the 1980s lucky students from Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) used the mansion as a campus, and after the second world war it served a ludicrously grand training college for PE teachers. (Some of the now rather elderly graduates act as tour guides.) Earlier this year the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust (WWPT) managed to raise £7m to buy the house from its last private owners, the Newbold family, a million under the asking price. But they need many more millions to carry out urgent repairs to safeguard what Hammond called “this key piece of northern heritage”.
The group estimates it will cost £42m over the next 12 to 15 years to fully restore the property to what Marcus Binney from Save Britain’s Heritage calls “a true people’s palace”. But the £7.6m from the government will at least pay for the leaky roof to be fixed and stop the damp from completely ruining the splendid interiors. They hope to eventually open the main interiors and gardens to the public, with the help of the National Trust. They want weddings and special events to take place in the north wing, which was once used as the Sheffield University refectory, and to create offices in the stables. Plans have also been submitted to create 15 residential units in the south wing, which would be used as holiday lets or on shorthold leases to provide an income stream for the WWPT. Clifford Newbold, an architect who was involved in the design of Milbank Tower and Dungeness Lighthouse, had hoped to restore the palace to its Georgian splendour, but he died last year. After buying the estate for just £1.5m in 1999, his family struggled to pay the £500,000 a year it costs to keep the house ticking over.
Their financial woes were compounded when they lost a high court battle with the UK Coal Authority. They claimed over £100m damage had been caused by an opencast mine which was dug in the 250-acre estate from 1947 at the instigation of Emanuel Shinwell, minister of fuel in Clement Attlee’s Labour government – an incongruous sight regarded by Binney as “like holding the Battle of the Somme in front of the Chateau of Versailles”. Hammond’s intervention was welcomed by Rotherham council, which had to make £117m of cuts from its budget from 2010 to 2015 because of the government’s austerity programme, with a further £48m of savings due to be made over the next three years. John Healey, the local Labour MP, said he had lobbied Hammond to make the case for the house. “I met the chancellor personally last month to press the case with the chair of the trust, Julie Kenny, and Conservative MP Robert Jenrick, who is a heritage expert. We’ve been meeting ministers and civil servants behind the scenes for over a year, so I’m delighted that the chancellor today recognised the scale of the challenge in saving Wentworth Woodhouse for the public and backed the huge potential boost it could bring to jobs, businesses and visitors in the north,” he said. Wentworth Woodhouse was originally the home of Charles I’s ill-fated administrator, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who used it for political entertaining. There were 60 family members and servants living in the house in the early 17th century, and it was later home to Charles Watson-Wentworth, a British Whig politician who served twice as prime minister. In 1835, before she became Queen, a young Victoria stayed at Wentworth Woodhouse, which has almost 400 rooms. She was impressed, recording in her diary: “It is a very fine edifice, and is an immense house, it would be impossible for me to attempt even to give anything like a description of it.” According to the Newbolds, in 1841 over 1,000 people were employed directly in occupations ranging from carpenters, masons, joiners and labourers to gardeners, housekeepers, servants and more unusual jobs such as rat-catcher and state bed maker. In 1912 King George V and Queen Mary stayed at Wentworth. Seventy-six bedrooms were required for the royal visit. Despite its regal past, Hammond’s claim to MPs that Wentworth Woodhouse also served as the inspiration for Pemberley in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice has been rubbished by Austen experts. In a statement to the Guardian, the Jane Austen Society said there is no evidence Austen ever went to the house or that a character such as Fitzwilliam Darcy could ever have afforded to live there. • This article was amended on 25 November 2016 to correct the year given for the digging of an opencast mine and the spelling of Emanuel Shinwell’s forename."
2016-11-24T14:27:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Ellie Butler's mother to appeal against child cruelty conviction,"The mother of Ellie Butler, the six-year-old murdered by her father, is appealing against her conviction for child cruelty and perverting the course of justice, the Guardian has learned. Jennie Gray, 36, was convicted in June for her part in Ellie’s death alongside Ben Butler, who was jailed for a minimum of 23 years for murder and child cruelty. The court of appeal has confirmed that Gray lodged a late application for permission to appeal against her conviction earlier this month. Her father Neal Gray has expressed shock and disgust at the appeal. “The news that she is appealing is really adding insult to injury,” said the 70-year-old, from Wallington in Surrey, who together with his late wife, Linda, cared for Ellie for most of her life. “What she is doing is disrespectful to Ellie’s memory. I’m angry and disgusted that she has done this.” Gray has publicly disowned his daughter for her role in Ellie’s death and refuses to refer to her by name. He previously told the Guardian he had not seen her since shortly before Ellie died. “I don’t call her my daughter any more and I never want to see her again,” he said following her conviction. “I hope she gets the strongest possible sentence,” he said. During Butler and Gray’s trial the court heard that Gray ignored bruises, grip marks on Ellie’s neck and a broken shoulder inflicted shortly before she died at home in Sutton, south London, in 2013. A text message she sent to Butler that was read out in court said: “I really do want you more than anything I ever wanted, even more than my children.”
Following the guilty verdict at the Old Bailey, Butler shouted: “I’ll fight for the rest of my life, unbelievable … I want to be sentenced now so I can fight in the appeal court. I will fight forever to prove this wrong. My daughter was jumping in the house. I’m 100% not guilty.” Gray responded: “Big mistake. Spend another 10 years proving you wrong.” Butler was convicted in 2009 for shaking Ellie as a baby, although this was later quashed on appeal. The couple then won a high court judgment to have Ellie returned to their care in 2012. Mrs Justice Hogg had sided with Butler despite objections from police, social services and Neal Gray. He said at the time that the judge would have “blood on your hands”. A serious case review found Sutton Children Services felt “powerless to act” following the high court’s ruling. Sentencing the pair at the Old Bailey in June, Mr Justice Wilkie told a sobbing Gray that she may have been “exceptionally naive and stupid” to believe Butler and take part in the cover-up. He said: “You played your full part in the grotesque charade that was the 999 call whilst subjecting your dead daughter to the indignity of pointless CPR when you knew full well she had been dead for two hours.” In a joint statement written before the trial, Ellie’s grandparents said they had struggled to come to terms with the “shock and horror” of her death. “Ellie was a very beautiful, bubbly and intelligent little girl who always had a smile on her face and even at such a young age she was nobody’s fool. She was our life and she gave so much pleasure to us and our family too. How we all miss her,” they said. Commenting on the news that Gray is appealing against her conviction, a spokesman for the judiciary said: “A single judge will now consider the application based on the papers provided. “As it has been submitted late, the judge would need to consider whether to allow a retrospective late application and then to consider whether permission to appeal should be granted. “If the answer to both of these is ‘yes’ then a hearing would be scheduled to hear the substance of the appeal. There is a way to go before then and there isn’t any indication when a single judge might look at the application.” Neal Gray said he was asked if he could be listed as Jennie Gray’s next of kin but refused. “Neither I nor my son or my other daughter are prepared to be her next of kin,” said Gray. “We don’t want anything to do with her. It sounds harsh because my late wife gave birth to her and she’s my flesh and blood ... My focus now is on fighting for justice for young Ellie.”"
2016-11-24T14:40:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"Let child abuse inquiry do its work, says victim","A member of the victims’ panel on the national child abuse inquiry is calling for critics to let the investigation do its work for the majority of survivors in England and Wales. Chris Tuck, writing in the Guardian, revealed she has suffered vicious trolling on social media amid continued criticism of the management and working of the inquiry. It was, she said, “cruel and cowardly” and was hard not to take personally. Tuck is a member of the victims’ and survivors’ panel on the child abuse inquiry, which was set up to provide victims with a voice in the process.
But she said she was speaking personally as a survivor of all forms of childhood abuse, including neglect and sexual abuse. She indicated there was a silent majority of victims who were supporting the inquiry, and the outspoken critics were putting the process at risk. “The few people who want this inquiry disbanded are robbing the victims and survivors in England and Wales of the opportunity finally to have their voices heard,” she wrote. One of the largest victims’ groups, the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, made up of people who were abused in Lambeth children’s homes, has withdrawn from the inquiry. Tuck said victims who did not want to engage with the inquiry had made a personal choice. “I respect that, but please let the inquiry get on with the job in hand. Damaging the inquiry damages all of us – and we have been damaged enough,” she wrote. The home affairs select committee is publishing a report on Thursday on the independent inquiry, which has been knocked by setback after setback over the last six months. About seven lawyers have left the inquiry including the lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC, his deputy and the lead barrister for the investigation into the Roman Catholic church. Prof Alexis Jay, the fourth chair of the inquiry, has yet to publish details of her review into how the investigation should operate in future. She has said it is unrealistic to hold a public inquiry into every one of the thousands of institutions where abuse is said to have occurred. The inquiry has set up 13 investigations intended to lead to public hearings with witnesses giving evidence on oath. These include investigations into the Catholic church and Church of England, Lambeth council, Medomsley detention centre, Nottinghamshire council, Westminster and the late Lord Janner. The New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard, who quit as inquiry chair in August, promised that up to 25 public hearings would take place, but Jay said the inquiry would commission new investigations “only if we consider they are necessary to fulfil our terms of reference”. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs committee, is to publish letters from the lawyers who have quit the inquiry, including Hugh Davies QC, its former deputy lead counsel, on Thursday. Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP, used parliamentary privilege to name Emmerson as the person accused of an alleged sexual assault at the inquiry’s London headquarters."
2016-11-24T17:07:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenager arrested over double stabbing at Manchester college,"Two students were stabbed on the campus of Britain’s largest further education college as they argued over a girlfriend, it has been claimed. The teenagers sustained knife injuries during a break-time altercation reportedly involving a third teenager. One student, aged 17, was knifed in the chest, the other, aged 18, was stabbed in the back. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in relation to the stabbing. He remains in police custody.According to witnesses at Manchester College the row at about 11am on Thursday may have erupted over the girlfriend of one of the teenagers. After the incident, one victim was seen clutching his chest, with his head on a friend’s knee, and begging for an ambulance to be called. The college was evacuated and lectures were cancelled.
The injured pair were being treated in hospital. Police recovered a knife at the scene. The incident occurred on the college’s Shena Simon campus – one of 18 it operates – as students were having coffee after a morning lecture. Ellie Ducker, 17, from Manchester, who studies drama at the college, said: “There were about four police cars and two ambulances and one other came later. “Everyone was screaming and shouting. One guy was stabbed in the chest and blood was coming down – he said he needed an ambulance. People were ringing the emergency services. Another stabbed in the shoulder. “We were looking out of the window and when we saw it happen we ran downstairs. When we got downstairs, we were told to go back in and had to stay in class. The tutors didn’t know about it until we told them – they didn’t know what to do. “The guy was holding his chest and had his head on someone’s knee. He was saying: ‘I need an ambulance,’ and everyone got their phones out. “It’s a shock, with them being really nice guys, for something like this to have happened.” Another student said: “We were supposed to be staging a theatre production, but it was cancelled and the college evacuated when all this started kicking off. It was over a girl, apparently. It sounds like they were both fighting and have both been stabbed.” The road outside the campus was closed off while officers searched the scene. Ch Insp Gareth Parkin, of Greater Manchester police, said: “We currently have two people with serious injuries in hospital so it is imperative that anyone with information comes forward and helps us with our investigation.
“We have recovered a knife from the scene, which will be forensically examined, but we still need people to contact us with any information they have. “I’d like to reassure the community that we have a number of highly skilled officers working on this investigation and will continue to carry out extensive enquiries.” Lisa O’Loughlin, principal at the college – which has 10,000 full-time and 20,000 part-time students – said the college support team was helping anyone affected by the incident. She added: “An incident occurred this morning at our Shena Simon campus, in which two of our students were injured. We are currently supporting the police with their inquiries. “We have closed Shena Simon campus for the remainder of today and are providing full support to our students and staff at this difficult time.’’"
2016-11-24T17:27:29Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Please help my friends in France,' say Syrian minors allowed in UK","A group of unaccompanied Syrian teenagers who have sought safety in the UK have made an impassioned plea for Britons to accept them “with open arms, not with racism and hate” and help hundreds of other minors who are stuck in France. Omar, a 16-year-old Syrian who arrived in the country about six months ago, urged people against accepting unaccompanied minors into the UK to have empathy. “All you need to do is put yourself in our shoes,” he said. “If you put yourself in our shoes and think about what we went through and think about your children going through this, you might sympathise and understand what it is we really want.” Speaking at an event organised by the Varkey Foundation and Safe Passage UK – which was set up to help the safe and legal entry of unaccompanied child refugees to the UK – 17-year-old Kabir made a plea for unaccompanied minors to be accepted into society. “I am not here by choice; I am here because of war,” he said. “I hope that this country will welcome us with open arms and not with racism and hate. If there is one thing I want to happen in these governmental chambers is that you open a file called chance for Syrian refugees to be integrated – all the refugee children, not just the Syrians.” The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, last week said 318 minors had been brought to the UK, 60 of whom were girls. Of these, 200 – like the teenagers speaking at the event – were brought in under a family reunification programme mandated by the Dublin regulation in EU law, with the remainder transferred under the Dubs amendment.
Charities say about 2,000 unaccompanied minors were registered in Calais before the demolition of the camp there and they are campaigning for 1,000 to be brought over before Christmas, after the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the UK would take half. The Home Office came under attack last week after new, highly restrictive eligibility criteria for child refugees hoping to be transferred from France to Britain were revealed. The rules exclude 16- and 17-year-olds of all nationalities from consideration for transfer to Britain under the Dubs amendment of the Immigration Act. “I am personally very strong-willed and I can make things happen, but there are a lot of children like me who find it very difficult finding information,” said 17-year-old Mohammed. Kabir urged the government to accept other minors trapped in France. “Please help my friends who are stuck in France and cannot get over here: I am anxious about that,” he said. “Your country has been friendly and they have been good, the information has not always been available but if you compare it with what my eyes have seen, I can’t complain,” he said. The experience was very different in France, he added. “I left a war, but I haven’t seen hatred like the hatred from the French. When we used to leave the camp at night, we used to get beaten for no reason.”"
2016-11-24T18:03:16Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland's rail network vulnerable as problems mount, regulator warns","Scotland’s rail network faces mounting problems as performance targets are missed and overspending grows on upgrade work, the rail regulator has warned. In more bad news for Humza Yousaf, the Scottish transport minister, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has predicted even worse problems on the network if there is bad weather this winter. Despite Network Rail cutting a key performance target to make improvements more achievable, a bad winter could further derail its plans because it has no margin left for mistakes or problems.
Yousaf has faced calls to resign after a series of breakdowns on ScotRail services closed rail lines, increased delays and cancellations, and worsened industrial action. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, was repeatedly challenged about the crisis at first minister’s questions on Thursday, as Labour called on the Scottish government to freeze fares next year in light of the poor performance. Sturgeon deflected complaints by insisting ministers were pressing hard for rail improvements, adding that those included 20,000 extra seats a day and 200 new services. She wrong-footed the leader of the Scottish Conservatives by disclosing in an answer to Ruth Davidson that ScotRail, which runs the vast majority of Scotland’s trains, was due to publish its 246-point improvement plan within days. But the Tories hit back by publishing several angry tweets sent out by Yousaf in 2010 and 2011 about the rail services, before and after he became an MSP. In one, sent in late 2011 while he was a parliamentary aide to then first minister Alex Salmond, he branded ScotRail as “#Scotfail” and called for fare cuts.
In its half-yearly report on Network Rail’s performance – which is influenced heavily by Scottish government investment plans – the ORR disclosed that the network has already missed its average punctuality target by 2.5%, forcing it to cut its year-end regulatory goal from 92% to 91% to make it more achievable. In order to meet that aim, the ORR has said Network Rail must meet its targets for the next four months and hope this winter’s weather is no worse than normal. “We have carried out a detailed review of the plan and have concluded that it is robust and that the 91% target is therefore stretching but achievable (assuming an average autumn and winter),” the ORR said. Shedding further light on delays that have beset parts of the network, the ORR said signalling performance “has deteriorated markedly since the beginning of the year, reversing the gains made during the last two years”.
It warned that Network Rail faced the prospect of running out of money, partly because the UK Department for Transport had cut its Scottish borrowing limit to £3.5bn, but also because of project cost overruns. The ORR forecast a £43m budget overspend this year, partly because the Edinburgh-Glasgow improvement project was costing £51m more than expected. The regulator added that Network Rail was delivering the overall rail and electrical line renewal plan ahead of target but was going to again miss an interim target for the electrification of Scotland’s busiest rail line between Edinburgh and Glasgow and its enhancements programme was lagging behind performance in England and Wales. The ORR revealed Network Rail’s difficulties were to blame for 54% of ScotRail’s “delay minutes” and 53% of those for the overnight Caledonian Sleeper services. Sturgeon’s spokesman said the improvement plan was aimed at tackling problems facing passengers and the network. “Clearly the service to the travelling public hasn’t been as good as we would like it to be,” he said. “In overall terms, the rail service in Scotland still compares favourably to other networks across the UK, [but] the mere fact we have an improvement programme is an acknowledgement things need to get better.”"
2016-11-24T18:28:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Andrew Lansley chides chancellor over lack of NHS and social care funding,"The former health secretary Andrew Lansley has joined MPs from across the political spectrum in criticising the autumn statement for its lack of extra funding for the NHS and social care. Lansley, who is now a peer, said he was disappointed there was not extra cash for the health service, which is under increasing pressure because adult social care budgets have been cut. “I think the time is now to put some measure in place to try and help health and social care through the next two years,” he told the BBC’s World at One. Asked whether he had been surprised at the lack of a funding announcement, he said: “Not being surprised doesn’t mean I’m not disappointed.”
He said the NHS and social care were facing an “incredibly difficult” period in the coming years. “In the last parliament a challenging target was set and it was achieved,” he said. “The trouble is in this parliament, what has been asked of the National Health Service is not just more of the same but even more, and I’m afraid what was evident in the last financial year was when you take the level of support for the NHS below a 2% increase – to hospitals, that is – and the demand is rising at 4% there comes a point where they start to go in to significant deficit. “The front-end loading of the money for the NHS in this parliament in to this financial year will probably mean those deficits come down this year, but without action next year and the year after those deficits will rise again and the accumulated deficit will make it very difficult for hospitals in particular to cope.” He said the Better Care Fund, which brought together money from the NHS and social care, amounted to “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. “That is not going to be remedied simply by taking money out of the NHS budget and passing it to local authorities,” he said.
Labour politicians led criticism of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, after his autumn statement for his failure to mention the NHS or social care in his fiscal document or to allocate any more money, instead prioritising infrastructure and projects such as more grammar schools. Some Conservatives also voiced concern, including Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the health committee, who has said NHS and social care are at a tipping point. She and four other members of the health committee have also criticised the government’s claim to be putting an extra £10bn into the NHS by 2020. “The continued use of the figure of £10bn for the additional health spending up to 2020-21 is not only incorrect, but risks giving a false impression that the NHS is awash with cash,” Wollaston and her four fellow committee members told the chancellor in a letter earlier this month."
2016-11-24T19:29:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Afghanistan veteran wins landmark Q fever compensation claim,"An Afghanistan war veteran who contracted Q fever has won a landmark compensation claim against the Ministry of Defence that could pave the way for payouts to others. Phillip Eaglesham, a former Royal Marine commando corporal, contracted the chronic condition two days before he was due to return home from a tour of duty in 2010. He developed flu-like symptoms, fatigue and sweating, which developed into muscular weakness and he is now in a wheelchair. Eaglesham, 35, who lives with his wife and children in Taunton, Somerset, is likely to receive a significant sum in damages, possibly more than £1m. He regularly requires care to help him with needs as basic as brushing his teeth. Q fever, caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, is spread when spores from animals are dispersed by the wind. It was first identified in Australia in the 1930s. Eaglesham’s lawyers argued that the MoD should have known that the infection was present in southern Afghanistan and that it could have prevented it causing serious illness. Treatment with doxycycline antibiotics are effective against Q fever, either as a preventative medication or if prescribed in the early stages of the condition. The US and French military were both using it in Afghanistan at the time, it was said.
A number of other armed forces members who contracted Q fever are understood to be preparing similar claims against the MoD. Sue Bowler, a partner at the law firm Coffin Mew, which represented Eaglesham, said: “Phillip’s case against the Ministry of Defence has been pursued so that he can pay for the specialist care, equipment and housing that he will need for the rest of his life – and to help other military personnel who contracted the same illness in Afghanistan and are also pursuing claims. “Phillip has gone from being a strong, fit Royal Marine to someone with very severe disability, all because of contracting Q fever. It has never been about the money for him, no amount could take away his suffering and that of his family.” The high court ruled in Eaglesham’s favour after the MoD repeatedly failed to file a full defence and provide the court with copies of all documents relevant to the case despite being granted an additional 15 months to compile the materials. Speaking after the judgment, Eaglesham told the BBC: “It would be amazing to have a family life again rather than my wife being my full-time carer.” The veteran competed for Ireland at the Rio 2016 Paralympics and is campaigning for other servicemen and women who have fallen ill through Q fever. An MoD spokesperson said: “We are studying the judgment and it would be inappropriate to comment further.”"
2016-11-24T20:36:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Port murders: police failed to follow up on coroner's concerns,"New evidence has emerged suggesting that police may have missed opportunities to catch Stephen Port, who will be sentenced on Friday after being convicted of murdering four young gay men. The coroner at the June 2015 inquest into the death of Port’s third victim, Daniel Whitworth, 21, raised concerns that someone else may have been involved three months before Port murdered Jack Taylor, 25, his final victim, in September last year. Transcripts from the inquest also revealed police were advised to test items found near Whitworth’s body for DNA but failed to do so, the BBC reported. He was found in a graveyard near Port’s flat. A fake suicide note, written and planted by Port, and a blue bed sheet, would later be found to have Port’s DNA on them.
The coroner, Nadia Persaud, said in her inquest conclusion: “My concerns of a third-party involvement in Daniel coming to be in the graveyard on 20 September cannot be allayed by the evidence that has been produced to the court. “I cannot say beyond reasonable doubt that I am satisfied that he voluntarily took his own life. I also cannot say that I am satisfied that he was unlawfully killed.” She recorded an open verdict. Transcripts obtained by the BBC show that Persaud asked DI Rolf Schamberger whether the bed sheet had been examined, as recommended by a pathologist. He said it had not, adding that the “circumstances at the time indicated towards no other external parties being involved”. “The potential outcome of having the blanket analysed, the bed sheet analysed, could have been to identify maybe where he had been the night before, who had contact with him. But it wasn’t submitted,” Schamberger told the coroner. Whitworth’s body was found by a dog walker in St Margaret’s graveyard in Barking in September 2014, just three weeks after the same dog walker found the body of Gabriel Kovári, 22, in the same location.
The body of Taylor was also found in the graveyard, which is about 500 metres from Port’s flat in Barking, east London. The body of Anthony Walgate – Port’s first victim in June 2014 – was found just outside the communal entrance to his block of flats. Persaud was most concerned by bruises under Whitworth’s armpits, and on his chest and neck, which she said suggested someone may have lifted him and moved him. Schamberger told the inquest that only the contents of a bottle found in a bag with Whitworth’s body had been tested. The bottle, which was found to contain the “date-rape drug” GHB, was later found to have Port’s DNA on it. The detective inspector also revealed that officers had checked the handwriting of the “suicide” note found with Whitworth’s body with one of his diaries, but a handwriting expert was not called in to advise, the BBC reported. The writing on the note was later found to be a match for that of Port. Seventeen officers are being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is reviewing the coroner’s concerns as part of its investigation into the police handling of the case. Port was convicted on Wednesday of 22 offences against 11 men, including four murders, four rapes, four assaults by penetration, and 10 of administering a substance. He was cleared on three counts of rape. He will be sentenced on Friday."
2016-11-24T22:00:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Former abuse inquiry lawyer calls for clarity on alleged sexual assault,"The failure of the independent inquiry into child abuse to explain how it investigated allegations of sexual assault on its premises has undermined its credibility, a former senior lawyer on the investigation has said. Hugh Davies QC said in a letter published by the home affairs select committee that the inquiry’s leadership must provide a clear public explanation of what the allegations were, how they were investigated and what has been done to identify and address future risks. Davies was the only lawyer who commented publicly on the events that have rocked the national inquiry over the past two months, following a request from the committee for written evidence on the departure of a series of high-ranking legal experts. “It is in the public interest that [the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse] IICSA succeeds,” Davies said, and greater clarity on the allegations of sexual assault at the inquiry’s London headquarters would promote the chances of that. All the other lawyers who have left, including the former lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC, his deputy, Elizabeth Prochaska, and another counsel, Toby Fisher, cited confidentiality to the inquiry as a reason not to comment to MPs. The chair of the inquiry, Prof Alexis Jay, refused to waive that confidentiality.
Emmerson was suspended in September and then resigned. Two weeks earlier, Prochaska left the inquiry. Since then, a number of other lawyers have left. Davies, who left the inquiry in 2015, said the lack of any explanation about allegations made by a junior member of staff against Emmerson left “an impression that, rather than investigating … IICSA has reached a de facto compromise agreement … and ended the investigation”. The committee report said the allegations involved claims that Emmerson sexually assaulted an inquiry worker in a lift. He denies the allegations. Davies’ testimony was released as MPs on the committee published a critical report on the troubled investigation, and called for robust action to deal with the allegations and restore public confidence in the inquiry. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the committee, said the inquiry’s response had been “wholly inadequate”. Robust action was needed to restore public confidence, including the appointment of an external person to investigate the case. “Given that the inquiry was set up to challenge institutions for covering up internal problems or ignoring abuses of power, it is crucial that it shows it has a robust and transparent approach to dealing with problems of its own,” she said. Cooper stopped short of supporting calls from fellow Labour MP Chuka Umunna for Jay to step down in favour of a senior judge, but, she said, “the inquiry needs to get back on track … it is too important to be sunk by problems … urgent action is needed to sort them out.” She criticised delays in setting up the Truth Project and holding public hearings, which showed a “significant weakness” in engaging with survivors.
Cooper called for the inquiry to appoint a new counsel as a priority and to consider splitting its work into two strands; a forensic, lawyer-led investigation to establish the truth about past institutional abuse, and a second strand looking at thematic issues around child protection. The report was published as a person from the survivors panel, which was set up as part of the inquiry, called for it to be allowed to get on with its job. Chris Tuck said she had suffered vicious trolling on social media by some survivors that was hard not to take personally. “The few people who want this inquiry disbanded are robbing the victims and survivors … of the opportunity to finally have their voices heard,” she said. Davies said that despite confidentiality issues he was able to comment in the interests of transparency on the allegations of bullying and sexual assault matters that had been in the public domain. When taken together, they left a negative impression, which was compounded by unofficial briefings from inquiry sources in the media that undermined the alleged victim’s account. “I would criticise any failure by an institution to act, and IICSA must expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others,” he said. “IICSA will investigate and make findings on institutions that have put reputational advantage ahead of a duty to investigate, including the use of compromise agreements with the subject of disclosure. If that is what has occurred here, the reputational harm to IICSA is obvious. If it is not, it is in IICSA’s interests to correct this impression.” Any disclosure of bullying or sexual assault relating to the conduct of a senior member of staff towards a more junior employee, whether it was a formal complaint or not, amounted to abuse of power, he wrote. “History demonstrates that, where bullying or other abuse reflects an imbalance of power between individuals, it is more likely to be repeated,” he added. Jay said in a statement: “We recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry, and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it. I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.” She said the inquiry would appoint an external senior legal figure to review some of the issues raised in the committee’s report."
2016-11-25T00:01:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police heavily criticised over child protection failings,"Britain’s biggest police force has suffered a humiliating rebuke from an official watchdog for failing to protect children and for delays in investigating fears about adults who attack and exploit the young. The Metropolitan police, which prides itself on being a leader in law enforcement, was found to be so inadequate in so many areas it will now face emergency measures.
The report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary examined a sample of child protection cases, numbering about 384, and found that three-quarters were substandard. Matt Parr, lead inspector for HMIC, said the failings were systemic and involved errors in leadership, training, organisation and judgment. “They have really dropped the ball on child protection,” he said. HMIC announced fresh follow-up inspections for the force and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, promised crisis measures, saying: “This deeply troubling report has found that, too often, children in our city have been let down when they are most in need. This is simply unacceptable and things must change.”
Inspectors from HMIC were aghast at some of the failings they uncovered. In one case, the Met was warned by a child protection agency about a man uploading indecent child images to the internet. Police took 96 days to get a search warrant to seize the suspect’s computer. The Met then had to be told by HMIC to take action after it spotted the failing. Even then it took three months for the force to act. The inspectorate said the Met had failed in the case of a 10-year-old girl – who had witnessed her father attacking her mother with a screwdriver and raping her – amid further concern that the child could herself have been attacked and abused by the man.
From cases of sexual exploitation to holding too many children in police cells to “serious concerns about the force’s response to missing and absent children”, the watchdog castigated the Met.
One detective protecting children was not trained to do so, nor had trained as a detective. Some parts of the force knew too little about convicted sex offenders living in their areas. The report is one of the last covering the commissionership of the Met by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. He is due to retire in February next year. Parr said: “We found serious errors of judgment, inconsistency, unacceptable delays and a lack of leadership which meant that children are not being protected properly. Far too many of the cases we looked at fell well short of expected standards and meant that victims weren’t protected, evidence was lost and offenders continued to pose a risk to children.” Themes in the report echo longstanding concerns about the Met which have said that while it can be world beating in tackling high-end crimes such as murder, kidnaps and terrorism, it can be worse than other forces in dealing with more everyday crime and slow to recognise failings.
The child protection report said: “HMIC referred 38 cases back to the force, because we considered they contained evidence of a serious issue of concern – for example, failure to follow child protection procedures and/or a child at immediate risk of significant harm. The force responded to the concerns raised by inspectors in these cases, either by taking action or providing an updated assessment. However, there was still a failure by some staff to recognise wider investigative or safeguarding opportunities.” HMIC found the Met was kidding itself about how well it was doing; in 76 cases studies where the force believed it was doing a good job, the real figure was 22. The Met had seen that it was failing in 24 cases that were studied but HMIC said the real figure was four times higher – about 101 cases. In one instance, the Met rated itself as “good” in a case where a 30-year-old man had groomed a teenage schoolgirl with alcohol and cigarettes, who suffered sexual assaults. HMIC discovered police took 17 days before passing the case to an officer to investigate and rated the Met as “inadequate”. Crime targets from the era when Boris Johnson was London’s mayor were highlighted by HMIC: “We were told in interviews that the focus was on these crimes as opposed to child protection. This requires urgent correction.” The Met accepted the report in its headline messages, but in parts appeared defiant. The force said: “Since the HMIC inspection, we have revisited all the cases they examined. We have identified no further harm to children and no further offenders have been charged or cautioned as a result.”
The Met said defended itself against the criticism aboutholding children in police cells: “All custody cases reviewed by HMIC were cases where the child had been charged. In many circumstances, there is simply no suitable accommodation where these children can be placed, a fact acknowledged by HMIC within the main body of their report.” London’s mayor said he would parachute in national experts as part of a special panel to oversee changes in the Met and discuss the failings with the home secretary. Both will soon interview and then choose by February 2017 the next commissioner of the Met. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said: “It is deeply worrying that the Met has not yet got to grips with the way it tackles child abuse and sexual exploitation. Its delay in doing so will have blighted the lives of many thousands of London’s children whose abuse has gone undetected by the authorities tasked with protecting them.” Parr, who before joining HMIC had been in the Royal Navy and commanded the Trident nuclear submarine fleet, said there were no comparisons to be drawn with Operation Midland, the discredited Met inquiry into claims of historic sexual abuse by members of the establishment."
2016-11-25T07:00:56Z,uk-news,UK news,UK immigration centres record 218 hunger strikers in three months,"More than 200 detainees in UK immigration centres staged hunger strikes in a three-month period, the Guardian has learned, prompting warnings of “desperation, frustration and helplessness” among asylum seekers arriving in Britain. According to figures released following a Freedom of Information request, 218 people refused to eat in July, August and September this year. It is thought to be the first time data revealing hunger strikes in detention centres has been made public. Human rights campaigners said some of those striking wanted to die from starvation, while others were refusing food to protest their incarceration or urge reconsideration of their immigration application. The data was obtained by No Deportations, an organisation that provides signposting information to people who are subject to immigration controls, after a lengthy battle with Home Office, which had declined to release the information. A further FoI request by No Deportations revealed that over the same period there were 109 suicide attempts with 649 detainees on suicide watch. Approximately 30,000 people are detained each year, meaning that over a three-month period the numbers detained are likely to be about 7,500.
The highest number of detainees on hunger strike was 66, at Brook House near Gatwick airport. The detention centre also had the highest number of people on suicide watch – 106. Theresa Schleicher, the acting director of the charity Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of people in immigration detention, said: “Medical Justice is concerned about the high numbers of detainees refusing food and/or fluids revealed in response to this FoI request. It illustrates the degree of desperation, frustration and sense of helplessness. “We are frequently contacted by detainees who are refusing food and/or fluids. Their reasons vary and sometimes overlap: some have mental or physical health problems that mean they do not or cannot eat.” She added: “Some express a wish to die by not eating. Some feel their case has not been properly considered and hunger striking is the only way to make their voice heard. Some are protesting against their detention. Several of the hunger strikers we have seen have later been found to have been unlawfully detained and were found to have valid protection claims.” The Home Office finally agreed to release the data after an appeal against non-disclosure was made to the information commissioner. The commissioner found that the Home Office had breached the Freedom of Information Act by failing to complete its public interest test considerations within a reasonable time period. In its response when providing the information on hunger strikes, the Home Office said: “Competent individuals (ie those that have been assessed as having mental capacity) are considered to be engaged in a food and/or fluid refusal when they fail to partake in scheduled meals for a period of 48 hours (for food) or 24 hours (for fluids), and have not been confirmed as eating food and/or taking fluid from another source (ie items purchased from an IRC shop) and have stated that their reasons for not eating or drinking is as a result of a protest or other grievance.” In its response to the separate FoI about suicide attempts, it said: “All incidents of self-harm are treated very seriously and every step is taken to prevent incidents of this nature. “Staff at all centres are trained to identify those at risk of self-harm so that action can be taken to minimise the risk. Notices in various languages are displayed in immigration removal centres setting out that where there is a concern about a fellow detainee this should be brought to the attention of a member of staff.”"
2016-11-25T09:31:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Lawyer to investigate abuse inquiry's response to sexual assault claims,"An external lawyer is to investigate how the national child abuse inquiry investigated allegations of sexual assault on its premises. Prof Alexis Jay responded to calls from MPs for an independent examination of what was done to investigate claims made by a junior member of staff of assault by the former senior counsel to the inquiry.

2016-11-25T10:57:47Z,uk-news,UK news,St Paul's not consulted on development that mars cathedral view,"St Paul’s Cathedral has said it was not notified or consulted about the construction of a skyscraper that mars a centuries-old view of Sir Christopher Wren’s famous landmark, and expressed concern that the development was allowed to go ahead despite it apparently breaking planning rules. Conservationists this week called on the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to take action against Manhattan Loft Gardens, a 42-storey tower in Stratford, east London, which they say compromises the view of St Paul’s from King Henry’s Mound in Richmond Park.
Designed by SOM and described on its website as “Europe’s most ambitious residential tower”, it comprises three extensive sky gardens, a 145-bedroom hotel, almost 250 residential units and retail and restaurant space. The charity Friends of Richmond Park said that under the London Plan, the capital’s overarching planning document, the London view management framework (LVMF) states that any development affecting the view of St Paul’s should be “subordinate to the cathedral and that the clear sky background profile of the upper part of the dome remains”. Oliver Caroe, surveyor to the fabric at St Paul’s, said the cathedral was not notified or consulted on the planning application for the development project in 2011 via the referral methods stipulated by the Greater London Authority and the LVMF. “Chapter has always recognised that the protected views of strategic landmarks have been designated for the benefit for all Londoners,” he said. “We are privileged in this generation to play our part, with others who are concerned for the built environment, in safeguarding Sir Christopher Wren’s visionary landmark which contributes so enduringly to our identity as a city and society.
“In this case we observe that LVMF requires that, from the protected view from King Henry VIII’s Mound in Richmond Park, developments ‘should preserve or enhance the viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate the dome of the cathedral … it is essential … that the clear sky background profile of the upper part of the dome remains’. “Therefore it is reasonable for the public and statutory authorities to be concerned about the SOM Stratford development. We have been advised that the policy is expressly to safeguard the clear skyline view of the landmark and there is no limit to the distance behind the dome of the cathedral where the wider setting consultation area ceases to apply. “We hope the experts in the field of view protection will clarify and confirm this interpretation and expectation.”
St Paul’s said it supported calls for a management and visualisation tool such as a 3D model that would assist in preserving cherished views in London. “We would further welcome the opportunity to engage with all parties in the planning system to improve training and awareness to ensure that the heritage assets and views of strategic landmarks, which the GLA and the London mayor has designated, operate effectively,” Caroe said. The chairman of Friends of Richmond Park, Ron Crompton, has written to Khan, calling for an urgent investigation into how GLA officers came to grant planning permission for the Manhattan Loft Gardens development in contravention of the LVMF. Historic England, the UK’s statutory adviser on heritage, has also protested against the development and said it was not consulted. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan Loft Corporation said the developer went through a transparent and public process to gain planning permission, adding that that maps of the LVMF protected view indicated that the background area to be protected beyond St Paul’s was 1.86 miles (3km). The new tower is 4.35 miles (7km) away. “As planning approval was achieved [on] 18 July 2011, we were never asked about the LVMF background view impact,” she said. “However, SOM has a long history of working with the St Paul’s view corridors and the more recent London Plan LVMF document.” A spokesman for Khan said: “We are currently looking into the issues involved with this development.”"

The identity of the youngster is unknown and police are appealing for help to trace the “desperately ill” boy’s family. A member of the public called police after the teenager was found in Wythenshawe Road, near Wythenshawe Park, at 10.30pm on Thursday. Police and paramedics attended the scene to find the boy still unconscious. He was taken to hospital in an ambulance where his condition was described as critical. The incident was not being treated as suspicious and officers said the youngster, aged between 12 and 15 with blond hair, had not been attacked. He is described as white, of slim build, with green/blue eyes and skin grafts on his upper legs. He was wearing a blue Penguin-brand jacket, grey sweatshirt, black tracksuit bottoms, black socks and blue trainers. DI Mark Astbury, of Greater Manchester police’s city of Manchester division, said: “This young boy is in a serious condition and we want to reunite him with his family. I would like to appeal to parents who have not seen their son or anyone who has concerns about a friend who matches this description to contact us. “I would also urge anyone who was in the area at the time and has any information that can help identify this young lad to come forward.”"

Most of the buildings in the historic centre of Edinburgh, a Unesco world heritage site since 1995, are in urgent need of maintenance work. Repairs are needed to crumbling stonework, corroded ironwork, rotten window frames and walls sodden from broken gutters. A survey by the charity Edinburgh World Heritage, together with the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, found that 72% of the buildings in the historic centre are in need of repair, the result of a backlog of neglected maintenance. Climate change is likely to exacerbate the problem, the charity says, with studies showing that both rainfall and temperature in Edinburgh are rising, increasing the stress on historic buildings, their energy consumption, and thereby their carbon footprint.
Adam Wilkinson, director of the charity, says that although people assume development is the greatest threat to the historic buildings, poor maintenance and neglected repairs are actually doing more damage. The survey covered 202 buildings in three streets including tourist-crowded Canongate, and found 172 in need of repair. Most were privately owned tenements, in multiple ownership or with renting tenants, making agreeing maintenance and repairs more difficult. Almost half the buildings, 42%, had vegetation sprouting from neglected gutters and stonework, the single most visible sign of the damage being caused."
2016-11-25T12:30:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Report exposing Met police failings on child sex abuse 'shocking',"The minister for policing has described the official watchdog’s report exposing the Metropolitan police’s failings on tackling child sex abuse cases as “the most damning of any report they had ever written on any police force in the country”. Brandon Lewis said the findings of the report by Her Majesty’s Inspection of Constabulary were shocking, and said the home secretary, Amber Rudd, had ordered the publication of quarterly follow-up inspection reports into how Britain’s police were tackling the issue. Lewis was responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who said the Met’s failings together with the “crumbling” nature of the official inquiry into sex abuse raised serious questions about the government’s commitment to tackling child sex abuse.
The HMIC report said hundreds are children were being left at risk of sexual exploitation and rape because of systemic failings by Britain’s biggest police force. Three-quarters of child protection and abuse cases were poorly handled and involved shocking failures including errors in leadership, training, organisation and judgment. Among the worst examples was a failure to interview a 10-year-old girl who may have been abused by her father and who had witnessed her mother being raped and stabbed with a screwdriver. In the Commons, Abbott said the report, following another damning review, had found numerous errors in Scotland Yard’s Operation Midland investigation, in a week in which the largest group of survivors, the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, had withdrawn from the child sex abuse inquiry. “This is a shocking report. The home secretary cannot hide behind the mayor. Looking at child sex abuse in its totality, looking at how the child sex abuse inquiry seems to be crumbling, the public would be forgiven for asking how seriously does this government really take the issue of child sex abuse.” But the policing minister insisted in the Commons that ministers were tackling the issue. He said the HMIC report was “the most damning report that the HMIC has ever written on any police force in the country”. Lewis told MPs the home secretary had spoken to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on Thursday to ensure that “swift action” followed its damning verdict and had asked HMIC to publish quarterly reports detailing what, if any, progress was made by the Met police. He said it would be a priority for the incoming Met commissioner in the new year. The Met’s assistant commissioner, Martin Hewitt, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the force accepted the HMIC’s findings. “There is no doubt that level of inadequacy is something that is really troubling,” he said, adding that the report would be a “launchpad for change”. Matt Parr, lead inspector for HMIC, said his team found shocking failures and pointed out that in more than 10% of cases problems were so alarming there was ongoing risk to child safety. “We had to send 38 of them straight back to the Met immediately because of the severity of what they contained of leaving children at risk,” he told Today. But Hewitt said none of the 38 urgent cases had resulted in criminal charges. “We set a team up as soon as we became of the findings to look at every one of those cases. In all of those cases that were sent back that were so worrying to the HMIC, we have looked at all of those, and in none of those cases have we identified further risk, and we haven’t charged or cautioned anyone,” he said."
2016-11-25T12:35:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Two homeless people found dead after fire in Manchester's Chinatown,"Two homeless people who had been trying to keep warm in freezing conditions in Manchester have died after a fire ripped through a building in the city’s Chinatown, yards from the quarter’s imperial arch. A fleet of fire engines were sent to tackle the flames, which illuminated the decorative gateway at the peak of the blaze and blocked city centre roads. At just after 11.30am on Friday police announced that they had found two bodies inside the burnt-out building. It is understood the two people, a man and another who remains unidentified, were homeless and may have lit a fire to keep warm. The bodies were found on the first floor of the building in Nicholas Street, which is known locally as a place where homeless people have slept rough in the past. Police said they were working to establish the identity and age of the victims, which they said could prove difficult due to the nature of their injuries. The huge blaze began at about 2.15am and threatened to cause disruption as shoppers headed out to grab Black Friday shopping deals. Ch InspGareth Parkin, from Greater Manchester police, said: “These are tragic circumstances and we are working to identify the people who were found in the building.” Police have launched a joint investigation with Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS) to to establish how the fire started.
Phil Nelson, group manager of GMFRS, said: “Crews are still working hard to extinguish the building. We’re using two aerial appliances which have worked well in containing the fire and preventing spread to other buildings.” At its peak, the blaze lit up the Chinatown arch and caused severe damage to the building. Fire crews were tackling the incident from a distance to avoid falling debris, amid fears the structure could collapse. The blaze was contained by about 6am but Portland Street, Princess Street and Faulkner Street remained closed and anyone travelling to the area was urged to find alternative routes. The fire was contained to the building and it is believed there is no fire damage to other buildings. Between 10 and 15 firefighters would remain on scene for the next few hours. Manchester borough manager Paul Etches said the building was unsafe and had been unoccupied for some time. He added that the key priority was to make sure there was no one else in the building."
2016-11-25T13:09:21Z,uk-news,UK news,"Â£5,000 in mispaid housing benefit 'used to fund Isis terror cell'","More than £5,000 in mispaid housing benefit was used to fund an Islamic State terror cell linked to the Paris and Brussels attacks, a court has heard. Belgian national Anaour Haddouchi left Birmingham to join the terrorist organisation in Syria in the summer of 2014, and was joined by his Belgian wife a few months later, lawyers said. Kingston crown court heard that Haddouchi and his wife let their home in Small Heath through an agency called Golden Estates when they left the country. It was claimed the letting agent wrote to Birmingham city council on 12 January last year to say that Haddouchi had left the property three weeks earlier and asked to cancel the council tax liability. However, the court heard that details of the tenancy termination were not passed to the Benefits Service, which kept paying housing benefit for another year. Between 21 December 2014 and 1 November 2015, housing benefit of £5,413.06 was paid into a joint account in the name of Haddouchi and his wife, Julie Maes. After their departure, two men allegedly accessed the couple’s account in Birmingham and handed the cash over to Mohamed Abrini in a park in Small Heath, in July 2015. Abrini, who is charged with involvement in the Brussels airport attacks in March this year, has been dubbed the “Man in the Hat” due to the headgear he is seen wearing in CCTV footage. Haddouchi had opened an Islamic current account with Lloyds Bank in November 2009 and added his wife as joint holder in January 2010, the court heard. On 20 May 2015, a person claiming to be Haddouchi made a telephone call to Lloyds reporting his debit card as lost. Although the bank was unable to complete security checks, it issued a new debit card that was sent to the Small Heath property. Prosecutors claimed the call was made by Mohammed Ali Ahmed, who later visited the property and convinced the new tenant to hand over any letters for Haddouchi. Ahmed then withdrew a total of £5,050 from the account in 16 instalments of £300 and one of £250, the court heard. Over the course of a month between 30 May and 30 June, he visited cash machines at Barclays, the Post Office, Tesco, Morrisons, TSB and Nationwide in Small Heath, Sparkbrook and Yardley Wood. The bank account details showed he was receiving £238.20 a fortnight in housing benefit and £136.20 a month in child benefit. Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said the money was for destined for Isis – either to Haddouchi himself, or other fighters. “The intention could not be more clear,” he told the court. Mohammed Ali Ahmed, 27 and a British national, has admitted withdrawing money from Haddouchi’s account and meeting Abrini in the park. Belgian national Zakaria Boufassil, 26, was with him for the handover. Both deny helping to prepare acts of terrorism. Abrini received £3,000 from Ahmed and Boufassil during his visit to Birmingham on 11 July last year, it is alleged. Abrini is facing charges that he was involved in the Paris attacks four months later that killed 130 people, and the Brussels bombings in March 2016 in which 32 people died. He became notorious when CCTV images of him emerged wearing a distinctive hat and pushing a luggage trolley at the airport. Later in the day the court heard that Abrini also visited Manchester and took a tour of the Manchester United stadium while on a visit to Britain to collect funds. Abrini had flown into the UK from Turkey, after crossing over the border from Syria, and made his way to Birmingham by coach. He was then supposed to fly on to Paris but instead of continuing his mission, Abrini diverted to Manchester to get the onward flight. When he got there, he went to Old Trafford to see the stadium and took photographs later found on his phone. At about 3.20pm on 14 July, Abrini took a picture near the entrance to the stadium and close to the statue of former United manager Sir Matt Busby. There were then about 30 images taken during tour of the stadium over the next two hours. The last image was taken at 5.45pm of a white Porsche Cayenne parked on the pavement outside the Hotel Football near the stadium. Abrini stayed the night in Manchester and the next day he went to the Arndale Centre, where he went to Thomas Cook to change some money and to book his flight. In the event, all the flights to Paris were full so he was forced to return to Birmingham once again. Abrini also made six visits to casinos during his week-long visit, including two in Manchester – the Grosvenor and Genting – and Grosvenor casinos in Victoria in London and in Birmingham. Haddouchi travelled by Eurotunnel from Folkestone to Calais on 12 August 2014 and then flew from Amsterdam to Istanbul, Turkey and made his way to Syria where he allegedly joined Isis. Maes left Britain in September 2014 and made her way to Syria to join her husband, the court heard."
2016-11-25T13:34:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Richmond Park byelection: what exactly is it for?,"As our South West train pulled out of busy Vauxhall station, Tim Farron - pleasant manner, daybreak coffee, Preston accent - set out his case for what the Richmond Park byelection is about. “Any byelection, any kind of election, is about what the electorate says it’s about,” he said. We were heading for Richmond station, travelling against the morning peak travel flow. It was, the Liberal Democrats leader thought, the seventh time he had struck out for the famously handsome London suburban town since his party picked a candidate to try to boot the famously handsome Zac Goldsmith out of his famously handsome Richmond Park parliamentary seat. “My sense is that Heathrow expansion was, of course, the big thing that everyone talked about in the first week,” Farron went on. He had a point, of course. Indeed, the byelection is only happening because Goldsmith chose to keep a promise he made to Richmond Park electors when challenging the then Lib Dem incumbent Susan Kramer during the 2010 general election campaign that he would, if elected, resign and re-fight the seat as an independent should a Conservative government go back on the promise that had been made by the then shiny new party leader David Cameron in 2009 that if he became prime minister Heathrow airport would not be expanded, “no ifs, no buts”. But Goldsmith isn’t the only candidate against expansion. The Lib Dems as a party are too. And while Labour appears in favour despite the reluctance of its leader, its Richmond Park hopeful is not. Farron argued that it is the seat’s electorate that has pushed the airport down the pecking order of issues, though given that the Tories aren’t running a candidate, leaving the case in favour of expansion unmade in local hustings or media debate, it’s hard to see how it could have gone anywhere else. “It’s not off the agenda, but people don’t seem to think this byelection is going to shift the dialogue on that, because all the candidates are against it,” Farron reasoned. “Whereas the thing that is going to have the most lasting and significant impact on peoples’ lives is Brexit and the nature of it, if it happens.” Note that pregnant “if”. The Lib Dems, historically super-europhile and down to just eight MPs, have said that unless the government promises British voters a second referendum on the deal it strikes at the end of negotiations over the terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, it will vote against the triggering of those negotiations through the formal mechanism of article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. With this stance, Farron’s party is effectively seeking to claim the 48% who voted to remain in the EU as their own. That’s 48% nationally, of course. In the borough of Richmond-upon-Thames remain took a massive 69.3% of the vote, one of the highest shares in 60% remain-backing Greater London. The scope for the byelection to be - or be seen as being - a sort of local referendum on the Brexit one is down to Goldsmith, representing one of the borough’s two constituencies, being a noted leaver. Moreover, he is one who has sustained damage to his formerly almost saintly reputation thanks to his shockingly negative and deservedly disastrous London mayor campaign just a few months ago, which sought to create anxiety over his Labour rival Sadiq Khan being Muslim. It also offers the Lib Dems hope of recovery from its recent, miserable electoral decline. Goldsmith’s defeat of Kramer in 2010 was the start of the collapse of a strong Lib Dem position in this region of Greater London, where the party has since lost three more of the five seats they once held to Conservatives. They also lost control of Richmond Council to the Tories in 2010. Kingston went the same way four years later. Sutton Council and the parliamentary constituency of Carshalton and Wallington are all that’s left of the old orange riviera. Across the capital as a whole the party has just 113 councillors out of 1,851 and one member of the 25-strong London Assembly. They are, though, taking heart from a generally increasing vote share in borough byelections since the general election and from gaining a Richmond council seat in the neighbouring Twickenham constituency last July. With Labour in parliament all over the place on Brexit, Farron hopes to build nationally on the big swing they secured at the Witney byelection in October. That’s why he’s been willing to trundle from Vauxhall through Clapham Junction and Putney to Richmond so often. Outside the destination station, Lib Dem activists handed local commuters a four-page spoof of Square Mile free sheet City AM to alarm them on their journeys into town. “Britain’s Brexit Black Hole” bellowed the front page, along with a snapshot of Nigel Farage and his giant gob and the news that “Ukip Backs Zac (see page two)”. On the pavement, candidate Sarah Olney sought engagement. She’s 39, lives locally and works as an accountant at the National Physical Laboratory in nearby Teddington, a world-renowned metrology centre. That means it’s good at measuring thing. Dimwits, it appears, need not apply. Though it was cold, Olney was sunny-bright despite the Surrey Comet - Richmond is in that zone of ambivalence where the metropolis and the Home Counties meet - reporting that her husband had worked for Heathrow between 2003 and 2007 on Terminal 5. The Lib Dems say the project had already been signed off and that Olney’s husband has subsequently turned down work connected with plans for a third runway at the airport. On the wide pavement, a man of South Asian appearance with a professional manner and businesslike attire talked to Olney for an animated couple of minutes about Brexit and his disquiet over the Goldsmith mayoral campaign, which tried to persuade Hindus and Sikhs to reject Khan, before dashing for his train. The candidate then stood with Farron for a smart phone video shoot: “It’s eight days until a byelection that could change the direction of our country,” her leader said. Next stop, a short uphill trip through avenues of elegant terraces, was the Vineyard primary school, where, as young scholars scootered by, Olney was told by a local woman accompanying a child for a friend that though she leaned towards Conservatives she’d go Lib Dem this time. Goldsmith’s mayoral tactics came up again. One of the school’s governors told her in a friendly way that he was disappointed that an eight-page Lib Dem publication called Park Life failed to mention education. “We’ve got rid of all the so-called fat,” he said, speaking of straining budgets. “We’ve only got people left to cut.” Olney conceded that he had a point about the campaign literature, though she can certainly claim that she is going big on another cuts issue, the funding of the NHS. The school stands near the lip of the Terrace Gardens on Richmond Hill close to the Thames from where, on a clear day, you can see Windsor Castle. Down the slope in the Hollyhock Cafe, to a background of baby yowls and coffee machine hiss, Farron and Olney communed with locals, mostly women, both young and older. Goldsmith took 58.2% of the vote in 2015, with more than triple the number of crosses in boxes the Lib Dem candidate secured in finishing second. Can she possibly overturn such a majority? An opinion poll conducted near the end of October gave Goldsmith 45% to Olney’s 22%. After she’d chatted with some voters I asked her what she would consider a good result. Naturally, she said she’s going all out to win. But: “I’m fairly sure that we can take a big chunk out of his majority, and I hope that would be enough to send a message if we didn’t win.” That message would be that “Theresa May is going to lose seats if she pursues a hard Brexit” and that, with “Labour in disarray, it’s the Lib Dems she needs to look out for, rather than Ukip.” Much of the Richmond Park landscape seems timeless, with its riverside communities and royal herd of deer, but its political map is hard to read with certainty as byelection day of 1 December nears. New Statesman’s Stephen Bush has written that, contrary to common belief, there is strong evidence that Goldsmith “has no personal vote worth talking about” and that any he did have will have been weakened by his Brexit stance and that toxic mayoral campaign. As Bush observed, Richmond Park contains many of the types of higher-educated Londoners likely to have been turned off by both. This seems underlined by Sadiq Khan’s taking the lion’s share of second preference votes in the mayoral vote, which made his winning margin overwhelming rather than just very large. The decision of the local Green Party to stand aside in favour of Olney ought to help her too. And she has made the calculation that going a bit further than her party over the article 50 vote will be another factor in her favour: she says she’ll vote against it regardless of what it says or any promise of a second referendum and is seeking “a personal mandate” for doing so. Christian Wolmar, an Islingtonian running for Labour from an HQ in Sheen Lane in Mortlake, takes a more flexible stance. “I think it’s a disaster that we’ve chosen to leave the EU,” he says. “My instinct is that I would vote against article 50 as an MP. I certainly couldn’t vote for some single-line bill. But if there was more detail, I’d consider voting for it depending on what it said.” Wolmar, who made a genuinely grassroots bid to become Labour’s mayoral candidate, says he’s encouraged by the doorstep response he’s been getting in a seat where his party has become accustomed to finishing a distant third “People are so pleased to see a Labour candidate,” he says. “There’s been a lot of anti-Tory tactical voting here.” Wolmar declines to define what a good result for him would be, but says he aims to at least establish a good Labour base in Richmond Park for the future. He mocks a comment by Olney that she would not have been helped had Labour too decided not to field a candidate because that would have linked her by association with Jeremy Corbyn. “Labour voters associate the Lib Dems were being in coalition with the Tories, the bedroom tax and all the rest of it,” he says. Olney is very new to politics, having only joined the Lib Dems last summer. In the cafe she talked observantly about local housing issues, noting the needs of older people and the migration of their sons and daughters to Croydon or Staines because property prices are so very high, but Wolmar claims the Lib Dems will regret her inexperience, citing an uncomfortable Evening Standard interview. The other large part of the Richmond Park equation and by far the oddest is what exactly is in it for Goldsmith. With various prominent Tories out supporting him, his campaign looks more like that of the Heathrow dissident wing of London and Home Counties Conservatism being indulged by the Tory mothership than a truly independent one. Goldsmith said a year ago that he regrets his promise to bring about a byelection over Heathrow. Earlier this month, he said that he regrets the direction his mayoral campaign took. Keeping his Heathrow pledge might be seen as demonstrating that he is, after all, the man of principle he and his admirers have kept insisting that he is. By contrast, it might be seen as his last chance to salvage what’s left of that reputation. Should he lose next Thursday, his portfolio of regrets will be complete.

2016-11-25T14:14:21Z,uk-news,UK news,SFO expands Rolls-Royce inquiry over Iraq bribery allegations,"The Serious Fraud Office inquiry into Britain’s engineering giant Rolls-Royce was expanded earlier this year over suspicions the company was involved in bribery in Iraq, new documents have revealed. Papers filed at the high court in London show how the four-year SFO investigation into Rolls-Royce took a fresh turn in March when investigators arrested a man at a British airport. This led the SFO to begin looking at Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil and gas firm, which is accused of paying bribes on behalf of dozens of multinational firms, including Rolls-Royce, to help them win contracts. The documents reveal the SFO’s investigation into Unaoil was, in part, sparked by suspicions it had acted corruptly on behalf of Rolls-Royce over its business dealings in Iraq since 2005. The new documents have been filed as part of a legal dispute between the SFO and Unaoil. A court hearing into the dispute is due to start on Thursday. In its claim, Unaoil describes how a businessman working for its firm was arrested at a British airport in March. According to the claim, the SFO at this time opened its criminal investigation into Unaoil which the anti-fraud agency alleges was involved in “serious fraud and corruption” and does not conduct “any legitimate lawful business”.
Unaoil has flatly denied the corruption claims, adding that some of the information that formed the basis of the allegations against it “has been gathered as a result of criminal activity including extortion”. According to the court documents, the two cheques worth £950,000 and £925,000 – found on the arrested man – appear to have been from Unaoil and had been made payable to a company that was believed by the SFO to be owned by a suspected Iraqi agent. In its submission, the SFO claims emails were found that “support a strong suspicion of an ongoing corrupt relationship” involving Unaoil. Unaoil argues that the cheques were dated 2013 and 2014 and had expired without being cashed and “therefore could not have been evidence of any past or ongoing criminality”. The SFO counters that the cheques could still be cashed for up to six years. According to the documents, the SFO cited the cheques when it asked police in Monaco to raid Unaoil’s headquarters the following day. The headquarters were raided on 29 March. On the following day, journalists at Australia’s Fairfax Media, drawing on a leak of thousands of Unaoil’s documents, alleged that the firm had systematically corrupted the global oil industry, distributing millions of dollars of bribes on behalf of Rolls-Royce and other multinationals which were seeking to secure contracts. At the high court hearing next Thursday, Unaoil, Ata Ahsani, its chairman, and his two sons, Cyrus and Saman, are challenging the legality of the raid on their Monaco headquarters, claiming that the “excessively wide fishing expedition” amounted to an unlawful misuse of the SFO’s powers. They are asking for damages for violations of their human rights. They are also asking for “the large quantity of important business material” seized in the raid to be returned to them, and the copies held by the SFO to be destroyed, as they say they are unable to carry on their normal business. However the SFO has refused to give them access to the material, arguing that it is “unpersuaded that Unaoil conducts any legitimate lawful business”. Investigators seized more than 60 terabytes of data from the firm – 30 times the size of data leaked from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca that comprised the Panama Papers.
The SFO is contesting the legal challenge, arguing that their actions were legal and that the Unaoil executives are attempting to “delay and disrupt an ongoing criminal investigation into serious fraud and corruption”. The SFO began to investigate Rolls-Royce in 2012 over allegations that a network of its agents made illicit payments to land large contracts around the world. Last month a joint Guardian/BBC investigation reported that part of this SFO investigation was into allegations Rolls-Royce had hired Unaoil to help it secure contracts in at least five different countries, including Angola, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Rolls-Royce said it was fully co-operating with the investigations and cannot comment in detail. • If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here)."
2016-11-25T15:05:41Z,uk-news,UK news,"Tax credit error costs families with disabled children Â£4,400 a year","Thousands of families with disabled children have lost out on up to £4,400 a year in tax credits after an administrative blunder by the authorities. The error in processing their claims meant an estimated 28,000 families whose children qualified for disability living allowance (DLA) during 2011-14 missed out on an additional tax credit premium of between £60 and £84 a week. The government revealed in the autumn statement this week that it had set aside £360m over six years to ensure these families receive child disability tax credits in future. However, the payments will be backdated only to April, meaning individual families may have lost out on entitlements totalling up to £20,000 over the past five years. The non-payment of the tax credit premiums appears to have been a result of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) failing to inform HMRC about families’ eligibility for the award over a three-year period. The charity Contact a Family called for a compensation fund to be set up to help the families, saying it was not their fault that they lost out on what collectively amounted to tens of millions of pounds in entitlements.
“One thing is certain: this isn’t the fault of families. When you tick a box on a government form indicating you are in receipt of tax credits you reasonably expect it’s there for a reason – and there’s a process in place that allows government departments to share this information,” said the charity’s head of policy and public affairs, Una Summerson. Families who are responsible for a disabled child or young person are eligible for a higher rate of child tax credit if the child is in receipt of a disability benefit such as disability living allowance (DLA) or personal independence payment (Pip). Although it is technically the responsibility of the claimant to inform HMRC directly that they receive DLA or Pip for their child, in practice the tax authorities have endeavoured to update the claim automatically using information supplied by the DWP.
When a family applies to the DWP for a disability benefit on behalf of their child, the form asks whether they are in receipt of tax credits. If they state that they are, and the application is approved, the DWP would normally pass the information directly to HMRC. HMRC regards the data-share as an “extra safeguard” to ensure that the extra child disability amounts are paid even when claimants have not directly notified them they were in receipt of the benefit. However, between 2011-2014 a processing error described officially as “a gap in the data feed between DWP and HMRC” meant awards were not automatically updated. Despite the large sums of money involved, the tax credits correction was referred to without explanation in the main Treasury autumn statement report, with only sketchy details of the error buried in a supporting document on policy costings. Robin Williamson, technical director of the pressure group Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: “The amounts payable for disabled and severely disabled children within child tax credit are significant and it is concerning that such a large number of people have missed out on claiming these payments potentially for a number of years. “It is important that HMRC work closely with DWP to ensure that the data feed works in future so this situation does not happen again. “Although the claimant has a legal obligation to report changes to their circumstances, we often encounter claimants who quite reasonably assume that this kind of information is shared within and between government departments. This is certainly happening more frequently and means there is a confusing landscape for claimants and a mismatch between the legal framework and the operational practice,” he said. Summerson said: “We are pleased with the announcement that, for these families, their awards will be amended and the extra amount paid from April 2016. This is something we’ve been campaigning on.” The error occurred during a period of intense upheaval at the DWP when the then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was pushing through over 30 separate reforms including universal credit while at the same time cutting the department’s administrative budget by 18% and reducing staffing by nearly a quarter. A National Audit Office report, published in 2015, was critical of some aspects of the DWP’s handling of what the department described as the “most fundamental change to the social security system in 60 years”. The report noted that: “Recent reforms have stretched the department’s ability to manage programmes”."
2016-11-25T15:33:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds of people in Co Durham paid to be shell company directors,"Hundreds of people in a former steel town in north-east England have been revealed to be directors of a range of pornography, dating, diet and travel websites. An investigation by the Reuters news agency found that at least 429 residents of Consett, County Durham, had been or still were being paid to serve as directors of more than 1,000 shell companies. People in the town were paid £50 cash to become directors, with a further £150 a year for forwarding company mail, in order to provide a range of online businesses with a UK address to meet requirements to trade in Europe. Residents of the town told journalists they did not know what the companies did and had signed up to the scheme in order to make extra money. Simon Dowson, who runs the business that arranges the directorships on behalf of the online firms, said everyone had been fully informed about what the companies did, their role and any documents they had to sign. Dowson was paid between £2,500 and £3,000 per shell company, administering 1,200 at his peak, but he said his business had a turnover of less than £1m a year. Dowson and some of the firms using his service have been investigated by the Insolvency Service, part of what is now the government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. As a result, he agreed to close one of his businesses in 2015 and stop recruiting people in Consett to be company directors. In 2010, 27 of the firms were closed down by the government when it found they were behind sites that trapped online customers through “free trial” offers into high credit card commitments on health supplements including colon cleansers, teeth whitening kits and Açaí berry detox pills. There have been no sanctions brought against Dowson or any of the directors in Consett and there is no suggestion that Dowson’s business is illegal. Frances Coulson, head of insolvency and litigation at Moon Beever Solicitors and a trustee director of an independent thinktank, the Fraud Advisory Panel, told Reuters the story highlighted flaws in the regulation and enforcement of company formation in Britain. “Part of the raison d’etre for the enforcement is the protection of the public,” she said. “[This] doesn’t sound as if it’s happening.” One of the directors in Consett, John Mawson, told BBC Newcastle he did not really know what his role involved. The 61-year-old was recruited by a neighbour who had already signed up. “All we were told was that we would just get letters sent and all we had to do was hand them on,” he said. “Money was rather tight. All we wanted was a bit of extra cash.”"
2016-11-25T15:40:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Port case prompts special police training on gay chemsex crime,"Scotland Yard has adopted measures to increase knowledge of chemsex crime in the gay community after the police watchdog launched an investigation into “missed opportunities” to catch the serial killer Stephen Port.
In the wake of Port’s conviction, frontline officers were undergoing special training to deal with rape and sex crimes against males. The measures were announced on Friday as the family of Jack Taylor, Port’s final victim, claimed their concerns over the initial investigation went unheeded because he had been dismissed as “a gay and a druggie and that was it”. Port, 41, was given a whole life sentence without release for the murders of four gay men: Anthony Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Taylor, 25. Port had surreptitiously given them fatal doses of the drug GHB to satisfy his fetish for sex with drugged, unconscious boyish-looking males.
Cdr Stuart Cundy, of the Met’s specialist crime and operations command, said the measures were “to enhance the knowledge and understanding of our officers about drugs-facilitated sexual assault, or sexual assault following chemsex”. Frontline and specialist officers who investigated these offences were being trained with the help of the anti-violence charity Galop and other LGBT organisations. A toolkit and a checklist document had been created to provide guidance for officers on how best to respond to allegations. A pilot study was launched by the Met in September to increase knowledge of the kind of drugs used to facilitate the sexual assault of men, Cundy said. Victims were being asked to provide a urine sample to test for GHB – also known as G or liquid ecstasy – which is the drug most commonly used in such cases. As part of the study, tests for GHB were also being carried out on males who had died and there was evidence of sexual assault or the death was unexplained, he said. The Met has already announced it is reviewing the deaths from GHB poisoning of 58 people in London over the last four years as a result of the Port case. An anaesthetic, GHB is popular on the dance and club scene. At low doses, it is reported to produce euphoria, lowering social inhibition and increasing libido. At higher doses, euphoria gives way to sedation. Still larger doses can induce coma. In some cases, death can arise as a result of respiratory depression or the inhalation of vomit.
The Met has faced criticism in the past over its handling of the murders of members of the LGBT community. In 2007, a review of 10 murders of gay men or transgender people said in some cases police inquiries were hampered by a lack of knowledge, reliance on unfounded stereotypes and personal prejudices. The report, written by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender advisory group, did acknowledge the force had substantially improved its dealings with the communities, but said more radical steps were needed. Investigations of high-profile cases to have attracted criticism in the past include those of the serial killers Dennis Nilsen, Michael Lupo and Colin Ireland."
2016-11-25T15:45:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Cornwall council 'did not listen' to warnings before landslide death,"A council should have known that a woman who died when she was engulfed by a landslide while watching television in her flat was in mortal danger, an inquest jury has concluded. The jury said Cornwall council ought to have known that erosion to high ground behind Susan Norman’s home posed a “real and immediate risk of death”. Norman, 68, was killed instantly when her ground-floor flat was destroyed by tonnes of mud and rubble that fell on to her rented property in Looe during torrential rain. A jury of five men and six women heard more than two weeks of evidence from more than 30 witnesses – including neighbours who described how they tried to get the council to take action. They returned a narrative conclusion, saying: “Susan Norman died as a result of being buried by a landslide. Cornwall council ought to have known at the time of the real and immediate risk of death to Susan Norman.” Cornwall coroner’s court had been told there was a series of landslips in the neighbourhood. The jury said: “Cornwall council did not listen to regular, consistent and frustrated complaints by the residents. Cornwall council did not respond to an independent report highlighting risk.” Jurors had heard evidence from one expert who said the landslip was likely to have been triggered by water from a road spilling over the top of the retaining wall behind the block of flats, which was called Veronica. The panel added: “The landslide was caused, or more than normally contributed to, by a failure of Cornwall council to prevent the surface water moving from St Martin’s Road on to the rear of Veronica.” Norman had three children. Outside the court Helen Hazeltine, her daughter, said: “They [the council] had a lack of care towards my mum. They just dismissed the residents’ views constantly over 15 years. “My mother was the one who paid the ultimate price. It could have been worse and it could have been more people. She was taken away from us and she didn’t have to be. She still should have been here with us for Christmas, birthdays and everything.” Hazeltine claimed that if Cornwall council had implemented a £45,000 drainage scheme to route excess water through nearby woods the tragedy would not have happened. Following the inquest, the council apologised to Norman’s relatives and friends and accepted there were “a number of matters which require the attention of the council and its staff”. During the inquest, Norman’s landlady, Christina Miller, said her tenant had raised concerns about a bulge in a retaining wall at the back of the house, prompting her to call in a structural engineer who warned about the risk of “catastrophic collapse”. Miller, who had concerns about water running off St Martin’s Road, called in the council and was told it was “a private matter and not one for Cornwall council to fund”. Philip Curtis, an engineering geologist, said a very small amount of the water coming off the road would be enough to saturate the earth behind the wall and cause it to fail. Neighbours described their concerns before the accident in the early hours of 22 March 2013. Rowan Beckingham said: “At the beginning of March, I remember Christina Miller saying there was a problem with the cliff at the rear of our property. I do remember asking why the council was not fixing it and she replied that they would not do it fast enough and so she would get someone in.” Tim Topham, who lived two doors from Norman, told the inquest that several landslips had happened in the area since 2006 and he had alerted Cornwall council. Norman’s daughter Rachael Boden had put a photo of her mother on a chair at the inquest, explaining she wanted to put a face to the person who lost her life. Norman had just returned from holiday when the accident happened."
2016-11-25T16:34:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Child abuse victims call for public hearing to drive inquiry forward,"Representatives of more than 200 victims of child abuse are calling for an urgent public hearing with the chair of the national inquiry into institutional abuse to “lance the boil” of dissatisfaction and drive the investigation forward. Survivors who were abused in a Home Office-run school, an approved school and a Catholic seminary, as well as other institutions, said a full hearing was required where Prof Alexis Jay could properly address criticisms. “We are not happy, we are not satisfied and we want to say so publicly,” they said, in a letter sent to Jay on Friday by their lawyer David Enright. The victims make up nearly a quarter of the core survivor groups represented at the inquiry. They include individuals who were abused at the Home Office-run Forde Park school in Newton Abbot, Devon, Stanhope Castle approved school in County Durham and at the Mirfield seminary in Yorkshire between the late 1950s and early 1980s as well as survivors from the group Survivors of Organised and Institutional Abuse. The victims said they wanted to support Jay and the inquiry in public in order for it to get on with what Theresa May as home secretary said was a “once in a generation opportunity” to expose the wrongs of the past. But their support was not unconditional and they wanted public reassurance and their concerns to be aired. “We want to give you the chance to show us that you understand why we are unhappy and to demonstrate to us that you have a clear road map and are determined to get to the destination of uncovering the truth,” they said. “We ask you to urgently schedule a hearing at which all of us can attempt to lance the boil of dissatisfaction and thereafter to recommit ourselves to the shared goals of truth, recovery and future child protection.” The victims heavily criticised the inquiry for failing in what they say should have been a core purpose of putting survivors at its heart – and said that in the past months, as the inquiry reeled from one crisis to the next, they had been sidelined. “Neither survivors nor their lawyers are being kept up to date as to any progress or about the possible future shape of the inquiry,” they wrote. “For many of us, this repeats the way that the police and the civil and criminal justice systems treated us after being abused. For many of us, the ongoing problems with the inquiry bring back the memories of the way we were abused and the way that we were treated after reporting that abuse … We are being left in the dark about what is happening and what will happen in the future.” The letter said there had been no progress since the inquiry was set up two years ago. The victims told Jay that they would not accept modification or reduction of the inquiry’s remit in her soon-to-be published review without being consulted. “What we require is a firm and clear statement from you and the inquiry setting out what has gone wrong and laying down a clear path for the future progress of this inquiry,” they wrote. The victims said that as the inquiry had suffered the loss of lawyers, and chairs, they were all in place waiting to take part. “Let us be clear, the members of our groups, and those who look to our groups to represent their experiences, are ready and willing to participate. Our lawyers have not resigned despite working without funding for up to a year. Our groups are not falling apart at the seams, despite the heavy stresses that this inquiry has placed upon our members.” On Thursday, the home affairs select committee criticised the way the inquiry had handled allegations of sexual assault on its own premises, saying the response was “wholly inadequate”. Jay issued a statement apologising to victims for causing them “any unnecessary anxiety”. She said she would appoint an external lawyer to review how the allegations of sexual assault in the inquiry’s London premises were handled. Jay also promised to be more transparent, saying the panel would soon be releasing testimonials from victims who had shared their experiences via the Truth Project."
2016-11-25T16:39:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Ministry of Justice axes 500% rise in fees for immigration tribunals,"Rises of up to 500% in immigration tribunal fees have been dropped in an abrupt U-turn by the Ministry of Justice. Following overwhelming opposition in a public consultation to the scheme that would have raised up to £34m a year, all the increases have been abandoned and the department will undertake a more extensive review of fees. In a surprise written parliamentary statement, Sir Oliver Heald, the minister responsible for courts and justice, said that from Friday all applicants would be charged at previous fee levels and those who had paid the increases would be reimbursed. Welcoming the decision, the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants tweeted:
Fees for an application to the first-tier tribunal dealing with immigration and asylum cases rose earlier this autumn from £80 to £490, while an oral hearing rose from £140 to £800. For the first time, appeals to the upper tribunal were being charged at £350 for each application and £510 for an appeal hearing. The immigration tribunal fee rises were introduced by the last justice secretary, Michael Gove, who also cancelled many of his predecessors’ legal fee increases when he first became justice secretary. In a recent public consultation on immigration tribunal fees, all but five of the 147 responses opposed the changes. The Law Centres Network said the rises were disgraceful and meant asylum seekers faced “whopping” fees. The Law Society described them as punitive and said they would hamper access to justice. Announcing the policy reversal, Heald wrote: “We have listened to the representations that we received on the current fee levels and have decided to take stock and review the immigration and asylum fees, to balance the interests of all tribunal users and the taxpayer and to look at them again alongside other tribunal fees and in the wider context of funding for the system overall. “From today all applicants will be charged fees at previous levels and we will reimburse, in all cases where the new fees have been paid, the difference between that fee and the previous fee.” But he added: “The government’s belief is unchanged that it is right that those who use our courts and tribunals should pay more, where they can realistically afford to do so, to ensure that the system is properly funded to protect access to justice and to relieve the burden on the taxpayer.” Bob Neill MP, the Conservative chair of the Commons justice select committee, said: “I warmly welcome the government’s decision. We concluded in our recent report that the cost-recovery aim of the proposed six-fold increases would not be realistic; that there was a danger that the increases would deny vulnerable people the means to challenge the lawfulness of decisions taken by the state. “It was unwise for the government to have brought forward these proposals before its review of the impact of employment tribunal fees has been published. It is very good to see the government prepared to listen and take action as a result. “We plan to follow up our report, and the government’s response to it, in the near future by taking evidence from Sir Oliver Heald on the subject. Further details will be announced soon.” Richard Burgon MP, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: “This is a significant climbdown by a Conservative government which has done so much to deny access to justice to thousands of people, particularly those on lower incomes. “Labour opposed these measures in parliament when they came in just two months ago, and we are pleased the justice secretary has finally given in to all those who argued against these unfair fee increases.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The cost of our courts and tribunals on the taxpayer is unsustainably high. “Those using the system, and who can afford to, should pay more to relieve this burden - immigration and asylum cases are no different. Our commitment to fee reform is unchanged, and we will bring forward new plans in due course.” Catherine Dixon, chief executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “The decision to reverse a 500% hike in asylum and immigration fees from today is great news and we are delighted that government has listened to our concerns. We are also pleased that those who paid the increased fee are to be reimbursed. “The Law Society vigorously opposed the fee increases because equal access to justice is more important than income generation when it comes to setting court and tribunal fees. We note the government is now embarking on a wider review of tribunal fees which we welcome and we will be monitoring that process carefully.” Saira Grant, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “These fee increases were part of a series of measures that have drastically reduced people’s ability to appeal Home Office decisions to an independent court. Home Office caseworkers regularly get life-changing decisions wrong and the government response has been to insulate them from independent scrutiny by removing appeal rights, forcing people to appeal from abroad and removing legal aid. Today’s decision is a welcome step, but we have a long way to go to ensure access to justice for all, irrespective of their ability to pay.”"
2016-11-25T17:07:34Z,uk-news,UK news,The week that time stood still,"Monday If time seemed to drag during Theresa May’s “I’m not going to tell you that I don’t know what I’m doing” Brexit speech at the annual conference of Confederation of British Industry, it almost stopped in the contributions that followed. Quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day-long bash at London’s Grosvenor House hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of Deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the government’s Brexit planning “a complete shambles” ended up as front page news, or the head of Facebook in Europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation, is anyone’s guess. But they did all eat very well. For breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries, and for elevenses we got ham-hock quiche and chocolate muffins. For lunch there was a choice of five main courses, including Thai prawns and vegetable curry, followed by three desserts. For tea, we had doughnuts and clementines. If it hadn’t been for the entertainment, it would have been a good day out. Tuesday I kind of expect post-truth antics with Brexit, Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. It goes with the territory. But I didn’t expect Tottenham Hotspur, the football club I support, to be quite so fashionably on trend. Spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the Champions League a second time, and now that they’ve done so, what do they do? They decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition. The reason? They wanted to keep some players fresh for this Saturday’s Premier League fixture against Chelsea. Brilliant. You spend years trying to qualify for a competition, only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season. It’s meta, post-truth football in which it’s not the taking part that counts, but the qualification to take part. Predictably, Spurs came unstuck, which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity. It’s a club tradition that Spurs fail so that we don’t have to. Wednesday When I was at Exeter university in the 1970s, male students with long hair tended to stick together. The hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you weren’t a member of the Conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices. Thank God, then, I wasn’t at Oxford with Philip “Lurch” Hammond, the dullest man in Westminster, or I could have come badly unstuck. Old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders. Imagine the possible faux pas. There you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free-market capitalism, because you assume he must have been up all night listening to Gong. Then it turns out he isn’t stoned, he means every word of what he’s saying and that he really is that boring. Thursday Just occasionally, select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us. During a recent session of the public accounts committee – at which the Department of Health civil servant Chris Wormald made headlines for saying the NHS was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment – one gem slipped under the radar. During a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners, the chair, Meg Hillier, asked Wormald if he had any comparative figures for Spain. “Yes,” he said promptly. “At our last count there are 62 Spanish … ” “Not 62,000?” interrupted the Conservative Richard Bacon. “62 Spanish pensioners,” said Hillier. “You’re kidding me.” “62 Spanish pensioners live in the UK and about 70,000 British pensioners live in Spain,” replied the bewildered Wormald, who couldn’t see what the fuss was about. “62?” Hillier repeated incredulously. “We are not the retirement place of choice,” Wormald explained. Pensioners. That’s one export success we don’t often hear the government boasting about. Friday As with much of my life, inertia invariably wins the day on Black Friday, so I’m yet again left with the feeling I’ve probably missed out on dozens of bargains. I never get round to starting my Christmas shopping until the second week in December and I don’t want a new TV quite enough to go through the hassle of trying to work out which is the right one. Even if I did, I’m fairly sure I’d end up buying a product that was being discontinued or was actually cheaper in John Lewis. Our own family motto is “Never knowingly underbought” as we always tend to end up paying top dollar for everything, even when we’re trying to do something on the cheap. An example of this was when we went on holiday to Egypt some years back and my wife and son mistakenly managed to haggle the price of a souvenir up from the seller’s original asking price. If only we could see ourselves coming as well as everyone else seems to. Silver lining of the week: We could be even more broke. The OBR forecast for the country’s finances was more upbeat than many expected."
2016-11-25T17:28:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham school faces second discrimination case,"A school accused of ethnic discrimination against a teaching assistant is facing similar allegations after a senior staff member was charged with racially abusing a teacher. Heartlands academy in Birmingham came under fire when an assistant’s role at the school was terminated after she objected to her class of 11- and 12-year-old special needs children being shown footage of people jumping to their deaths from the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks. Suriyah Bi, 24, recently turned down an £11,000 compensation offer from the school and has vowed to fight the case in court. The Guardian has now learned that Dawn Salter, the head of food technology at the school in the Nechells area, is to stand trial next month for religiously aggravated harassment. The alleged victim, Rehana Begum, who was a food technology teacher at the school, claims Salter called her a “fucking Muslim bitch” and threatened to “wrap my headscarf around my neck”. Begum, 47, is also suing the school for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination. She claims she was repeatedly harassed between April 2015 and November 2015 after she raised concerns about exam fraud. Following the alleged harassment, Begum, who was employed at the school on a rolling yearly contract, went on sick leave in March this year and her contract was not renewed. She is now supply teaching. Salter is believed to have remained at the school until 23 July, when she was formally charged by the police. She is now reportedly also on sick leave. The school referred the Guardian to E-Act, the academy’s sponsor, for comment. The company said: “E-Act takes all such allegations seriously, however, as we are in the middle of a legal process it would not be appropriate for the trust to comment further.” Salter has been charged with religiously aggravated intentional harassment by use of words and is due to appear at Coventry magistrates court on 6 December. Begum’s case against the school will then follow at an employment tribunal. Bi’s case, meanwhile, is due to begin at an employment tribunal on 5 December. The Birmingham MP, Liam Byrne, has called for the education secretary to investigate Bi’s case."
2016-11-25T17:32:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Ten suspected of entering UK illegally in refrigerated lorry,"Six men and four boys suspected of entering the UK illegally have been treated for the effects of cold after they were found in the back of a refrigerated lorry. Ambulance crews were called near a retail park off the M6 after the group were discovered in Wednesbury, West Midlands, at 5.31pm on Thursday. The HGV was reportedly stopped by motorway police as it travelled north after other motorists spotted arms hanging out of the vehicle, apparently gesturing for help. Police contacted Immigration Enforcement at around 6pm and they are now processing the 10 males, who said they were from Iraq, Iran, Vietnam and Lebanon. A spokesman for West Midlands ambulance service said medics had assessed and treated the males for the effects of cold. Staff at a branch of Costa Coffee at the retail park served them hot drinks, while one was taken to Walsall Manor hospital after he fainted. All are thought to be aged between 16 and 26. The Home Office said that six of the males would be referred to Immigration Enforcement to be interviewed, while four, who said they were minors, would be passed into the care of social services to be age-assessed. Two Spanish men, aged 50 and 60, were arrested by West Midlands police on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and the case is now being led by Immigration Enforcement criminal investigations. Immigration Enforcement, part of the Home Office, is responsible for enforcing immigration law. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Where someone has no right to remain in the UK, we will take action to remove them.”"
2016-11-25T18:37:13Z,uk-news,UK news,"British pilot, 71, goes missing during vintage air rally to Africa","A British pilot who has been taking part in a rally of historic aircraft across Africa has gone missing for the second time in a week. Maurice Kirk’s next of kin have been informed, while organisers of the Vintage Air Rally (VAR), in which a fleet of historic flying machines are aiming to travel from Crete to Cape Town in South Africa, say they have confidence in his ability to land his plane in the wild. Kirk, 71, from Bristol, vanished during a previous leg after taking off in Sudan. He turned up safely, but he and the rest of the rally – more than 40 people in all – were then detained in Ethiopia, where the authorities accused them of illegally entering the country’s airspace. Following intervention from the Foreign Office in London and the US embassy in Addis Ababa, the rally was allowed to leave Ethiopia and head to Kenya. They all arrived safely in Kenya on Friday apart from Kirk, a former vet and acquaintance of the Hollywood actor Oliver Reed, who has been flying a 1943 Piper Cub plane called Liberty Girl II. On VAR’s Facebook page, organisers gave the good and bad news. “The rally has just arrived in Kenya after the Ethiopians managed to figure out where they, we and the Sudanese managed to mess up,” they wrote. “For the second time in two flights, Maurice is a no-show. We have launched (again) an overdue aircraft process (now Kenyan rather than Ethiopian). We suspect he has run out of sunlight and landed somewhere. “Next of kin have been informed. His ability to drop his cub into a small field for the night is impressive. We hope he is OK.” VAR and Kirk had a falling out before his last disappearance and the organisers said he was no longer officially part of the rally. “But we have of course been helping him with everything (fuel, accommodation, oil, permits, flight plans etc etc) until Kenya,” the statement says. Kirk is no stranger to controversy. In 1979 he got into hot water after dropping in on a hang-gliding rally in Wiltshire in a wooden biplane. When his craft was examined, it was found to be riddled with woodworm and had a bird’s nest in one wing. He was arrested in Japan after his first Piper – Liberty Girl I – crashed in Kanazawa; he walked out of custody in nothing but a kimono and neck brace. Kirk was also once arrested for landing a plane at George W Bush’s Texas ranch. Liberty Girl I eventually met a watery end in the Caribbean, but none of it has put him off. Even before his disappearances this week, the rally had not been plain sailing for Kirk. He almost crashed Liberty Girl II in France when he suffered an engine failure as he approached Cannes. “That so easily could have ended in a tangled pile of twisted aircraft and Maurice,” he wrote on Facebook. On 19 November, he posted: “Where am I? I keep getting lost, which is why I really wanted to go via Gibraltar and just keep the sea on my right to Table mountain [near Cape Town].” He has suffered a puncture and propeller failure. But he has clearly enjoyed the trip. He said Dongola in Sudan “will always be a memory of what life is really all about … the fried fish fresh out of the Nile … the coffee you can [stand] your spoon up in!”"
2016-11-25T18:51:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Serial killer Stephen Port receives whole-life prison sentence,"The serial killer Stephen Port has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for the murder of four young gay men he drugged and raped before dumping their bodies near his east London flat. The 41-year-old chef, who had a fetish for sex with unconscious boyish-looking men, was convicted on Wednesday of the murders of Anthony Walgate, a 23-year-old fashion student from Hull, Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia, Daniel Whitworth, 21, a chef from Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, a forklift driver from Dagenham. Sentencing Port to a whole-life order, Mr Justice Openshaw said: “I accept his intention was only to cause really serious harm rather than cause death but he must have known and foreseen there was a high risk of death, the more so after the death of Anthony Walgate, the first victim.” He said: “The murders were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct of the defendant surreptitiously drugging these young men so that he could penetrate them while they were unconscious. “A significant degree of planning went into obtaining the drugs in advance and in luring the victims to his flat. Having killed them by administering an overdose, he dragged them out into the street in one case, or took them to the churchyard in the other cases, and abandoned their bodies in a manner which robbed them of their dignity, and thereby greatly increased the distress of their loving families.”
The judge said: “I have no doubt that the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally high that the whole-life order is justified; indeed it is required. The sentence therefore upon the counts of murder is a sentence of life imprisonment. I decline to set a minimum term. The result is a whole-life sentence and the defendant will die in prison.” There were loud cheers and applause from family members in court, while someone in the public gallery shouted out: “I hope you die a long, slow death, you piece of shit.”DCI Tim Duffield, senior investigating officer from the Met’s homicide and major crime command, said: “These evil crimes have left entire families, a community and a nation in shock.” He said Port was one of the most dangerous individuals he had encountered in almost 28 years of policing and that a full-life term in prison was the only appropriate punishment in the circumstances. Outside court, Taylor’s sister Donna said: “We finally have justice for Jack and the other boys. A sick and twisted scumbag will never be able to hurt or destroy any other family’s life. Jack can finally rest in peace. We will always be completely heartbroken.” The judge highlighted Port’s attempt to cover up two of his murders with a fake suicide note as “wicked and monstrous”. All four men died after being given fatal overdoses of the date-rape drug GHB, also known as G or liquid ecstasy. Port was convicted of 22 offences against 11 men, including drugging and sex offences against seven men who survived their encounters with him. Despite striking similarities between the four murders, which were carried out over 15 months, the Metropolitan police failed to link them until the family of Taylor, his final victim, forced them to re-examine all the deaths. The Taylor family are planning to sue the force, and believe Port would not have been stopped if they had not fought for a full investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the Met’s initial response to the murders, including whether “discrimination played any part in actions and decisions”. The judge referred to the police investigation in his sentencing remarks, saying: “It is not to me to say whether the seeming bizarre coincidence of these three gay young men being found dead so close together might have given rise to suspicions that these deaths were not the result of ordinary self-administered drug overdoses but that is how their deaths, including Jack Taylor’s death, were treated at the time; the competence and adequacy of the investigation will later be examined by others.” He said police had accepted the death of Port’s first victim, Walgate, “at face value”, adding: “Whether the police were right to do so, in the light of what they knew or ought to have found out, is for others to decide having thoroughly inquired into the matter, which it has not been appropriate for us to do in the course of the criminal trial.” The public gallery at the Old Bailey court was packed, and all the members of the jury had returned to court to hear the sentencing. Ahead of sentencing, Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, read aloud to the court from victim impact statements. Relatives of Walgate described their “devastation”. His mother said her son was clever, funny and talented and wanted to be a famous fashion designer. Port had not only destroyed their family, but had destroyed his own, she said. Kovari’s brother, Adam, said the impact on his family of the loss of his only brother could “hardly be described in words”, said Rees. His murder had “changed their lives for ever”. Adam Whitworth, father of Daniel Whitworth, described living two parallel lives, where grief tainted everyday life. Friends had told him that “the light had gone out of his eyes”, said Rees, and he had a “life sentence of grief”. His partner and Daniel’s stepmother, Amanda Pearson, said she had become “bitter and cynical”, that the “rich and fulfilling life ahead of us with Dan has been stolen from us”. It had been painful for the family when they had first wrongly been told he had taken his own life, Rees said. Taylor’s family said their lives had been destroyed, and they had had to suffer the “devastating effect” of his body being exhumed. They endured endless sleepless nights, and family members had taken time off work sick. The loss of the son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law had left “a black hole that will never be filled”. Port’s family later said they continued to believe he was innocent, ITV news reported. Speaking anonymously to the broadcaster, Port’s mother said: “I know he’s my son – he’s a kind boy. “He said all along, ‘I didn’t murder anyone mum,’ he said. Honest truth. ‘I didn’t murder anyone’ - that’s what he told me last Sunday on the telephone.” David Etheridge QC, for Port, said in mitigation that at that period in Port’s life, he had descended into a “vortex” of drug-taking, where “gratification of his sexual life was central”. Port’s fetish for sex with drugged young men had “graduated to fixation, and fixation to compulsion”. He added the prosecution had not alleged “any intent to kill these young men”. The premeditated planning “was to drug to unconsciousness and not to end someone’s life”, said Etheridge. As Port was convicted, Stuart Cundy, a police commander who leads the Met’s specialist crime and operations unit, offered personal letters of apology to the victims’ families for the missed opportunities to catch Port sooner. During the trial it emerged that Port, a bus depot canteen chef, had been arrested and charged for lying about how the body of his first victim, Walgate, came to be found dumped outside the communal entrance to his flat in Barking, east London, in June 2014. Port was bailed. He went on to murder his second and third victims, Kovari and Whitworth, in August and September 2014. Their bodies were found within three weeks, by the same dog walker, propped up in a sitting position in a graveyard near his flat. As part of an elaborate cover-up, Port faked and planted a suicide note purporting to have been written by Whitworth claiming he had taken his own life by overdosing on GHB in guilt over accidentally giving Kovari a fatal dose of the drug during sex. The note, which was taken at “face value” by investigating officers, included the line: “BTW, please do not blame the guy I was with last night, we only had sex, then I left. He knows nothing of what I have done.” Had police attempted to trace that “guy’, which they did not, it could have led them to Port. Port was briefly jailed in March 2015 for perverting the course of justice in lying to police about Walgate’s death. He was released in June 2015. Three months later, in September, he murdered Taylor. Seventeen police officers are facing investigation for possible misconduct over the catalogue of failures in catching Port. The Met is now re-examining 58 unexplained deaths involving the drug GHB from a four-year period, across London, in case signs of suspicious death were missed. Port used a string of fake online dating profiles and was very active on social media. He met his victims via apps such as Grindr, expressing a sexual preference for young, boyish-looking men he called “twinks”. Following his conviction, the force has appealed for any other victims who suffered at Port’s hands to come forward."
2016-11-25T19:16:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Fake doctor who secretly filmed and blackmailed women he dated is jailed,"A taxi driver who pretended he was a doctor to impress women he met on a dating website before secretly filming them naked and blackmailing them by threatening to post the footage online has been jailed. Farhan Mirza, 38, who targeted Muslim women, was sentenced to eight and a half years after being found guilty of blackmail, voyeurism, sexual assault, theft and fraud. Four-times married Mirza tried to impress his victims by hanging surgical scrubs in his wardrobe and carrying a stethoscope when in fact he was a taxi driver and part-time IT worker living with his mother in a terrace house in Abertillery, south Wales. The prosecution told Cardiff crown court that Mirza was a sexual predator who threatened to bring shame upon three Muslim women and their families unless they gave him money and gifts.
The father-of-one met two victims on shaadi.com, which describes itself as the world’s biggest match-making website. Timothy Evans, prosecuting, told the court: “It is the prosecution’s case that Mr Mirza is a particular kind of sexual predator and he chooses his victims carefully. “Because of their religious and ethnic backgrounds, he targeted them because of the terror, embarrassment and humiliation that each of these ladies would have felt in their minds by what this defendant did to them.” One of the victims went to the police in 2014 and investigations led to the other two complainants. She said Mirza told her he was an IT manager, his brother was head of security at an airport, his sister was a doctor and his father a director of a utility company in Pakistan. “Everything was a lie,” she said. The woman described her shock at discovering numerous home movies of Mirza having sex with various women. “He didn’t have one or two – there were hundreds of them. I was there, too. I had no idea that he was filming when we were together, or had hidden cameras. Never, ever would I have consented to that,” she said. Another woman told jurors that Mirza claimed he was a successful hospital surgeon with a house in London and had promised to buy her a £25,000 diamond ring. “He told me he was a surgeon, so I thought he was a surgeon. He told me he was single, never married and was a virgin,” she said. Mirza claimed he was scared of one of the victims, insisting she had links to the Taliban and that he threatened to send embarrassing photos of her “just to shut her up”. Jailing Mirza, Judge Tom Crowther accused him of “pure misogyny”. Outside court, Gwent police said he was “manipulative, deceitful and callous” and praised the victims’ great bravery and dignity."

The cut, which started at 5.16pm, hit Soho, which was packed with tourists, shoppers and people enjoying the areaâ€™s bars and restaurants.
Some West End plays, including Aladdin, Jersey Boys, Thriller Live, the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time and Les MisÃ©rables were cancelled, with theatres offering refunds.
Lauren Tucker, whose sister and mother were planning on seeing Les Mis this evening after travelling into London from Bath and Bristol, said: â€œThe tickets, which cost Â£318 for six tickets, so Â£52 each, were birthday presents and they are unsure whether they can travel back up to watch the show. They were purchased direct with the venue who will refund the tickets, but we assume no compensation is going to be provided in terms of hotel and travel,â€� she said. The lights were back on at 9pm and other shows including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were able to go ahead with a delayed start. UK Power Network have revealed that the disruption was due to a faulty piece of equipment on their underground electricity network. A spokesperson said: â€œAll power supplies were restored by 9pm. We apologise for the impact this incident caused and for the inconvenience.â€� The company had earlier said that 2,300 properties were affected. Thames Water also tweeted that water supplies could be affected in blocks of flats."
2016-11-26T13:58:34Z,uk-news,UK news,David Hamilton found dead amid allegations of historical rape,"On the Mediterranean beaches of Cap d’Agde, British photographer David Hamilton was a familiar figure in the 1980s looking for young girls to model for his pictures. “Shopping” was the word he used and he knew what he was seeking: young, early teens, preferably blonde, blue-eyed and with pale, almost translucent skin; the epitome of the “age of innocence”, the title of one of his best-selling books. Parents rarely refused when he asked if the youngsters could come to his studio to pose, honoured that their child had been spotted by a world-famous artist. But Hamilton’s motives, it has been claimed, were far from innocent.
On Friday evening, days after allegations resurfaced that he had raped and sexually abused a number of his young models, the London-born photographer, who had repeatedly denied the accusations, was found dead in his Paris home. Police reported that a bottle of medication was found nearby, and declared that Hamilton, 83, had taken his own life. Radio and television journalist Flavie Flament, 42, who had recently gone public to claim Hamilton raped her 30 years ago when she was 13, declared she was “devastated” by his death and accused him of “cowardice”. Flament’s claims, made in her recently published book, were vigorously denied by the photographer and her own mother, but three other women came forward anonymously to say Hamilton had raped and sexually assaulted them as girls. On Saturday, Flament’s literary editor, Karina Hocine, said Hamilton’s death had condemned his victims to eternal silence. “Of course she is devastated ... they say it’s suicide, and of course as human beings we are divided between the horror of the situation and a feeling of immense revulsion, because he has not allowed justice to do its work,” Hocine told LCI radio. A few hours after Hamilton’s death was announced, Flament issued a statement. It said: “I’ve just learned of the death of David Hamilton, the man who raped me when I was 13. The man who raped numerous young girls, some of whom have come forward with courage and emotion these last few weeks. I’m thinking of them, of the injustice that we were trying to fight together. By his cowardice, he has condemned us once more to silence and unable to see him condemned. The horror of this act will never wipe out the horror of our sleepless nights.” Hamilton, who grew up in wartime London – spending some time as a child evacuee in Dorset – set out to be an architect. Instead, aged 20, he travelled to Paris to work as a graphic designer at French Elle and later became the art director of the grand magasin Printemps. At the same time he began taking photographs, floaty, hazy images of pre- and early-pubescent girls nude or in transparent dresses in flowery, bucolic scenes, that became a recognisable style – the “Hamilton blur” – but were banned in some countries as pornographic. One of the girls who came forward after Flament accused Hamilton told Le Nouvel Observateur that he would send his girls off to find a new “mouse” on the beaches in the south of France. “Mouse”, she revealed, was the word he used for the girls’ genitals. “I would approach the parents first, to reassure them. I would say, ‘David Hamilton would like to take a trial photograph of your daughter’. Then he would approach them,” the unnamed woman told the magazine. Hamilton declared he was inspired by Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita, saying he shared the writers’s “obsession with purity” and that his work looked for “the candour of a lost paradise”. In the 1970s, his “erotic-romantic” images published in books and kitschy calendars raised few eyebrows, and his 1977 soft-focus erotic film Bilitis became an aesthetic manifesto for a generation of artists. Like other well known and famous men of his generation, however, by the start of the 21st century, his pictures had begun to divide option: what he claimed was innocence and candour appeared not just passé but perverse and pornographic. Chris Warmoli wrote in the Guardian in 2005: “Hamilton’s photographs have long been at the forefront of the ‘is it art or pornography?’ debate.” Hamilton responded to the resurfacing of the rape claims by threatening to sue for defamation. “I have done nothing improper. Clearly the instigator of this media lynching is looking for her 15 minutes of fame, by defaming me in her novel,” he said last week. Hamilton pointed out he had never been found guilty of any charge, and that the time had passed in which any could be brought. Under France’s statute of limitations, charges must be brought within 20 years for rape and 10 years for sexual abuse."
2016-11-26T19:34:28Z,uk-news,UK news,London cycling and the “by chance” success of Amsterdam,"For many London cycling activists and politicians with transport responsibilities the Netherlands is the touchstone nation for urban cycling policy, as demonstrated by the London Cycling Campaign’s ongoing “Go Dutch” theme and Boris Johnson’s borough-centred “mini-Holland” schemes. It is easy to see why. In 2014, cyclists accounted for a commanding 32% of modal share across the Dutch capital Amsterdam, higher than any other category and rising. Only walking rivals it as a way to get around. How did Amsterdam come to be such a beacon as a cycling city and what can London learn from it? Professor Ruth Oldenziel of Eindhoven University – a Dutch person and a cyclist, just so you know – is co-editor of a new book called Cycling Cities: The European Experience. In it, she and a colleague characterise Amsterdam as the “world bicycle capital, by chance”. Last week, presenting the book’s findings at a London Travelwatch event, she summarised the city’s cycling pre-eminence as resulting from “a kind of coincidence”. The professor’s Amsterdam cycling story is not of the city’s authorities introducing a visionary type of street design and everything proceeding from there, but one arising from the interplay of a range of factors over time, during which cycling policy was never more than “makeshift” and change has been untidily incremental. Nor is Amsterdam representative of every city in the Netherlands. “There are many different Dutch cycling cultures,” Oldenziel said. While Groningen and Enschede have banned cars from their city centres, Rotterdam’s cycling levels are very low. Amsterdam’s recent rising high cycling levels have been quite gradual compared with the dramatic plunge they took from peaks as high as 75% in the 1950s. By then, cycling had become perceived as an obstacle to modernisation. The book reproduces a photograph from 1957 showing Amsterdam’s main commercial and commuter street, the Leidsestraat, clogged with cyclists, bikes and trams, all competing for the same road space. Something had to give in the heart of Amsterdam’s main transport artery. It did: the photo’s caption says that in 1971, cyclists were banned from it. Oldenziel records that there was a class element to the disciplining of Amsterdam cyclists, which had been going on in various forms for decades. Cycling was what the lower orders did and, in the view of the authorities, they did it in a manner that was unruly, unpredictable and a hindrance to the car-led future. The first segregated cycle lanes, introduced in the 1930s, were an outcome of the process of marginalising cycling rather than an attempt to encourage it. But from the mid-1970s, new social forces came into play. Amsterdam’s counter-culture, allied with its preservationist movement, reclaimed the city’s cycling heritage as part of its resistance to motor-domination and redevelopment. “Thereafter, the city adopted a pro-cycling policy, albeit on pragmatic rather than principled grounds,” Oldenziel writes. Today, in the centre of Amsterdam, a thumping 87% of trips of less than four kilometres are made by bicycle. Oldenziel attributes this to a combination of a determined social movement, a stubbornly strong cycling tradition, Amsterdam’s compact layout and a “pragmatic mix of pro-cycling and car-limiting policies,” of which the curbing of motorists has “proved the most effective”. She said that the Dutch approach as a whole “is really about intervening on the streets, inch-by-inch, bottom-up and really cost-effective, with very few large engineering infrastructural projects”. The book looks at what has happened to cycling in 14 European cities, identifying five main factors explaining why it has thrived in some and faded in others: the nature of the urban landscape; the availability of alternative modes of travel, including public transport; cycling’s place within wider traffic policies; the effects of social movements; and cycling’s changing cultural status, from the transit mode of poorer people to what it is today. London is not among those studied. It is, of course, as distinctive as every other city and a very different one from Amsterdam, both physically and historically. But some of the reasons for Amsterdam’s success can surely be transferred. Oldenziel, who had pedalled round parts of the capital during the afternoon, told me her research had found that traffic-calming measures have represented the best use of public money in European cities in terms of encouraging cycling. Making car parking more expensive produced strong results too and generated funds for road infrastructure changes. She was precise about what sort of infrastructure brings about the best results. “A lot of cycling lanes are at the expense of pedestrians or public transit,” she explained. “These infrastructure visions often mean travelling at a high speed from A to B. That’s actually a car mentality. What you want is an infrastructure that is about the living street: about negotiation, about meandering and traffic calming. We do need to invest in infrastructure, but not in separate lanes.” Although the Amsterdam story she tells includes periods of conflict between trams and the demolitions required for subway construction on the one hand and cycling on the other, Oldenziel would prefer the interests of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users to be allied and complementary. It’s about having the right priorities for making a city a place to live in rather than one for racing through. “The story of Amsterdam is actually that automobility was so expensive that car space is now taken over by cyclists by default,” Odenziel said. “There are speed bumps everywhere too. But it is mostly about making the decision that cars do not belong.” Plenty there for London to reflect on. Cycling Cities: The European Experience can be purchased via here."
2016-11-27T00:05:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Lake District hotel devastated by Storm Desmond set to reopen,"The shallow stream that runs under the bridge in the village of Glenridding and out into Ullswater looks as gentle as the calm, reflective lake it tumbles into. Gazing out at the winter-blue sky and snow-crested hills, Liz Ali both loves and hates this dramatic landscape. “I dread the rain,” she smiled. “I just want 5 December to come and go this year, then I can get through the winter. We have been in shock for a long time. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved but it’s been so stressful, so much hard work.”
On Thursday, almost a year since Storm Desmond sent a flash flood pouring into this Cumbrian village and straight through Ali’s 19th-century hotel, the Glenridding will reopen. Inside, it smells of fresh paint and pine needles. Bottles are being taken out of boxes in the cosy-looking bar, the Christmas trees are up, and a search is under way for the fairy lights. “Now the builders and decorators are actually out of the way, we have to remember where we put everything,” said Ali. “The decorations were put away on 6 December last year. We tried to save the tree – we kept putting it higher and higher up – but the water got it. It ended up in the beer garden; we still find the odd Christmas bauble out there.” It has been a long, long haul. The Ali family bought the hotel in 2007 and were first flooded in 2009. “That was just a day’s work of brushing out water,” laughs Liz. Last year a landslide joined the water hurling down from the hills, sending boulders pouring through the village, smashing the tourist information centre and flooding properties. Two floors of the hotel were gutted, apart from, ironically, the swimming pool. The cellar was a fish tank, the kitchens submerged. It took until May for the walls to dry out. Hanging in reception is a board where staff would pin the weather forecast for residents. It still has the sheet from 5 December 2015 – “rain”.
“It started about 3pm,” said Ali. “At first a trickle, then this raging torrent. By 10pm it was banging at the doors: the whole river had changed its course, from running down the side of the hotel to coming through the doors. I’d been on the phone since 5pm to the emergency services – but they couldn’t get through. We couldn’t get out and we couldn’t get our 25 guests out. There was the noise of tree trunks and boulders smashing into the walls; heating oil tanks we being washed down from houses further up. The smell was awful, and the water was everywhere, raging. “The phones went down, the electricity was flickering on and off, and we were just listening to the eerie noises of fridges upturning, the snooker table banging against the wall. I had no idea if the foundations would even hold. It was a very long night.” It was to be two days before Glenridding had any outside help. While emergency services scrambled to help other parts of the country hit by Storm Desmond, the village was cut off – the road to north and south submerged or simply washed away. A local building firm, Beckside, arrived first, with diggers. “They managed to clear the river bed of debris, build up the banks and send the water back into its original course,” said Ali. She pointed to the name of her new bar – Beckside. “They were brilliant, so we named it in their honour, but all the volunteers who came to help were amazing. We can’t thank them enough. The village pulled together.” Then, on the Wednesday, they were hit by a second storm, and a second flood.
“That was terrible: we’d actually thought we’d be able to open in a week or two. I was worrying about a Christmas party we had booked in,” said Liz. “Then it hit home.” Her sister Selina agreed: “It was all so chaotic that the terrible thing is I can’t remember the names of half the people who came to help us clear up. We were in shock, but we couldn’t have done it without them. We’re a strong family and we’re not quitters. We just took one day at a time. “There have been a lot of sleepless nights: I can’t even put a figure on the cost and the loss. Astronomical. It’s been so gut-wrenching to see the hotel so soulless, as a construction site. It will be great to have it alive again.” It is the abundance of water here that originally brought the village of Glenridding into existence: the becks of the Patterdale valley powered a large lead mine, whose owners built houses for their workers. Dams built by the mining company failed in 1927 and 1931: the village was under water then, too, and staff at the Glenridding Hotel had to be rescued from their quarters. The Ali family have been assured that history won’t repeat itself, but they’ve installed a webcam, pointing at the river, just to be safe. “We’ve been told it can’t happen again,” said Liz, “but I’ll be keeping an eye out.” Across the street, outdoor shop Catstycam is open for business. Andrew Laverick had two outlets, one here and one at the other end of Ullswater, at Pooley Bridge. Both were flooded by Storm Desmond.
“I couldn’t get into Glenridding until two days afterwards because of the roads, and communications were down,” he said, “so I had no idea what I’d find. It was very emotional: I love this village, and to see it like that was very hard. I was in tears – not just for us but for everyone. Then, to get flooded again a few days later … It has been hard. There was just so much work facing us. There still is. The village has been in turmoil all year. It has been a building site.” The Environment Agency faced around 660 repair works to riverbanks and flood defences in Cumbria, Lancashire and West Yorkshire, at a cost of around £200m. Some 6,421 businesses and homes were flooded, and many vulnerable areas still face several nail-biting winters before planned new defences are ready. Desmond’s rain broke all previous UK records: the Met Office saying Honister in Cumbria saw 341.4mm of rain in just 24 hours. A national emergency was declared in Dumfries and Galloway, and a £235m, five-year flood defence strategy under way in Scotland in response to both Storm Desmond and Storm Frank. “For me there was no option of closing down,” said Leverick. “Living at the wild end of the country as we do, we’re close to nature, not isolated from it as people are in cities. That is wonderful, but the flipside is that when nature decides to bite we have a front-row seat. “The great thing has been all the people coming to the Lake District to support us. We still feel the 2008 recession here; London may be booming but our turnover had been falling. This year it feels as though people have been making an effort to support us local businesses.”"
2016-11-27T11:40:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Demonstrators swap insults at Bolton 'stop the mosque' protest,"Far-right protesters wearing swastikas and performing Nazi salutes descended on a town in Greater Manchester in protest against a planned mosque. More than 100 people gathered in the centre of Bolton on Saturday to demonstrate against the proposed construction of a mosque and Islamic centre. The mosque has already been given planning permission. A similar number of activists are believed to have taken part in a counter-protest started by Unite Against Fascism (UAF). The demonstrators could be seen shouting and swapping insults over barriers outside Bolton’s main square, as police admitted they had no power to stop the legal protest. Footage showed the group – some trying to cover their faces – raising their hand in salute as they held signs stating “no more mosques”. They were met with chants of “Nazi scum, off our streets” from those representing Unite Against Fascism. The “stop the mosque” protesters also accused Bolton council of being corrupt. One of the protest’s organisers said his group was opposed to what he claimed was the “Islamification” of their town. Organiser Bryan Morgan said: “Today was about highlighting the corruption of the council, the Islamification of the town, the mosque-building programme. There were a plethora of issues people were here to represent. Anytime anyone opposes anything to do with colour creed or religion automatically the race card is pulled out. If they bothered to sit down and look at it they’d see some of the issues being raised are ones both sides agree on.” Rival demonstrators were kept separated by fenced off areas in Victoria Square outside the town hall . Nick Peel, a local councillor, described the protest as “un-British”, adding: “Obviously everybody has a right to protest. However, I understand the nature of it was described as ‘anti-mosque’. Well that is ridiculous in the free and open society we live in. “One of our most enshrined values is freedom of worship to for one section of the community to protest against worship facilities for another section is very un-British.” Greater Manchester police said no arrests had been made."

Appearance: Jazzy, snazzy, pizzazzy, fronted by Gaby Roslin-y. Ooh, the lottery! It was a triple rollover at the weekend! I got my usual numbers of 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 59. I don’t trust 58. Any joy? They failed to come in but, even so, what fun! It’s the experience of The National Lottery Live that makes it what it is, rather than the actual winning of £13.4m. Hmm. Well, I may have a bit of bad news about … Ah, yes, the national lottery TV draw and all its attendant add-ons is surely the cornerstone of any Saturday night, more so than those fly-by-night shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, The X Factor and Casualty. Yes, well, have you seen the news that … Who can forget such masterly lottery gameshow innovations as Wright Around the World with Ian Wright, and Come and Have a Go If You Think You’re Smart Enough? THEY’RE TAKING THE SATURDAY-NIGHT SHOW OFF BBC1! And those slight format changes to freshen things up! Such as doubling the price of tickets and adding 10 extra numbers to make a jackpot win more or less imposs… Wait, what? The Saturday-night show is being axed from BBC1 as of January 2017 in a new three-year deal with Camelot. I seem to have something in my eye ... It is going digital-only, as is often the way of things nowadays. As of next year, if you want to watch the draw, you’ll have to do it on iPlayer. What is the meaning of this outrage? Camelot’s Tim Copper says: “We’re embracing changes in players’ results-checking habits – providing content that they can access at all times, across multiple different touch-points.” “Results-checking habits”? “Multiple touch-points”? Sounds like a load of bonus balls to me. I think it’s a way of politely saying that nobody watches the programme any more. Scandalous! I watch every show. Mind you, I do have a shrine to Gaby Roslin in my garden shed. What does the BBC have to say for itself? Director of BBC content Charlotte Moore reassures us that “this new deal reaffirms the BBC’s commitment to the national lottery and our ongoing relationship with Camelot”. Will Nick Knowles’ spinoff programmes be adversely affected? We can only hope. Do say: “Sod the format, just show me the money.” Don’t say: “Weeeelll, it hasn’t been the same since Noel was presenting.”"
2016-11-27T17:27:16Z,uk-news,UK news,"Gang dispute behind indiscriminate attacks, warn Merseyside police","Feuding gangs on Liverpool estates have sparked a “chaotic” eruption of violence, with police warning “feral urchins” are launching indiscriminate attacks, injuring children and the elderly. A spate of shootings across Merseyside this year that have injured members of the public are thought to have been inspired by an argument in prison involving one of the UK’s most wanted criminals. Police bosses said gang members on each side of the dispute have thrown out the rule book, firing indiscriminately in their effort to settle the score and earn back community respect. This week a 73-year-old great-grandmother in Netherley was shot in the leg in an attack believed to be linked to the control of Liverpool’s drug trade. Valerie Bradley, grandmother of Kirk Bradley, is related to one of Liverpool’s most notorious crime families. Kirk, a Liverpool gangster, is serving life in prison for crimes including leaving a hand grenade outside the home of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish. Bradley, 31, from Huyton, Merseyside, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in 2012 for orchestrating a wave of shooting and grenade attacks. Valerie’s son, Trevor Bradley, was also imprisoned in 2011 for his attempt to bring £330,000 of cannabis to the north west of England. Her other grandson, Karl Bradley, was found dead after being shot in the back garden of a house in West Derby, Merseyside, in March 2013. Although the attack on Valerie’s house was targeted, there have been others that have led to innocent victims being caught in the crossfire in the spiralling dispute. Two weeks ago a 70-year-old woman was treated for shock after being forced to dive behind the couch of her Netherton house as a gunman unloaded shotgun pellets from the street outside. On Bonfire night a baby – just 12-months-old – was hurt by damage caused when shots were fired at the back of another home in the city.
In September, a four-year-old child was hit by shotgun pellets in a shooting in Millwood Road, in Speke. DCS Paul Richardson, said the incidents showcased the ruthlessness and recklessness with which gang members across Merseyside are now willing to operate. Richardson said he had witnessed the birth of a new breed of unpredictable gangsters who present a greater threat because they do not follow the unwritten codes that sought to spare innocent bystanders from violence. “They do not have the ability to appreciate the consequences of their behaviour and that is frightening,” said Richardson. “They have become so feral that they think the only means of resolving even a petty dispute is to use a firearm.” Richardson said he believed that Kirk was continuing to control the “drugs turf” in Liverpool from his prison cell and this latest spate of violence may have been a result of a dispute with another prisoner. Richardson went on to say that he had noticed a distinct deterioration in the behaviour of the gangsters, who “can’t even behave themselves in court”. “We are now having to try and learn about their mentality. They have no rules.” Kirk Bradley was arrested in Bijlmer, Amsterdam in April 2012 after nine months on the run. Officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency and police in Merseyside and the Netherlands had tracked the fugitive’s movements which led to his arrest. Bradley and his partner in crime Anthony Downes, 30, had previously been arrested in the UK but were able to escape from a prison van after it was attacked by an armed gang in July 2011 on their way to Liverpool crown court. The pair were on trial with four others accused of running a campaign of armed attacks across Merseyside against underworld rivals. Police caught up with Downes a month prior to Bradley at a holiday park close to the Holland and Belgium border and he is also now serving a minimum of 22 years.
The men presided over a guns-for-hire gang, contracted to execute violent acts for cash. Rivals were kneecapped, kidnapped and family homes blown up with hand grenades. Since being jailed in a high security unit at London’s Belmarsh prison, the relationship between Bradley and Downes has deteriorated. Downes stabbed Bradley with a shank in November 2012, but guards were able to intervene before any serious injury. Meanwhile, Kirk’s grandmother remains in hospital with a broken leg. Police say they are no closer to discovering the identity of her attacker. “They all protect each other and they keep people silent by threatening them,” said Richardson. “We know that they have now started storing their firearms in the homes of vulnerable people. But someone, someday will eventually talk and we will be waiting.”"
2016-11-27T18:35:32Z,uk-news,UK news,UK in for cold snap as temperatures forecast to be as low as -8C,"Britain is bracing itself for a cold snap over the coming days, with temperatures forecast to drop to -8C in some parts of the country. Forecasters said Monday was expected to be the coldest night of the week, with the mercury plunging to between -6C (21.2F) to -8C in rural areas and -3C in towns and cities. Sophie Yeomans, from the Met Office, said: “It’s going to be fairly cold for the next few days … It will be colder down south than up in Scotland on Monday and Tuesday due to the clear skies.”
Average temperatures for this time of year are 7C or 8C during the day, dropping to 2C or 3C at night and 1C or zero in Scotland. Yeomans said frost was to be expected in the coming days but that temperatures should return to normal for this time of year by the end of the week. She added: “While there will be fog patches in some areas such as the north of England, the good news is that there is high pressure which should keep things fairly dry, although there might be the odd spot of rain perhaps on Tuesday and into Wednesday when it gets cloudier.” Meanwhile, bookmakers are predicting a good chance of a white Christmas for many parts of Scotland. Ladbrokes are offering odds of 2/1 for snow in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it is offering odds of 3/1 for snow in Newcastle upon Tyne and Belfast, 4/1 for London, 5/1 for Liverpool and Manchester and 6/1 for Cardiff and Birmingham. Jessica Bridge, of Ladbrokes, said: “Winter’s coming, and the odds are falling as quickly as the temperatures are dropping, leaving punters already dreaming of a white Christmas.” The firm is also offering odds of 2/1 that a new record is set for the coldest night of 2016 before next Sunday. It said it was evens that the temperature would drop to -10C or lower."
2016-11-27T19:26:31Z,uk-news,UK news,'Awkward moment' for Prince Harry in minute's silence for Fidel Castro,"Prince Harry has taken part in observing a minute’s silence in remembrance of Fidel Castro. The potentially embarrassing episode took place during a trip to the Caribbean island of St Vincent. The prince joined local dignitaries at a reception in the capital, Kingstown, hosted by the Caribbean country’s governor general, Sir Frederick Ballantyne. News of Castro’s death at the age of 90 broke on Friday and the following day Harry, who is on a 15-day tour of the Caribbean, was among those to bow his head when Ballantyne asked his guests to mark the death of the Cuban revolutionary leader.
Among them was the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines and leader of the country’s ruling Unity Labour party, Dr Ralph Gonsalves, who described Castro as a good friend of his country. The incident prompted criticism from Conservative MPs, who said it was unfair that Prince Harry had been put in such a position. Alec Shelbrooke said the British government should make clear it was unacceptable. He told the Mail: “Castro was a murderous dictator. He is dead, and good riddance. This endless stream of people excusing him, especially Labour MPs like Jeremy Corbyn, is ridiculous. It is very unfair to put pressure on members of the royal family to take part in this kind of tribute.” His Conservative colleague Michael Fabricant told the paper: “I am no fan of Fidel Castro, who was more of a tyrant than an enlightened leader. But I am a fan of Prince Harry. It must have been an awkward moment for him but hey, what else could he do?”
Castro has been a divisive figure on the world stage, coming in for heavy criticism for his regime’s repression of political opposition after it took control in Cuba in 1959, as well as the many deaths of those it deemed a danger to it. But some world leaders praised Castro after his death for the way he led his country and stood staunchly opposed to Washington throughout his life. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, said: “To all the revolutionaries of the world, we have to continue his legacy and his flag of independence, of socialism, of homeland.” Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, said: “He was a great one. Fidel is dead. Long live Cuba! Long live Latin America!” Kensington Palace declined to comment."
2016-11-28T10:45:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Wales urged to do deal with Ireland to secure EU funds post-Brexit,"The Welsh government is being urged to open talks with Ireland in an attempt to secure continued access to European funding after Brexit, under a plan by Plaid Cymru. The party believes it can take a leaf out of Norway’s book. The country gets EU funding despite not being a member, thanks to a partnership with Sweden. “The Welsh government cannot afford to play ‘wait and see’ with Wales’s future relations with our nearest neighbours and must think creatively in order to further Wales’s interests post-Brexit,” said the party’s external affairs spokesman, Steffan Lewis. He made his call for a new Celtic Sea alliance on the first of two days of biannual talks at the British-Irish parliamentary assembly in Cardiff. It says that the Belfast agreement provides for bilateral deals even if the UK quits the EU. Lewis believes such an alliance could mitigate the economic impact of Brexit on Wales and Ireland, which is already being hit by the fall of the pound. The exit from the EU could have devastating consequences on the economy of Wales, where the vast majority voted for Brexit. It is the single biggest beneficiary of EU funds in Britain, with £2.7bn earmarked in the present round of funding. This includes allocations to farms, the European Social Fund, the Horizon science and research fund and the European Regional Development Fund, which accounts for the lion’s share of money at £1.8bn. Ireland is already feeling the brunt of the Brexit vote following the drop of sterling. Britain is the country’s single biggest trading partner and exports are already hit, particularly in food and agriculture. Several mushroom farms in Ireland have already taken a hammering because of the exchange rate and last month political leaders warned of the “incalculable consequences” Brexit would have on the Irish economy. Brexit also poses an opportunity for Wales, with the devolved government expected to redouble efforts to lure Irish business. There are already strong trade links between the two countries, with several major Irish food processing plants in north and south Wales, and it is widely felt that the only way Irish exporters can soften the Brexit blow is to have manufacturing offshoots in Britain. Lewis: “It is necessary for that to be formalised between the governments of Wales and Ireland through an agreement that could establish a Celtic Sea alliance, focused on collaboration between the two nations but especially the western regions of Wales and the eastern regions of Ireland.” There may also be an opportunity for Ireland and Wales to dip into EU inter-region funds, known as Interreg. Norway and Sweden share €73m (£62m) from Interreg funds for programmes designed to protect vulnerable border regions, in terms of environment, employment and social cohesion. The notion that Wales could continue to benefit from EU funds comes as similar attempts are made in sectors such as education and science, which are heavily dependent on EU funds. British universities are considering plans to open branches inside the European Union to soften the blow of Britain’s exit. University leaders fear Brexit will make student and staff recruitment much more difficult, cutting off EU research and funding and probably constricting the flow of EU students, who have been the fastest growing proportion of young undergraduates. Funding in scientific research often flows from collaboration with institutes across Europe, and elite universities feel they will be excluded from cross-border consortia long before Britain quits the EU."
2016-11-28T11:58:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham pub bombings inquest fails to trace families,"The families of eight victims of the Birmingham pub bombings have had no contact with the reopened inquest into their deaths, a hearing in the city has been told. Efforts to trace the families have been unsuccessful, Peter Thornton QC, the chief coroner for England and Wales, said on Monday. He appealed to relatives of the eight to come forward if they wished to be involved. The inquest was reopened earlier this year after Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, said she had serious concerns that police may have failed to act on advance warnings about the attacks. Lawyers representing a further eight families told the hearing they had yet to receive any funding, while lawyers for a ninth said they had received limited funding but that no money appeared to be available for future work. Both said the situation compared unfavourably with the inquest into the deaths of 96 people killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, during which the Home Office provided some discretionary funding for families’ legal teams. Thornton said he supported the application for funding. Twenty-one people died when the IRA bombed two pubs in Birmingham in November 1974. It was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in British history. More than 180 people were injured, many seriously. The following year, six men – now known as the Birmingham Six – were convicted of the attacks and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1991, however, their convictions were quashed, in an acknowledgment of what is now seen as one of the UK’s worst miscarriages of justice. The hearing was adjourned until February, and the full inquests are expected to begin next September."
2016-11-28T12:55:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Football child sex abuse claims widen to Leeds United and Blackpool,"Leeds United and Blackpool are the latest football clubs to be engulfed by allegations of child sexual abuse within the sport, according to the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association. Gordon Taylor said a number of former players had come forward to say they had been abused by staff at the two clubs as well as at Crewe, Manchester City, Stoke and Newcastle. “Of those who became apprentices and senior players, over 20 players have come forward,” he said. “We’d start at Crewe, go to Man City, Stoke, Blackpool, Newcastle, Leeds. “I’m expecting there will be more. I can’t believe it’s just going to be in the north-west and north-east. We need to be mindful this could be throughout the country in the same way it’s been in other professions where children are there – in the church, in schools.” Football’s governing body has been forced to launch an independent investigation into the escalating scandal, vowing to determine how a suspected paedophile ring was allowed to prey on youth players. The Football Association recruited an independent QC to oversee an internal review after former players came forward to claim they were abused by coaches and trainers. The Guardian is aware of many others from junior teams who have done the same and the FA has acknowledged its initial investigation could eventually lead to a full-scale inquiry into the sport. The review will seek to establish how much information was available at the time about the alleged activities of Barry Bennell, the convicted paedophile at the centre of the scandal. Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, former players at Crewe Alexandra, waived their anonymity to tell the Guardian that they had been sexually abused when Bennell was running the club’s youth system. Bennell, now 62, has served three prison sentences totalling 15 years for multiple offences involving Crewe and various other teams, but there are growing fears that he was colluding with at least one other paedophile. The FA’s hotline, set up with the NSPCC and described as “a safe space for any further whistleblowing”, has received more than 100 calls. Taylor suggested that some of the issues his organisation had encountered with players suffering from mental health issues could be linked to the crimes of Bennell and others. “We’ve had issues of depression and, of course, issues that caused suicides – some of what might be coming out might help explain that as well,” he said. Many of the players who have already come forward have voiced similar fears. The FA said it was now looking at how the system allowed Bennell to get away with it for so long and whether the two clubs where he had the strongest links, Crewe and Manchester City, ought to have done more to investigate allegations about his behaviour. “The internal review will look into what information the FA was aware of at the relevant times … what clubs were aware of, and what action was or should have been taken,” a statement read. “The FA has instructed independent leading counsel Kate Gallafent QC to assist it with a review into the abuse cases which have recently come to light. At this time, with acknowledgement that a wide-ranging inquiry may be required in time, we are working closely with the police to support their lead investigations and must ensure we do not do anything to interfere with, or jeopardise, the criminal process.” Edward Timpson, MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said: “The players that have broken their silence to speak out about the abuse they suffered have shown immense courage. No one must ever feel they can’t or shouldn’t be able to do the same. It’s now important to understand what happened and why, and let all those affected know that they don’t need to be alone.” Bennell started coaching in 1970 and worked with numerous teams in Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire before serving his first prison sentence in 1994 in Florida, having molested a British boy on a tour. Crewe have stated they are holding their own investigation into how the club dealt with allegations about their employee, and another of their former youth-team players, Anthony Hughes, has joined the growing number of victims to go public, telling the Sunday Mirror he was also targeted by a man the US authorities have described as having “almost an insatiable appetite” for young boys. The Metropolitan police as well as the Hampshire and Cheshire forces have confirmed they are investigating complaints within the football world. Northumbria police said they were investigating an allegation from a former Newcastle player that he was abused in the club’s youth system. Newcastle said they would cooperate with authorities “if or when the club receives further information” but that all they knew currently came from what was printed in the Guardian. Stoke have said they had not been approached about any specific allegation but were ready to investigate if necessary while Manchester City, where Bennell was affiliated with their junior teams for seven years, have said in a statement: “[We are] currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organisation.” Tony Book, Manchester City’s youth-team coach when Bennell was coaching junior teams affiliated to the club, declined to comment. “The club are handling it and I’m not getting involved at all,” he said. Bernard Halford, the former club secretary and honorary life president, also said he did not want to talk about the issue. Blackpool said they had not received any information from the authorities but that if they were to do so the club would “provide every assistance”. Leeds United said they had not been made aware of any allegations regarding sexual abuse from the PFA or any other governing bodies to date. The club added they would take any complaints seriously and would cooperate fully with the PFA and the FA with any such investigations. “The safeguarding of our young players is of the upmost importance to Leeds United,” they said. Anyone with any complaints or concerns should contact the NSPCC helpline on 0800 023 2642 or contact the Club’s Safeguarding Officer via email on safeguarding@leedsunited.com"
2016-11-28T17:35:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Millionaire murdered woman he paid to be his private escort, court told","A multimillionaire businessman murdered a woman after paying her up to £10,000 a month to be his exclusive escort, a jury has been told. Farmer and property developer Peter Morgan, 54, allegedly strangled Georgina Symonds, 25, and used his Porsche to take her body to a hiding place. Morgan took Symonds to spa days, put her up in plush hotels and once took her on a helicopter ride from a castle that he owned, Newport crown court in south Wales heard. Other gifts included riding lessons and expensive liposuction, the court heard. William Hughes QC, prosecuting, told the jury the murder was carefully planned. He said Morgan made a ligature in his workshop before going to his victim’s home to kill her, equipped with duct tape and plastic sheeting to wrap her body in, as well as a metal pole to help him lift it. Hughes told the court: “That metal pole fitted perfectly inside the boot of his Porsche Cayenne.” Symonds was reported missing after failing to collect her five-year-old daughter from school. Morgan, a married father of two from Llanellen, near Abergavenny, denies murder. Hughes said: “The murder of Georgina Symonds was premeditated and well-planned by Peter Morgan. After killing Georgina he went to great lengths to move her and conceal her body and cover his own tracks for some time. “Peter Morgan was a very successful and wealthy businessman with a large property portfolio. He made his money through farming before moving into property development and by his own words was a millionaire many times over.” The jury of eight men and four women heard Symonds, who trained as a beautician, was working as a pole dancer and then as an escort when she met Morgan. At first she would see other clients and he would use other escorts. Hughes said: “But the relationship developed from being a professional one to something a bit more than that. He would lavish her with gifts and spend a lot of money on her.” He told the jury: “There came a point when he did not want her to see other clients and began paying her between £7,000 and £10,000 a month and put her up to live in a property he owned.” After her disappearance, Morgan was questioned by police and admitted he killed Symonds, the jury heard. Hughes said: “He planned and decided to kill Georgina … He said he attended her address with the items required to assist him in the disposal of her body. “In post-arrest interviews he said he made a ligature from twine at his workshop. He went to her home address to kill her and he took duct tape, plastic sheeting to wrap her body [in] and a metal pole to lift and assist him in carrying her body.” Morgan plotted to kill Symonds after suspecting she was about to break off their arrangement, the court heard. Known to her friends as “Rich Pete”, he became “increasingly controlling” and “obsessive”, it was claimed. He allegedly installed a secret listening device, disguised as an adaptor, in her home. It was fitted with a sim card and recorded her phone calls, allowing Morgan to listen in, it is alleged. The court was told he killed her after hearing her tell another man on the phone that she would leave Morgan once he signed over his bungalow to her. Hughes said: “Morgan told police he heard her mention … she was going to leave him and carry on working as an escort … He did not want her seeing other clients. He wanted her exclusively. His increasing wish was to monitor her, to the point of obsession.” Morgan is alleged to have told police he had killed Symonds after they traced her mobile phone to his Porsche, parked at his farmhouse, saying: “I strangled her this morning. I took her body to Beech Hill Farm. I love her so much.” He then allegedly told police that he locked her body in an outhouse, and refused a lawyer after he was arrested, saying: “I done it. So there’s no point.” The court heard Morgan had separated from his wife, Helen, and divorce proceedings were ongoing. Symonds, from Allt-yr-yn, Newport, was found dead in January. The trial, expected to last three weeks, continues."
2016-11-28T19:08:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Sheffield trees dispute prompts 'scenes you'd expect in Putin's Russia',"It was, said Nick Clegg, “something you’d expect to see in Putin’s Russia, rather than a Sheffield suburb”. Council contractors and police had descended on a particularly desirable street in his Hallam constituency under the cover of darkness, “dragged” people out of bed to move their cars and detained peaceful protesters – “all to chop down eight trees”, he wrote in a local paper. So far five people have been arrested in relation to a long-running and increasingly bitter battle over the fate of Sheffield’s trees, including a 70-year old emeritus professor and a 71-year-old retired teacher, both women. On Thursday two men will become the first of the city’s tree protesters to appear in court, charged under trade union legislation, following a protest on 2 November.
One of them, the author and university lecturer Simon Crump, 56, a local Green party member, said he was arrested for protecting a 100-year-old London plane tree on Marden Road in Nether Edge. He said he was locked in a cell for eight hours and that he would have been released sooner but, he claimed, officers could not find the offence he had allegedly committed on the police computer. “It was quite Kafkaesque. I was being imprisoned because they couldn’t work out what to charge me with,” said Crump. He was subsequently charged under Section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which criminalises anyone who persistently stops someone from carrying out lawful work – in this case tree surgeons contracted by Amey, an outsourcing company, to chop down trees under a controversial contract with the city council. Crump has vowed to plead not guilty at Sheffield magistrates court on Thursday, along with the self-described tree campaigner Calvin Payne. “The way I see it, our case has implications for the right to peaceful protest against anything,” said Crump. The fight for Sheffield’s trees has its roots in a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal signed by the Labour-run council in 2012, which Amey pledged would “see Sheffield’s roads transformed from some of the worst in the country to the best in the country within the first five years”.
The council says many of the trees are diseased and that their roots have ruined pavements, making them impassible for wheelchair users and buggies. But the Save Sheffield’s Trees group argues that Amey works without proper consultation and is motivated by profit rather than any desire to protect the trees. “If they blitz the city’s trees in the first five years of their 25-year contract, they can spend the next 20 years with much lower maintenance costs,” the group argues. They have formed a sort of arboreal neighbourhood watch scheme to keep tabs on any tree that is suddenly adorned with a “felling notice” by Amey, scrambling a protest group as soon as the men with chainsaws turn up. When contacted by the Guardian on Monday, Amey passed the request on to the council, which previously said of Amey’s work: “If a tree is damaging or obstructing we will make all reasonable practical attempts to try and retain this tree in situ by applying one or more of over 20 sensitive engineering solutions. If these cannot be applied then the tree will be replaced. All trees that are removed as part of this project will be replaced on a one-for-one basis.”
But the protesters are not convinced. It is a scrap that threatens the Labour party’s future in the city, according to Jim Lafferty, the chair of the Sheffield Central constituency Labour party. On Friday he wrote to Julie Dore, the council leader, warning her that many local party members had quit over the tree dispute and that many council seats could be lost. “This is not synthetic outrage by a privileged minority of politically motivated opponents of the Labour party, unaffected by the harsh realities of Tory-imposed cuts. Neither is it a desperate attempt by an environmental lobby to block the essential road improvement schemes being carried out across the city,” wrote Lafferty. “This is a rejection by the grassroots membership of the party.” So far 4,000 trees have been felled, the campaigners claim, with a further 36,000 still standing — most of which are not under threat, the council insists. The biggest fight so far has been over eight lime trees which have shaded the well-heeled residents of Rustlings Road opposite Endcliffe Park for more than 100 years. As referenced in Clegg’s piece in the Sheffield Star, a team from Amey turned up at 5am two weeks ago to warn car owners that they should move their vehicles if they did not want them to be crushed by breakfast. Freda Brayshaw, a retired French teacher, was having none of it. Though warned by police not to approach the trees, she stepped over a barrier of tape and moved towards one trunk. The response was swift: for the first time in her 71 years she found herself under arrest and was put into a police car, along with her friend Jenny Hockey, a professor emeritus of sociology at Sheffield University, and a man.
Currently awaiting a court summons, Brayshaw insists she has no regrets, despite spending eight very cold hours in a police cell. “I am passionate about Sheffield’s trees. This is a very polluted city,” she said. “They are doing a job for free: you can work out the value of these trees in terms of flood defences and countering air pollution. That is why we decided to take non-violent direct action to try to save them.” Save Sheffield’s Trees claim that PFI contracts are bad for democracy because private companies are not subject to freedom of information laws, “so there’s no scrutiny and no accountability”. Many residents, including Clegg, have tried and failed to get hold of an unredacted version of Amey’s PFI contract with Sheffield city council. “We’ve tried so many times that the council has now deemed our requests to be ‘vexatious’,” claimed Crump. At the weekend the council finally issued a statement on the Rustlings Road situation. “We would like to offer an apology to the people of Sheffield who were affected by the way in which we took the trees down on Thursday of last week, and particularly those living on Rustlings Road, who will also receive an apology in the post. We are sorry for the disruption and distress caused by the work starting at 5am,” Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for environment at Sheffield city council, said in a statement. “As we continue to carry out work as part of the largest investment there has ever been in the city’s street trees, and to protect the city’s 36,000 street trees for generations to come, it is important that we take necessary measures to ensure that we protect the safety of our workforce, and the public. But we know we got it wrong last week with the way the work was started. We have listened and are sorry for the mistakes that we made.”"
2016-11-28T23:25:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Ireland gets ready for first papal visit since 1979,"In 1979, in the early days of his papacy, Pope John Paul II landed at Dublin airport and kissed the ground as he disembarked from an Aer Lingus Boeing 747 named the St Patrick. Ireland was then a bastion of Roman Catholicism in which the church’s moral authority was unquestioned, divorce was banned and homosexuality illegal. Over three days, more than 2.5 million people came to see the Polish pontiff. More than 1 million of them packed Phoenix Park in Dublin for an outdoor mass, and hundreds of thousands lined the streets to welcome him. At a liturgy in Killineer, near Drogheda, the pope prayed for an end to the Troubles: “On my knees, I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and return to the ways of peace.” Ireland has had to wait almost four decades for another papal visit, and in that time much has changed. When Pope Francis arrives in 2018 for a trip announced by the Irish prime minister on Monday, he will find a republic where gay marriage is legal, the Troubles are over and the Catholic church has been damaged, perhaps irreparably, by a deluge of sexual abuse and exploitation scandals. He may even do what no pope has done before: cross the border into Northern Ireland. “I think there is no prospect whatsoever of him coming to Ireland and not coming to the North,” said Martin McGuinness, the region’s deputy first minister, who at the time of the last papal visit was a senior member of the IRA. Asked why he was so sure, McGuinness replied: “Because I’m around a long time and I know how these things work.” Later, a spokesman for Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, said: “Were the pope to visit Northern Ireland in his capacity as head of state then the first minister would meet him.” If he does cross the border, the pontiff will find a radically changed, more peaceful society than that which existed in 1979, when it was deemed far too dangerous for John Paul II to travel there. During the year of his visit, the IRA ratcheted up its violent campaign, culminating in the murder of Lord Mountbatten in County Sligo and the deaths of 18 British paratroopers on the same day in August. In 1988 the then leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Ian Paisley, denounced John Paul II as the antichrist. South of the border, too, things have changed. Francis’s political host for the visit, the taoiseach Enda Kenny, launched a blistering attack on the global Catholic leadership in 2011, accusing the Vatican of trying to play down the gravity of a report into widespread clerical sex abuse in the Cloyne diocese and saying that “dysfunction, disconnection, elitism and narcissism … dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day”.
Kenny’s audience with Francis at the Vatican on Monday, after which the papal visit was announced, was seen as a bridge-building exercise. The Irish Catholic hierarchy will see the arrival of the popular Argentinian pontiff as a means of reasserting the authority of the church. But many Irish people believe the church has a long way to go before it can recover its credibility. Some victims of clerical sex abuse warned the papal visit would be used by conservative religious forces to prevent the further secularisation of Ireland. Sarah Clancy, who remembers seeing John Paul II at an outdoor mass in Galway as a seven-year-old, said she was mesmerised by the man speaking to hundreds of thousands of people in an accent that was unfamiliar to her. But she rebelled against the church and blames her struggle with bisexuality in her 20s on “the culture of shame that Irish authoritarian Catholicism promoted”. The church in Ireland will hope the memory of Francis’s visit will be less bitter. “Pope Francis has been an important voice for the young, the poor and disadvantaged,” Kenny tweeted. “Glad he will visit Ireland in 2018.”"
2016-11-29T00:01:33Z,uk-news,UK news,London mayor sets 35% affordable homes target in deal with developers,"Sadiq Khan will allow private housebuilders to limit the amount of affordable housing included in new developments to 35% in a deal that opponents said casts doubt on his election promise to “set a target for 50% of all new homes in London to be genuinely affordable”.
The threshold, announced on Tuesday by the London mayor in a new housing strategy, is intended to increase housebuilders’ contribution to cheaper housing, but the Conservative opposition accused Khan on Monday night of “ratting on what he said during the election”, something strongly denied by City Hall. Andrew Boff, the Tory housing spokesman on the London assembly, said: “There was a clear statement that 50% was what he wanted. Now this has become a long-term aspiration. The mayor has resiled on his housing target.” Khan said he now planned to “move towards a long-term strategic goal” of half of new homes being genuinely affordable and stressed that “fixing the housing crisis will be a marathon not a sprint”. City Hall believes the demand for 35% from private builders is an important first step towards delivering 50% by the end of this decade.
Khan also said he would grant £3.15bn allocated to City Hall by the chancellor in last week’s autumn statement to housing associations who build a minimum of 50% affordable homes “with some partners enabled to deliver at least 60%”. It is estimated this will provide funding for at least 90,000 affordable homes over the next six-year period, an increase of nearly 50% on the previous six years. They will be a mix of low-cost rent, shared ownership and “London living rent” which is based on a third of average incomes in each borough. The announcement of the new target as part of supplementary planning guidance comes amid a deepening crisis in the availability of cheap housing in the capital. Just 13% of the new homes approved in London in 2014-15 were classed as affordable, which includes rents as high as 80% of market rates. That is down from almost a third in 2007-08. Khan and his deputy mayor for housing, James Murray, have been in talks with developers since May about ways of speeding up the delivery of housing of all kinds.
“London is in the midst of a housing crisis, with thousands of Londoners priced out of a city they call home,” said Khan. “These announcements today demonstrate real progress on the long road towards fixing London’s housing crisis.” Khan wants to speed up the planning process by exempting developers from revealing the profitability of their schemes to officials if they promise to build at least 35% affordable housing. It is understood that some developers wanted the figure to be set at 30%. Currently, City Hall can insist on seeing the financial model behind a housing scheme to ensure the developer is not making surplus profits when they could be providing more affordable units. In most major applications, developers have to provide a “viability assessment” that shows the costs and revenues of a development, and therefore how much affordable housing can be provided while maintaining a profit. It often leads to disputes between housebuilders and planners. City Hall said the new approach would “offer developers a new quicker route through the planning process, removing the requirement for protracted viability negotiations if they meet the minimum 35% affordable housing”. Boff also questioned whether Khan would be able to deliver 35% affordable housing from private developers, who he predicted would argue that they could only go ahead with projects if they are allowed to deliver less and would therefore turn down the 35% fast-track approach in favour of negotiation."
2016-11-29T00:01:33Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scottish councils' cash reserves are running out, says watchdog","Many Scottish councils face losing all their reserves unless they continue to make deep cuts in spending, the local government watchdog has warned. The Accounts Commission predicts that well over a third of Scotland’s 32 councils will face a funding gap by 2018 that is larger than their reserves, while Falkirk and South Lanarkshire believe that shortfall will dwarf their savings next year. It estimates the cumulative size of the funding shortfall and councils’ use of reserves could exceed £1bn from this year through to April 2019, depending on how councils manage their budgets. In its 2016/17 financial overview, the Accounts Commission reports that councils have substantially increased their reserves to some £2.5bn despite absorbing cuts in central government support of 8.4% since 2010/11, at the same time as taking on a heavier workload. Originally intended to act as long-term sources of top-up funding in the face of ongoing cuts, those reserves would be essential to guarantee services at 13 councils within the next 12 months unless they continued to cut spending, find efficiencies or reduce services, it said. Scotland’s councils had put aside reserves of £2.5bn in March 2016 as a cushion against ongoing cuts and soaring social services costs. They had investments of £1.5bn, which helped bring down net debt to £13.6bn; excluding those investments, overall debt stood at £15.25bn.
Councils are expected to see their incomes from the government, council tax and business rates fall annually from £11.94bn this year to £11.72bn in 2018/19 – including small increases in council tax rates for some councils. And in 2018/19, the commission estimates that the year’s deficit will be £553m – more than half the projected £1bn deficit from this year to April 2019. The report’s warnings have fuelled an increasingly intense debate on the future of Scottish local government financing in the run-up to next May’s council elections, when the Scottish National party is forecast to make substantial gains. Professor John Curtice of the Scottish Centre for Social Research says the current polls suggest the SNP could win overall control of a dozen councils and become the largest party in 12 more. It already runs Perth and Dundee and would take control of Glasgow – the biggest political prize the SNP has yet to win – as well as Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Stirling. The SNP government in Edinburgh has refused to support cross-party and expert calls for a fundamental reform of council financing but for the first time since 2008 will allow councils to increase council tax rates by 3% next year. Since the Accounts Commission forecasts ministers will continue cutting central funding, that will shift the political onus for raising taxes away from ministers and on to councils. In parallel with that option for an overall 3% increase, ministers have changed council tax bands by cutting them for the lowest rated homes but increasing tax on higher value homes. That will hit richer areas such as Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire, West Dumbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the umbrella body for most Scottish councils, did not respond directly to the commission’s findings on its reserves but said its members were doing their best to manage. Councillor Kevin Keenan, its finance spokesman, said the Scottish government made their task far harder by only giving councils funding estimates a year in advance. That made it harder to plan with any certainty. “We all know the direction of travel for public sector finances,” Keenan said. “Whilst councils and councillors do their best to mitigate the damage to communities from political choices made at the centre this is becoming harder and harder to do.” Andy Wightman, the Scottish Greens’ local government spokesman at Holyrood, said these financial challenges strengthened the case for substantial reforms of council funding. The Scottish Greens have also called for all council debt to be written off. Councils spent £1.5bn last year servicing their debts. “It is clear we now need to dedicate as much time and energy on negotiating a fiscal framework for local government to set the ground rules for future funding and to increase fiscal autonomy and democracy,” Wightman said. Alex Rowley, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said it would aim to amend next year’s Scottish budget to increase higher rates of income tax in part to fund increased council spending. “These figures confirm that the SNP has slashed funding for local services, like schools and social care, which put the life chances of people across Scotland at risk,” he said. No Scottish government minister responded. Instead, a spokesman said: “This report highlights the pressures that councils – like other parts of the public sector – face, but also highlights that they are continuing to improve services. We expect local authorities to continue to use resources as efficiently and effectively as possible to ensure taxpayers get the best possible services and value for money.”"
2016-11-29T00:38:53Z,uk-news,UK news,SFO will not charge former Tesco boss over accounting scandal,"Tesco’s former chief executive Philip Clarke will not face charges in relation to an accounting scandal at the supermarket chain, it has been confirmed. Clarke’s lawyer, David Corker, said on Monday that he had received a letter from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) informing him of the decision. Unconfirmed reports in recent weeks had suggested Clarke would escape prosecution. “Following a thorough review of the evidence obtained … it has been decided not to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction,” the letter read, according to Corker. He had been questioned over the scandal, which left a £326m hole in Tesco’s books in 2014. The company admitted it had overstated profits by £263m by incorrectly booking payments from suppliers. It later revised the overstatement up by £63m. Three other former Tesco directors in the UK have been charged over the allegations that the firm overstated its profits in 2014. Carl Rogberg, Tesco UK’s former finance director, Christopher Bush, its former managing director, and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, were each charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. They face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of fraud by abuse and seven years for false accounting. They have each denied the charges and the case has been sent to Southwark crown court for trial. A source told the Guardian that the decision not to charge Clarke cast doubt on reports that the SFO would seek to prosecute the company because the former directors who have been charged were not sufficiently senior to back up claims of corporate fraud. The SFO declined to comment, save for indicating that its investigation is continuing. It is understood that its options would be to bring charges, drop them, or come to a deferred prosecution agreement with Tesco that would require the firm to agree to a set of conditions, such as allowing in monitors."
2016-11-29T08:22:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Unions warn of 'massive betrayal' if shipbuilding contracts leave Scotland,"Union leaders are warning of a potential “massive betrayal” of working-class communities in Scotland if the Westminster government’s delayed national shipbuilding strategy, expected to be published on Tuesday, recommends that future contracts be awarded outside the UK. An independent review of the long-term sustainability of UK shipbuilding, by the industrialist Sir John Parker, was submitted a fortnight ago and had been expected to form part of the autumn statement. Parker’s report is likely to question the current dominance of naval shipbuilding by BAE Systems at its Upper Clyde yards, and highlight the success of so-called “modular” construction of vessels in different locations around the UK. Earlier this month, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, announced work on eight Royal Navy Type 26 frigates would begin next summer exclusively at BAE’s Govan and Scotstoun yards, safeguarding nearly 3,000 jobs. But as speculation grows about the contents of the Parker review, there are fears that work promised to Scotland could go to England. Anxieties about the loss of Scottish contracts to both the the rest of the UK and overseas have been rife since the 2014 independence referendum campaign, when the impact of leaving the union on the future of the industry became a key issue. Noting that shipbuilding on the Upper Clyde and the Forth supports nearly 10,000 jobs and generates more than £260m in wages for the economy, the GMB Scotland organiser and chair of CSEU Scotland, Gary Cook, said: “Scotland simply cannot do without these shipbuilding contracts. Any offshoring of future contracts outside of the UK would be a massive betrayal to British manufacturing and to the prosperity of working-class communities like Rosyth, which are supported by this type of work.” Cook added: “Parker could present a fantastic opportunity to revitalise shipbuilding across the rest of the UK and, after the securing the long-term future of the Upper Clyde, sustain the significant economic and employment contribution made by the likes Rosyth for the next generation.” Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, Parker said his report would be recommending that all of the Type 26 frigates continue to be built by BAE on the Clyde, as well as the “modular” construction of future vessels in different locations in order to ready the UK industry for export challenges. Parker said: “We are recommending that BAE really use that full workload to push forward with full modernisation of its technology, for example to advance its digital engineering, industrialisation and productivity along with unions, with training and with the workforce, so that it is absolutely match-fit to be the natural yard of choice for the very sophisticated top-of-the-end warships like the Type 26 and the next generation beyond that.” Delays have dogged the replacement of the navy’s 13 ageing frigates. Last week, Westminster’s defence select committee warned that uncertainty over plans to replace the “woefully low” number of warships were putting Britain’s defences at risk. In last autumn’s defence review, the government announced it would order eight new Type 26 warships instead of the original 13. There are concerns that promised work on smaller and cheaper offshore patrol vehicles will not be sufficient to keep the yards’ order books full and maintain the workforce. Plans for a state-of-the-art “frigate factory” – which it had been hoped would help the Clyde yards win future export orders – also appeared to have been shelved. The navy is understood to favour the ships being built more quickly and cheaply abroad, while concerns have also been raised that defence budget cuts mean that there is simply not enough money for both Type 26 frigates and the smaller, general purpose Type 31 frigates – which were also promised in the defence review – to be made on the Clyde. While it would be politically risky for Fallon to renege on the Type 26 contracts now, the contracts for the Type 31 and three royal fleet auxiliary support vessels still hang in the balance. Cook concluded: “The UK government has talked a lot about how the working class have been downtrodden, so we are challenging them to make good on their words by ensuring the contracts for the three RFA support vessels are awarded to British yards and also the contracts for the Type 31 frigates.’"
2016-11-29T10:00:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester Chinatown fire pair named locally as Popeye and Uncle Albert,"Two homeless men who died after a fire ripped through a building in Manchester’s Chinatown have been named locally as Wayne and James, who were nicknamed Uncle Albert and Popeye. The pair are thought to have lit a fire in an attempt to keep warm in the freezing conditions early on Friday morning. Their bodies were found on the first floor of the derelict building on Nicholas Street, a spot known to be commonly used by rough sleepers. Fire crews were called just before 2.15am to tackle the blaze, which illuminated the quarter’s imperial arch and blocked city centre roads. At just after 11.30am on Friday, police announced that they had found two bodies.
Greater Manchester police said they could not confirm the names, but were working to formally identify the victims, a task they said could prove difficult because of the nature of their injuries. The investigation is expected to be concluded later this week and the building returned to its owners. One post on the Feed the Homeless: Manchester Facebook group read: “The two people killed in the Chinatown fire have been informally confirmed as homeless and informally named as nickname Popeye and Wayne. What I have been told is that they have kicked a candle over while asleep. However, I guess that is speculation based on knowledge of the conditions inside the building.” A spokesman from Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said investigators had been back at the scene on Tuesday morning and the fire was so intense that they still could not confirm that no one else had been in the building at the time of the blaze.
The top floors of the building were completely burned through and it is expected to be another three or four weeks before the cause of the fire is confirmed. The building is listed, but while the facade will be saved, the internal structure will undergo a “long, protracted and complicated demolition job”. News of the two men’s deaths prompted calls for further action to tackle homelessness in Manchester. Amanda Croome, the manager of the Booth Centre, which offers support for homeless people in the city, said the fire had once again bought Manchester’s homelessness problem to public attention “in a very sad and stark way”. She said it was not uncommon for rough sleepers to seek shelter in unsafe, derelict buildings across the city. “It’s something we talk to people about on an ongoing basis, if they are sleeping in buildings, about making sure they are safe,” Croome said. The official number of people sleeping rough in Manchester has increased tenfold since 2010, when the council’s annual rough sleeper count recorded seven on one night. In comparison, 70 people were logged in the most recent count on the same evening last December, up from 43 in 2014. Lucy Powell, the Labour MP for Manchester Central, said the deaths highlighted the risks homeless people and rough sleepers faced, particularly during winter months. “Successive Tory and Tory-Lib Dem governments have overseen a drastic increase in homelessness, as well as savage cuts to the wide range of council and voluntary services which support people who are homeless or at risk of becoming so,” she said. “Like most people in Manchester, I am horrified at the plight of homeless people in our society. Tragedies like this highlight the real risks people face and the need to do more.”"
2016-11-29T11:56:41Z,uk-news,UK news,"Sadiq Khan sets out key plans for more ""genuinely affordable"" London homes","London mayor Sadiq Khan has published two important documents designed to increase the number of new homes built in the capital that are, in his pointedly chosen words, “genuinely affordable” to Londoners on low and middle incomes. One is his Affordable Homes Programme covering the next four-and-a-half years, which sets out how the minimum £3.15bn being dispensed to him by the government during that time will be spent. The other is his draft Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) aimed at streamlining the process for getting new homes built and pushing up the proportion of them that meet that “genuinely affordable” definition. Both should help the supply of such homes under Mayor Khan outstrip that achieved under Boris Johnson. The paradox of writing about housing issues in London is that they concern basic human needs and deep human feelings while the business of addressing them involves arid technical terms and terrifying maths. Try to keep thinking of people with very little money living in cramped and insecure conditions, or “priced out” teachers, nurses, cooks and even solicitors as I endeavour to explain why the two new documents matter and how the mayor’s housing policy experts think they will help. Affordable Homes Programme The £3.15bn is to help fund 90,000 new homes, the construction of all of which must at least have started by March 2021. From scratch, it typically takes a couple of years to get one finished. The mayor’s agreement with the government is that nearly all the new homes will be one of three of Khan’s principal “genuinely affordable” types. A minimum of 58,500 of them will be either Shared Ownership or London Living Rent dwellings, 29,000 will be for Affordable Rent and there might be some other types of properties which, in small numbers, could also qualify for support under the programme. So, what are those three kinds of “genuinely affordable” home? Shared Ownership has become a familiar option in London for people who will, to be blunt, never be poor enough to qualify for council or housing association social housing yet have neither the deposit nor the income to get a mortgage as first time buyers on the London open market. Shared Ownership means they can purchase a percentage of a property from a housing association, and pay rent on the remainder. They have the option of increasing the size of the share they own. The right shared ownership deal can be less expensive than private sector renting. Some buyers of shared ownership homes have found themselves hit with heavy service charges they weren’t expecting, so providers benefiting from Khan’s programme are being asked to draw up a charter for governing those. London Living Rent is to be a new form of “genuinely affordable” home for working households from the “intermediate” part of the increasingly cluttered “affordable” spectrum. Rent levels will be at a discount rate based on one-third of the average household income in the boroughs where the homes are built. During the mayoral election campaign, Khan spoke in general terms about London Living Rent levels being low enough to enable tenants to save for a deposit to buy a place of their own. That link is to be formalised for London Living Rent homes built with financial support from the mayor, with providers of the homes expected to “actively support” tenants into home ownership within ten years and give them the right to buy a share of the home they have been renting. Just as shared ownership is seen as providing a first step into home ownership, these are seen as first steps into shared ownership. Controversy has surrounded Affordable Rent since its introduction by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition as part of slashing its grants to housing associations. Officially, it is a form of social housing and is allocated to people eligible for it, but its rents can be as high as 80% of those charged by local private landlords - far higher than traditional social rent and very far indeed from “genuinely affordable” in many parts of London, as Khan’s policy recognises. That said, Affordable Rent can be worthy of the name. Such properties let at 50% of local rates can be very adjacent to traditional social rent levels and in (relatively) inexpensive parts of the capital aren’t shockingly high. Khan will contribute to the building of Affordable Rent homes that conform to benchmark levels to be published. Most of the homes funded from the Affordable Homes Programme will be provided by developers whose output across the capital comprises a minimum of 50% affordable homes - that basically means housing associations - and there will be what is described at City Hall as “a strategic relationship” with a small number of big providers who manage 60% or more. Responding to the wishes of the industry, Khan’s team has produced set levels for the grants they will distribute: £60,000 for Affordable Rent homes; £28,000 for London Living Rent or Shared Ownership. Who will get to live in these new “genuinely affordable” homes? Shared Ownership in London has had its critics. In expensive areas, households with incomes of up to £90,000 a year can qualify for it - yes, it’s absurd - though more typical buyers are on less than half of that - the London median is about £40,000, which is close to the median London household income, and the deposits needed are on average something over £13,000, depending on the area. London Living Rent will be available for renting households making up to £60,000 a year. Affordable Rent homes will be allocated on the basis of need, mostly from council waiting lists. It’s worth keeping in mind that tenants can apply for housing benefit. You can read the Affordable Homes Programme 2016-21 here. Supplementary Planning Guidance The draft SPG is a separate but related part of Khan’s housing policy approach. It aims to help maximise the number of “genuinely affordable” homes generated through development schemes agreed between London and property developers of whatever type and size. Formally, it is to ensure the greatest effectiveness of policies in Boris Johnson’s London Plan, which Khan must abide by until he’s able to publish his own London Plan, a laborious enterprise that will take at least two years (there should be a draft by the end of next year). Effectively, the SPG seeks to put a bit of backbone into the relevant part of what Khan has inherited from his predecessor. This states only that the “maximum reasonable” affordable housing should be secured. Language could hardly be looser. The 50-page document creates incentives for boroughs and developers to ensure that housing schemes they negotiate reach a threshold of 35% “genuinely affordable” homes per site without needing public subsidy. If they do, Khan, who has powers to block or even take over planning applications if he’s unhappy with what they offer, will look kindly on them. If they don’t he will set his team of number crunchers on those responsible. At the heart of the draft SPG is the vexed question of viability. It has become standard practice for developers to set out the financial workings of their proposed schemes in viability assessments, which include their arguments for the amount of affordable housing they can afford to include. These are often denounced as opaque, ad hoc, secretive funny number exercises in befuddling hard-pressed council officers into accepting less affordable housing than the developer could, in truth, stump up and still make a healthy profit. The draft SPG encourages a standardisation of the information that viability assessments should include and the methodology that should be used, including crucial stuff about how and when the value of land - a defining financial element - should be inserted into the complex viability equation (have a go at paragraph 3.36 if think you’re hard enough). It says that the mayor won’t even ask developers for viability assessments if their proposals reach the 35% threshold. This is a part of a sort of trade-off, because viability haggling is fraught, expensive and time-consuming for developers too. The mayor’s team, having had numerous discussions with major players from all parts of London’s housing sector over the past six months, are satisfied that this simplification of the planning system at the mayor’s end of it gives developers and boroughs some welcome clarity and certainty. So much for carrot. The stick? If a scheme falls short of the 35% threshold or wants some of Khan’s affordable housing budget in order to reach it, the mayor’s team will, by contrast, want to see very detailed viability calculations which, except in exceptional cases, will be “scrutinised and treated transparently”. A bit like having your iffy maths homework marked in public. Must try harder, and so. Further, such schemes will be subject to “comprehensive review mechanisms”, which means that their viability will be looked at again as they start taking shape, possibly resulting in the “affordable” homes percentage being bumped up. Why 35%? The document describes this level as “ambitious and practical” and “informed by analysis of past completions and approvals” and places it in the context of just 13% of homes given planning permission in London during 2014-15 meeting the (less stringent) definition of “affordable” Johnson used. It also stresses that boroughs whose own local targets are higher than 35% are entirely free to keep at it. There is also a section on Build To Rent housing developments, which have their own, distinctive economics. You can read the draft SPG here. The consultation period ends on 28 February 2017. What difference will the two documents make? The homes Khan wants to fund won’t be the only “affordable” ones built in London during the his mayoral term, which will end in May 2020, and beyond it. The larger housing associations, obliged by government grant cuts and to some extent put off by the complexity of bidding for mayoral funds under Johnson, have been become adept at exploiting London’s inflated property market to become more self-sufficient, building properties for lucrative market sale and using the profits to finance lower cost homes, including on separate sites. A number of London councils have set up their own semi-detached housing delivery companies, enabling them to borrow to build homes their residents can afford. However, the mayor’s interventions in London’s housing market with the powers, the influence and the money he has could be very significant. Boris Johnson left office claiming he had overseen the building of a record 100,000 “affordable” homes in total over two four-year terms. Khan intends to help fund 90,000 over just four-and-half years under a stricter definition of “affordable”. Those are 90,000 starts, not necessarily completions, but let’s do some long division and call that an average of 20,000 starts a year over the four-and-half years to the end of March 2021. It certainly looks more impressive at this stage and getting more money from a Tory government than the Tory Johnson did must count as a success. There is, though, a bigger picture to consider too. London’s overall housing need is generally held to be about 50,000 new homes a year. Khan acknowledged this in his manifesto, though he did not pledge to meet it. He has set no overall absolute target for delivering (or starting) “genuinely affordable” or any other kind of home by the end of his City Hall term. In fairness, it would be difficult to do set one that was really rigorous at this stage, given the vagaries of the property market, especially in the light of Brexit. But he will surely have to at some stage. Another part of that bigger picture, still unclear at this stage, is the future impact in London of the extension of right to buy to housing association tenants and forced sale of council housing stock demanded by the Housing and Planning Act. One target Khan has set - a “long-term strategic one”, as he and his housing deputy James Murray emphasise frequently - is for 50% of all new homes in London to meet his definition of “genuinely affordable” in the capital, be that what he is now calling London Shared Ownership, London Affordable Rent, London Living Rent, traditional social rent or anything else that fits the definition. You don’t have to be all that clever at maths to know that 35% is less than 50% and that reaching an overall London 50% will require plenty of housing schemes that provide more than 50%. But here’s another way to look at it: total new housing output in London has been at around the 25,000 per annum level in recent years. Imagine if it stayed that low until 2021 and Khan’s 20,000 “genuinely affordable” homes were still built during that time. You do the percentages. Meanwhile in the real world, one thing looks pretty clear. It is that Khan and his team have set about their housing task with the same energy and pragmatism that carried the mayor to power. The Affordable Homes Programme and the draft SPG have been welcomed by organisations as varied as Shelter, developer Mount Anvil, David Montague who chairs the G15 group of London’s largest housing associations and business organisation London First. This seems to bode well. But keep your abacus handy."
2016-11-29T13:22:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Hillsborough: police media officer loses 'coercion to spin' case,"A press officer for South Yorkshire police who said she was pressured to spin positive coverage for the force at the Hillsborough inquests has lost her complaint with the police watchdog. Hayley Court told the Guardian earlier this year that she was instructed to emphasise evidence considered favourable to the force to journalists attending the hearings into the deaths of 96 people, including allegations of misbehaviour by Liverpool supporters. She said she first raised concerns internally in September 2014, 19 months before the Hillsborough inquests finished. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found no case to answer for misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. In a report published on Tuesday it said: “Four instances were examined where the superintendent allegedly told Miss Court to ‘schmooze’ the media. Investigators concluded that Miss Court was encouraged to build a working relationship with journalists, however no corroborating evidence was found to support the allegations that this was a deliberate attempt to manipulate the media. “Miss Court’s predecessor stated that the only brief she had when carrying out the role had been to ensure ‘balanced and fair reporting’ of the proceedings. If Miss Court was given the alleged instructions, it seems likely that similar instructions would have been given to anyone carrying out the communications specialist role. “Investigators concluded that Miss Court may have misunderstood some of her directions and highlighted a lack of clear unambiguous written guidance on how the force’s staff should engage with the media during court proceedings.” Court, an experienced journalist who worked from 2010-13 for Hampshire constabulary as a media relations officer, was the acting director of communications for the Association of Chief Police Officers when she was headhunted by South Yorkshire police to work specifically on the Hillsborough inquests. She said she believed it was an opportunity to help South Yorkshire police deal truthfully and face the failings that caused the disaster, and their conduct in the aftermath, when the force blamed innocent supporters who were the victims of the lethal crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Earlier this year the Guardian examined two South Yorkshire police internal reports relating to Court. In a 20-week review of Court’s performance, in November 2014, when she was signed off sick with depression following her complaints of bullying, the South Yorkshire police head of communications, Carrie Goodwin, acknowledged: “Hayley disclosed that she felt she had been asked to act in an unethical manner in that she should coerce the media.” Another internal report, on Court’s complaint that she was being bullied, made it clear that South Yorkshire police believed media coverage of the Hillsborough inquests was biased against them, and managers claimed Court had failed to redress it. The internal investigation did not uphold that there had been “intentional bullying” of Court, but did find that “a number of process issues” in how she had been managed, including not having been set clear objectives for her role when she started at the Hillsborough inquests as well as negative feedback, had “caused Hayley to feel like she was the victim of bullying”. In a statement on Tuesday, Court said she was disappointed with the IPCC ruling. She said: “The public of South Yorkshire, police officers and staff deserve high-quality leaders within their police force who act with integrity and support the reporting of unethical behaviour. Sadly, this was not my experience when I first raised concerns in September 2014 – 19 months before the Hillsborough inquests concluded. “I’m disappointed by the IPCC’s findings, as anyone who has made significant professional sacrifices to highlight concern of wrongdoing would be. Nevertheless, I am grateful to those who examined my claims and carried out as detailed an investigation as their narrow remit allowed. “Any suggestion that I simply misunderstood my instructions is manifestly wrong. I am, as any experienced press officer should be, acutely aware of the value of strong working relationships with the media. My instructions went beyond that and, in my opinion, breached the code of ethics designed to make the police service more open, transparent and accountable. “I stand by my claims and feel it was in the public interest to speak out. I only hope that anyone else who encounters unethical practices within the police or any public sector body is not dissuaded from whistleblowing after seeing the outcome of this particular investigation.” Meanwhile, an independent external review released on Tuesday ruled that the IPCC was right not to investigate Hillsborough families’ complaint about former SYP chief constable David Crompton. The complaint specifically alleged that Crompton instructed barristers representing the force at the inquests to “pour blame” on the Liverpool fans as part of a deliberate effort to deflect blame from SYP. Rachel Cerfontyne, IPCC deputy chair, had previously found the available evidence did not indicate that a criminal or misconduct offence had occurred. She concluded that a “meaningful investigation” would not be possible as communications between Crompton and his inquest legal team were not accessible to the IPCC. These instructions are subject to legal professional privilege, which SYP refused to waive. Cerfontyne’s decision was reviewed by independent external counsel Hugh Tomlinson QC, who had no previous involvement in Hillsborough matters."
2016-11-29T14:35:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Ellie Butler family court judge may be called to 'inevitable' inquest,"The family court judge who ruled that Ellie Butler should be returned to her violent father, who subsequently murdered her, could be required to give evidence at an inquest into the six-year-old’s death, a coroner has said. At a hearing at Croydon coroner’s court into whether to reopen the inquest into Ellie’s death, senior coroner Selena Lynch said the role of the family court played a key part in the case, and that the judge, Dame Mary Hogg, could be asked to attend. “My feeling is that the resumption of the inquest is inevitable because there has been a breach of the article 2 (of the Human Rights Act) duty to protect life,” Lynch said. She added that any investigation of the judiciary raised constitutional issues. She also highlighted the difficulty of a more junior court investigating a higher one. “How can I investigate a superior court?” Lynch asked. “The coroner has the power to summon witnesses and compel evidence of investigations. The Ministry of Justice and Mrs Justice Hogg could be required to attend. There is nothing in law to prevent them from being required to attend but a judge would not be compellable,.” The coroner added that the scope of the inquest would be wide ranging. As well as engaging with the family court she requested evidence from the social workers at Sutton council, the independent social workers from Services For Children (S4C) who supervised Ellie’s return to her parents, the two schools the child attended, her paediatrician, her GP as well as the two hospitals (Chelsea & Westminster and St Helier) where her mother, Jennie Gray, attended after violence from her partner, Ben Butler. Lynch said she would be exploring systemic issues about information-sharing and recording, the framework of cooperation between independent social workers and the council, the lack of communication in relation to putting together the bigger picture in relation to Ellie and identifying the risk to her. Lynch said she favoured a public inquiry rather than an inquest to look at the issues arising from Ellie’s death because they were so wide ranging. However, no decision has yet been made about that and the coroner instructed Sutton social services, the S4C social workers and Ellie’s schools and GP to submit reports to her within 56 days. As far as involving the family court in the inquest, Lynch said she intended to write directly to the secretary of state and would invite Ministry of Justice to engage directly with the coroner’s court. She added that there were ongoing discussions between the president of the family court, Sir James Munby, and officials involved with the serious case review into Ellie’s death. The girl’s grandfather Neal Gray welcomed Tuesday’s developments, saying: “I’m pleased things are moving forward, I don’t mind which way things are done, either by an inquest or a public inquiry, as long as the truth comes out about the role of the individuals and organisations involved with Ellie before she was murdered.” It emerged last week that Jennie Gray had lodged an out of time appeal against her conviction for child cruelty towards Ellie. The coroner said on Thursday that Ben Butler had also lodged appeal papers but that these had been returned for technical reasons. Butler, 36, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years in June for murdering Ellie. Gray was sentenced to 42 months for child cruelly and attempting to pervert the course of justice."
2016-11-29T16:02:59Z,uk-news,UK news,"Millionaire made list of items to help murder private escort, trial hears","A multi-millionaire property developer obsessed with the woman he paid to be his exclusive escort made a list of items to use when he murdered her, a court has heard. Peter Morgan, 54, is accused of strangling Georgina Symonds, 25, after overhearing her say in a phone conversation that she planned to “fleece him”, leave him and return to working as an escort for other men. Morgan, from Llanellen, near Abergavenny, lavished Symonds, who had a five-year-old daughter, with expensive gifts and paid her up to £10,000 a month to be his personal escort. Newport crown court was told Morgan overheard Symonds’ phonecall with another man via a listening device disguised as a plug adapter that he had planted in her home. The call took place at 10.25pm on 10 January. The prosecutor William Hughes QC told the jury Morgan created a note on his phone at 3.20am the following day, reading: “Sim, gloves, snip, handle, tape, adapter.” Hughes said: “It is a list we say that Mr Morgan was preparing in his planning of the murder of Georgina.” That day Morgan, who has two children, bought a sim card, which he later told police was to call a taxi after he had hidden Symonds’ body, Hughes said. Morgan arrived at the rural bungalow he owned, and where Symonds lived rent-free, in Llanmartin, Newport, on the morning of 12 January. He brought with him tape, twine, a metal pole and plastic sheeting. After strangling Symonds with the twine, he wrapped her body, bound it with rope and tape, and loaded it into the boot of his Porsche Cayenne, the court heard. CCTV footage shows Morgan arriving at an outbuilding just metres from the home of his estranged wife, Helen, at Beech Hill Farm in Usk, Gwent, at 12pm. “Mr Morgan drives off. He then goes about his normal business. He goes to work in his office. He then pops in to the Lloyds Bank in Abergavenny,” Hughes said. Symonds was reported missing to police after she failed to collect her five-year-old daughter from school that afternoon. Officers discovered her white Samsung phone under the driver’s seat of Morgan’s Porsche 911, parked near Helen Morgan’s home. Morgan allegedly told officers at 4.45am on 13 January: “I strangled her this morning. I love her so much.” Police discovered Symonds’ body in the outbuilding at 6am and a postmortem examination found she died from strangulation. Hughes said Morgan planted the listening device, which was fitted with a sim card and recorded her phonecalls, in the bungalow in November 2015 and called it 514 times between then and her death. He is alleged to have listened to the device – stored in his mobile phone as a contact called “Isobel” – for up to two hours at a time.Hughes said: “During the course of his interview under caution, Peter Morgan said he overheard Georgina talking to an unknown person. He heard Georgina say that once he had signed the bungalow over, she was going to leave him, go to London to work as an escort and continue to fleece him. “This enraged him and, as a result, he began to plan and think about ‘ending this problem’”. Morgan was initially just one of Symonds’ clients but their three-year relationship went from being professional to “something more”, Hughes said. He treated her to spa days, helicopter flights, hotel stays and liposuction. The prosecutor described Morgan as “a very successful and wealthy businessman with a large property portfolio” who was “a millionaire many times over”. In police interviews, Morgan told police he loved Symonds and “gave up everything for her” but she blamed him following the suicide of her ex-boyfriend in November 2015. “He said he wanted her to stop blaming him. He said, ‘I just done it’, and then stated, ‘When I’d done it I felt no remorse,’” Hughes said. Morgan told officers he had been married for 22 years but was giving half his companies to his wife in order to be with Symonds, describing himself as Symonds’ “sugar daddy”, Hughes said. The trial continues."
2016-11-29T17:39:51Z,uk-news,UK news,London Underground station staff vote to strike in row over safety,"Further London Underground strikes are looming in a dispute over jobs and safety following a programme of ticket office closures. The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA), which represents 540 station staff, said 67% of the votes cast in a ballot were in favour of a strike, and 90% backed industrial action short of a strike. The union said workers had experienced “unprecedented” levels of verbal and physical abuse from passengers since tube ticket offices closed. A change of regime at City Hall was expected to soothe industrial relations, with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, having quickly invited transport union leaders for talks after succeeding Boris Johnson, who refused to meet them. But staff dissatisfaction at what Transport for London chiefs refer to as the modernisation of the tube does not appear to have abated, despite Khan promising an independent review. The union said it conducted a survey in September assessing the impact of the changes and discovered that 80% of staff reported a sharp increase in verbal and physical abuse from passengers. About 800 jobs were axed in TfL’s fit for the future programme, which came into effect from April. The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said the vote should concern “everyone in Britain who comes to London or has relatives in our capital city”, as it was a dispute about safety, not wages. “Our customer service assistants are overwhelmingly trying to warn the public that the tube they use is not safe. We no longer have enough staff,” he said. “Our members will as a last resort go on strike to safeguard passengers. They are prepared to forgo wages and risk media and management wrath to let the public know that our capital’s tube is no longer safe enough. “This strike vote must not be dismissed as mindless militant action. Instead, it’s an act of desperation by mindful and public-spirited customer service assistants at their absolute best by putting passenger safety before anything else.” The TSSA has not yet announced what action it will take. In a separate dispute with London Underground, the RMT union has called 24-hour strikes by drivers on the Piccadilly and Hammersmith and City lines next week, citing a breakdown in industrial relations."
2016-11-29T18:36:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Eritrean child asylum seekers abandon French centre in bid to reach UK,"Forty-four child asylum seekers from the demolished refugee camp in Calais have run away from a reception centre in Le Havre over poor conditions, saying they are returning to Calais to try to make their own way to the UK. The children were among more than a thousand placed into centres around France to be looked after by the authorites after the camp was demolished. The children left the centre on Tuesday morning after waiting weeks for the Home Office to process their cases and decide whether they were entitled to come to the UK. One of the children, 16, told the Guardian: “We have very bad conditions in the centre. They don’t give us enough food or clothes. The manager came to speak to us with a Tigrinya interpreter earlier today. She was saying that only 10 children would be going to England and the rest would not be going.
“She said that if we didn’t like living at the centre we could leave. So that’s what we decided to do. There are some children here who are 12 or 13, others like me who are 16. All the children in the centre are Eritrean. The manager didn’t want to listen to our concerns.” “We went to the station and hoped that we could get a train to Calais even though we don’t have any money to buy a ticket. But the station staff wouldn’t let us get on a train.” After four hours at the station the children decided to return to the centre. One said: “We were too cold and hungry to continue. When we returned the staff said to us: ‘Welcome back.’” Three of the boys are represented by Duncan Lewis solicitors and one of them texted his legal representative on Tuesday saying: “By now we are coming back to Calais.” One of the boys’ caseworkers, Rebecca Carr, spoke to a member of the centre staff in Le Havre about the mass exodus of children and asked them what they were going to do about it. The staff said they could not prevent the children from leaving if they wanted to. Carr said the member of staff had told her that they were trying to do their best but that it was difficult because the centre did not exist three weeks ago, and it had been difficult to source all the furniture and food for the children. The centre is only given €5 per child per day, she said. The 16-year-old boy who spoke to the Guardian said that all the children were feeling very bad in the centre and losing hope, especially after they were told that only 10 would be allowed to go to the UK. “Two of the children, one who is 12 and one is 13, already ran away and managed to get to Holland. We all want to go to the UK but we don’t know what will happen to us. I was interviewed by the Home Office last week and was told I would have to wait for a month before I could get papers to come to the UK to join my uncle who lives there,” he said. Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis, had urged the children to return to the centre.
“They are all very fed up and they have had enough but if they leave they will be at risk of exploitation and serious harm. If they do make it to Calais there are no longer any services there to support them. We are representing 37 children who have been placed in different centres across France but this is the first time we have heard of a mass departure like this being staged. The Home Office seem to be dragging their feet. They say they are processing applications but they aren’t doing it quickly enough.” A spokesman for the French embassy confirmed that the 44 children had left the centre earlier on Tuesday to try to get to Calais. “We checked with local officials who confirmed that conditions in the centre are good. Of course we could not force the children to return to the centre but we encouraged them to return, and they did so,” the spokesman said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are continuing to work closely with the French government and other partners to identify unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who may be eligible to come to the UK. “Our priority is transferring these children as soon as possible and ensuring their safe arrival. When transferred to the UK they are reunited with family members or put into the care of local authorities. “We have made significant progress in improving and speeding up the existing processes since the beginning of the year, but the primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French authorities.”"
2016-11-29T18:55:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"More young men being blackmailed over videos of sex acts, says NCA","Young men and boys as young as 11 are being increasingly targeted by “sextortion” cybercrime rackets, the National Crime Agency has said. Four men have killed themselves in the past 12 months after being convinced to perform sexual acts on webcams by criminals using false identities, and then blackmailed. The number of people reporting webcam blackmails has more than doubled from 385 in 2015 to 864 so far this year, and it is believed that the crime may be severely under-reported. There were nine reports of the offence in 2011. The NCA and National Police Chiefs’ Council have launched a campaign to tackle the “really worrying emerging threat”, said the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt, the lead for kidnap and extortion, and adult sexual offences. “The really key point is that as a result of this criminality, we have had four young men in the United Kingdom who have killed themselves because they saw no way out of a situation that they had got into,” he said. He added that police forces were being provided with more information to raise awareness of the crime and help them deal with victims.
Men between the ages of 21 and 30 are most likely to be targeted, but a “substantial proportion” are aged 11 to 20 and there have been victims as old as 82. “Perhaps more important is a public awareness campaign to make not only potential victims, but all those around them – friends of potential victims, family members of potential victims – really aware of what is a very damaging and invidious crime,” Hewitt said. The NCA has identified criminal gangs working from Morocco, Philippines and Ivory Coast, who target potential victims on websites such as Facebook, Skype or Linkedin, then persuade them to perform sexual acts that are recorded. The criminals then threaten to share the footage with family and friends unless the victim pays a bribe. In one case, the victim was told: “Your life is over, you may as well go and kill yourself.” The NCA’s advice to any potential victims is: “Do not panic, do not pay, do not communicate and preserve evidence.” A 17-year-old boy from Northern Ireland killed himself last year after what his family described as a “relentless” campaign of online bullying by a gang. Ronan Hughes, from County Tyrone, was tricked into posting intimate photos online after receiving pictures of a girl. He was then blackmailed for £3,000 by the gang, who threatened to upload the images to his friends’ Facebook pages. “This is being organised by well-equipped, often offshore organised crime groups that are facilitating this activity,” Hewitt said. Last year, more than 40 arrests were made in Philippines and there is a continuing international prosecution connected to one of the deaths reported this year. Roy Sinclair of the NCA said: “There is huge under-reporting of these kinds of offences, often because victims feel ashamed or embarrassed, but of course criminals are relying on that reaction in order to succeed.” One male victim in his late teens said he had considered killing himself after being lured into exposing himself and showing his face on Skype. “I offered to go to the bank, but went to the police station instead. I was trembling throughout the whole thing, shaking and thinking, ‘What’s going to happen? This will ruin my life’, and did not know what to do,” he said. “Since then, I’ve tried to put it to the back of my mind and I’ve moved on with my life. There is always life afterwards. But I would not be here today if I had not spoken to anyone.” Another victim in his 60s said the scam had ruined his life. “Even now I have trouble going on the internet, and I can’t use Facebook any more. I wake up every morning and what is always in my head is that I don’t know if that video still exists or not,” he said."
2016-11-29T21:09:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Man wielding axe in Hull dies after being shot by police,"A 31-year-old man who was shot and injured by police in Hull after wielding an axe has died, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said on Tuesday night. The IPCC confirmed the man, who has not been named, died in hospital after he was shot by officers from Humberside police near Hull city centre on Tuesday morning. IPCC associate commissioner Tom Milsom said: “Our thoughts are with the man’s friends and family, and all those affected at this very difficult time.” Police attended the scene near the post office on Holderness Road, Hull, shortly after 9.20am “following reports of concerns for the safety of the public”. According to a police statement, the man was injured at 9.37am after shots were fired by officers. He was taken to hospital and was receiving medical attention. The Hull Daily Mail reported that there was a huge police presence in the area and said a number of roads had been closed. “Everywhere you go there’s a copper. It must be quite serious. It can’t be an accident because they wouldn’t shut this many roads,” one resident said. A witness, called Rachel, said she had heard two loud bangs and screaming. “We looked outside and there was a guy with his back against the kerb lying on the floor,” she told the paper. “There was blood everywhere. His jeans were slightly down and you could see his boxer shorts were covered in blood. It’s sad. At the end of the day whatever he’s done he’s got a mum somewhere, hasn’t he?” One woman tweeted:
A spokesman for Humberside police said earlier: “An investigation is under way and the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is standard practice in such incidents. “We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident at this time. As such, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage.” Ch Supt Scott Young told reporters near the scene of the shooting that police were not looking for anybody else in relation to the attack. “We also have no reason to believe that any terrorist incident has occurred,” he said. “We appreciate that people will be worried when they hear of this incident and as a result of that we’ve got community officers in the area, today and in the coming days, in order to speak to our communities an make sure they are kept informed.“I’d like to remind the public that these are extremely rare incidents.”"
2016-11-30T08:24:32Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ministers want controls on skilled and unskilled EU workers, say sources","The British government wants to implement an immigration regime under which controls would be applied to both skilled and unskilled European workers, the Guardian understands. Ministers have told colleagues they want a tough system that is profoundly different to the one that currently exists, with restrictions at all levels. But sources have suggested that they and officials are now looking at a regime in which European citizens would be treated preferentially to migrants coming to the UK from the rest of the world. Theresa May wants free movement to be a red line in Brexit negotiations and has been reported to support the idea of EU citizens being able to travel freely for holidays, to study or to marry, but with a robust visa scheme for those wanting to work. The Guardian understands that there have also been discussions about a second, more liberal immigration system under which free movement would stay but with an “emergency brake” if immigration levels became unacceptably high. The system, which would have a registration system for EU nationals, goes beyond what David Cameron proposed in his renegotiation but is in line with concepts that have been used by other countries with access to the single market. However, May has told cabinet colleagues that while the emergency brake scheme should be kept on the table, it is not her preferred option as it does not provide an adequate shift from what already exists. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has also said privately that she does not want an emergency brake implemented. Ministers also favour controls in place at all skill levels despite calls from some politicians and business figures to allow free movement of more qualified workers. The question of what Britain’s immigration looks like is at the heart of an ongoing battle between MPs and business leaders who campaigned for Brexit, not least because its toughness could dictate the level of economic access granted to Britain. The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, became the most recent European leader to argue that curbing immigration would mean the UK would have to leave the single market. The campaign group Open Britain has advocated an emergency brake because it is a concept that has been used for non-EU countries that are still part of the European Economic Area and so have access to the single market. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, responded to the latest suggestion by saying that the government was heading towards a hard Brexit if it was unwilling to maintain an open system. “Cracking down on skilled workers will hurt our economy. What makes Britain best is when we are open, tolerant and looking towards the world,” he said. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will warn on Wednesday that he will push for a special deal for the capital if the government fails to ensure it has adequate access to skilled workers. “London’s businesses must retain access to the skilled workforce they need in order to grow – it’s absolutely essential to protecting jobs, growth and tax revenues across Britain over the next decade,” Khan will say in a speech to the Institute of Directors. “I will keep pushing the government to recognise this vital need in their negotiating position – but it doesn’t look like they are listening.” He will say that if that continues he will look for a “London-specific solution” with the City of London corporation suggesting a visa system that varies by region. But Brexit-supporting MPs said it was right to put in place restrictions, even for skilled workers. Peter Lilley, a Tory MP on parliament’s Brexit committee, argued that access to cheap skilled labour had allowed British employers to “put training on the backburner”. He argued that the result was that countries such as Germany, Switzerland and Sweden had four times the proportion of technically and vocationally skilled workers, which he said was a disaster in Britain’s education system. He also said it was important to cut back on migration levels because of shortages of housing. However, he was not supportive of any better treatment for European citizens over those in other parts of the world. “Our current system is racist and would continue to be racist if we had a system with preference for EU.” If the plans are agreed they could cause concern among other Brexit supporters who told British people with Commonwealth heritage that they were being unfairly discriminated against in the immigration system during the referendum campaign. The issue persuaded Bangladesh restaurant owners to come out in favour of Brexit.” John Springford, the director of research at the Centre for European Reform, argued that it seemed likely that May would consider a preferential system for Europeans because if not they would face getting no more than a “basic free trade deal” from the EU27. He also argued that restrictions on skilled workers were also likely if the prime minister wanted to achieve her goal to heavily reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. “We have one of the most highly skilled immigrant populations in the developed world, with the highest numbers of people with degrees, so if you are serious about trying to get down to below 100,000 you will have to reduce the number of skilled migrants that come from the EU,” he said. “If you want to reduce the numbers you’ll need a significantly different regime.”"
2016-11-30T09:38:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"National Lottery: 26,500 players' online accounts accessed","About 26,500 National Lottery players are facing compulsory password resets on their online accounts after they were apparently accessed by cybercriminals. Camelot, the firm that operates the game, said it had become aware of “suspicious activity on a very small proportion” of accounts, and it was now taking steps to understand what had happened. Logins may have been stolen from other websites where players use the same details, it said. Cybercriminals had not been able to access “core National Lottery systems”, Camelot added. “We do not hold full debit card or bank account details in National Lottery players’ online accounts and no money has been taken or deposited,” the company said in a statement. “However, we do believe that this attack may have resulted in some of the personal information that the affected players hold in their online account being accessed.”
The National Lottery has about 9.5 million customers registered to play online. Of the compromised accounts, fewer than 50 had been suspended since the attack on Camelot’s servers, after some personal details were changed, the company said, although “some of these details may have been changed by the players themselves”. “We’d like to reassure our customers that protecting their personal data is of the utmost importance to us,” Camelot’s statement added. “We are very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause to our players and would like to encourage those with any concerns to contact us directly, so we can discuss it with them in more detail.” The kind of confidential personal information accessed could be used to build false customer profiles or commit fraud later on, said one cybersecurity expert. Chris Hodson, from information security firm Zscaler, added: “With no technical details included in the National Lottery’s statement about how the data was exfiltrated, just that it was, we can only speculate as to the tactics of these hackers. “The act of stealing personal information from these accounts but leaving financial credentials untouched, also highlights that the motives of the criminals was not immediate financial fraud but highly sought personal identifiable information.” A spokesman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said Camelot had submitted a breach report on Tuesday night. “The Data Protection Act requires organisations to do all they can to keep personal data secure – that includes protecting it from cyber-attacks,” he said. “Where we find this has not happened, we can take action. Organisations should be reminded that cybersecurity is a matter for the boardroom, not just the IT department.” Camelot said it was working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre, a new division of GCHQ, to investigate the incident. An NCA spokesman said: “We can confirm that we are investigating an incident linked to Camelot. As our inquiries are ongoing, we cannot comment further at this time.” The National Lottery hack is just the latest online security breach to hit British consumers this year. Earlier this month, Tesco Bank fell victim to a cyber-attack which resulted in it paying out an estimated £2.5m to 9,000 customers. Eight million UK-based Yahoo users were affected when the internet firm’s defences were breached in September, leading to sharp criticism when it emerged that crucial account details were not encrypted. And in April more than 15,000 expectant parents had their data – including email addresses, usernames and passwords – compromised after a hack on the National Childbirth Trust. Nick Gibbons, partner at insurance and risk law firm BLM, said that Camelot’s statement seemed to fail to acknowledge the significance of the invasion of its customers’ privacy, and the risk posed by the potential disclosure of their personal information. “While perhaps less important and embarrassing than that seen in the Ashley Madison case, some people will not want the fact that they bet on the national lottery to be made public,” he said."
2016-11-30T12:08:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police will need licence to practise for child sex abuse cases, says Rudd","Police officers investigating child sex abuse are to be required to be specially trained and accredited in the same way as specialist firearms officers under proposals announced by the home secretary. Amber Rudd said she wanted to see only registered officers who could demonstrate specialist skills used to investigate complex “high harm” crimes involving the most vulnerable people, such as child sex abuse. In a speech to the College of Policing, the home secretary said the new police licence to practise would mean officers and staff were not forced to take on roles they were not prepared for or professionally trained to do. “For too long crimes against vulnerable people have simply not been taken seriously enough and their voices have not necessarily been heard. They have been treated as second-class crimes and not always been given the attention they deserve,” said Rudd.
“Police professionals investigating complex cases against the vulnerable should hold a licence to practise so the public can have confidence that an officer has the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out such important work.” Rudd said the proposed licence to practise, which has been put forward by the College of Policing, would put beyond doubt that the skills required to protect the vulnerable were every bit as valued and critical as those required by a firearms officer or any other specially trained officer. The announcement follows last week’s scathing report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary on the record of the Metropolitan police on child protection, which showed that mistakes had been made in 75% of child sexual abuse cases. The home secretary announced that an initial £1.9m would be made available to the College of Policing to develop training for frontline police officers to identify signs of vulnerability and provide better protection for victims. It will also pilot intensive courses for supervisors to give police officers a better chance of preventing further abuse and gathering evidence for investigations. Chief Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said the funding would support officers and staff to do their job while the new guidance would focus on their own welfare. “Vulnerability is a priority for everyone in policing and it is important that we protect the most vulnerable in society and the officers and staff carrying out this essential work,” he said. “To deliver the best service to the public we want our members who are overseeing cases involving vulnerability to benefit from an accredited qualification and undergo continuing professional development to keep their skills up to date and link learning directly to practice.” The new guidance will set out how forces should manage the psychological stress of those working in high-risk areas such as firearms, undercover operations, counter-terrorism and child sexual exploitation. Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the proposed licence was welcome but was not a strategy to tackle child sexual abuse. “This offering from the Home Secretary is a wholly inadequate response to the magnitude of the crisis in society and the tasks facing the police. “The Tories have cut police numbers. Their inquiry into child sexual abuse is failing and scandals continue to multiply. This is a piecemeal offering to the victims of child sexual abuse. They and we all deserve more from this government,” she said."
2016-11-30T13:51:37Z,uk-news,UK news,'Rogue' Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson wedding photos sold at auction,"There were few guests and little fanfare for the wedding that caused a constitutional crisis and rocked the British monarchy. But previously unseen photographs of the private nuptials of the former Edward VIII and his American divorcee bride, Wallis Simpson, have fetched £11,408 – double their estimate – after going under the hammer. The 17 black and white images were taken at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the remote Chateau de Cande, near Tours, France on 3 June 1937. The unofficial photographer was Lady Alexandra Metcalfe, wife of the best man, “Fruity” Metcalfe, who took them on a “rogue camera” and later presented sets to those who attended the low-key ceremony.
The pictures, which had been expected to fetch between £4,000 and £6000, were sold to an absentee bidder who left a highest price with the auctioneer. Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 – 80 years ago next month – to be with Simpson, passing the throne to his brother, then the Duke of York, who would become George VI. The photographs include images of the bride and groom, their wedding guests, the wedding breakfast table, the ceremony room with chairs placed ready, the floral arrangements by Constance Spry and a seven-tier cake. Denise Kelly, of Bellmans Auctioneers in Sussex, where the photographs sold, said they were “of the greatest rarity – not least because of the use of a rogue camera at such an event; until quite recently, guests at most social events would have been happy with the pictures provided by an official photographer. “It is unusual to receive consignments of any such private royal photographs, but having 17 of them in one lot, which represent the king who gave away his empire for the woman he loved, is extraordinary.”"
2016-11-30T14:16:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Sheffield council urged to drop plans to fell war memorial trees,"Campaigners are demanding that Sheffield council re-examine plans to cut down trees planted to honour soldiers killed in the first world war, in the latest development of the long-running battle over the local authority’s tree-felling programme. The 23 trees on Western Road in the Crookes area of the city were planted in memory of a group of young soldiers who attended nearby Westways primary school and were killed in the war. Ninety-six trees were planted on the road in 1919, of which 60 remain, and the site is still a registered war memorial. The trees were “planted in grateful appreciation of the part taken by former pupils of this school in the Great War 1914–1919”, says a plaque near the school. The council has recommended that 23 of the trees be chopped down as part of its ongoing Streets Ahead project, which campaigners say has already resulted in 4,000 trees being felled across the city. The council claims that many of the city’s trees are diseased and that their roots have ruined pavements and roads. The 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal signed in 2012 with private contractor Amey promises to “see Sheffield’s roads transformed from some of the worst in the country to the best in the country”. Spokespeople for the Sheffield Trees Action Group have described the plans as outrageous. “You don’t desecrate war memorials,” retired academic Alan Story, who is a spokesman for Western Road Remembers told the Sheffield Star, which has mounted a campaign to save the trees. Karen Houtby lives on Rustlings Road, where three residents were arrested in the early hours of 17 November for attempting to stop tree surgeons contracted by Amey from chopping down trees on the street. Her seven-year-old son also attends Westways school. “There’s a lot of anger and sadness about it all,” she said. “I think there’s a a feeling that hopefully the council this time can’t ignore the fact that there is so much significance attached to those trees. Surely they’re going to have to listen now.” The trees on Western Road have been adorned with poppies and yellow ribbons by residents, parents and pupils at the school. “The thing that has upset me more than anything is that people are not being listened to,” said Houtby. “It’s quite clear the residents don’t want this.” A Sheffield city council spokesman said: “We are in the early stages of working with residents on Western Road to confirm which trees need to be replaced. No decisions have been made. There are 54 trees and our initial recommendations are that 23 need to be replaced. “Every household has now been sent a survey asking their views on these proposals. If more than 50% of respondents disagree with the plans, we will refer the street to the independent tree panel for further investigation. We will work closely with residents and the War Memorials Trust to ensure any trees that are removed are replaced appropriately and sensitively.” On Thursday two men will become the first of the city’s tree protesters to appear in court. So far five people have been arrested under section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which criminalises anyone who persistently stops someone from carrying out lawful work."
2016-11-30T18:38:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Cold weather in England and Wales set to continue,"England and Wales will continue to experience some of the coldest temperatures of the last 12 months over the next few days , as the meteorological winter starts on Thursday.
Parts of the UK experienced the coldest night of the season on Tuesday, with temperatures of -9.4C (15F) recorded in the village of Sennybridge, Powys, and -8.5C in Benson, Oxfordshire. “We’ve seen the coldest November temperature since 2010 and the coldest temperature of the year including last winter,” said Martin Bowles, an operational meteorologist at the Met office. “That is partly because we have had such mild autumns for some time and this year is looking to be colder.” Though temperatures will rise slightly, the cold, dry snap is expected to continue into the weekend and into next week. Thursday and Friday are forecast to be warmer due to increased cloud cover, but Saturday and Sunday will be clear and bright with frost overnight. Wednesday was forecast to see another cold and frosty night, with clear skies across south Wales and southern England and possible fog patches by morning. The north and east are expected to see cloudier and milder conditions, with patchy light rain in northern Scotland. “Usually we expect at this time of year for it to be much colder in Scotland, but in fact over the next few days it will tend to be less cold in the north and in Scotland and colder in the south,” said Bowles. Thursday will see the official start of winter in meteorological terms. While the astronomical definition of winter begins on the equinox and solstice, which fall on the 21 or 22 December, it is important to have set dates when comparing climate data. The fixed date of 1 December is therefore used to mark the start of the meteorological winter, which ends on 28 February. The colder conditions come as the Local Government Association’s (LGA) annual winter readiness survey shows councils are well prepared for plummeting temperatures with a substantial stock of grit. About half are at the limit of storage capacity, and the LGA said gritters would be out treating thousands of miles of roads whenever overnight temperatures dropped below zero. LGA’s transport spokesman, Martin Tett, said: “We are well prepared for the cold, with 1.2m tonnes of salt stockpiled and a fleet of state-of-the-art gritters ready to be deployed.” The coldest temperature ever recorded during a UK winter was -27.2 °C, which was twice recorded in the village of Braemar in the Scottish Highlands, first on 11 February 1895 and again on 10 January 1982."
2016-11-30T21:01:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Huge backlog as EU citizens rush to secure British residency,"EU citizens worried about their right to remain in Britain have inundated the Home Office with applications to secure their UK residency, leading to an official backlog that has trebled since the summer of 2015. The figures emerged on a day that Labour demanded Theresa May guaranteed the rights of the more than 3 million EU citizens to remain in the UK before Brexit negotiations begin, with MP Keir Starmer saying there was “a mounting sense of very real injustice” over the issue. The number of outstanding applications from European citizens to secure their residency status in Britain went from 37,618 in June 2015 to almost 100,000 “currently in progress” in early July 2016, including those seeking permanent residence cards and documents for non-EU family members of European citizens. Home Office figures to be published on Thursday alongside official immigration data for the three months to September are expected to confirm the surge in applications has continued since the EU referendum on 23 June. Starmer called for urgent unilateral action by the prime minister to secure the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and warned her to abandon her position of refusing to act without securing equivalent guarantees for the 1.2 million UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. “It’s becoming increasingly apparent to me from my discussions in Brussels with those that are likely to be involved in the negotiations that they are very concerned about the fact that we are not giving comfort and status to their citizens,” the shadow Brexit secretary told the Guardian. “They have said to me, pretty well in terms, the UK should sort this out before March and that would ensure that the article 50 negotiations got off to a much better start than they will otherwise do so.”
At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, May defended her approach in a question from the Conservative MP Peter Lilley, saying: “I think the reaction that we have seen shows it was absolutely right for us not to do what the Labour party wanted us to do, which was simply to give away the guarantee for rights of EU citizens here in the UK. As we have seen, that would have left UK citizens in Europe high and dry.” Relations between the UK and the rest of the EU have become increasingly heated. On Tuesday, the European council president, Donald Tusk, published a strongly worded letter to a group of Tory MPs in which he said the issue would have to wait for formal Brexit negotiations to begin and appeared to blame the British electorate for causing the uncertainty in the first place. In his letter, he added: “The only way to dispel the fears and doubts of all citizens concerned is the quickest possible start of the negotiations based on article 50 of the treaty.”
Starmer described Tusk’s letter as unhelpful, but said it pointed to the need to act unilaterally now and was further evidence of the “unhelpful atmosphere” created in the lead-up to the negotiations. Starmer suggested the government could “pass a domestic law, dealing with the status of these individuals, and it would get cross-party support, and could be passed very swiftly”. He added: “At the very least there ought to be clarity for those who were already here on 23 June.” Quarterly net migration data are expected to show that annual figure remains more than three times above May’s target of 100,000. The Home Office is expected to deflect some of the political embarrassment by announcing the rollout of two further measures from Thursday designed to create a “hostile environment” that it will say will discourage illegal immigration. They are tougher penalties, including prison sentences, for landlords who rent to tenants without proper immigration papers and the start of a “deport first, appeal later” policy for those challenging some immigration decisions. Saira Grant, the chief executive of the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants, said the social fallout from the Brexit vote had led to the government urgently positioning itself as a champion of integration. But she said ministers’ fixation on the net migration target was leading to toxic immigration policies that were causing critical harm to community relations and to cohesion in Britain. “It’s not good enough for the government to talk about the tensions caused by immigration and a lack of integration, when their own polices are designed to create suspicion within communities, to encourage profiling of those who appear to be immigrants, and to reduce immigrants’ security within the UK,” she said. “Integration comes when immigrants and the communities they live in can trust each other and understand that they will be treated fairly within the immigration system. Openly using EU migrants as bargaining chips, asking landlords, doctors, schools, and local authorities to act as border guards, is setting back integration and community cohesion across the UK.” Grant’s warning came as Madelene Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford University, told the House of Lords EU home affairs subcommittee that the number of citizens of other EU countries in Britain could be as high as 3.9 million and the task of registering them after Brexit would be a “formidable logistical, bureaucratic, administrative and legal task”. Sumption said a work permit system would be the most practical option for controlling EU migration post-Brexit as it would take account of the various needs of the economy. An “emergency brake” approach, reported to be under consideration in Downing Street, would, however, simply limit numbers without taking individual skills into account, she said. Thecampaign group Migration Watch UK urged the government on Wednesday to close the door on unskilled labour migration from the EU by extending the current non-EU work permit system to EU migrants. Consideration might be given to a “key workers scheme” for lower skilled workers, including seasonal agricultural workers, deemed essential to particular sectors of the economy. But Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research told peers that ending the free movement of low-skilled workers from the EU could see businesses close, food prices rise and cuts to social care. Portes, a former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said the consequences for the agricultural industry were particularly grave: “They may range from simply shutting down, going out of business, in which case consumers would either buy different products or products from abroad … Another possible response is higher wages which would probably be passed onto consumers.” He said the government needed to consider urgently how it was going to register all the EU citizens in Britain, adding that it was unrealistic simply and undesirable to include everyone who was in the UK on the day of the referendum. “There is no definition of residence, or proof of residence, for people who have been here. What about the Polish shopkeeper who went home on 23 June? We do not know who was in the country.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Government has been clear that, as we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe. It would not be right for us to give a running commentary on negotiations.” Asked when the issue of expatriates could be expected to be settled, May’s official spokeswoman said: “This is an issue that we are very clear matters to Europeans here in the UK and Brits in Europe. “Therefore, in the spirit of working constructively together and having that kind of mature relationship with our European partners, it’s an issue that should be settled early on. “It’s a two-year process once we trigger (Article 50) so these are going to be lengthy negotiations.”"
2016-12-01T09:25:52Z,uk-news,UK news,May wanted to 'deprioritise' school places for children of people illegally in UK,"Theresa May wanted children of parents unlawfully in the UK to be dropped to the bottom of lists for school places, according to reports of leaked Cabinet Office letters. As home secretary, May’s department suggested to the Department for Education that schools could withdraw children’s places if their families did not have the right to remain in the UK, according to documents leaked to the BBC. Current laws mean all under-16s have the right to a school place, even if their parents entered the country illegally. Nicky Morgan, education secretary at the time, is understood to have blocked the move, writing to the then prime minister David Cameron with “profound concerns”. “I have concerns about the practical and presentational issues of applying our strong position on illegal migrants to the emotive issue of children’s education,” the leaked letter read.
“These cover deprioritising illegal migrants in the schools admissions process, and carrying out immigration checks through schools.” Morgan is reported to have had concerns that the process would delay schools from being able to confirm places for British and legal migrants’ children in good time before the start of the school year and would be “jeopardising our increasingly important focus on tackling both segregation and extremism, and with consequent impacts on the children of British nationals who attend the schools”. A government spokesman said he would not comment on leaked documents. He said: “It is only right that any government looks at a range of options when considering policy options, but ultimately it is for ministers to decide which policies are taken forward. “We are building a system that works in the best interests of the British people and ensures that only those with a right to be in the UK can live and work here.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said she was “deeply concerned” about the policy proposal. “It’s a terrible idea. Denying innocent children the right to an education because of the circumstances of their parents is disgusting,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday. “It’s not a British value that we have. It just shows that, rather than deal with the problems in her own department, Theresa May was trying to offload the failings of her department on to innocent children, trying to bring our teachers into border control. We know immigration is in a mess and it is under Theresa May’s watch.” Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of the schools watchdog Ofsted, said he believed that schools should not be used as a border control by the Home Office. Speaking on the Today programme, he said: “I’m amazed and shocked by it. Schools should not be used for border control.”"
2016-12-01T12:05:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Armed forces: pledge to raise payouts for injury or death in combat,"Members of the armed forces or their families are to receive more generous compensation if they are injured or killed in combat, Michael Fallon has promised. The defence secretary announced the move in an effort to avoid lengthy court actions. Cases brought in recent years have included claims of negligence by the Ministry of Defence in failing to provide proper equipment or came as a result of friendly fire incidents. The MoD has launched a consultation on the proposals, which will require legislation. The consultation is a first step and will look at how the scheme would work as well as trying to find agreement on a definition of combat. Senior military staff want the legislation to provide a clearer definition of the term and give immunity from claims of negligence. They resent judges “second-guessing” military decisions often made at speed in stressful situations and claim the legal actions are negatively affecting operational effectiveness. They have also complained about the “judicialisation of war”. The MoD was culpable in both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts in failing to provide appropriate equipment for troops on the ground. Fallon said court cases were often costly as well as time-consuming. The compensation would be roughly equal to the kind of payments awarded by the courts, he said. The defence secretary said: “Our armed forces put their lives on the line to keep us safe. This new scheme will mean more generous payments to anyone injured – or the families of those who are killed – in combat. By making these changes we will put more money into compensation and remove the stress of lengthy legal action.” As part of these reforms, the MoD will clarify in that the common law principle of combat immunity should apply to deaths or injuries which occur in the course of combat situations. The chief of the defence staff, Sir Stuart Peach, said: “Clarifying combat immunity and offering better compensation will remove the need for legal action and the courts will no longer have to second-guess military decisions. This will allow our armed forces to do their job knowing they, or their families, won’t have to go to court for compensation in the case of injury or death in combat.” He called on military personnel to contribute to the consultation. Lawyers reacted warily to the announcement, welcoming the prospect of improved payments as a result of death or injury from combat but sceptical about how generous it will turn out to be. Sue Bowler, a partner at Coffin Mew Solicitors, said: “What is not yet clear is whether the new proposals will truly match what can be achieved in the civil courts. Quantifying claims for those who are severely injured is a complex and skilled process. It usually involves expert evidence from a range of professionals to set out the medical prognosis for the future, life expectancy and an individual’s needs. “The detail of how it is proposed that this is achieved without legal representation for injured personnel needs to be carefully scrutinised.”"
2016-12-01T13:03:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"Boy, 15, charged with killing of Polish man in Harlow","A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the manslaughter of a Polish man killed in Harlow in August. Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, died after a late-night clash with a group of youths in the Essex town. The Crown Prosecution Service announced the charging decision and said five other youths arrested over the incident would face no criminal charges. Essex police said Jóźwik, 40, was attacked at about 11.35pm on Saturday 27 August. He was taken to the Princess Alexandra hospital, and was later transferred to Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, where he died two days later. The senior investigating officer DI Danny Stoten, of the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has now authorised Essex police to charge a teenager with manslaughter in connection with the death of Mr Jóźwik. He is due to appear at Chelmsford youth court on 6 January 2017.” It is understood that the CPS has decided it will not prosecute the case as a hate crime. There were concerns at the time of the death that the incident may have been a hate crime because it occurred at a time of heightened community tension in the aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union on 23 June. The factory worker, who had been living in England for four years, was knocked unconscious outside a row of takeaway shops. Shortly after the incident his brother, Radek, linked the death with a surge in hatred towards eastern Europeans after the Brexit vote. Such was the concern that Polish police officers were allowed to patrol Harlow alongside British officers. Paul Scothern, crown advocate in the complex casework unit for CPS East of England, said:“Following early investigative advice from the reviewing lawyer, the police decided to take no further action in relation to five other youths who were at the scene. “May I remind all concerned that this youth has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.”"
2016-12-01T13:36:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Demonstrations outside tree-felling court hearing in Sheffield,"Approximately 150 people have staged a protest in support of two men who appeared in court in Sheffield after they tried to stop a 100-year-old tree being cut down. Simon Crump and Calvin Payne are two of five people to have been arrested in the long-running battle over the local authority’s tree-felling programme. Campaigners claim 4,000 trees across the city have been chopped down since a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal with the private contractor Amey was signed in 2012.
The deal to maintain the city’s roads and pavements claims it will “see Sheffield’s roads transformed from some of the worst in the country to the best”. The controversy attracted national media attention this month when two women in their 70s spent eight hours in a police cell after they staged a similar demonstration to prevent trees on their road being chopped down. Scores of people gathered outside Sheffield magistrates court on Thursday morning to protest against the charges against the two men and the cutting down of what they say are healthy trees. The former Green party leader Natalie Bennett addressed the rally saying that people in the city were being “terrorised” by the police and the council. Bennett has been chosen by her party to stand in the Sheffield Central constituency at the next election and she is in the process of moving to the city. It was a target seat for the Greens in May 2015, when the party secured 15.8% of the vote. The Labour MP Paul Blomfield increased his majority there and won 55% of the vote.
Crump and Payne pleaded not guilty to charges under section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which criminalises anyone who persistently stops someone from carrying out lawful work, in this case tree surgeons contracted by Amey to chop down trees on 2 November. A trial date has been set for 9 March and the pair remain on unconditional bail until then. Speaking outside the court, Crump, a lecturer in creative writing at the University of Huddersfield, said he was pleased the case would be heard in court. “My reaction is, bring it on,” he said. Payne, a well-known local campaigner, said the protest outside the court was about more than tree felling. “It’s about the imposition of this contract. It’s the undemocratic nature of it and the fact that the democratic process seems to have shut down while this 25-year contract with the company is in place.” A council spokesperson said they could not comment on police proceedings, but they have previously said the roots of many of the trees earmarked for felling prevent people in wheelchairs and people pushing buggies from using pavements. Bennett said none of the protesters had a problem with the council taking action to deal with diseased or dangerous trees, but said independent experts had declared many of the felled trees to be healthy.
She argued that it was cheaper for Amey to chop down old trees with big roots and plant new ones, than it was for them to maintain mature ones. “Amey is acting to maximise its profits. It’s a private company and that’s what it is supposed to do,” she said. Sheffield city council apologised last week after a team from Amey woke up residents on Rustlings Road at 5am to ask them to move their vehicles so they could fell trees. Freda Brayshaw, a retired French teacher, and Jenny Hockey, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Sheffield, both in their 70s, were arrested along with another man when they tried to protect the trees. The dispute has caused headaches for Labour, with the chair of the Sheffield Central constituency party warning the council’s leader that the controversy threatened the party’s future in the city. On Thursday South Yorkshire’s Labour police and crime commissioner, Alan Billings, hit out at Sheffield council for causing “reputational damage to the force at a time when it cannot afford it”. “There was no plan to involve SYP officers in door knocking, but on the morning there were insufficient council/contractor staff to knock on all doors in a timely fashion,” he wrote in a letter to the MP for Sheffield Hallam, Nick Clegg. Vanessa Leeming, who lives in the Nether Edge area of the city and has several trees earmarked for felling on her road, said she had decided to get involved in the campaign when she heard about the morning raid this month. “People are trying to make us out to be tree-hugging idiots, but it’s got nothing to do with that,” she said. “We want an organised programme so that dangerous, decaying and diseased trees are managed. But they are murdering and felling completely healthy 100-year-old trees that have given Sheffield its green reputation. “Sheffield is an ugly city. It was bombed and annihilated in the war. We’ve got no architectural beauty like other cities, but what we have got is our greenery, our trees and our parks.”"
2016-12-01T14:15:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hate preacher laws may need re-examining, says independent reviewer","Extra legal powers may be needed to prosecute hate preachers who encourage violent radicalisation in private conversations, according to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. In his final report after six years in the influential post, David Anderson QC says the requirement in the 2006 Terrorism Act that such persuasion needs to be “published” or delivered at a meeting should be re-examined. “That change might make it possible to use undercover officers for the purposes of gathering evidence against those who are inspiring terrorists,” he suggests. It may also be necessary to specify more clearly “examples of ways in which support for a proscribed organisation could be invited”, he explains. “Prosecutors with experience of such cases have told me that this could assist juries in matching the alleged conduct to the offence.” Anderson, who stands down in February, was not formally recommending such changes but believed there should be a more detailed inquiry. “I offer them for discussion as a possible partial solution to the problems of prosecuting hate preachers,” he writes, “and in the spirit that our freedoms are better protected by a well-functioning criminal law than they are by a system based on coercive civil orders of broad and uncertain scope.” Anderson says: “It is entirely fair to ask why the law did not catch up with Anjem Choudary [who was convicted of inviting support for Daesh earlier this year] sooner.” He said the Crown Prosecution Service considered Choudary’s activities on 10 occasions between 2002 and 2015. In general conclusions, Anderson observes: “Laws against terrorism need to bear down hard on all kinds of extremists who espouse violence: but it is important also that they do not alienate the rest of the population.” He welcomes the steady decline in the number of so-called port stops, used to question and detain travellers to determine whether they are involved in terrorism. They have fallen from 87,218 in 2009-10 to 28,083 last year. “My overall impression is that though port controls remain a frequently mentioned irritant, the terrorism acts are no longer the focus for grievance that they once were,” Anderson notes. “Indeed they have been overtaken as a source of grievance by aspects of the Prevent strategy to counter extremism.” The terrorism acts, he says, “are a broadly proportionate reaction to the current threat”. He states: “I reject the false narrative of power-hungry security services, police insensitivity to community concerns, and laws constantly being ratcheted up to new levels of oppression.” However, Brexit could damage the UK’s ability to lead European policy and promote European laws in the counter-terrorism field, Anderson says. He adds: “There are strong operational reasons for maintaining access to EU mechanisms that others may devise. Brexit will not alter the fact that as crime [including terrorist crime] crosses borders with increasing ease, the same must be true of the information and resources that are needed by those who fight it.” In the report, written after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by the Nazi sympathiser Thomas Mair, Anderson says: “The organised extreme rightwing threat in the UK is … perceived by the authorities to be fragmented, with no unifying ideology or set of principles. “In a document provided to me by the national counter-terrorism policing operations centre in July 2016, the threat of organised XRW groups was described as … ‘limited to low-level protest and heated online debate’.” There were no deaths or injuries from terrorism in Britain during 2015, the report says, “unless one counts the injuries sustained by Lyle Zimmerman at Leytonstone tube station in London in December”. In Northern Ireland, there were three security-related deaths in the year to 31 March 2016. The report adds: “Outside Northern Ireland, there have been only two deaths in the UK from terrorist incidents since 56 people [including four British suicide bombers] were killed in the 7/7 London attacks of 2005. The continuation of that record is impressive.” The threat remains, however: “Some attackers or would-be attackers leave only a very limited intelligence trace, particularly if their radicalisation has been swift. “Others come to the attention of the authorities but are not given the priority that their subsequent actions show them to have merited, often for understandable reasons. And as was demonstrated recently in Nice, even such an everyday object as a large motor vehicle can exact a horrible toll on the innocent when used by a person heedless of the consequences for his own life.” In his parting comments, Anderson observes: “Human rights do not hamper the fight against terrorism and extremism: they underline its legitimacy.”"
2016-12-01T14:54:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Mzee Mohammed death: plea for witnesses to events before arrest,"Detectives investigating the death of an autistic teenager shortly after he came into contact with police are seeking witnesses of events leading up to the moment officers pinned him down and handcuffed him in Liverpool. Lancashire constabulary have released a gallery of CCTV stills showing the faces of people they believe may be able to describe the circumstances leading up to Mzee Mohammed’s encounter with 18 police officers, eight security guards, a police dog and an ambulance crew. The 18-year-old was pronounced dead an hour and a half after officers were filmed cuffing him face down on the ground in the Liverpool One shopping centre on 13 July. Police said at the time that they were responding to unconfirmed reports of a black male acting in an “aggressive and erratic manner” with a knife. Footage of the incident shows him apparently unconscious.
A postmortem examination was inconclusive and further tests are said to be required to establish a cause of death. An inquest has been opened and adjourned by the Liverpool coroner while detectives investigate Mohammed’s movements before his death. Police said the review would look into the circumstances under which Mohammed left his home in the city; his movements between leaving the address and arrival at the Chips a GoGo kiosk at the shopping centre; and the activity at the kiosk before the arrival of police officers. Detectives will not consider the actions of police officers, including whether they are responsible for killing Mohammed. This aspect of the investigation is being led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. DCI Gary Brooks, of the force’s major investigation team, said: “We know of course that Mr [Mohammed’s] family must be distraught by what has happened and we recognise the tension this incident has caused within the wider community.
“What we are trying to do is find out what happened to Mzee on the afternoon of 13 July and we need the community’s help to be able to do that so that we can try to provide his family with the answers they desperately seek. “I would appeal directly to those people pictured in the CCTV to come forward as they may be able to help us piece together what happened to Mzee. I would also ask anyone who recognises them to contact us.” Protests were held in Liverpool following Mohammed’s death, at which his mother, Karla, disputed the police version of events. Anyone who witnessed anything that could help the investigation, or who knows any of the people in the images, is asked to contact Lancashire police on 101, quoting log number LC-20161111-0339. They can also contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org. Alternatively, call the IPCC on 0800 096 9071. The specific email address for the inquiry is liverpoolone@ipcc.gsi.gov.uk."
2016-12-01T15:19:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Tunisia attack: UK wants inquests to be held partly in secret,"The UK government wants the inquests into the deaths of 30 British tourists killed by a gunman on a Tunisian beach to be held partly in secret over fears certain material could be used by terrorists to plot further atrocities. Security measures at hotels and resorts and details of how the UK and Tunisian governments work together to protect travellers are among the evidence that the government deems too sensitive to be discussed in public. Families of the victims of the massacre, which was claimed by Islamic State, will be able to see all information shared with the court and it is understood they have agreed it would be inappropriate for some material to be aired publicly. Clive Garner, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is representing 20 of the families who lost loved ones, said: “The government is applying to have some evidence heard behind closed doors and while we recognise the need to safeguard information critical to national security, this needs to be balanced with the families’ right to a transparent and open hearing.” The inquests into the deaths of 30 British victims shot dead by Seifeddine Rezgui in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, near Sousse, in June 2015 will resume next month. A total of 38 people were killed in the attack and a similar number were injured. The government made the application to hold part of the hearings behind closed doors at a pre-inquest review hearing at the royal courts ofjustice on Thursday. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith will make a ruling on the application later. Loraine-Smith told the hearing nothing would be kept from the families of victims, adding: “As far as possible everything will be in public.” He said “the last thing in the world” that families would want to do is to assist anyone planning a future attack.
Andrew O’Connor QC, for the government, told the judge it was “in the interests of national security” to keep some material out of the public domain, adding: “This risk is assessed by security experts to be a very real one.” Andrew Ritchie QC, representing 20 families, said it iwas their view that a “full and fearless” investigation was required to remain in keeping with the principle of open justice. He said that was particularly important in the context of the case, adding: “UK citizens travelling abroad face this sort of risk not only in Tunisia but around the world.” Ritchie said that “at the heart of the open justice principle”, it was the coroner’s role to bring the full facts to light. At a hearing in September, Ritchie said many families feared the Foreign Office may have failed in its responsibilities to thousands of British tourists. He said the families were also potentially concerned about the FCO “having cosy chats” with travel companies interested in running profitable businesses “in light of FCO then-current advice that there was a high risk of terrorist activity, including in tourist areas”."
2016-12-01T17:35:26Z,uk-news,UK news,"EU immigration hits historic high, but post-Brexit policy clues lie in the detail","The latest official figures showing that immigration from the European Union rose to a historic high in the run-up to the Brexit vote will not make comfortable reading in Downing Street. But Theresa May’s policy advisers will be less interested in the confirmation that Britain remains, as it has been for the past 20 years, a country of mass migration and more interested in any detail that might help them frame the future post-Brexit migration policy.
The numbers that will really capture their interest will be those showing the record rise in the number of EU citizens arriving in Britain looking for work without a definite job offer and the numbers on overseas students. The figures show that 189,000 EU citizens arrived in Britain looking for work in the 12 months to June and 57% of them had a definite job offer. The remaining 43%, or 82,000, came looking for work – a rise of 21,000 over the previous year. Most find a job within weeks and are barred from access to welfare benefits. They come because Britain has become the “jobs factory of Europe”, while Italy and Spain – the traditional destination, in particular for Romanians – have faltered. The prime minister made it clear when she was home secretary that she wanted to see severe restrictions on those who came to Britain without a specific job offer: “When it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits.” There have been clear signs in recent weeks that May still thinks this could be the way to go. EU labour migration has been the main driver behind the increase in the headline net migration figure. If she could secure a deal that meant restricting the numbers coming without an immediate job she would also achieve a big reduction in the record headline 335,000 net migration figure. The irony is that such a migration policy is entirely possible within the original Treaty of Rome and could be done without leaving the EU. The other big number Downing Street policy advisers will focus on is the 30,000 reduction, to 163,000, in the number of overseas students coming to Britain, indicating that the squeeze on higher education is now really biting. Most come from outside Europe, particularly China, the USA and India. The biggest falls in the last year have been in further education (-8%), English language schools (-9%) and private schools (-3%), but universities also saw a 1% drop in visa applications. May’s next big move on immigration is to tighten the curb on overseas students even further by tying the quality of the visa offer to the quality of the institution and the course. It is no secret that half the cabinet, including the chancellor, think overseas students should be taken out of the firing line and removed from the net migration target altogether. Despite May’s renowned stubbornness, it remains an open question. The battleground is over what proportion of students overstay their study visas to settle in Britain. May’s advisers have claimed up to 80% for certain types, while others claim it is as low as 1%. The current ONS migration data, based on the international passenger survey, is not fit to answer the question. Early results from the new system of exit checks circulating among ministers could settle the question. They should be published as soon as possible."
2016-12-01T17:49:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Violinist Bethan Doci jailed for Â£300,000 cancer fraud","A professional violinist has been jailed for conning more than £300,000 out of well-wishers by pretending that she had cancer. Bethan Doci, 38, claimed she needed the money for her treatment, but was fit and well and instead funded a lavish lifestyle including holidays abroad, luxury cars and expensive handbags. Doci, who has performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and with orchestras around the world, cheated one man out of his life savings, Swansea crown court was told. Jailing Doci for 32 months, the judge, Keith Thomas, said: “You committed these offences in a callous and heartless manner, saying you were suffering from cancer and needed treatment which you couldn’t afford. You took the money but used it on a lavish lifestyle.” Thomas said her treatment of a retired chartered accountant, Liam Donnelly, 64, whose wife had died from cancer and who handed over £170,000 to help Doci, was especially harsh. “Your victims were devastated, especially Mr Donnelly, who you treated particularly cruelly by taking all his life savings,” the judge said. The court heard that Doci had no assets left, having spent all the money, and she was ordered to repay a nominal £1 in compensation. Doci, who used the professional name Bethan Morgan, wept as she was led away. As well as Donnelly, Doci duped retired businessman Bruce Pilley, 58, out of £168,000, and former Royal Navy officer Neil McKelvie, 56, out £30,000 after advertising her fake illness on the Craigslist website. Doci, who lived in a riverside apartment in Swansea, admitted 11 counts of fraud from 2010-13. Catherine Richards, prosecuting, said Doci provided those who expressed a desire to help with false doctor’s notes. Richards said: “Her lies and deception became more and more elaborate.” Paul Spreadborough, defending, said: “She was gaining a professional reputation as a violinist and was a dedicated performer. But she was caught in a classic spiral of lies, debt and deceit. She fell into a pattern and fell deeper and deeper.” After the case, Supt Kath Pritchard described the investigation as “complex and protracted”. She said: “Thanks to the overwhelming evidence against Bethan Morgan, she pleaded guilty, which is testament to the tenacity and professionalism of our detectives. Bethan Doci/Morgan had a total disregard for her victims, who all trusted her. I hope her victims find some comfort in today’s outcome, which also sends out a clear message to criminals intent on committing fraudulent offences.” A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: “She exploited the trust, emotional vulnerabilities and generosity of … persons whom she met on the internet. Her conduct amounted to a calculated protracted web of deceit to fund her lavish lifestyle and foreign travel. A thorough and lengthy investigation revealed the breadth of her crime and a number of victims. “We hope her conviction and sentence provide some solace to those who were betrayed and suffered as a result of her crime, and we hope it deters others from committing like offences.”"
2016-12-01T18:16:32Z,uk-news,UK news,London mayor issues pollution warnings at bus stops and tube stations,"Air quality alerts have been issued at bus stops, tube stations and roadsides across London because of high pollution levels, said a spokeswoman for the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The alerts will notify Londoners on Thursday evening during their commute home from work. People in London who suffer from lung or heart problems have been warned to avoid strenuous exercise. The risks from heightened levels of air pollution enveloping the city have been exacerbated by settled and cold conditions, which have prevented pollutants from being dispersed. Individuals at risk have been warned to particularly avoid outdoor exercise, while those with asthma may need to use their inhaler more often, according to the London Air Quality Network, based at King’s College University. Anyone from the wider population who experiences sore eyes, a cough or sore throat should also consider reducing their physical activity, particularly outdoors, the pollution monitoring service said. Air pollution campaigners called on the government and city authorities to restrict traffic during smog episodes. “When pollution episodes are high, the mayor should introduce emergency traffic restrictions to bring pollution levels down quickly,” said a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth. “The solutions proposed for dealing with the latest smog have things backwards: the first step should be restricting traffic not people. “It’s outrageous that those with vulnerable lungs, including children and the elderly, are told to stay at home when the air is bad. Everyone should be able to go about their business, without being afraid of the air they breathe.” According to the London Air Quality Network, winter smogs are formed when pollutants from traffic and industry are trapped at ground level because of a temperature inversion. The pollution is a mix of ultra-fine particulates of unburned carbon, known as PM2.5s, and the toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is largely created by diesel cars, lorries and buses. Thursday’s pollution episode took place on the same day as Nice, the government’s independent health advisers, proposed that councils in England should be given powers to set up clean-air zones. This would allow them to restrict certain vehicles entering some areas. About 9,500 people die early each year in London due to long-term exposure to air pollution, more than twice as many as previously thought, according to new research. Air pollution is now Britain’s most lethal environmental risk, killing about 40,000 people prematurely each year. Air pollution monitors showed high or very high pollution along all major London roads, with extremely high pollution recorded in the city centre. On Thursday, a Defra pollution monitor on Marylebone Road also registered very high levels. Khan made tackling London’s air pollution a priority issue in his election campaign. This summer he announced his intention to issue alerts for high pollution. However, there have been no incidents of particularly high pollution until now. Khan said: “Londoners need to know when the city is suffering from high pollution levels so they can take any necessary appropriate measures to protect themselves from poor air quality. This is particularly crucial for Londoners who are vulnerable, such as asthma sufferers.”"
2016-12-01T18:28:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Michael Howard convicted in speeding case,"Michael Howard, the former leader of the Conservative party, has been convicted of failing to say who was driving his car when it was caught breaking the speed limit in south-east London. The Tory peer and his wife, Sandra, told Wimbledon magistrates court that either of them could have been driving their Toyota Prius when a speed camera clocked it travelling at more than 37mph in Lewisham, on 24 January, breaking the road’s 30mph speed limit. Howard was fined £900 and ordered to pay £625 costs and a victim surcharge of £90 after being found guilty of failing to give police information relating to the identification of a vehicle. He received six penalty points, which will be added to the three points already on his driving licence for speeding in 2014. The couple had been returning to Westminster from a weekend at their house in Howard’s former constituency of Folkestone and Hythe, in Kent, when their car was caught breaking the speed limit. Howard, a QC, fought the case himself, calling his wife as a witness to back up his account. “When I’m with my wife, which is regularly, we have no regular routine,” he was quoted as telling the court. “We were driving back from Kent, a journey we make very regularly and who drives depends on circumstances of whether one of us is tired, has work to do or is reading.” Asked if he recalled who was driving, Howard was quoted as saying by MailOnline: “I very much wish that I did, unfortunately I don’t.” His wife told the court: “We were not trying to hide anything. We simply couldn’t remember.” Howard claimed that because the speeding notification letter had arrived at his home while he and his wife were on holiday in Grenada, he did not open it until three weeks after the offence. “I tried as hard as I could to remember,” he said. But prosecutor Andrew Perry said: “Shrugging your shoulders and saying, ‘I can’t remember,’ is not enough.” Despite that, district judge Barbara Barnes described the evidence given by both Howard and his wife as credible. “The defendant did speak to his wife to try and remember who was driving. They did rack their brains,” she said. Howard said he intended to appeal against the verdict."
2016-12-01T18:34:07Z,uk-news,UK news,London's homelessness count continues to rise,"London dominates estimates of national homelessness newly published by Shelter. This, of course, is no surprise. Neither are high levels of homelessness anything new in the capital. In his book London: The Heartless City, published in 1977, David Wilcox reported that “by the end of 1976, 15,000 families were recognised as homeless”. And that was 10 years after Cathy Come Home. Has anything improved? Shelter calculates that 170,000 people are homeless in London today. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has told the Guardian it does not recognise Shelter’s figures and provided one of 52,820 homeless households in temporary accommodation in London as of the 30 June. However, as households frequently comprise more than one person and Shelter’s figures are mostly drawn from the DCLG’s own data on temporary accommodation and rough sleeping, the difference between the two might not be so great. Any comparison between these figure and the 15,000 homeless families of 1976 will be inexact, as counting methods and homelessness definitions have altered over the years. Moreover, London’s population has gone up by about 1.5m since then which alters the percentages. But however you cut the numbers, they’ve been going in the wrong direction recently. Shelter claims that its methodology has “for the very first time” revealed “the true scale of homelessness” by adding up those DCLG numbers, others from social services departments secured through Freedom of Information requests and more on hostel bed spaces for single people gathered at Homeless Link. The venerable charity says its figures “should be viewed as robust, lower-end estimates” based on “conservative assumptions” and do not include the “hidden homeless” of so-called “sofa surfers” - usually young people staying with friends. The current DCLG figure is higher than the 50,970 it recorded for the final quarter of 2015, which, while lower than a peak of 63,800 at the end of 2005, was the first time it had topped 50,000 since 2008. In 2011 it was 35,620. Shelter says that Newham is the borough containing the largest number of homeless people in London with 12,246 of them, followed by Brent with 10,582 and Enfield with 9,285. The one with the highest proportion of homeless people is Westminster, whose total of 8,059 represents a striking one in 25 of its overall population. In Newham, the figure is one in 27, in Haringey approximately one in 28 and in Kensington and Chelsea it is one in 29. At the bottom of Shelter’s “homelessness hotspots” top 20 is Wandsworth, with 3,987 homeless people and a ratio of one in 81. The Shelter report points no fingers of blame, recognising that this long running problem has many causes and manifestations which vary from borough to borough and age to age. In the capital, where nothing is straightforward and spending cuts are deep, local authorities are struggling to cope. “There is no single solution to this problem,” says Lewisham Council, which has an imaginative “pop up” housing scheme in Ladywell among its policies: “Homelessness here continues to rise whilst the supply of suitable affordable accommodation is reducing and the cost of housing across all tenures has never been higher.” Newham stresses that its similar problems are “exacerbated by the government’s welfare reforms which have restricted the number of properties available to families on low incomes”. It says a not-for-profit housing organisation it set up in 2006 provides some temporary accommodation. Across town, the story from Ealing Council is much the same: “The numbers of families presenting to the council as homeless is increasing year on year and, like many councils, we are struggling to find accommodation for them.” They are developing small pockets of their own land and building their own modular homes as an alternative to housing people in expensive, temporary private accommodation locally. It’s 50 years since Shelter was founded. Its work goes on."
2016-12-01T18:40:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland to raise age of criminal responsibility to 12 years,"Scotland’s minimum age of criminal responsibility will be raised to 12 years, in line with UN standards, after the current minimum age of eight, the lowest in Europe, was labelled a “national embarrassment”. Mark McDonald, minister for childcare and early years, announced on Thursday afternoon that the Scottish government would bring forward legislation to raise the age by four years, calling the case for it “clear and compelling”.
In a statement to Holyrood, McDonald told MSPs: “Having the lowest minimum age of criminal responsibility in Europe does not match with our progressive approach to youth justice and ambitions to give children the best start in life.” A recent consultation with police, prosecutors and victims’ groups found that 95% supported an increase to the age of 12 or above. In 2010, the Scottish government raised the age of criminal prosecution to 12, assuring that no one under that age could be prosecuted or sentenced in the criminal courts but would be dealt with through children’s hearings. However, those outcomes would still be added to children’s criminal records.
McDonald said: “Raising the age of criminal responsibility will mean people no longer face potentially damaging and life-altering consequences, such as a criminal record, for events that took place when they were a young child.” He added that he recognised the need for safeguards in exceptional cases, and that police would still have powers to investigate serious offences committed by children under 12s.
The minimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10. The UN committee on the rights of the child has stated that setting the age of criminal responsibility below 12 is considered “not to be internationally acceptable”. Liam McArthur MSP, the Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, welcomed the decision. His predecessor in the role Alison McInnes advocated the rise, but her attempts to alter the law by bringing forward amendments to a criminal justice bill in the last Holyrood session were voted down by the SNP. McDonald told the chamber on Thursday that he wanted to put on the record his thanks to McInnes for pressing the issue. McArthur likewise praised her “tireless work”, adding: “Eight-year-olds should be treated as children not criminals. The fact they can receive convictions which need to be declared for decades, or even the rest of their lives, is a national embarrassment.”
The acting chair of the Scottish youth parliament, Amy Lee Fraioli MSYP, also welcomed the move, adding that children and young people across Scotland felt strongly about the issue. “Raising the age of criminal responsibility from eight to 12 is an important step towards fully incorporating the UN convention on the rights of the child into Scots law. Many children who find themselves in children’s hearings are also victims themselves, and are often ill-equipped to deal with the situations they find themselves in. Raising the age will help ensure that Scotland is a fair place for children, and shift focus to supporting children instead of criminalising them.”"
2016-12-01T19:12:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"Immigration to UK hit record levels prior to Brexit vote, data shows","Immigration to Britain reached 650,000 – its highest ever annual level – in the runup to the EU referendum, fuelled by record numbers of European migrants coming to work in “the jobs factory of Europe”, official figures reveal. The record level of immigration at the time of the Brexit vote was driven by a historically high inflow of 284,000 EU citizens, almost matching the number of those from outside Europe (289,000). The influx meant net migration remained at a near-record high of 335,000 in the 12 months to the end of June. It is more than three times the government’s target to reduce annual net migration to below 100,000 a year. However, the figures show that Theresa May’s drive to reduce overseas student numbers is continuing to bite, with 30,000 fewer international students compared with the previous year.
Some early data from after the Brexit vote suggest that some migration to the UK may be decreasing. New national insurance data suggests that the numbers of Polish people and other eastern European migrants registering to work in Britain dropped by 17% or 35,000 in the 12 months to September. But there was an 11% rise, or 22,000 increase, in Romanians and Bulgarians registering for national insurance. Work has proved the main attraction for the record levels of immigration, particularly from within the EU, accounting for 189,000 of the 311,000 who came to Britain for a job in the last year. More than 182,000 came to work in a definite job, but those looking for work jumped 23,000 to 130,000 in the latest figures.
The proportion of EU citizens coming to work in Britain without a specific job offer has now risen to a record high of 43% (82,000), while 57% had a definite job. May has strongly indicated that a new post-Brexit immigration system could be based on restricting access for European jobseekers to the UK labour market. The ONS said that in 2015 Romania had for the first time become the most common country of last residence, displacing India and making up 10% of all immigrants. The figures show a sixth successive annual increase in the number of asylum seekers claiming refugee status in Britain, to 41,280. But despite the intensification of the European refugee crisis, the number of Syrians claiming asylum in the UK fell by 317 to 2,298. The largest numbers were Iranians and Iraqis. A further 4,162 Syrians were directly resettled under the government’s commitment to take 20,000 over the next four years. The latest Home Office figures show that the backlog of EU citizens who have applied to secure their right to residence in the UK jumped by more than 23,000 to 113,000 in the three months immediately after the Brexit vote. The figures for applications for permanent residence cards alone jumped 83% during the six months bracketing the referendum campaign. Net migration from the EU is at historically high levels and now matches net migration from outside the bloc. The record 650,000 level of immigration in the year to June 2016 was made up of 284,000 EU citizens coming to live and work in Britain, 289,000 coming from outside Europe, and 77,000 Britons returning to live in the UK. The most common reason they came to Britain was to work. Nicola White, the ONS’s head of international migration statistics, said that net migration remained at record levels, but was stable compared with recent years. “Immigration levels are now among the highest estimates recorded; the inflow of EU citizens is also at historically high levels and similar to the inflow of non-EU citizens. “These long-term immigration figures run up to the end of June, so it is too early to say what effect, if any, the EU referendum has had on long-term international migration.”
The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, responded to the figures by saying the British people had sent a very clear message that they wanted more control of immigration. He renewed the government’s commitment to getting net migration down to sustainable levels in the tens of thousands. “There is no consent for uncontrolled immigration, which puts pressure on schools, hospitals and public services. That is why reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK will be a key priority of our negotiations to leave the EU,” he said. “Further to this, we continue to reform non-EU immigration routes to ensure we attract the best and brightest, who benefit and contribute to this country. But there is more to do as we build an immigration system that delivers the control we need.” But immigration lawyers Laura Devine Solicitors highlighted a refusal of 49% of entrepreneur visa requests in the last quarter, many from India, and argued that this questioned Britain’s “open for business” reputation.
The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the May and the Tories seemed determined to repeat their mistakes over the net migration target. She said: “We now know that at the same time she was cutting the border force, she tried to force schools into objectionable schemes that would hurt children in a failed effort to meet that target. We should welcome overseas students and the contribution they make to our universities and wider society, and yet the Tories seem determined to discourage them.” She said it was a scandal that the number of asylum applications had gone down from Syria despite the deepening crisis and said it was time to provide certainty to EU citizens about their future in Britain. Phoebe Griffiths of the Institute of Public Policy research said the surge in grants for permanent residence – up by 40% following the referendum – showed that Brexit was clearly causing concern among EU nationals living in Britain. “When individuals already in the UK take steps to safeguard their status, barriers should not be put in their way. Brexit has created great uncertainty. If the government does not wish to guarantee the rights of all EU nationals at this point in the negotiations, it should at the very least prioritise streamlining the process for residence applications,” she said. Marc Stears, of the New Economics Foundation, said: “This isn’t bad news for the economy: to take one example, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast, a possible reduced immigration as a consequence of ending free movement – Brexit – would translate into lower GDP and lower tax receipts, resulting in an increase of public sector debt by £16bn to 2020-21. The fact immigration hasn’t gone down means more money to spend on things like the NHS, pensions and welfare.” This article was amended on 2 December 2016 to correct details about refused visa requests highlighted by Laura Devine Solicitors."
2016-12-02T06:00:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Sir Hardy Amies show celebrates life and legacy of Queen's dressmaker,"An exhibition celebrating the origins of Sir Hardy Amies, revered supplier of tailoring to society and royalty, opens this week in the east London borough of Dagenham. Photographs and letters, memorabilia and original designs including a pink hat and coat created for the Queen’s silver jubilee will feature in the exhibition, as well as a moth-eaten and battered object Amies kept his whole life – his old cap from Brentwood School. Amies returned to the school several times, to open a bazaar in the 1950s, to give a fundraising fashion show in 1957 and, in the 1960s, to redesign the girls’ uniform still being worn today.
“It’s been largely forgotten even by most people living in Dagenham and he is often seen as a snobby and elitist figure – but he never attempted to deny his origins, which clearly meant a lot to him,” said curator Amy de la Haye, professor of dress history at the London College of Fashion, part of the University of the Arts London. The exhibition is being created in a building Amies would have known well, Valence House, a miraculous survivor in suburbia of a house datingin part to the 1400s, now a local authority museum. Amies was born in London in 1909 and moved to Dagenham as a toddler when his father got a job helping create the Becontree Estate, once the largest council house estate in the world. Their first home, an old farmhouse, was demolished long ago, but they then moved to the White House, another remarkable survivor which is being rescued from dereliction as a community arts centre by Create London.
His mother was a dressmaker and he followed her into couture, but only opened his own Savile Row salon after the second world war, in which he served in British intelligence and the special operations executive. He was official dressmaker to the Queen from 1955 until he retired in 1989, and other projects included costumes for the science fiction film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. He was knighted in 1996. De la Haye said that when Amies died in 2003, many of the contents of his elegant flat were given to Central St Martin’s art college and are now going on display for the first time - including the old school cap, which she described as “the jewel in the collection”. Steve Lawrence, a local carpenter who has worked on the White House and the Valence House exhibition, discovered Amies when he became fed up at the buttons falling off his winter coat. “Every winter I would buy a coat, and every winter the buttons would fall off,” he said. “I decided that what I needed was a proper old school overcoat, the kind everyone’s dad had that lasted for ever. When I found one in a second hand shop the guy said he had some suits as well – and that was my first Hardy Amies suit.”
Although his suits are now museum pieces, with two on display in the exhibition, Lawrence wears one to work every day – and just this week bought another online for £5. His mate, he says in bewilderment, just spent £200 on a pair of new jeans. Lawrence says the Amies suits are “warm, they’re practical, they look good - and they never wear out”. De la Haye says the secret of Amies’ enduring style is simple: “He was a very very good tailor.” Hardy Amies, a Dagenham Designer, 3 December to 25 February 2017. Free admission."
2016-12-02T07:33:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Richmond Park byelection sends message from London to the UK,"A bizarre suburban byelection has been rescued from meaninglessness by 20,510 Richmond Park electors who have put Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney into the House of Commons and given erstwhile Tory pin-up boy Zac Goldsmith an almighty boot in the Brexits. The billionaire’s son who was once the environmentalist facelift of David Cameron’s rebranded Conservatives and who began the year with hopes of becoming London mayor will end it twitted, tarnished and politically unemployed. Everything about the contest was unreal. Goldsmith resigned as the affluent, Thames-side seat’s Conservative MP in protest at the Conservative government’s decision to expand capacity at Heathrow airport despite regretting having promised to do so when initially winning the seat in 2010. The party he has formally left in order to see that pledge through as an independent indulged him in his act of reluctant principle by not standing a pro-expansion candidate against him. They weren’t alone. Olney and Labour’s candidate Christian Wolmar didn’t want a bigger Heathrow either. The Greens opted out to assist the Lib Dem. The way was left fatally clear for a contest Goldsmith had intend to be a referendum about aircraft noise in south-west London to instead became one about the even bigger and more polluting din that is the aftermath of the EU ballot held in June. Goldsmith, like his father before him, is a dedicated Leaver in one of the most Remain-leaning quarters of Remain City. Ukip stepped aside to help him win. He was in trouble from the very beginning. Goldsmith’s EU view wasn’t the only reason the anti-airport man was cruising for a bruising. He’d fought his wretched mayoral campaign claiming that the greatly increased majority he’d secured in 2015 showed that his constituents valued his independent spirit and personal style. Yet the air war part of that mayoral campaign was the nastiest example of negative tactics the capital has seen since the notorious 1983 Bermondsey byelection - won by the Liberal Democrats, by the way - and the most sly and pernicious example of dog-whistle politics the capital has yet endured. The Tory muck machine fed its media conduits - primarily the Evening Standard and the Sunday Times - guilt-by-association non-stories designed to stir Londoners’ anxieties about Islamist terror to the disadvantage of Labour’s candidate, the Muslim Sadiq Khan. Called out, Goldsmith became indignant. His defence was that he’d never claimed Khan himself held extreme views but that his past support for causes also backed by alleged fanatics brought his judgment into question. But it was Goldsmith to whom London voters assigned guilt by association. Rather than Khan being “linked” with extremists in the majority’s minds, Goldsmith became linked with dirty politics. This was the direct antithesis of all he claimed he stood for, and it did not go unnoticed in Richmond Park. The issue came up on the doorstep. Challenged about it, Goldsmith stuck to his stubborn denials. A politician long hailed for his grace and purity has become indelibly soiled. For Olney and her party, victory will feel like the next step on a national comeback trail in a region of the capital that used to be an orange stronghold. For London, it is a local reassertion of its people’s disquiet over the turbulence triggered by the Brexit vote and the destructive mentalities it has unleashed. A freak of a byelection that risked being pointless has ended up as a restatement of some of the capital’s most distinctive values. It won’t be the last time the city makes its feelings known. Dave Hill is the author of Zac versus Sadiq: the Fight to Become London Mayor, which can be bought from the Guardian Bookshop or directly from the author."
2016-12-02T08:35:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Isis recruiters targeting refugees in Europe, say counter-terror experts","Islamic State recruiters are targeting vulnerable refugees in Europe to radicalise them in an effort to further polarise the European Union population, counter-terror experts have warned. Europol, the law enforcement agency of the EU, said it was in the interests of Islamic State to inflame the migration crisis and to turn EU citizens against refugees seeking asylum. A number of jihadis are already travelling through Europe for this purpose and German authorities were aware of about 300 recorded attempts to recruit refugees trying to enter Europe by April 2016, Europol said in its report, Changes in Modus Operandi of IS revisited. “Given that it is in the interests of IS (Islamic State) to inflame the migration crisis to polarise the EU population and turn sections of it against those seeking asylum, there is a risk of some infiltration of refugee camps and other groups,” the report published on Friday said. “A real and imminent danger is the possibility of elements of the (Sunni Muslim) Syrian refugee diaspora becoming vulnerable to radicalisation once in Europe and being specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters.” However, Europol said the extent of such infiltration was unknown, making the subject susceptible to exaggeration and exploitation by populist factions and extreme rightwing parties. In the same report, Europol warns that as Islamic State is defeated or severely weakened by coalition forces in its former stronghold of Syria and Iraq, there may be an increase in the number of foreign fighters and their families returning from the region to Europe. The agency said further attacks in the EU, both by lone actors and groups of terrorists, were likely to be attempted – with estimates from some intelligence services suggesting that several dozen people directed by Islamic State might be currently in Europe with a capability to commit terrorist attacks. Gilles de Kerchove, EU counter-terrorism coordinator, said: “We have to be vigilant, since the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State and returning foreign fighters is likely to persist in the coming years. These people are trained to use explosives and firearms and they have been indoctrinated by the jihadist ideology.”"
2016-12-02T13:47:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother of Briton accused of trying to shoot Trump makes appeal to Obama,"The mother of an autistic man who allegedly wanted to shoot Donald Trump at a campaign rally before the US election has appealed to Barack Obama to allow her son to serve his sentence in Britain. Michael Sandford, 20, will be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty to lesser charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business. The Briton attempted to grab a pistol from a police officer at a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas four months before the election, and said he had wanted to kill the then presidential candidate.
Sandford had hoped to receive the minimum sentence of 18-24 months in prison, because he has no previous convictions, and to be allowed to serve it in England. But his mother has said he is terrified that pressure from the president-elect may result in a more severe sentence that has to be served in the US. Lynne Sandford said: “When he first heard that Mr Trump had won, he told me: ‘I’m so glad I didn’t do what I wanted to do that day, and I do accept and respect the decision of the American people.’ But within 24 hours, it hit him like a sledgehammer.
“He was in a terrible state, saying: ‘What if the judge decides to increase my sentence to get onside with Trump? What if Trump wants to have me bumped off in prison, what if he wants to make example of me and not let me out of prison?’” Lynne Sandford has seen her son once since he was taken into custody, but will fly to the US for his sentencing on 13 December. She said Michael had recently written her a letter saying he was struggling to get by. “He said: ‘I can’t describe how I’m feeling. Tears are streaming down my face as I write this. I miss you all and love you all more than words can explain. I need to be back home with you all. I’m so alone, cold and scared here. You all mean everything to me and I’m so sorry for how I have treated you all. I love you, I love you, I love you,’” she said. Her son has a range of acute and complex medical issues. He has had severe obsessive compulsive disorder, was sectioned aged 14, previously tried to kill himself, and has a heart condition. He was diagnosed as having been under the influence of a delusional, psychotic episode at the time of the incident. He was initially told he faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison after being charged in June with disrupting an official function and two firearms offences. He is being held in custody at a US government-run detention centre in Nevada. “The US and UK have to agree to him serving his sentence in England. I don’t think that’s a problem for the English side, but once Mr Trump is president, he might not agree to it,” Lynne Sandford said. “That’s what we’re worried about. “I have written to President Obama and Theresa May to see if they can intervene. I’m hoping that President Obama will show compassion and realise that this poor sap could be on the receiving end of Trump’s anger, and I am urging him to act in any way he can while he is still in power.” She said she had received a standard reply from Downing Street and was yet to hear from the White House. Her son has been on suicide watch for much of his time in detention. “When he’s on suicide watch, he’s in isolation his cell 24 hours a day. He is not allowed anything in with him; not even toilet paper, in case he rams it down his throat,” she said. She has been told her son is being given 15 tablets a day, but not what for or what dosage. “All I know is he is being given them erratically, sometimes in one go. He’s had more seizures and has been hallucinating. I would imagine this is the result of the erratic medication,” she said. Her son had lost a great deal of weight and was less than eight stone, she said. Michael, who is 5ft 10, has had anorexia nervosa in the past. “He is eating porridge in the morning and a bread roll in the evening, and that’s it. He is unable to sleep at night because the lights in his cell are kept on all night. He is severely depressed,” the mother said. She said she wanted to thank Guardian readers who had donated more than £10,000 to a Crowdjustice page set up to raise money for his legal fees after the Guardian’s Weekend magazine wrote about his case. “It was an amazing response,” she said. “We were so touched and appreciative, and Michael passes on his sincerest thanks to everybody trying to help him. I’m glad readers realise that despite what he attempted to do, he’s not a bad person at heart, and that he needs help.” She has started a new Crowdjustice page to raise funds to try to bring him back to the UK to serve his sentence close to his family."
2016-12-02T17:26:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Murder inquiry after immigration centre detainee dies in fight,"Police have launched a murder investigation after a 64-year-old immigration detainee died following a fight in a detention centre close to Heathrow. Officers were called to an assault at the Colnbrook immigration removal centre in west London on Thursday morning, but the man died in hospital 12 hours later at 9.30pm. A 32-year-old man remains in custody, while two others, aged 31 and 35, have been released with no further action. Colnbrook has the capacity to hold up to 396 men and 27 women. It is run by Home Office subcontractors Mitie Care and Custody. Colnbrook detainees told the Guardian they were sad about the death and expressed fear for their safety. The centre manager, Paul Morrison, circulated a letter to all detainees on Thursday night saying the victim was being treated in hospital. “The detainee involved is currently being treated in hospital and police have attended the fight. We believe this to be an isolated incident. We have no further information at this time,” the letter said. One detainee said: “There is a lot of violence in this centre and a lot of people are harming themselves. We are not allowed to have phones with cameras in them, but if we were, we could get some photos to the outside world and show people what is really happening in this place. “They sometimes put the whole place on lockdown and then we feel really trapped. Every day we feel very stressed in this place. I don’t think you would keep an animal in these conditions.” Another detainee said: “Everyone is very scared after what happened. We don’t know who to trust and we don’t know what will happen next. Nobody feels safe here. “People who are sick don’t always get the proper treatment from the healthcare unit and we see terrible things sometimes when people are being deported. Their ankles are twisted, their arms are damaged, some have restraint belts put around their waists, then they are picked up like a handbag.” Jerome Phelps, the director of Detention Action, which supports people in detention, said: “While the exact facts are still unconfirmed and a murder investigation is continuing, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased. “Irrespective of the circumstances, the bare minimum we expect from immigration detention centres is that they guarantee the safety and security of those in their protection. It is unacceptable that this marks the 27th death that has happened in a detention centre in the UK. The Home Office owes a duty of care to people in detention and this must be upheld.” A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that a murder investigation is under way. “Detectives from the homicide and major crime command led by DCI Mark Lawson are investigating. No one else is currently being sought in connection with the investigation,” he said. A Home Office spokesman said it did not comment on continuing police investigations. Colnbrook, which opened in 2004, holds migrants the Home Office is planning to remove from the UK, as well as foreign prisoners who have completed their sentences. However, Home Office figures show that in July, August and September, 43% of detainees were released back into the community. A Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons report in 2013 found “significant evidence of constant low-level anxiety and fear among detainees” at Colnbrook, although the then chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick found that there had been some improvements in the levels of violence and use of force."
2016-12-02T19:52:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Edward Heath child abuse investigation 'not a witch-hunt',"The chief constable of the force investigating claims that Sir Edward Heath sexually abused children has vowed not to buckle under “unacceptable” media pressure, insisting the investigation into the late prime minister is not a “fishing trip” or a “witch-hunt”. A “significant number of individuals have disclosed allegations of abuse”, the Wiltshire police chief, Mike Veale, said on Friday in an extraordinary 1,600-word statement that sought to rebuff media criticism and keep the 15-month investigation on track. The Guardian understands that at least 15 people have made allegations to the police around the country claiming Heath, who died in 2005, was involved in the sexual abuse of children. Multiple sources say the Wiltshire-led Operation Conifer remains live and the claims are regarded by police as credible, with inquiries continuing into whether they can be shown to be true or disproved. Police are describing the complainants as “victims” in private. One police source said the fact police were continuing the investigation demonstrated the belief in the credibility of the complaints. “If we did not believe that, we would have shut the investigation down. The fact is we are continuing.” Police have taken advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, and a senior officer from Wiltshire has been moved into a role with full-time oversight of the inquiry into Heath and others. Veale’s three-page statement, rare during the middle of a high-profile investigation, came after months of attacks in the media on Operation Conifer, which began in August 2015. The chief constable criticised the undue pressure on his officers and said police were under a greater duty to investigate because Heath had held the highest office in the UK. “Sir Edward Heath was an extremely prominent, influential and high-profile person, who was arguably one of the most powerful people in the world commensurate with the publicly elected office he held.“It is clear that I am expected to conduct a proportionate investigation which will result in a distinct outcome or report and the closer the suspect is to the state the greater the obligation and the more probing the investigation should be.” Heath was prime minister from 1970-74. A world-class yachtsman in his spare time, he took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community. His time in power was beset by industrial strife, and confrontations with the then powerful trade unions plunged Britain into a three-day week. He was elected leader of the the Conservative party in 1965 and won the 1970 election. He lost the premiership in 1974 to Labour’s Harold Wilson and lost the Conservative party leadership the following year when challenged and defeated by Margaret Thatcher, of whom he became a bitter and vocal critic. Heath, who never married, died at home in Salisbury in July 2005, aged 89. Dr Rachel Hoskins, an expert on ritual sacrifice who has been asked by detectives to examine claims made against Heath and others as part of Operation Conifer, has been highly critical of the investigation. Veale said: “This is not a ‘fishing trip’ or ‘witch-hunt’ – both of these terms have been unfairly levelled at us.” He cited the constitutional principle of policing being free of undue influence from the state, as he pledged the investigation would continue. “I take my responsibilities of operational independence, which is the bedrock of British policing, very seriously indeed. Therefore I will remain operationally independent and will not be influenced by inappropriate and unacceptable pressure from people who don’t know the detail of this case. “I will not be buckling under pressure to not investigate or to conclude the investigation prematurely.” Veale said even though Heath was dead, detectives might be able to track down any accomplices and support any victims. “There remains the likelihood that witnesses that can serve to corroborate or, equally as important, negate the allegations, are still alive. If abuse has occurred then it remains relevant to support those affected and seek to bring to justice any person still living who may have committed associated criminal offences. It is important to identify any vulnerable individuals who require safeguarding today.” Several police forces across Britain have received claims about Heath. The investigation is being co-ordinated and led by police in Wiltshire, where Heath had a home in Salisbury. Veale said a thorough inquiry could exonerate Heath and that some claims had been dropped by detectives. The media debate about the investigation has characterised it as unfounded, but within policing the view is largely different. Public faith in police competence around investigating historical sexual abuse claims against high-profile individuals has been rocked by the fallout from a Scotland Yard inquiry, Operation Midland, which examined claims from the 1970s and 80s. A report earlier this month castigated police for falling for false claims made by a complainant called “Nick”. In that case, police chiefs were among the last to realise the inquiry, which wrongly targeted establishment figures, was beset by failings. Veale said “Nick” had not been spoken to as part of the Wiltshire-led investigation. In the Met inquiry he is believed to have made claims, widely thought to be false, about Heath. Other police investigations into historical sexual abuse claims have led to convictions. Police have also faced accusations that they have covered up or failed to investigate abuse claims against powerful people. At the end of their investigation, Wiltshire police plan to write a report assessing whether the evidence gathered would have been sufficient to charge Heath, put him on trial, and convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt. Two people have been arrested as part of Operation Conifer. Police will only say the arrests are related to “child protection issues” and that the two, who have been bailed, are suspects but are not directly linked to the Heath investigation. Wiltshire’s police and crime commissioner, Angus Macpherson, who has strategic oversight of the force, backed its right to investigate the claims and said public interest was adding to pressure on officers. “I believe the root cause of this pressure is a legitimate concern that the reputation of a former prime minister may be tarnished without there being credible evidence of guilt,” Macpherson said. “The chief constable and I are of one mind: the police cannot act as judge and jury in their own cause. Once the police have conducted the investigation to a conclusion, there must be an alternative avenue to assess the credibility of any evidence that has been gathered.” The Guardian understands that Det Supt Sean Memory, who was Wiltshire’s head of crime, has been moved from his post to oversee the inquiry into Heath full-time, as well as another inquiry into historical allegations which emerged during the investigation into Heath. Wiltshire police said: “Further to a restructure of portfolios Det Supt Memory is the new head of Legacy Investigations and continues in his role as senior investigating officer for Operation Conifer.” The CPS confirmed it had given advice to the police investigation. In August 2015 Memory made a public appeal, controversially outside Heath’s Salisbury home, saying: “This is an appeal for victims in particular if you have been the victim of any crime from Sir Ted Heath or any historical sexual offence, or you are a witness, or you have any information about this, then please come forward.”"
2016-12-03T05:30:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Life and death on a Highland road,"Driving down the hill the other day, I spotted a casualty on the road ahead, and knew by its size that it was a brown hare. Of all the creatures I find dead or injured on the roads, the brown hares are the ones that upset me the most, not least because when they are hurt their hare scream is penetrating and eerie. This one was a crumpled heap of light and dark brown fur. Its elongated hind legs were broken, but the long, broad ears stuck out almost defiantly. The carcass would not last long with so many scavengers around and I expected that night a fox would carry it off to eat at leisure. Coming back along the same road seven hours later, I was surprised by another roadkill specimen, a few metres from what was left of the brown hare. In all my 40 years of driving in the Highlands, this is only the second time I had found a dead woodcock on the road.
I wondered why it had been there at all during the day, as they are normally nocturnal or crepuscular. I stopped and took away the body to examine closer. I was particularly interested in the two pin feathers located at the carpel joint of the wings. These are short and stiff and highly prized by artists for fine work. Scolopax rusticola is a bird that guards its secrets closely. It is known that the adults pick up their young when danger threatens, but many people who have studied woodcock all their lives never see evidence of this. Years ago, walking through woodland in the breeding season, I was privileged to see one rise up in front of me carrying a small chick between its legs. The adult landed about 20 metres away and deposited its offspring, then flew back towards me, picked up another young bird and flew back to the first one. I left them in peace with a feeling of intense satisfaction at having witnessed this for myself. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary"
2016-12-03T09:22:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Football abuse: from one lone voice to a national scandal,"It began with the former footballer Andy Woodward bravely stepping out of the shadows to describe to the Guardian the sexual abuse he endured as a young player. Two weeks on it has spiralled into a scandal engulfing clubs and communities across the UK. By Friday, 18 police forces were investigating leads from at least 350 alleged victims, the NSPCC children’s charity was processing almost 1,000 reports to a hotline and one of the world’s most famous clubs, Chelsea, was facing questions about whether it had tried to hush up abuse allegations. All those involved – police, football administrators, players and their relatives, children’s charities, lawyers – are convinced it will not end here. The former England striker and NSPCC ambassador Alan Shearer was the latest to express his shock at what has emerged and solidarity with those who had come forward. “Over the last week I have been shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the abuse that colleagues, and in some cases former team-mates, suffered,” he said. “I have nothing but huge respect and admiration for all the players who are now coming forward, bravely breaking years of silence in a bid to help others. They’ve carried a terrible burden for too long.” Shearer sought to reassure parents of children who would be playing football this weekend that changes had been made. “We can never be complacent but thankfully huge progress has been made in the last 10 years when it comes to safeguarding. All clubs now have dedicated people tasked with keeping kids safe, but there’s always more to be done.” He also made it clear he believed the scandal was likely to escalate. “As the weeks go on, it seems likely that there will be more people coming forward who suffered abuse within football, and they will need to be given our support so as they can get the help they need and should have had years ago.” Two players at Newcastle United were among those who came forward this week. Derek Bell told the Guardian how he was groomed and violated between the ages of 12 and 16 by the convicted paedophile George Ormond, his coach at the Montagu and North Fenham boys football club. Ormond went on to become involved in youth coaching at Newcastle, where he abused player David Eatock, during the Kevin Keegan years in the 1990s. “I can still remember the look on his [Ormond’s] face, how terrifying it was, and how his eyes were possessed,” Eatock told the Guardian. The former England, Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur player Paul Stewart described in harrowing detail how he was abused by the late Frank Roper, a well known youth coach in the north-west of England. “He said he would kill my mother, my father, my two brothers if I breathed a word about it,” said Stewart. “And at 11 years old, you believe that.” Individual clubs including Newcastle, Manchester City and Crewe have launched inquiries into how they handled allegations of abuse, or coaches who had turned out to be offenders. On Tuesday, the former coach Barry Bennell was charged with eight offences of sexual assault against a boy under the age of 14. The offences allegedly took place between 1981 and 1985. The Football Association has launched an independent review, which will be led by the barrister Kate Gallafent QC, who specialises in human rights and sport. The FA chairman, Greg Clarke, described it as one of the biggest crises in the organisation’s history. Asked about claims that clubs may have tried to bribe players to stay silent about their abuse, he described the concept as “morally repugnant”. He has promised that any club guilty of “hushing up” sexual abuse to protect their image will be punished. That promise may be tested after the Daily Mirror revealed that the former Chelsea player Gary Johnson signed a confidentiality agreement with the club in 2015 in return for £50,000 after he alleged he was abused by the club’s then chief scout Eddie Heath in the 1970s. “I think that they were paying me to keep a lid on this,” he told the Mirror. “Millions of fans around the world watch Chelsea. They are one of the biggest and richest clubs in the world. All their fans deserve to know the truth about what went on. I know they asked me to sign a gagging order and how many others are there out there?” Chelsea has refused to comment on the details of the allegations, only saying that it has appointed an external law firm to carry out a formal investigation into a former employee, and would pass those findings on to the FA. On Friday, Southampton, a club renowned for its youth system, said it had contacted the police after receiving information in relation to historical child abuse. It followed BBC interviews with two former players, Dean Radford and Jamie Webb, who said they were groomed and abused by a former club employee. Police chiefs said there was no sign of any let up in the reports of abuse. By the end of the week Greater Manchester police said it had identified 10 suspects after receiving reports from 35 victims. The priority for forces was to assess whether those named posed a present risk to children, and to deal with them before moving on to investigate historical abuse claims. But the allegations emerging are not confined to football, or even to sport. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) said it had seen a tenfold increase in the number of adult survivors of child abuse registering for its support groups, rising from 10 registrations a week to 100 in the last three weeks. The Napac chief executive, Gabrielle Shaw, said: “This is not just about football; huge numbers of people suffered abuse in childhood, within the family or institutions. Survivors often feel shame, pain and confusion about what was done to them.”"
2016-12-03T10:16:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-Southampton employee accused of abuse 'still works in football',"A former employee of Southampton Football Club accused of sexually abusing young players in the 1980s is still working in the sport, it has been reported. BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme said it understood the former staff member left Southampton after concerns were raised about his behaviour towards members of the clubâ€™s youth team. The programme claimed the staff member went on to work for other clubs and, despite being asked to leave one of them, was still working in the game. Southampton has said it will work with Hampshire police as at least 18 forces around the country investigate claims from up to 350 people of historical child sexual abuse in youth football. The development came as the England menâ€™s and womenâ€™s captains, Wayne Rooney and Steph Houghton, joined Alan Shearer and other leading football figures in urging players to come forward with allegations. In a video on â€œsafeguardingâ€� published for the Football Association and NSPCC childrenâ€™s charity, published on the FAâ€™s Twitter account, Rooney said: â€œItâ€™s important that everyone knows how to raise any concerns about the childâ€™s welfare. â€œIf youâ€™re a young boy or girl and youâ€™re upset, hurt or scared with the way someone behaves with you, please let someone you trust know now.â€�
Rooney has previously praised Andy Woodward, 43, who came forward two weeks ago to say he was abused as a young player. West Midlands police said it was â€œinvestigating four historical allegations of child sexual abuse in footballâ€� and Kent police said it had received reports of abuse within the countyâ€™s football community. So far 10 suspects have been identified, and Greater Manchester police said it was investigating reports from 35 people, with its inquiry growing on a â€œdaily basisâ€�. On Tuesday, the former coach Barry Bennell was charged with eight offences of sexual assault against a boy under the age of 14. The offences allegedly took place between 1981 and 1985. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) said it had seen a 10-fold increase in the number of adult survivors of child abuse registering for their support groups â€“ from 10 registrations a week to 100 â€“ in the past three weeks. The National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council said around 350 people across the country had reported abuse allegations."
2016-12-03T17:50:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Drivers warned to manually lock cars after thefts at service stations,"Drivers using motorway services are being warned to check their cars are secure after a spate of thefts believed to be linked to technology that stops them remotely locking. Thames Valley police said there had been 14 recent thefts from cars at motorway services in Berkshire and that in many cases there was “no obvious sign of a break-in and no damage caused to the vehicles as items were stolen from them”. It is believed that thieves may have used radio jammers, which can interrupt signals sent by a remote key, to steal from the vehicles undetected. Items including a laptop, suitcases and wallets have been stolen during the break-ins. Police have advised motorists to do a manual check before leaving their car unattended.
Sgt Alan Hawkett of Newbury police, said: “I strongly recommend that any members of the public visiting motorway services stations anywhere in the country keep all valuable items in their possession when away from their vehicle. “Offenders may be using technology to prevent your vehicle from locking, therefore we would advise a manual check of the doors before leaving your vehicle.” In December 2014, a 25-year-old man was convicted of using a signal jammer to break into cars in the Greater Manchester area. Michael Fennell used a signal jammer bought outside of the UK for just £35 to target central Manchester car parks. The jammer was used to prevent victims from locking their cars without their knowledge. Fennell simply opened the doors leaving no trace of the intrusion and leaving victims unaware that they had been targeted."
2016-12-03T19:49:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office keeps child refugees ‘in the dark’ about move to UK,"The Home Office has been accused of failing to provide sufficient information to child refugees from the demolished Calais camp, in what critics believe is a ploy to try to reduce the number of unaccompanied minors who are likely to enter the UK. Researchers who visited a series of reception centres in France, where children are being held as their UK applications are processed by Home Office officials, found many children had received insufficient information or none at all. Their findings, contained in a report by the charity Help Refugees, reveal that the approach had caused severe psychological distress among some youngsters in France, with incidents of self-harming and one child hospitalised. Some children had run away from reception centres. In a detailed 33-page report, volunteers for Help Refugees said: “It was clear from our observations that the Home Office was purposefully remaining silent on important issues that directly affected unaccompanied minors.”
The report, An Uncertain Future, said: “This lack of information was deeply distressing for unaccompanied minors who mostly remained in the dark about their chances of reaching the UK.” Liz Clegg of Help Refugees said: “Obviously, it suits them [the Home Office] because they have potentially less children to deal with. They never wanted to let these children into the UK in the first place.” Report co-author Benjamin Hunter said: “It’s a deliberate method of the Home Office getting what they want from the situation without factoring in the wellbeing of the minors.” Researchers visited 12 of the 85 centres in France last month, interviewing staff and unaccompanied minors. They often found that no basic information had been shared by the Home Office over how many minors would be accepted, or how and when they would be transferred to the UK. “This lack of information is causing visible mental distress among minors, some of whom are self-harming. The Home Office has offered no explanation for this. These minors are understandably confused, frustrated and losing faith in the system intended to protect them,” said the report.
One staff member at a centre in Auxonne, eastern France, said the lack of communication with the Home Office, which has six teams of officials touring the French reception centres, was causing distress. “There is no communication [with the Home Office], it’s a big problem for us and for them [the minors].” The sense of uncertainty has been compounded by uncertainty about when Home Office officials would visit with some children waiting four months despite witnessing other minors being registered and transferred to the UK in a week. The report documents how one bus carrying 29 child refugees was ready to leave for the UK at the end of October but was cancelled without explanation at the last minute. The children were then dispersed randomly to centres across France and have still not been told when they might be taken to the UK. Only one of the 12 centres visited had psychologists on staff, with the overall mental health support for children described as “notably deficient” in the report. The report said it knew of 28 youngsters who had left the 12 centres that were visited by the charity; the smallest holds six and the largest holds 51.
Clegg said: “I have spoken to some of the absconders, they have gone back to northern France and are sleeping in ditches, sleeping rough with nothing. They had biscuits on the first day, but that was it.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are continuing to work closely with the French government and other partners to identify unaccompanied asylum seeking children who may be eligible to come to the UK. “Our teams work to the highest professional standards with the aim of ensuring these children are transferred as soon as possible and arrive safely in the UK. “We have made significant progress in … speeding up the existing processes since the beginning of the year, but the primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French authorities.”"
2016-12-03T20:07:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Time running out to save Britain’s U-boat hunter from scrapyard,"HMS President has survived U-boat attacks, bombing raids, London smog and even parties of marauding Made In Chelsea stars. Yet now the submarine hunter, one of three that remain from the Royal Navy’s first world war fleet and the only one that fought in the first battle of the Atlantic, is destined to be scrapped unless its custodians can find £3m before January.
The money is needed to pay for major hull repairs and mooring fees on the Thames where the ship has been a London landmark since 1922, after retiring from its role of hunting U-boats while disguised as a merchant vessel. During the second world war it served as a London base for General de Gaulle’s French resistance. Its uncertain future was throwing doubt on plans to commemorate the Royal Navy’s efforts in the first world war, according to Paul Williams, the director of the HMS President Preservation Trust. Trustees will meet next week to find out how much it will cost to dismantle. “The No 1 agenda item is scrappage. We are at that point,” Williams said. “The ship’s supposed to be a centrepiece of the first world war commemorations in 2018. There’s very few sites in London where you can do that, particularly the role of the navy.” The trust has been turned down twice by the Heritage Lottery Fund, and a crowdfunding campaign has raised £20,000 – only enough to keep the campaign itself going. HMS President’s supporters had pinned hopes on the Treasury’s Libor fines fund, which channels penalties imposed on banks to military charities and related causes, but its application was rejected. “We were told the reason was that we hadn’t provided enough professional reports or competitive quotes,” Williams said. “But we had all that, and we offered them to the Treasury but they said they didn’t want them.” Last week, MPs including defence select committee chairman Julian Lewis, Tory Bob Stewart, and Labour’s Mike Gapes and Geoffrey Robinson wrote to David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, asking him to reconsider the “perplexing” decision. For now the ship remains decaying in a dry dock in Chatham, Kent, but the trust’s funds are running out. In March, the ship will need to be reinsured at a cost of about £20,000, but without major repairs to the hull the policy cannot be renewed.
HMS President was one of several hundred Q-ships commissioned as part of the response to the German imperial navy’s attempts to starve Britain of resources in what naval historian Dr Phil Weir describes as “the first battle of the Atlantic”. “The U-boat campaign in the first world war was monstrously effective,” Weir said. “It came closer to bringing Britain to defeat than the second world war version. Britain took its time in developing the right tactics to counter it, largely the convoy, which it didn’t do until mid-1917.” U-boats sank more than 12m tons of merchant shipping during the first world war, amounting to more than 5,000 vessels. Depth charges and rudimentary sonar were brought into service, alongside Q-ships including HMS President, which was launched as HMS Saxifrage in January 1918.
The Flower-class sloop, built by Lobnitz & Company in Renfrew on the River Clyde, was heavily disguised in an attempt to fool U-boat crews into thinking it was an unarmed freighter. U-boats often surfaced to attack, offering enemy crews the chance to abandon their ship before boarding and to scuttle their vessel with explosives, allowing the submarine to avoid the use of expensive torpedoes. Q-ships relied on this tactic to lure U-boats within range of their guns. The disguise included a fake rudder, casings to cover the guns and costumes for the sailors. Ratings and officers dressed as merchant seamen or civilians in an effort to trick the U-boat spotters."
2016-12-03T21:07:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Football abuse scandal grows with 55 clubs now involved,"More than 50 football clubs have now been named in allegations passed to police investigating child sex abuse, as the scandal continues to engulf the sport. Child protection sources within Operation Hydrant, the national police body coordinating historical sex abuse claims, have told the Observer that 55 professional and non-league clubs have so far been cited by players claiming they were abused. “We can confirm that 55 clubs in total have been referenced,” said a source at the National Police Chiefs’ Council, which coordinates Hydrant. Meanwhile, the NSPCC said it had received calls to its football abuse hotline alleging cases of continuing abuse, raising the risk that some children might currently be in danger. “We have had a few bits of information, allegations where children might be at risk now,” said John Cameron, the charity’s head of helplines. The development followed claims on Saturday that a former employee of Southampton football club accused of sexually abusing young players in the 1980s is still working in the sport. Chelsea, currently top of the Premier League, were forced to issue a statement following claims that the club insisted on a confidentiality clause in a settlement with an ex-player who said he had been sexually abused by a former chief scout at the club. Gary Johnson revealed that last year he had signed the confidentiality agreement and accepted a £50,000 payment after being repeatedly abused as a youth player in the 1970s by Eddie Heath, who died in the 1980s. Chelsea admitted that the confidentiality clause was, in retrospect, “inappropriate”. The club’s statement added that Johnson, 57, had told club officials that Heath had perpetrated abusive “relationships with other young boys/men from the club although no names were given to us”. It was clear “that Gary Johnson suffered unacceptably while in our employment in the 1970s for which the club apologises profusely”. The NSPCC said on Saturdayit expected the number of calls to its hotline, launched on 23 November, to pass 1,000. Cameron said he was “astonished” by the volume of men who had come forward after the Guardian revealed on 16 November how former player Andy Woodward endured sexual abuse as a youngster.
“It’s taken us totally by surprise, it’s an unprecedented event. We did not expect the demand that has come through. What’s special about this is that men are coming forward. We’ve had a real problem about getting men to talk about non-recent abuse or indeed young boys talking about current abuse,” said Cameron. In other developments, sources within Operation Hydrant – set up in 2014 – suggested that allegations of abuse relating to other sports had been received, although the “vast majority have come from the world of football”. On Thursday police said that 350 potential victims had come forward with a quarter of police forces confirming they are investigating reports of abuse in football and their priority was to identifying alleged offenders who may still pose a danger to children. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said that although the scale of the allegations had provoked a national debate it was important not to panic. “While our alarm about the scale of non-recent abuse is entirely justified, we should guard against the risk of marrying these revelations with a sense of hysteria that sees sex offenders lurking in every locker room and on every sports pitch,” he said. “However, there is no room for complacency and we need to know that our children are as safe as they can be.” New analysis of calls to the charity’s helpline shows that more than 90% of calls to the football hotline concerned non-recent abuse. Women’s football had not featured in any of the allegations. Cameron said that may be because its popularity was comparably modest during the 90s, 80s and 70s when the majority of the abuse is alleged to have taken place. So far several clubs including Newcastle, Manchester City and Crewe have launched inquiries into how they handled allegations of abuse, or coaches who turned out to be offenders. More than 20 former players have so far come forward to speak out. On Saturday, the England men’s and women’s captains, Wayne Rooney and Steph Houghton, followed Alan Shearer and other prominent football figures in urging players to come forward. The NSPCC hotline is available 24 hours a day on 0800 023 2642"
2016-12-03T22:14:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Cycling on Vauxhall Bridge: a return visit and some new statistics,"On Monday I stood on Vauxhall Bridge counting cyclists. Sad but true. I did the same thing almost exactly a year ago following a startling radio station row about how many people were using the newly-opened, two-way cycle superhighway, CS5, to cross the bridge and how many weren’t bothering. My return last week was in order to see what might have changed in the ensuing 12 months. Was CS5 being used more or less? Had the overall number of cyclists crossing the bridge increased or reduced? Were cyclists behaving differently? The cycle superhighway (CS) in question is on the eastern side of the bridge. During the first bitterly cold half hour I spent on the bridge on a Tuesday morning last November, I counted 98 cyclists - a rate of 196 per hour - crossing the bridge on its western side. Almost all were heading north into central London, as you would expect during the morning peak travel period, and made their way through the motorised traffic into the bus lane. During that half hour, hardly any cyclists took advantage of the signalised crossing provided for them on the southern approach to the bridge to get over to CS5 and make use of that bespoke facility for crossing the bridge. For the next bitterly cold half hour, still in the morning peak, I counted the cyclists who did use CS5. There were 265 of them - a rate of 530 per hour - again, almost all heading north. This was less than might have been expected in view of a press release issued near that time which said that “in the busiest peak more than 750 cyclists are already using the new dedicated segregated lane”, a number supplied by no less an authority than Boris Johnson’s cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan. Adding up the figures for cycle traffic on both sides of the road made a grand total of 726 cyclists per hour. So what about late November 2016? Again, the morning weather was cold, though not as cold as it had been the previous year. The first difference I notice was that the number of cyclists heading north who used the bus lane side of the bridge during my 30-minute count was much smaller - just 27, a rate of 54 per hour compared with 196 per hour in late November 2015. But it quickly became apparent that something else had changed which could partly account for this. The number of cyclists approaching Vauxhall Bridge from the western, Wandsworth side who chose to used the signalised road crossing, make their way over to CS5 and cross the bridge using the segregated lane was much higher. In fact, exactly the same number chose to do that as chose not to - a very different picture from a year before, when almost none crossed the road at that point. I then made my way over to CS5 and conducted a half hour count there, again still during the morning peak. Between 07:45 and 08:15 I saw 380 cyclists, a rate of 760 per hour - a very substantial 230 more than had used it during my equivalent November 2015 count. Of these, the vast majority were heading north, though a significant 57 were heading south. Adding up the total number of cyclists on both sides of the road during the morning peak produced a grand total of 814 cyclists an hour - 88 more per hour than on a chillier morning a year before, with a larger proportion of them using CS5 and many more taking the time to cross the approach road to the bridge to make use of it. Late that afternoon, I returned to Vauxhall Bridge and again counted the cyclists using CS5. Between 17:20 and 17:50, which falls into the 16:30-18:30 busiest period for London road traffic at that end of the day, 349 cyclists went by - an hourly rate of 698 per hour - considerably fewer than the 760 per hour that had used CS5 during the morning peak. I didn’t count how many cyclists took the north-bound bus lane option on the other side of the bridge at that time because I had to be somewhere else but, assuming that at that end of day there would have been very few of them (remember, there were only 27 during my 30-minute the morning peak vigil), it means the total number of cyclists on Vauxhall Bridge during that period was a lower than it had been in the morning. That might seem odd - it seems reasonable to expect that cyclists heading towards the centre in the morning will commute back by the same route at the end of the day. But, in fact, a Transport for London (TfL) report on the performance of its cycling programmes, considered by its programmes and investment committee on Wednesday, confirms that the evening peak numbers using CS5 on Vauxhall Bridge are indeed lower than the morning peak ones, as they are on the CS routes along Victoria Embankment, and Blackfriars Bridge, according to initial counts (see paragraph 6.30). The same paper says that the numbers of cyclists using the CS at those three locations have risen by 73% (Vauxhall Bridge), 54% (Victoria Embankment) and 55% (Blackfriars Bridge) compared with “pre-construction figures”. My figures for Vauxhall Bridge should be viewed with circumspection - there would have to be a lot more counting over many more days than I could spare to get a really reliable numerical picture - but they at least indicate that numbers there have continued to go up since CS5 was opened too. How good is this news? An obvious yardstick is the policy objectives set out in Johnson’s 2013 Vision for Cycling in London, which announced the CS programme and its goals. The third of its four “key outcomes” was: More people travelling by bike. Cycling across London will double in the next 10 years. We will “normalise” cycling, making it something anyone feels comfortable doing. Hundreds of thousands more people, of all ages, races and backgrounds, and in all parts of London, will discover that the bike has changed their lives. If my Vauxhall Bridge count reflects the true picture, then the total number of cyclists crossing the bridge - including those eschewing CS5 for doing so - has risen by at least 10% in the past year and is therefore on course to double after ten (though, of course, it will have to increase at the same rate everywhere else in the metropolis to live up to the Vision’s assertion). What about the demographic spread the Vision aspires to? At present, young, white, male professionals predominate in London’s cycling population, for a range of interesting reasons. Of course, my mini-survey couldn’t ascertain what jobs the cyclists do. However, I can report that only about 30% were female, most looked pretty youthful and only a handful were not white, so there looks to still be some work to be done if cycling is to appeal to those groups of Londoners less inclined to take it up. Can this be achieved through infrastructure alone? That TfL report picks up some further issues too. It notes (paragraph 6:31) an initial survey finding that cycle flows on CS5 as a whole “are around 85% lower outside of the peak periods”. As the report also notes, this huge drop reflects the CS routes covering “key commuter corridors” and also “cycle flows throughout central London” but it raises the value-for-money question of how to increase their use during the heart of the London day. Then there is the matter of increased motorised road traffic congestion. The TfL report says (paragraph 6:15) that on the CS5 route, inbound journey times for motor vehicles in the morning peak were 15-20 minutes long before the CS was constructed and that the range has narrowed to approximately 20 minutes, while journey times in the evening peak are now 15 minutes having been “just less” than that prior to the CS works beginning. TfL seem pleased with this, given that a lane for motor traffic has been removed, though the story not so happy eastbound in the evenings on the route of the east-west superhighway, where the report says journey times have risen between five and 15 minutes. The problem with long motor traffic delays it that they are bad for air quality - these may represent a perverse outcome for London, given that promoting cycling is integral to TfL’s ambition to improve Londoners’ health. The new mayor, Sadiq Khan, says he is committed to making cycling safer and easier and has said he will learn lessons from mistakes he thinks his predecessor made. Me, I’ve pencilled in a date to visit Vauxhall Bridge around this time next year. Still sad. Still true."

2016-12-04T14:56:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Barking and Dagenham: Darren Rodwell's 'aspirational working class',"When visiting Barking and Dagenham it is possible for Londoners from different parts of town to imagine that they have slipped back in time. That’s partly about architecture, because this piece of the eastern suburb mosaic, slotted between Newham, Redbridge, Essex-minded Havering and the north side of the Thames, is still so visually synonymous with the 30,000 homes of the famous Becontree estate, a huge public housing development, conceived, in the words of Municipal Dreams, “in the brief, post-Great War coupling of hope and fear. Homes fit for heroes and the concern that those very heroes might succumb to Bolshevism in 1919”. It’s also about accents: the London style of speech cemented in national sentiment by apples, pears and the spirit of the Blitz, but now getting scarce in Shoreditch, still greets the ear pretty often round here, including in the Town Hall. And then there’s attitude, which is where Barking and Dagenham can be misunderstood. I asked council leader Darren Rodwell if he thinks the borough has an image problem. “Absolutely,” he says. “It’s that we’re white racists who work at Fords. But that is snobbery. The reality is, we’ve got one of the best communities in London – if not the best.” Another, and indisputable, part of Barking and Dagenham’s reality is that, contrary to any impression of its being suspended in some by-passed London yesterday, it is going through truly profound change and has been for at least as long as the local authority has existed. “For most of the life of the borough the council has had to cope with the consequences of de-industrialisation,” writes Tony Travers in his indispensable London’s Boroughs at 50. He describes the need to re-train the local workforce and attract new sources of employment as “a continuous challenge” in an area with a long tradition of young people leaving school early and going straight into jobs of a type that used to be on their own doorsteps but aren’t any more. For 70 years the giant Ford production plant Rodwell referred to was Dagenham’s employment core and community anchor. It cranked out its first vehicles in 1931, a few years before the completion of the great Becontree “new town”, and grew into a vast production line of motor-Americana whose legendary livery loomed above the A13. In 2002, all but a small bit of it closed. In the meantime, Barking and Dagenham’s population had altered greatly. And during this century its shifts have been, to use the council’s word, “unprecedented”. According to the 2011 census it rose by 22,000 during the preceding ten years, an increase of 13.4%. It grew radically younger during that period too and more ethnically mixed than it had ever been. Human turnover has been huge. All of this has required adjustments, stirred anxieties and presented an electoral opportunity to the British National Party, which it seized by winning eleven seats in the borough elections of 2006. Labour stayed in control, as it has ever since 1964. But it was stung into mounting a sustained counter attack, which saw Margaret Hodge hold her Barking parliamentary seat in 2010, crushing BNP leader Nick Griffin in the process. The BNP presence on the council was ended at the borough elections held on the same day. They haven’t made a comeback. Rodwell, though, seems well alive to why some of the borough’s residents made them briefly strong. “We’ve got a 12th century church, a 14th century pub and a 17th century vicarage,” he said, driving me through the Dagenham Village conservation area. “They decimated it in the 1960s and 1970s.” He pointed out of the window: “That was my nan’s place, there.” Further on, we reached an industrial site where the May and Baker pharmaceutical company used to be. “Great people who worked there,” Rodwell remarked. “If it hadn’t been for them we wouldn’t have had Winston Churchill.” That’s because the drug that did wonders for his bacterial pneumonia in 1942 was invented there. Moving on, Rodwell, took us past a health and fitness club (“When it was built, this was the Sterling machine gun factory”) and then we were in the heart of Barking , served by Bobby Moore Way (no commentary required). There was a purpose behind highlighting these landmarks of history. “I can’t say to people that we can keep the streets the same as they were when I was growing up,” said Rodwell, 46. “And nor do I want to. There were some good bits about it and some not so good bits. When I was a lad growing up here we didn’t have 137 different cultures. We have today. Now, some of that is good. Some of that, people will say, is not so good. Some people are concerned by it. If they are people who don’t want to move along with that change in society, then we can only support them the best we can. We can’t make them want to change and I understand the anxiety. But, actually, a hundred years ago, none of this was here.” By “this” Rodwell meant, well, nearly everything standing in the area today, including a great deal of the council housing that went up in the decades after the Becontree was completed, especially that constructed after World War II. He isn’t sentimental about it. “As I see it, people deserve better than this,” he remarked of one cluster of homes put together in the years when Moore was at his footballing peak. Of the council housing in general constructed during that era, when Labour and Conservative national governments competed to get the most built, he says: “It was good for its time. It was good for the working classes that came out of the slums of London and for the immigrants that came over from Ireland or Eastern Europe, which we had a lot of.” But now: “Historically, the problem with the borough is we’ve only had one type of housing, which was for one type of community. We were the subservient workforce of Fords and other industries.” This, Rodwell believes, militated against openness and ambition. “You didn’t have to be educated, and you didn’t have to aspire to want to do better. It was all laid on a plate for you. That’s a safe place to be - when you’re being told what to do, when to go on holiday, how to live your life. You’re cradled. Well, we’re not in that world any more. And after eight decades, in my opinion, it led to the BNP.” Before becoming a councillor, Rodwell had worked for the charity DABD as an adviser and advocate for benefits claimants. He became Barking and Dagenham leader in May 2014. It was just after the council elections of that year in which Labour repeated its clean sweep of 2010, dashing the hopes of Ukip, by then seen as its main challenger, even though the borough would become one of just five out of 32 where voters wanted to leave the EU. Rodwell told his local paper he would promote “social responsibility” in the borough and make “community” his main focus. He also pledged to do all he could to combat the effects of government cuts, labelling the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition the “worst disaster”. There is a stress on education too. Coventry University is to set up a campus in Dagenham Civic Centre next year and offer courses in accountancy, engineering, policing, It and more. The Rodwell recipe is a distinctive combination of protective innovation and a desire to foster change from within, articulated as an independent, working-class philosophy. “I don’t class myself as a politician,” he said. “I class myself as a community champion. The job of the council is to facilitate where the community wants to go, and then to get the investment in, whether it be public or private. As long as I do that, as long as I get that right, I don’t need any posh people with letters after their names and bank balances to prove it telling me how I or the rest of the community should live our lives. It’s really, really simple.” Rodwell’s housing policies demonstrate his beliefs and approach. Last year, Barking and Dagenham became a private sector landlord by buying a block of newly-built flats and creating its own company, Barking and Dagenham Reside, to manage them. Some of the properties are for social rent, others are for people who will never qualify for it but can’t afford to buy and are priced at 80% of local market rates. Rodwell deputy Saima Ashraf, who is also the council’s cabinet member for community leadership and engagement, called it “a win-win for our council, taxpayers, residents and Generation Rent”. Conservative London Assembly member Andrew Boff, a local resident, praised it as “fantastic”. Rodwell says the council’s private rented homes begin at levels affordable to people on the London Living Wage: “On £19,000 a year you can get a one-bedroom flat.” The next big innovation, introduced earlier this year, bestowed on traditional secure council tenants a “right to invest”. It enables them to convert to shared ownership by purchasing between 25% and 70% of the home they live in. The mechanism gives people who cannot afford to exercise their right to buy a financial stake in their homes without the council losing its stock. It was also designed to protect tenants against the government’s planned “pay-to-stay” policy, now dropped, which would have entailed tenants with incomes above a certain level having their rents raised. If occupants want to sell their share of their home, the council will get first refusal. Rodwell says he has “no problem with people wanting to better their lifestyles, but it shouldn’t be done the way it’s being done at the moment - at a cost to the wider community”. In contrast to Right to Buy, he sees “right to invest” as another means of nurturing aspiration and community stability at the same time. It’s an aspect of his desire to increase tenure mix, of which he is an uncomplicated advocate. Barking and Dagenham has high levels of social housing, a category whose definition in Rodwell’s mind includes buy-to-let properties where other councils place people from their waiting lists. For him, this adds to the weight of sustaining neighbourhoods containing a lot of people on low incomes. “That’s two-thirds of the borough,” Rodwell says. “When you’ve got 70% on some form of benefit, you’ve got to get greater diversity. Without it, you get seen as a dumping ground of London. That’s not good for the residents here, or those who are placed here. We need to support people here that want to progress. You’ve got to make sure of is that we can still build homes for the aspirational working class.” There’s also that legacy of poorly-built post-war housing to keep on dealing with. After collecting me from Dagenham East station Rodwell took me to Dagenham’s nearby Leys estate, where he was shown around by people from developer Mulalley. It was not the Leys built in the 1960s. In 2009, the council received a petition from its residents, asking for delayed improvement work under Labour’s Decent Homes programme to be carried out. The council lacked the cash and decided to redevelop. In March 2013, bulldozers moved in. Phase one of the work is now complete. Of the 89 new homes, 19 are for market sale and the other 70 for affordable rent, half at 50% of local market rents, half at 65%. Phase two will produce another 69 homes, all for rent at much the same split. They are tenure blind and renters on the old estate are entitled to return. It’s another Reside project. Rodwell is pleased with the quality of the work: “I look at it really, really simple. Regeneration today should be the heritage of tomorrow. The Becontree estate was built in 12 years. We will soon celebrate its hundredth year. Why? Because it was good quality housing with the infrastructure required to make a community. And it’s made a very good community.” At first, you couldn’t get a house on the Becontree unless you had a job. Today’s contemptuous stereotypes of council house tenants could not have taken hold in those days. I asked Rodwell if he regards his promotion of mixed tenure as a way of restoring a mixture of residents on estates that Barking and Dagenham has largely lost. “Agreed. Yes. Exactly that,” he replied. “What you want is what you’ve just seen at the Leys. There will be a complete mix of people who are hard-working Barking and Dagenham Londoners, who have pride in the job they do, but who will never have the same amount of money as people who can afford to buy. Why should they have anything less?” At the Town Hall, Rodwell is happy to be photographed beside the portrait of the Queen that hangs on his office wall. Five years ago, he accepted her invitation to attend her garden party in recognition of his charity work. Last year, the monarch visited the borough as part of its 50th anniversary celebrations and was entertained by the legendary Dagenham Girl Pipers and Iqra Zaman, a 16-year-old self-taught pianist. Rodwell doesn’t mind who knows of his affection for the chief royal or the nation’s great arts institutions and cultural sites. He wants access to these to be free for UK citizens, but not for tourists, welcome though they are: “Make ‘em pay.” He outlined another part of his vision for his borough’s evolution - encouraging local arts and culture. “For 80 years, high art was a Saturday night down the working men’s club,” he said. “But we have to be individuals. We have to stretch the mindset of what we can achieve and where we can go. People in Barking and Dagenham deserve what you get in Westminster. They deserve it because they’ve worked for it. There are people here who’ve wanted to express themselves for so long, but they were not allowed to because we had a conformist community.”
Local planning policy seeks to provide low cost ground floor spaces and work-live units for local artists and their small businesses. “We can adapt those for artists, micro-breweries, that sort of stuff,” Rodwell said. There are grander ambitions too. A year ago, the council spent £12m buying land on a local industrial site to pursue his aim of getting a film studio built there. The area has provided locations for big budget film and TV productions in recent years. Rodwell senses an opportunity. “Investors know we’re an ambitious council determined to realise the benefits of the creative industries for our economy and residents,” he told the Barking and Dagenham Post. London mayor Sadiq Khan joined him for a photo-op. He dropped by again in October: “In the 20th century Dagenham was known for Fords. In the 21st-century I think it can be known for film,” he said. It seemed only right and proper to pull his leg: next thing he knew, I said, his “aspirational working class” Barking and Dagenham would be over-run with bicycling Guardian readers craving fancy coffee and organic veg; gentrification is already re-making Plaistow and Manor Park; the tide will crash upon Rodwell’s shores soon enough and neighbourhoods will go to the dogs. “I have no problem with those people coming into the borough,” Rodwell replied, “as long as I can sit next to them reading the Mirror.” He points out that artists and small-scale brewers would be nothing new in the territory: “This was a Saxon space of innovation. I want to bring that ambition back.” Organic veg needn’t be out of place either: “We’ve got more allotments than any other London council. We’ve got a community growing space. So all this yuppie gentrification is actually, if you really want, going back in time to what the working class used to do. You’d have a hundred foot garden, split it up into three: a third for the animal, a third for the allotment and a third for the kids. That’s a very working class land use.” What matters, he explained, is that “the people already here get the same opportunities to develop themselves instead of being priced out. We as a council are doing our utmost to make sure that doesn’t happen. Those live-work spaces, there will be a lower and an upper income stream for them. So once you’re established you won’t need that space any more and it can be passed on to the next aspirational working-class person.” Rodwell’s distinction between gentrification, a transforming affluence from without, and aspiration, a transforming force from within, seems to capture his approach to the challenges of dealing with change that are faced be so many London boroughs in different ways. “What I want to see is true aspiration,” he says. “Because actually it’s the working class that normally, in the past, has given London its vibrancy. If you look at the arts, if you look at culture, if you look at music, architecture, any of it, it’s normally come from them.” Earlier, we’d visited Barking Riverside, a vast stretch of Thames-side ex-industrial land that will eventually be home to 10,000 households (and the subject of separate article before too long). For now, the small part that’s been completed is a bit of a lost village, waiting to be found by long-awaited public transport links. But it is, nonetheless, part of the future of London as it pulses and grows and its centre of gravity shifts further east. Across the wide, grey river, in Bexley and Greenwich you can see the new Thamesmead too taking shape. East London is entering its latest stage of unending transition. There will be good change and bad change and all sorts that fall somewhere between. Darren Rodwell is but one among the many who will help to define the forms it takes. He knows what he wants. He also knows what he wants to avoid. “You imagine a house with local government as its foundations. Local government has been eroded for decades and when you erode the foundations, the pillars start to shake. Now, what are the four pillars? The first pillar is housing. The second pillar is education. The third pillar is the welfare state and the fourth pillar is the NHS. Let’s look at those four pillars. Housing? We built what we could and we built a lot of it for everyone and that was really important. You know, they went through a world war. The second thing was a right to a good education, up to university. Well, we’ve nearly privatised our education. That’s a disgrace. Thirdly, the welfare state. No one should ever starve in this country. How can it be right that we went from one food bank here to 12 in a matter of five years? That’s not good policy. That’s very bad policy. And the last one is the NHS. Well, do we have to talk about how that’s on its knees? So the foundations are eroded, the four pillars are shaking, and then we wonder why the roof of Europe falls in. “I want a society where if Mrs Jones hasn’t collected her milk for a few days, a neighbour will know that Mrs Jones hasn’t collected her milk. What an indictment of our society when a local authority doesn’t know Mrs Jones hasn’t collected her milk, the neighbours don’t know Mrs Jones hasn’t collected her milk and her family that lives wherever they live hasn’t noticed either. That’s a really sad indictment of 21st century Britain.” This article was updated on 6 December 2016 to include the council’s plans for building a film studio."
2016-12-04T21:40:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman confirmed dead after being pulled from sea off Cornish coast,"A holidaymaker has died after being pulled from the sea off the coast of Cornwall. Police said the 36-year-old woman was on a break with her family and friends in the seaside village of Polzeath. Her body was discovered after a search operation was launched on Sunday morning when she was reported missing at around 10am. After being pulled from the sea she was taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital, formerly known as Treliske hospital, in Truro but was confirmed dead on arrival. The search operation involved officers from the force, a coastguard helicopter based in Newquay and RNLI crews from Padstow and Rock. A spokesman for the RNLI said that their lifeboats launched at 10.30am and carried out a shoreline search from Pentire Point to Daymer Bay as well as an investigation of the Camel estuary. He told Cornwall Live: “After directions from a member of the public who was viewing from the shore, Rock lifeboat recovered a casualty who was then transferred to Padstow lifeboat, before being taken by coastguard helicopter to Treliske.” He added that the lifeboats were returned to their station by 11.45am. Devon and Cornwall police said they are investigating the circumstances of her death on behalf of the coroner and that her family have been informed. A spokesman said: “At approximately 10am on Sunday 4 December, police received a call regarding a missing 36-year-old female who was on holiday in Polzeath with her family and friends. A coastal search commenced involving police, coastguard and lifeboat. A female was located and recovered from the sea by Rock lifeboat, and conveyed to Treliske hospital. “Tragically the female was confirmed as deceased on arrival. Police are continuing enquiries into the circumstances of her death on behalf of the coroner. The family have been notified.”"
2016-12-04T21:47:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Southampton FC trainer named in connection with abuse allegations,"A former youth development officer at Southampton Football Club has been named in connection with allegations of historical sexual abuse of children. Bob Higgins worked with youngsters at the club, which is renowned for its youth system, in the 1980s. He ran respected football academies and was recently working for Fleet Town FC on an “informal unpaid basis”. The BBC said it had spoken to six players who had named Higgins to police. The Hampshire force is understood to be investigating but has refused to confirm this. Fleet’s chairman Steve Cantle said that Mr Higgins was not police checked in 2012 as his role did not involve working with children. He added the club had received no notification from either the Football Association or the police about allegations made about anyone involved at the club, but would co-operate fully in any investigation. Southampton FC also said it was “committed to working together” with police to investigate any historical allegations. The revelations are the latest blow to a game that is reeling over a spiralling child abuse scandal that began when former professional Andy Woodward told the Guardian he was abused by a coach as a child. At least 18 police forces across Britain are investigating allegations made by 350 alleged victims. The NSPCC said it had received and was processing almost 1,000 reports to a hotline. Chelsea launched its own inquiry after former player Gary Johnson revealed he had signed a confidentiality agreement with the club in 2015 in return for £50,000 after he alleged he was abused by the club’s then chief scout, Eddie Heath, in the 1970s. In a statement issued at the weekend, the Premier League club said it was clear Johnson had “suffered unacceptably” and that the club had “no desire to hide any historic abuse we uncover from view”. The game’s governing body in England, the Football Association, has launched an inquiry and several top players, including the England captain, Wayne Rooney, have urged children and parents to speak out if they have any concerns about abuse. Higgins was a powerful figure in Southampton’s youth set-up in the 80s and worked with a number of players who have become household names. Former players who have alleged they were abused at Southampton include Dean Radford, from Bristol, who used to stay over on the south coast when he was a youth player there. Radford told the BBC: “You don’t live every day of your life crying your eyes out and walking around with your head down, you get on with life as normal, but you still have it there, it’s buried there deep, and it comes up, and it will keep coming up for the rest of my life.” Higgins was charged with sexual offences against boys in 1992 but cleared on the direction of a judge. In 1997, the BBC reported, letters were sent to clubs warning them about him. Police and social workers said they believed “Mr Higgins poses a risk to children”, the BBC reported. Former Southampton and England striker Alan Shearer, now an NSPCC ambassador, praised the bravery of those who had come forward. He said: “They will need to be given our support so as they can get the help they need and should have had years ago.” The Guardian has not been able to contact Higgins for comment."
2016-12-04T22:23:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Judging the Casey review: 'I'm sick of being told I don't get on with people',"It’s Friday – Jumah – the busiest day for mosques and the shutters come up on the haberdashery shops lining Stratford Road in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham, their windows filled with fabrics of deeply vibrant colours. Families and young people dip into the street’s many takeaways and restaurants to avoid the damp, cold weather and to warm up with a spicy traditional Asian meal.
Among them is Parveen Akhtar, out enjoying a celebratory dinner with her sister. Akhtar is a 38-year-old mother-of-three who has just been given a permanent position as a Birmingham city council social worker. Born in the UK and a practising Muslim, she argues that there is a lack of equality for all women, not just Muslim women, and questions the timing of Dame Louise Casey’s report on community cohesion, as well as its substance. “These studies are not a true representation of what is actually happening in society,” she says. “They come here [to Birmingham], go to the worst areas and then tell their bosses they have seen a trend and write a report which gets into the papers and creates even more hostility for us. “What reports like this don’t take into account is our culture – most Muslim women want to be at home with their children. Nobody is making them do this, this is what they want. Many are also carers for elderly relatives as we do not put them in homes. “If a white woman, or even somebody like me who is Muslim but relatively westernised, said we want to stay at home with our kids it would be fine. We would be doing the best for our children. Yet when a woman who has poor English says it then she is all of a sudden trying not to integrate and she is doing something wrong.” Akhtar says she is “sick of being told I’m not getting on with people who are not like me” and admits to deliberately going out of her way to change that perception. “You know what I’ve been doing recently?” she asks. “When I’m in a shopping centre, if a see a white person sat on a bench I go and sit next to them and talk to them. I try and engage them. It’s funny really: they must think I’m mad. But we are integrating – maybe not to the level that the government wants, but we get on with each other.” Before compiling her report, Casey twice visited the headquarters of Muslim Women’s Network UK – a charity chaired by Shaista Gohir OBE, which offers specialised help and support to women on issues from domestic violence and mental health to abortion. At her home in Yardley Wood, Birmingham, Gohir – a full-time mother-of-three who is also a physics and chemistry graduate – says Casey’s report has come out at a time when race relations are brittle but she would rather it were published than buried for fear of causing upset. “She is not really saying anything new. We agree that people not mixing with each other can lead to prejudice and intolerance but this is a two-way street. It is not just Muslims who are not integrating that well – there are pockets in every ethnicity: Sikhs, Hindus, Jews.” The charity’s executive director, Faeeza Vaid, adds: “What this report does not take into account is the national migration patterns. When people move to this country they want to feel comfortable, have access to food which is familiar to them and be near family. So inevitably they end up living near people who are similar to them. “This was the first generation though. The second and third generations are far more integrated. They go to university, get an education, move away.” Both women are passionate about their communities and defend them against the charge that English language skills “continue to be a barrier for some”, according to the report. “There [is] a generation of women who do not speak English but it is because they are incredibly family-orientated and they are bringing up the next generation of doctors, lawyers, dentists. It would be interesting to see if the mothers of Baroness Syeedi Warsi, Naz Shah MP and Mayor Sadiq Khan spoke English,” says Vaid.
Gohir directs us towards a Pakistani community worker, Snouber Sharif. The 42-year-old mother-of-three runs a weekly empowerment session for women from all ethnicities in the predominantly Pakistani Alum Rock area of Birmingham. Her morning has been busy – she has handed out dozens of food parcels and we arrive as she is packing up the leftovers at another project – a weekly community food project in St Peter’s college. Sharif wears a baby-pink jersey with the name of her community group – Women Empowering Women – emblazoned across the back, over her traditional Pakistani dress. She paid off her mortgage after tapping into the online shopping market and now runs the group full-time after she experienced what she describes as a void in her life. “It is not up to anybody else to empower you, to get you to do things, achieve: that is up to yourself,” she said. “A lot of it with these women is laziness. I don’t agree that they are segregated and that makes them some sort of victim. They need to get out there and find a job.” As Sharif finishes making her point, a Pakistani woman walks into the hall. Sharif barks at her, pointing at the woman: “Here you go, here’s an example for you. Why don’t you work?” The woman replies. “I am a carer for three people: my child, my elderly mother and another elderly relative,” she says. “That should be enough shouldn’t it?” • This footnote was added on 8 December 2016. After publication, Snouber Sharif pointed out that she knew the woman she addressed, did not intend to speak aggressively and would not have been understood that way by the woman. Details about her community work have been corrected."
2016-12-05T07:00:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"Brexit could draw more criminals to the UK, says police chief","Britain could become more attractive to foreign criminals after the UK leaves the EU, one of the country’s most senior police officers has warned. Steve Ashman, chief constable of Northumbria police, dismissed the argument of many of those who campaigned to leave the bloc that Britain’s departure would lead to a reduction in foreign criminals operating in the UK. He added that he would be very concerned if Brexit meant UK police could no longer apply for a European arrest warrant (EAW) or have access to surveillance and information-sharing systems from their European counterparts.
“I think if you lose the ability to extradite people effectively then one might also argue that that’s going to make us quite attractive to a particular criminal group,” he told the Guardian. “I think we are always going to have a problem with foreign national offenders. What’s important to me – and, I think, what’s important for UK law enforcement – is that we have effective and efficient means of dealing with them when they are here. Because I think we are dreaming if we think the position is ever going to be arrived at when there are no foreign national offenders in this country.” Asked if he could see any policing benefits to Brexit, Ashman paused for 18 seconds and said: “There’s your answer.” Much of his force area, which serves a population of 1.5 million people and covers an area of more than 2,000 square miles in the north-east, voted to leave the EU. Only Newcastle, with its large student population, voted to stay, by a narrow 1% margin. Ashman said the government must acknowledge that membership of the EU had brought real policing benefits: “We have benefited from our access to information from our European counterparts, our ability to form joint investigation teams where you have cross-border criminal behaviour and our ability to secure European arrest warrants.” “[These] are clearly working and have worked for a number of years. I would have some real concerns if we were to walk away from or tear up those agreements,” he said.
The EAW, which came into operation in 2004, allows for the speedy extradition of suspects from one European country to another to face trial or serve a prison sentence. More than 900 suspected serious criminals, including paedophiles, rapists and murderers, have been extradited either in or out of this country, thanks to the EAW. The mechanism was used in the case of Hussain Osman, who was wanted in connection with the 21 July 2005 attempted London bombings. Extradited from Italy in September 2005, he was subsequently sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of 40 years. In September the home secretary Amber Rudd was asked what discussions she had had with her international counterparts on the UK’s continued participation in the EAW. She said: “Officials are exploring options for future cooperation arrangements once the UK has left the European Union. We will do what is necessary to keep people safe, but it would be wrong to set out unilateral positions before that negotiation has taken place.” Ashman said he was not surprised that the north-east voted to leave. “It is a matter of fact that we are a long way from London – we are further than anyone from London – and it is very easy to see why communities here have become quite disaffected with government and that’s irrespective of which colour government it is. But in particular, in recent years, the public service cuts that have been suffered here are far, far, far worse than anywhere else in the country. So as the chief constable of the sixth largest force in England and Wales, I’ve taken the biggest hit because we were the most heavily dependent upon the government grant.” Northumbria police saw a sharp rise in reports of religious or racially motivated race crime after the Brexit vote. Internal force statistics shared exclusively with the Guardian show that in Sunderland, which voted 61.3% in favour of Brexit, there was a 50% increase in racist/faith crimes recorded from 24 June, the day after the vote, to 21 November. This year there were 132 such crimes, compared with 88 in the same period in 2015.
Three times as many eastern Europeans reported abuse: 27, compared with nine in 2015. People of Afro-Caribbean and Asian origin also reported more hate crimes than last year (14 and 42 respectively, compared with 10 and 36 in 2015). Examples of these crimes included a Polish woman and her son being told “go back to Poland”; a foreign national being told “why are you here? We’re out of Europe now” after challenging someone who pushed in a queue; and the word “Paki” being scratched into the paintwork of a convenience store. Just 3.6% of Sunderland residents were born outside the UK, according to the 2011 census. But Michal Chantowski, a Pole who runs the International Community Organisation of Sunderland, said he believed the true migrant population of the city was nearer 10%. He said there had been a “clear increase” in hate crime in Sunderland since the Brexit vote."
2016-12-05T08:43:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Cumbria residents still counting cost of Storm Desmond a year on,"When the river Eden swept into Angela and Ian Burrow’s house uninvited one night last December, they resigned themselves to spending the festive period in a rented flat paid for by the insurance company. But not in their wildest, darkest fears did they ever anticipate a second Christmas Day away from their smallholding outside Crosby-on-Eden, five miles from Carlisle. Yet that is their miserable reality, along with at least 700 other families across Cumbria, whose homes are still uninhabitable a year after being battered by the brutal triumvirate of Storms Desmond, Eva and Frank last December, which flooded 16,000 properties across the UK. Record volumes of rain fell on land already saturated from a soggy autumn, causing rivers to swell so much that the Burrows found a pregnant cow at the golf course at the bottom of their garden which had been carried 20 miles down the Eden from her farm near the village of Great Salkeld.
The family had only moved to their dream home three years before Desmond destroyed the ground floor, wiped out their large vegetable patch and killed seven bee colonies in the garden. On Thursday yet another surveyor had come to inspect the ravaged interior, the walls of the 19th century red stone house only recently replastered, bare lightbulbs strung in a rudimentary circuit. The latest set of builders say they will be done in three weeks. The Burrows do not believe it, but know that come mid-January the insurers will stop paying the rent at the two-bedroom flat they have been crammed into with their teenagers for the past year. They were insured for flooding, but like many victims have been deeply unhappy with the work the insurer’s contractors have carried out. “I ended up on antidepressants because of the stress of it all,” said Angie, a bookkeeper. The couple’s 13-year-old son has also suffered anxiety and depression, she added.
He is not alone. On Monday, the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, a children’s book about the floods will be launched at the newly rebuilt village hall in Crosby to alleviate the fears and uncertainties felt by those affected by flooding. Susan Fox, the author of Joe and Storm Desmond, wrote the book in the wreckage of her home in Crosby as she struggled to clear up after her fourth flood. The cost to Cumbria of Storm Desmond, the first and worst of last year’s winter storms as far as that county was concerned, is estimated at £500m or more. But as a report from the Carlisle Flood Action Group, a local pressure group, points out, the damage is not just financial: “The human cost of the storm and its aftermath is similarly incalculable. The effect of evacuation and displacement on physical and mental health, with lives put on hold, was significant and remains so for many.” Getting around Cumbria remains a trial for many. Across the county three bridges were washed away, with 554 more damaged. So far just 130 have been mended, with eight still closed to traffic a year on.
Warwick Road in Carlisle, which turned into a river when Desmond hit on 5 December, is open but still some way from back to normal. Blue ribbons tied to trees and lamp-posts commemorate the high water mark of 2 metres from when the river Petteril topped nearby Botcherby Bridge, causing water to back up on the wrong side of the flood defences. Billy Bone, who has owned the Foreways Convenience Store for 29 years, says his takings are two-thirds down, year on year. He lost all of his stock when floodwaters invaded, reaching the top shelf of the magazine rack at the storm’s peak.
Claire’s Bakery is still squatting in a caravan in front of the flooded shop, the carpet store has moved all its non-ruined stock upstairs and dozens of houses are either still empty, midway through renovation or up for auction. According to Keith Little, a Cumbria county councillor, some people can’t face moving back and so are cutting their losses. Others have in effect decided to live upstairs in case another flood hits. Before the recent flood, the handsome Victorian three-beds, with their high ceilings and bay windows, would have gone for £165,000. Recently the house next to Angela and Wilson Watson sold for £75,000, the owners willing to take a stinging hit if it meant they never again faced inundation by flood waters.
The Watsons are among the luckier residents of Warwick Road, having managed to move back in May. They hit the headlines last year when they were rescued on a life raft along with their waterphobic border collie cross, Brunn. Angela noted at the time that they had managed to save her most prized possession – season tickets for Carlisle United – when the waters started to lap up their stairs, eventually reaching 1.4 metres up the walls. The couple take a philosophical approach to their tragedy, with Angela even creating a hardback photo book to show visitors what the now immaculate house looked like filled with dirty water. “We don’t really blame anybody for what happened. It was a series of circumstances that all came together. To have stopped our house flooding they’d have to build flood barriers 10 feet higher. It’s just not practical,” said Angela, 68, a retired special needs teacher. Others are less sanguine. David Sowden is a retired policeman who until last week was living in a mobile home in his front drive in Crosby-on-Eden. He is furious to find himself flooded out again, following an inundation in 2005. “They should have built higher and better flood defences,” he insisted, asking why the council spent £38m on defences in Carlisle which didn’t hold.
But Little, the council’s lead on infrastructure, insists that “at least 1,000 homes were saved because of those defences. It would have been a lot worse without them.” The Carlisle Flood Action Group argues that Storm Desmond proved localised works of river defence are “an action of last resort”. Instead, the group’s latest report, released on Friday, blames poor river management. “Contrary to government reporting on Desmond the flooding of Carlisle was not principally caused by a storm blown in by climate change but as a direct result of long-term lack of river maintenance and poor management causing the build-up of accumulated gravels and thereby forcing rivers to flow higher in their channels than they used to,” the authors argue, adding: “As conditions currently stand the city and catchment does not appear to be in a fundamentally better place than 12 months ago.” Little insists that the council is better prepared now should the heavens open again to the same devastating degree. River height and flow is being monitored much better and 12,000 drains have been cleared, he said. This year 1,200 soldiers from three battalions are on standby to help clear-up in the event of further flooding. And the Met Office has agreed to improve weather forecasting for the Carlisle region: Little and colleagues only discovered last winter that the nearest meteorological monitoring stations are either in the east of Ireland or over the border in Northumberland. But ultimately Little knows that if the county experiences the same levels of rainfall after a damp month again, parts of Cumbria could be in trouble: “Fingers crossed for a dry and cold winter like we used to have.”"
2016-12-05T09:36:22Z,uk-news,UK news,British woman working in Lapland stabbed to death,"A murder investigation has been opened in Lapland after a British seasonal worker was stabbed to death. The woman, who has not yet been named, worked at Santa Safari, a company offering tours to meet Santa Claus, a spokeswoman confirmed to the Guardian. The 26-year-old woman was stabbed in Kuttanen, Lapland, on Saturday morning, Finnish police said. She is believed to be from Scotland. The woman’s 36-year-old boyfriend, a Czech citizen, was arrested after police launched a manhunt in challenging arctic conditions with temperatures as low as -30C, using snowmobiles and Border Guard helicopters, according to a police statement. The nearby border with Sweden was sealed and roads in the area were closed, according to a statement by tour operator Transun. The man had fled into the arctic wilderness on a dogsled, where he was found suffering from exposure after several hours evading the authorities. He was taken to hospital for treatment and is now in custody.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the death and said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who died in Finland on 3 December.” The Guardian understands that police in Scotland are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives of the death. A spokesman for the Czech government said: “The MFA [ministry of foreign affairs] of the Czech Republic can confirm that a Czech citizen was arrested as a murder suspect in Lapland on Sunday 4 December. “We are in contact with the police in Finland. We cannot provide any further details as the investigation of this case has just started.” The suspect has not contacted the foreign ministry or Czech embassy to request help, he said. A spokeswoman for Santa Safari told the Guardian: “We are deeply saddened to confirm that a member of the Santa Safari team was discovered dead on 3 December. “We are all in shock from this tragic news and our thoughts go out to her family. Our team is working closely with the Finnish police and relevant authorities to support the investigation that is now under way. It goes without saying that we will do everything we can to support the family and our staff at this incredibly difficult time.” Santa Safari’s tours start at £489 for a one-day round trip from the UK to its site in Enontekiö, in the arctic circle in north-west Finland. The company said it would compensate customers whose trips were disrupted by the manhunt. The spokeswoman said: “We thank visitors for their understanding at this difficult time and we will ensure that anyone whose trips have been affected will be compensated.”"
2016-12-05T10:02:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Friends pay tribute to Oxford student who died in French Alps,"Friends of a third-year Oxford history undergraduate who died of a heart attack in the French Alps have said they thought he was “invincible”. The 22-year-old student, named by friends on social media as Matt Smith, was found after the first night of the Oxford and Cambridge universities’ ski trip in Val Thorens on Sunday morning. Thousands of Oxbridge students arrived at the French ski resort, the highest in Europe, at the weekend for the annual event. Smith, who was in his third year reading history at St John’s College and according to Facebook had recently completed a three-month internship as a junior press officer at Sotheby’s living in London, was described by friends as a “smashing lad” who was full of “fun and adventure”. Eóin Barrett-Fulton wrote on Facebook:
In a statement Alex Jelicic, the president of Oxford University Ski and Snowboard Club, said: “We were all shocked to hear the news of Matt’s untimely death yesterday. He was a valued member of the club, not least in his capacity as social secretary last year, and he has made a lasting impression on all who were lucky enough to know him personally. “He was well known for being a fun-loving, adventurous individual who brought good humour with him at all times. We are proud to have had him serve on our committee, and he will be sorely missed by all members of the club.” A spokesman for Sotheby’s auction house in London, where Smith undertook an internship in the press office for three months in September, said: “We were extremely sad to hear of Matt’s death. Our thoughts are with his family.” His brother, Harry, wrote on Facebook: “I love you so much, Matt. Rest well above the clouds.” A University of Oxford spokesman said: “We would like to express our deep sadness at the tragic death and send our condolences to his family and friends. “While we await the findings of the official investigation we are offering support to students who may have been affected. Members of the college were invited to gather yesterday to remember him, and any member of the college who is particularly affected by this sad news has been encouraged to contact the chaplain or any member of the welfare team.” According to a Swiss newspaper, Le Matin, his friends were unable to revive him after finding him at about 8am on Sunday, prompting them to call the emergency services. Paramedics were also unable to save him and he is suspected of having suffered a heart attack. Gendarmes have said an autopsy will be carried out later in the week. It is understood that he had arrived in Val Thorens by coach with a group of friends from the UK on Saturday. The annual trip is a fixture on the social calendars of both universities, with publicity for this year’s event billing it as the biggest ski party in the world. Its advertising reads: “Those lucky enough to attend can ski all day on the slopes of one of the best ski areas in the world, and party all night.” A spokesman for Nuco Travel, which organised this year’s event, told the Varsity student newspaper that “sadly one of our passengers passed away on Sunday 4 December 2016. At this time, to respect their family’s and friends’ privacy, we will not be commenting further.” The first varsity ski trip was held in Switzerland in 1922 and attracts more than 3,000 young people a year, with a standard self-catering package costing £339. A spokeswoman for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who died in France on 4 December. We are in contact with the local authorities.”"
2016-12-05T13:42:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Louise Casey's integration plan is behind the times,"The pace of immigration itself appears to have overtaken Dame Louise Casey’s flawed report into the state of social integration in Britain, with the result that her aggressive action plan, with its calls for British loyalty oaths for new migrants, is likely to prove counterproductive. Casey’s experience of her inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham has rightly led her to a strong understanding of the problems that misogyny and the oppression of women and girls can cause when they are allowed to dominate in small, separate, closed communities. But her justified desire to ensure such scandals are not left to fester in dark corners of our society has led her to overlook the rapidly changing nature of Britain’s migrant communities. Such scandals are not the sole preserve of one British Pakistani community or indeed any particular community, as the domestic violence records of Britain’s police forces can clearly testify. Casey is right to identify those towns and cities that have experienced the most rapid population changes without sufficient work being done to cope with its impact as at the centre of the integration problem. But it is odd that her inquiry focuses almost totally on Britain’s Muslim communities, largely from Pakistan, and who mostly came to the UK more than 20 years ago. She has far less to say about the new Polish, Romanian or eastern European communities who have made up the bulk of Britain’s immigrants over the past 15 years. She mentions Muslims 249 times in her report, but there are only 14 references to Polish communities. The “separate lives, separate communities” narrative certainly had some force behind it at the time of the riots in the northern cities of Burnley, Oldham and Bradford in 2001. But Britain has not seen a repeat of such communal riots since. Casey worries about local wards where white British is no longer the majority ethnic group, but, as east London’s Tower Hamlets demonstrates, that does not necessarily mean one other single minority ethnic group now dominates instead. A diverse neighbourhood is not necessarily a segregated one along the American pattern. Her report again highlights, as David Cameron did back in January, the issue of Muslim women trapped at home not being able to speak English and being held back by “regressive cultural practices”. Casey says that the promotion of the English language and the emancipation of marginalised groups of women should be at the centre of a new programme to improve community cohesion. Quite right. But it was only later that we learned that David Cameron’s speech in 2011 declaring the “death of multiculturalism” meant deep cuts – £400m plus – to the adult skills budget which pays for most provision of teaching English to speakers of other languages (Esol). The 2011 census showed that not speaking any English was a problem that affected only 138,000 migrants, fewer than 0.3% of the population. Many of those who spoke no English at all were an older generation who had come as grandparents to join their families. Some have been in Britain for decades without learning English – not unlike the retired Brits on the Spanish Costas. The charity Refugee Action pointed out on Monday that there is no lack of appetite among new refugees and migrants to learn or improve their English and they are deeply frustrated that the 50% cut in Esol funding has led only to long queues for what classes remain. As for Casey’s “headline-catching” proposal of a loyalty oath to British values for new migrants, Britain already has a loyalty oath for new citizens, but it is hard to think of anything less British than requiring highly skilled Irish, French, American, Chinese or Indian people coming to work or study post-Brexit to take a loyalty oath. A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research on Bedford showed that a less aggressive approach can work. It shows that Bedford is well integrated, and that the most isolated groups are eastern European workers and Asian Muslim women. For them relatively small changes such as a women-only session at the local pool as a gateway to public services, or a different way of holding a parents’ evening can make a big difference. Casey may decry such an approach as “samosas and saris”, but it used to be known as community relations work. Sadly it has gone out of fashion in the face of New Labour’s demands for loyalty tests and the more recent Conservative focus only on extremism."
2016-12-05T13:43:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-IRA chief accused of role in Jean McConville murder 'has dementia',"A veteran IRA figure charged in connection with the murder and secret burial of a Belfast widow in the bloodiest year of Northern Ireland’s Troubles has dementia, a court has been told. Lawyers for Ivor Bell told Belfast crown court on Monday that their client would be unable to fully participate in his trial because he has been diagnosed with a vascular form of dementia. Bell, 79, is accused of soliciting the killing of Jean McConville, a mother of 10 children, who was dragged away from her child at gunpoint, driven across the Irish border, shot dead and buried in secret on a Co Louth beach. The west Belfast republican was arrested after he allegedly spoke about the McConville murder on the Belfast Project tapes. They are recorded testimonies for Boston College in the United States of IRA and Ulster Volunteer Force members over their roles in the armed paramilitary campaigns in the conflict. The Provisional IRA accused McConville in the December of 1972 of working as an informer in the Divis Flats complex, an accusation both her family and a former police ombudsman Nuala O’Loan have rejected. It was not until 1999 that the IRA admitted it had murdered the 37-year-old and buried her body in secret. McConville was the most famous of the “disappeared” victims the IRA killed and buried during the Troubles. Her remains were found in 2003 when a man walking his dog on Shelling Hill beach in Co Louth stumbled across them. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has pursued the Boston College Belfast Project through the US courts, successfully winning the right to seize recordings that were not only allegedly related to the McConville case, but to other Troubles-related murders. Historians and journalists have argued that the PSNI’s pursuit of the Boston College material will destroy any chance of an authentic truth-recovery process about what happened during the Troubles between 1969 and 1997. In Belfast crown court on Monday, Bell’s lawyer said his client’s dementia meant he “wouldn’t be able to properly follow the course of proceedings”. A lawyer for the crown told the judge, Mr Justice Treacy, that the prosecution would like to have Bell examined by a psychiatrist and have full access to his medical files. Treacy adjourned the case until 16 December when legal teams will provide further information on how proceedings can continue in the trial."
2016-12-05T15:26:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Are oaths powerful symbols or just empty gestures?,"Here’s a quick British citizenship test for you. According to Louise Casey’s 18-month review into community cohesion, what should immigrants have to do as soon as they arrive in the UK? a) leave? b) stick the kettle on? Or c) swear an oath of integration with British values and society? The answer is, of course, c). The Casey review, which attacks previous attempts at social inclusion as “saris, samosas and steel drums for the already well-intentioned”, recommends, among other measures, that migrants recite an “integration oath” as soon as they enter the UK. Currently, migrants are not required to swear an oath of allegiance until they are granted citizenship at a ceremony, but have to take a “Life in the UK” test costing £50 to secure their right to stay. Note that the Casey review’s proposed integration oath would be for migrants only, and not all British citizens, which you might say misses the point of integration: namely, that it must be a two-way street. And as for what British values actually are, well, that seems to be under review, too. But what is the point of an oath? A powerful symbol? Empty gesture? The showiest kind of nationalism? Here are some more oaths to help you solemnly decide. Members of parliament The swearing-in of MPs remains the most time consuming of parliamentary rituals. Two hundred years ago, it involved pledging allegiance to the crown in English on the authorised version of the Bible. Now MPs can swear or affirm in English, Welsh, Gaelic and Cornish, on or ignoring scriptures from the Qur’an to the Hebrew Bible. Some politicians have included prefaces to the oath, from the quietly subversive (Tony Benn: “As a committed republican, under protest, I take the oath required of me by law”) to the downright cheeky (Dennis Skinner: “I solemnly swear that I will bear true and faithful allegiance to the Queen when she pays her income tax”). Doctors Though many assume members of the medical profession take the Hippocratic oath – named after the Greek physician and philosopher Hippocrates – in fact, they simply agree to abide by the principles of good medical practice as defined by the General Medical Council. The classical Hippocratic oath, which begins: “I swear by Apollo the healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses ... that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture,” has been interpreted over centuries. There is still no single modern accepted version. Armed forces Royal Navy and Royal Marines recruits don’t have to swear an oath of allegiance because they were established by the sovereign’s prerogative. All other armed forces have to swear to God (or affirm) that: “I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second, her heirs and successors, and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty.” Schoolchildren In 2008 a report commissioned by Gordon Brown on British citizenship recommended pupils take an oath of allegiance to Queen and country. It never happened, but then neither did the touted national “Britishness” holiday. Instead, we got Brexit, which means permanent holidays in Britain because we can’t afford to leave."
2016-12-05T16:41:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Campaigners try to save Sheffield library from becoming five-star hotel,"Campaigners in Sheffield are urging the council to reject a deal with a Chinese company that would lead to the city’s central library building being turned into a five-star hotel. Actor Michael Palin has described the proposals as an embarrassment for the city of his birth and is among nearly 9,000 people to have signed a petition calling for the building to be kept as a public resource.
The local authority says the art deco, grade II-listed building needs £30m worth of repairs, which it cannot afford after cuts to its budget by central government. Sichuan Guodong Construction Group has been given 12 months to explore the possibility of turning the building into the city’s first five-star hotel, which would result in library services being moved to a new, purpose-built building. The Graves art gallery, which occupies the third floor of the building, would remain but be moved to the ground floor.
“The Sheffield central library embodies the very best aspects of civic pride,” wrote Palin in a letter to the Sheffield Star “It’s a fine building, built to give education and literacy a prominent place at the very heart of the city. That a building, seeking to improve the lot of all Sheffielders, should end up as a hotel for the rich and privileged seems a sad reflection on how little the city cares for its public service legacy.” A petition to keep the library in the building had attracted more than 8,800 signatures by Monday afternoon, surpassing the 5,000 required to prompt a full-council debate, which will be held on Wednesday. A public meeting will take place on Tuesday evening. The petition’s organiser, Rebecca Gransbury, said the building housed not only the city’s largest lending and reference collection and the Graves art gallery, but also a theatre in the basement and a children’s library. “From the start, this building was imagined as a public space from top to bottom and should remain as such,” she wrote online. Speaking to the Guardian, Gransbury said she did not disagree that Sheffield could benefit from a five-star hotel, but said it would render a key historic building in the city “more for visitors than for the people of Sheffield”. She added: “I love Sheffield and it’s nice to see people wanting to invest, but it seems like the company has been given a 12-month period to consider whether they want the building or not, before the people have been asked whether they want to part with it.” Jack Scott, a Labour councillor and cabinet member for community services, said the building did not meet modern standards of accessibility and inclusivity, with a lift shaft too small for mobility scooters, stairs at every entrance and insufficient space for public computers. “I agree the building is beautiful and that’s why we need to do something to protect it,” he said. “It is highly unlikely that we’ll have the millions of pounds that are required to maintain and upgrade it in the way that it deserves.” Scott said the proposals were for the building to be leased to the Chinese company, not sold, and that the hotel would raise an estimated £1m a year from business rates, which could be spent on a new library. The local authority is one of many across the north of England to seek direct investment from Chinese firms to fund infrastructure projects in light of budget cuts. “As the eye-watering cuts to local government, especially local government in the north, have hit home … we’re in a position where we need to consider a range of options,” he said. Sheffield city council has had £352m cut from its budget over the past six years, and a further £116m is predicted to go over the next five. In July, the local authority signed a £1bn, 60-year construction deal with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group, one of the biggest firms in China’s south-western Sichuan province. In the biggest Chinese investment outside London, an initial £220m will pay for four or five city-centre projects over the next three years and create “hundreds if not thousands” of jobs in South Yorkshire, according to the council. Work on the Sheffield Central Library building began in 1929 and it was opened by the Duchess of York in 1934. It faces Tudor Square, which is also home to the city’s two theatres, the Crucible and the Lyceum, and the Millennium Galleries."
2016-12-05T16:51:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Want to help your northern child? Become a pushy southern parent,"Blame the parents. According to Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner, one reason that there is a gap in educational attainment between teenagers in the north and the south is because northern parents are not as pushy as their southern counterparts. Apparently, there just isn’t the same appetite for Mandarin lessons, excellence in the hockey team or whatever other stereotype has been thrown at pushy mothers (and it is mothers who are overwhelmingly judged, of course). “As northern parents, we need to be aware of these inconsistencies and variations in secondary schools and push hard for our schools to show how they are improving and helping our children to achieve,” Longfield said, prior to the publication of her report Growing Up North. “One of the real drivers of improvements of schools in London has been the demand for good school results from parents and children. There is much we northern parents can learn about this parent power.” Here, then, is a guide to how to be a pushy southern parent to help your northern child: Get your child a private tutor According to the Sutton Trust, 42% of state-educated children in London have had private tuition, compared with 13% in the north-west and 16% in Yorkshire. Obviously, you’ll need a better-paid job to pay for it, so question why George Osborne’s promised “northern powerhouse” seems to have stalled, why growth in London is twice that of the north, and why net wealth across the UK is rising, but has fallen in the north-east. Those extra-curricular maths lessons won’t pay for themselves. Make your child learn a musical instrument It’s a fact that every child south of Newport Pagnell services has at least grade-six oboe. Making your child learn a musical instrument is, apparently, the hallmark of a pushy parent, as opposed to a skill that contributes to wellbeing. Ignore the fact that music lessons in schools have long been underfunded, and that half of primary school music teachers say they don’t have the resources to teach music. Instead, pay an average of £30 an hour for music lessons. You’ll be able to afford it once the northern powerhouse heats up, although your child may by then be in their 40s. Send your child to school in the south Many northern schools are struggling. As Longfield appears to suggest, this could be because of a comparative lack of so-called tiger mothers. Or, as Michael Wilshaw, head of the schools watchdog, Ofsted, said last week, it might have more to do with the government’s failure to improve schools or recruit and train enough good teachers. Or, as the Institute for Public Policy Research found, it could be because northern primary schools are funded an average of £900-a-pupil less than in London, and £1,300-a-pupil less in secondary schools. But let’s stick with the idea that northern schools could buck up if only northern parents were a bit pushier."
2016-12-05T16:56:06Z,uk-news,UK news,London and south-east children far more likely to go to top universities,"Children in London and the south-east are 57% more likely to get into universities ranked among the top third than their counterparts in the north, according to research by the children’s commissioner for England. Launching a year-long investigation into why many children in the north get left behind, Anne Longfield said the under-performance of secondary schools in the north of England was of “huge concern”, with poorer pupils getting significantly worse GCSE results. “London and the south-east is racing ahead,” she said. Longfield said she wanted to understand why the north-east had the best primary schools in the country, but the lowest adult employment rate: 71.1% compared with 78% in the south-east, according to September figures from the Office for National Statistics.
Of primary schools in Redcar and Cleveland, 95% are deemed “good” or “outstanding” by Ofsted. But the same local authority is in the bottom 20 of all 149 council areas in England when it comes to the progress a pupil makes from the end of primary school to the end of secondary school. The north-east is far better at helping young people into apprenticeships, however: 20% of school leavers in Hartlepool become apprentices, compared with just 4% in London. “We see that children start well but a gap emerges while they are at secondary school. That, coupled with the paucity of job prospects in some areas, seem to combine to really open up a gap that many children can’t get beyond,” said Longfield. She said she would be exploring the idea of companies from more affluent areas offering work experience placements to students from poorer areas with higher levels of unemployment. Pupils in a school in Bradford recently complained to her that their work placement scheme had been scrapped because of cost cutting, the commissioner said. Just 34% of disadvantaged children in the north of England overall get five GCSEs A*-C, including English and maths, compared with 48% of similar pupils in London. Of the 20 worst performing local authorities in England for GCSE results, 12 are in the north, with Knowsley and Blackpool at the bottom and Bradford, Middlesbrough, Kingston upon Hull and Manchester not far behind. Just one northern council area makes the top 20: Trafford in Greater Manchester. Explaining the knock-on effect for the further education opportunities, Longfield said: “School leavers in London and the south-east are at least 57% more likely to go to a top-third university.” Preliminary research carried out by Longfield’s team has found that the north of England’s education system is not uniformly poor. Children in the north-west performed better than their counterparts in London in verbal comprehension tests at 11, according to analysis of data collected as part of the Institute of Education’s Millennium Cohort Study. North-west children also have among the lowest instances of mental illness in the country, though those in the north-east and Yorkshire fare less well.
A succession of experts have expressed concerns about the north-south divide in education. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing chief inspector of schools, last year blamed poor teaching for the “troubling gap between the performance of secondary schools in the north and Midlands and secondary schools in the rest of the country”. Last month Sir Nick Weller, who runs an academy chain with schools in the north, advised the government to pilot a new “teach north” scheme to attract and retain talented newly qualified teachers in disadvantaged schools in the region. Schools in the north typically receive less funding per pupil than those in London despite having lower attainment and serving communities with greater disadvantage, Weller reported in A Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy, commissioned by the Department for Education. He singled out “monocultural disadvantage” as being “a particular problem in the north, whether this is white working-class children in former mining towns or Pakistani students in former mill towns, for example”.
“In some areas there is little that can be done about the monocultural makeup of schools. In others, however, two communities can live close by locally, but self-select separate schools for their different communities,” Weller wrote, adding: “Schools with high concentrations of monocultural disadvantage should consider how changing their admissions policy might encourage a more diverse mix of students, for example randomised selection from a city-wide or whole-town catchment.” In her review into segregation in Britain released this week, Dame Louise Casey said radical change was needed to address monocultural schools, “not just in relation to admissions but also to the fundamentals of what is taught in schools to grow tolerant, resilient pupils, capable of reflective, critical thinking”. She said she had been particularly struck by a survey of pupils in a non-faith secondary school with a high Asian population. Pupils had been asked to identify the percentage Asian population of Britain and their estimates ranged from 50% to 90% – the actual figure is 7% – presumably reflecting their experience in the local community, and a relative lack of knowledge about the country as a whole. Longfield said she would try to assess how monocultural education affects children’s outcomes. According to research by the thinktank Demos, seven of the 10 areas with the most disproportionately high levels of ethnic concentration in particular schools were in the north, with Blackburn with Darwen worst, along with Bradford, Rochdale, Kirklees, Oldham, Rotherham and Manchester."
2016-12-05T17:12:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Tube strikes called off after union talks with London Underground,"Strikes that were expected to cause widespread disruption on the London underground on Tuesday evening and Wednesday have been called off. The RMT union, which had called a 24-hour strike by its drivers on the Piccadilly and Hammersmith and City lines, said the action had been suspended following successful talks with London Underground management at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). The union had previously cited a range of grievances amounting to a wholesale “breakdown in industrial relations” on the lines, but said there had been “serious progress in resolving the issues at the heart of these disputes”. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “Talks with London Underground have proved to be positive and focused and as a result we have been able to make enough significant progress to allow us to suspend the strike action in both disputes that was scheduled for tomorrow evening.” The agreement will provide some relief to London commuters on the Piccadilly line, the tube’s fourth busiest. Action was likely to compound disruption in recent weeks that has seen a combination of poor weather, leaves on the line and a high number of trains requiring maintenance cause extreme delays and overcrowding. However, commuters in south London using Southern rail are expected to be impacted again by another RMT conductors’ strike on Tuesday, the first day of a three-day walkout. Southern said it would run about 50% of its services, as an overtime ban by drivers in the Aslef union also takes effect from Tuesday, and expects its metropolitan service to be particularly affected."
2016-12-05T17:25:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"Approved restraint techniques can kill children, MoJ found","The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is facing calls to scrap and rewrite the policy on restraining minors after it emerged that a report it commissioned found some authorised techniques could kill children or leave them disabled. An internal risk assessment of restraint techniques, obtained by the Guardian, shows that certain procedures approved for use against non-compliant children carry a 40% or 60% chance of causing injuries involving the child’s airway, breathing or circulation, the consequences of which could be “catastrophic”. The undated report defines catastrophic injury as “death or permanent severe disability affecting everyday life” and ranks the chances of it occurring in each approved restraint technique out of five. It found that 28 of the 66 scenarios assessed had at least a 40% chance of causing that level of harm. The medical review of restraints applied to children in young offender institutions (YOIs) and secure training centres (STCs) was completed for the government by an independent medical adviser and made public for the first time after a freedom of information (FoI) request. Carolyne Willow, the director of children’s rights charity Article 39, who obtained the documents, said: “What kind of society trains adults to use restraint techniques that could cause children to die or be severely disabled? “Techniques assessed as potentially causing catastrophic harm to children, with a likelihood of more than never, should be immediately struck out of the manual. “Children have reported feeling terror, panic, desperation, shame, humiliation and anger during restraint. These testimonies from children, together with the appalling restraint-related deaths … should remain uppermost in our minds. We need a completely fresh start with policy and practice led by experts in looking after children.” Willow has been engaged in a long-running legal battle for greater transparency in the government’s approach to youth restraints. The risk assessment forms part of a broader manual on restraint techniques, known as the MMPR (pdf), which has only been released to the public in redacted form, but the full version of which is the subject of an FoI appeal launched by Willow that could be taken to the court of appeal. The MoJ refused to make the syllabus publicly available on the grounds that some of the techniques in the manual are similar to those used in adult prisons, and its release could undermine the safety of prisoners and guards across the justice system. However, it released the risk assessment table for children being restrained using MMPR in detention or being taken to detention, which also includes children being deported. An MoJ spokesman said restraints were intended to be used as a last resort to prevent detainees harming themselves or others, to prevent damage to property and to prevent escape, but critics have warned that the guidelines are open to misuse. He added: “Every incident of restraint is reviewed by the establishment. This includes looking at whether any lessons can be learned for the future. We have introduced a new system designed to minimise the use of physical restraint in youth custody and we are committed to improving practice further.” YOIs take young people up to the age of 20. In March this year, there were 882 children (under-18s) in custody in England and Wales, and 4,668 18- to 20-year-olds. The three STCs in England and Wales have a combined capacity of about 270. In 2015, there were 28 incidents of restraint per 100 children, which was up from 10 per 100 children in 2010. There were 429 injuries to children reported as a result of restraint in 2015.
Among the techniques identified as dangerous in the risk assessment is moving a child through a doorway while wearing a waist restraint belt, for which there is a three out of five chance of suffering breathing difficulties resulting in catastrophic harm. The independent medical adviser also found that head holds, the mandibular angle technique (which involves applying upward pressure below the jaw, near the ear), moving a child under restraint, a figure of four leg hold in prone position, and strip-searching a child in prone position or on their side all had a two in five likelihood of resulting in grave harm. Moving a non-compliant child off transport, restraining a child on the ground, a figure of four arm hold to an inverted wrist, thumb flexion, moving a child under restraint “whilst negotiating stairs”, rigid bar handcuffs, straight arm hold to an inverted wrist also all had a three out of five chance of resulting in fracture or dislocation and ligament or tendon damage. The assessment acknowledges that such injuries require hospital attendance or admission but rates them only as “minor” or “moderate”. The Youth Justice Board (YJB) says officers receive “detailed medical advice on the physiological aspects of the youngest age range to make sure that the use of force is minimised, used only when necessary, and, when it is used, that the risk of injury to young people is minimised”. Staff are trained in the use of MMPR by experts, and understanding is assessed through a written test and scenario-based exercise. The manual states that they “must be able to demonstrate the required level of understanding before being authorised to use MMPR in an operational environment”. Staff receive a minimum of one day’s refresher training every six months. Willow has fought for children’s rights in custody since the death of 15-year-old Gareth Myatt in 2004. He was being restrained after refusing to clean a sandwich toaster at Rainsbrook secure training centre. Myatt, who weighed 40kg (six and a half stone) and stood 1.47m (4ft 10in) tall, was forced into a sitting position by three G4S officers, his upper body bent towards his thighs and knees. The officers ignored Myatt’s cries that he could not breathe and was going to defecate, which he did before vomiting. One restraining officer was 1.85m tall (6ft 1in) and 90kg (14st). When Myatt told the officers he could not breathe, one replied: “Well, if you are shouting, you can breathe.” His death was later found at an inquest to be accidental. The restraint technique used, known as the seated double embrace, was withdrawn two months after he died. MMPR, which was introduced following a lengthy review in 2012, was intended as a safer and more humane way of restraining children, emphasising the importance of staff using their existing relationships with children to de-escalate volatile incidents, and minimising the number of children who experience restraint. The risk assessment is believed to have been commissioned by then. But in the 2015 report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, former chief inspector Nick Hardwick wrote: “Children frequently reported to us that they struggled to breathe during a restraint.” In granting the FoI request for the risk assessment, the MoJ stressed: “If a technique scores highly in the consequences section, it does not mean that this injury will occur, as it is scored with the worst possible outcome in mind.” It added: “To date there have been no recorded serious injuries or warning signs recorded from the escort services.” Dave Hill, president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, said: “Department for Education guidance is absolutely clear in that restraint should only be used where absolutely necessary and should be reasonable and proportionate to the circumstances. Restraint that deliberately inflicts pain should never be used on children.” A spokeswoman for the YJB said: “The safety and welfare of the young people in the youth justice system is of paramount importance to the YJB. MMPR was devised by a team of experts who extensively researched and carefully considered the best ways to keep children in custody, and the staff looking after them, safe. Restraint should only ever be used as a last resort with staff using their relationships with the children in their care to manage their behaviour. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons’ thematic on MMPR published last year concluded that MMPR was a good system but it needed more time to be embedded.”"
2016-12-05T18:03:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Amber Rudd says EU nationals in post-Brexit UK will need 'form of ID',"More than 3 million European Union citizens living in Britain after Brexit will have to be issued with “some form of documentation”, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd told MPs she would not yet set out the details for any new EU ID card, but said: “There will be a need to have some sort of documentation. We are not going to set it out yet. We are going to do it in a phased approach to ensure that we use all the technology advantages that we are increasingly able to harness to ensure that all immigration is carefully handled.” The home secretary’s statement came in response to Labour’s Hilary Benn, who told MPs that EU citizens already in the UK would need to be documented so that employers and landlords could distinguish them from EU citizens arriving after Brexit. During Home Office questions in the Commons, Rudd also said she was aware of the need to continue the seasonal agricultural workers’ scheme after Brexit, but again ruled out demands to remove international students from the annual net migration target. The latest migration figures published last Thursday showed that almost 100,000 EU citizens living in the UK have applied to the Home Office to secure their status in Britain. The surge in applications has meant that a backlog is rapidly building up in a system that currently only processes 25,500 permanent residence applications every year.
Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told the House of Lords EU home affairs subcommittee that the number of citizens of other EU countries in Britain could be as high as 3.9 million. She said the task of registering them after Brexit would be a “formidable logistical, bureaucratic, administrative and legal task”. In September, the Home Office quietly started testing an online pilot programme to speed up applications for permanent residence for EU citizens and their family members. It has been estimated by the Migration Observatory that the complexities of the current paper-based system, which includes completing an 85-page form, means it could take 140 years to register all 3 million EU citizens in Britain at current rates of processing if they all apply. The Home Office has yet to clarify who exactly would have to register, but it is thought that Irish citizens living in the UK, who numbered more than 100,000 in 2011, would be exempt from any such requirement as part of a deal that will see a continuation of the common travel area that predates Britain joining the European Union. If Irish citizens were required to register as EU nationals it would also complicate the situation in Northern Ireland, where more than 20% of the population only have Irish passports."
2016-12-05T21:29:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Farmer whose cows trampled man to death gets suspended sentence,"A farmer who was warned repeatedly over the course of more than a decade to improve safety on his land has been spared jail after a retired university professor was trampled to death by cows at the farm. Mike Porter died after being trampled by the herd while he and his brother John walked their two dogs on a public footpath through one of Brian Godwin’s fields. John Porter was also injured but survived. After previous incidents in which people were injured by cattle on his farm, health officials had told Godwin to put in segregating fencing or signs saying “cows with calves” to let people know the protective animals were dangerous, a court heard. But sentencing him on Monday after Godwin admitted at a previous hearing to breaching his general duty to control his livestock, the judge said he had “quite blatantly failed to ensure the safety of people who came on your land”. Tim Mousley QC, sitting at Swindon crown court, said: “You could have prevented his [Mike Porter’s] untimely death.” He handed Godwin a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. The judge said Godwin would have to pay £30,000, which would be covered by insurance. In May 2013 the Porter brothers had been rambling with their dogs, who were leashed, through a field on Godwin’s 400-acre farm near Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire. About 30 “highly excited, jostling” continental beef cattle surrounded them and repeatedly trampled on Mike Porter, who curled up in a ball to protect himself. John Porter told an inquest into his brother’s death that the herd knocked them down repeatedly and seemed to deliberately trample on them “as if it was something they really wanted to do”. Mike Porter, who was a father of two, managed to scramble out of the field but collapsed later and was airlifted to hospital. He later died from internal bleeding. On Monday the judge told Godwin: “I’m quite satisfied that the way you managed your livestock created an obvious risk to people on public footpaths and a risk of serious injury. That was a risk that you failed to take reasonable steps to rectify and led to the terrible death of one man and serious injuries to another. “There was an incident in 2004, two incidents in 2008 after which the health and safety executive required you to make some changes. Two further incidents in 2011 after which the health and safety executive required you to make further changes. “It must have been clear at that stage, the warning signs were obvious. By May 2013, you were aware of all the previous incidents. You had made some improvements to farming practice. But what you did obviously was not enough. I’m satisfied you could have done more and you say you now realise that you could. “Simply the expedient of installing a fence that would not have provided 100% safety but certainly would have reduced the risk. Mike Porter, by everyone’s account, was a devoted family man. He knew the importance of his family and their loss is immeasurable.” In a statement issued after the hearing, Mike Porter’s family said they hoped lessons would be learned to help make the countryside safer for walkers."
2016-12-06T05:37:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Chinese firm buys pub where David Cameron and Xi Jinping enjoyed a pint,"It was an improbable symbol of the embryonic romance between London and Beijing: a 16th-century Buckinghamshire pub where then prime minister David Cameron and Chinese president Xi Jinping sealed their countries’ “golden” friendship over a pint of Greene King IPA.
Now the Plough at Cadsden – a rural tavern near the official country retreat used by British prime ministers – has reportedly been sold to Chinese investors for an undisclosed fee. “We are really pleased to have completed the sale of the Plough to SinoFortone Investment,” Neil Morgan, the Christie & Co director behind the sale was quoted as saying by the Morning Advertiser, a publication focusing on the pub sector. “The pub became famous in Chinese circles following the visit of President Xi Jinping, and it has become quite a tourist attraction for Chinese visitors since, who are keen to sample the classic British food and beer that the president tried,” Morgan added. Peter Zhang, the managing director of the government-backed investment group behind the deal, said: “We are so excited about this new adventure.”
“The English pub concept is growing very fast in China and it’s the best way culturally to link people from different countries and build friendships,” Zhang was quoted as saying by the state-run China Daily newspaper. The Plough at Cadsden served its first ale during the Ming dynasty and today describes itself as “probably the most famous pub in England” and “that kind of pub [where] everyone feels at home here and can be sure of a warm welcome”. Because of its proximity to Chequers, the prime minister’s country home in Buckinghamshire, a succession of political figures has propped up its bar over the years, including Edward Heath, Britain’s leader from 1970 until 1974. The pub’s website says it also regularly hosts “a variety of local celebrities from the world of film, television and the music industry”. It wasn’t until October 2015, however, when Xi and Cameron graced its bar during the former’s state visit to Britain, that the watering hole came on to Chinese radars. Xi’s brief visit, which helped launch a controversial diplomatic flirtation dubbed the “golden era” of UK-China relations, made the pub a magnet for some of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists who visit Britain each year. “We read the news that President Xi visited here and would love to experience the food and drink that he tasted,” one such visitor, 26-year-old Miao Xin, told the China Daily last year. Speaking to the same newspaper, the pub’s landlord, Steve Hollings, claimed Xi had sent him an email “thanking him, and saying that he enjoyed the meal and drink in the pub”. But not all patrons have been impressed by the changes that have taken place since Xi’s visit. “Seems to have lost its mojo,” one critic wrote of the Plough on Tripadvisor in September."
2016-12-06T10:39:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Flights cancelled as heavy fog descends on southern England,"Heavy fog across the south of England caused traffic disruption on Tuesday morning and dozens of flights were cancelled due to low visibility. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Heathrow, which was forced to cancel 45 flights because of low visibility, while London City airport in east London had cancelled 43 arrivals and departures by 9am. Up to 18 flights were also delayed or diverted as fog shrouded the city, causing poor visibility. A City airport spokesman said: “Adverse weather is causing delays and cancellations this morning. Passengers are advised to check with the airline directly for flight info.” Gatwick said the fog was impacting incoming flights and there were delays but no cancellations, while Stansted said it had accepted two diversions from City airport.
Highways England urged drivers to take extra care on the roads, telling them to check their headlights and fog lights and drive slower than usual. Drivers faced areas of fog, including some dense freezing fog patches with visibility of less than 100 metres on Tuesday morning. The Met Office issued a yellow warning for fog overnight, adding that while most areas would clear by the afternoon some heavy patches of fog could persist in the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east. “There is a north-south split in the weather today, with rain from the Atlantic coming in heavy bursts in Scotland and Northern Ireland,” said Emma Boorman, a Met Office forecaster. The “very foggy” conditions were due to continue throughout the morning, with a misty and dull day expected. A spokesman from Gatwick said: “Due to foggy conditions across the south-east some arriving aircraft are subject to air traffic control restrictions, however this is not currently expected to have a significant impact on today’s schedule.” A Heathrow spokesman said passengers could experience disruption to their journeys. “Heathrow advises passengers to check their flight status with their airline before coming to the airport. We apologise to those whose travel has been affected,” he said. British Airways warned passengers that flights were delayed and cancelled because of the fog.
A BA spokeswoman said it would refund or rebook the flights of any affected customers as soon as possible. She said: “We’re sorry that some of our customers’ travel plans have been affected due to thick fog at Heathrow, which has led to a reduction in the number of aircraft which can land each hour. “For safety reasons Heathrow airport, air traffic control and airlines have agreed to operate a slightly reduced schedule to help mitigate the effects of the fog. “We would advise customers to keep checking ba.com for the latest information about their flights.”"
2016-12-06T11:33:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Chris Grayling unveils plans for fully privatised rail line,"The government has unveiled plans for a fully privatised railway line, with track and trains operated by the same company. A new line linking Oxford and Cambridge will not be developed by Network Rail, the owner of Britain’s rail infrastructure. Instead, a new entity will be responsible for track and infrastructure, as well as operating train services, under proposals drawn up by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling.
“What we are doing is taking this line out of Network Rail’s control,” Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Network Rail has got a huge number of projects to deliver at the moment … I want it to happen quicker. This is an essential corridor for this country. On that route we are going to bring in private finance, in a form to be decided.” In a keynote speech later on Tuesday, Grayling will outline further how the government plans to reunite the operation of tracks and trains, which are currently the respective responsibility of publicly owned Network Rail and private train operating companies (TOCs). He will also outline how future rail franchises will have to create integrated operating teams between TOCs and Network Rail. The RMT union said Grayling’s rail plans would recreate privatisation chaos that it claims he introduced in the prison system as justice secretary. On Tuesday morning, Grayling told parliament in a written statement: “I am going to establish East West Rail as a new and separate organisation, to accelerate the permissions needed to reopen the route, and to secure private-sector involvement to design, build and operate the route as an integrated organisation.” He said he intended to build on two major reports into the rail industry, the 2011 McNulty report and the 2015 Shaw report, that advocated cost-cutting, devolution and bringing in private finance. He added: “But there is much more to do.” While officials at the Department for Transport have disputed reports that Grayling is seeking more immediate challenges to Network Rail, unions pledged to fight the proposed changes. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This is a politician who doesn’t believe in the public sector, who spent five years at the justice department and left a prison system in chaos and now wants to do the same on the railways. And we are not going to stand idly by and watch that happen.“This is a slippery slope to privatisation and the breakup of Network Rail and we are deeply concerned about it.” Grayling denied he was intent on privatisation. “I don’t intend to sell off the existing rail network. I don’t intend to privatise Network Rail again,” he told Today. He said the Oxford and Cambridge rail link would be developed by a separate company outside Network Rail in the same way that the Crossrail link had been developed in London. Rail privatisation has consistently polled as deeply unpopular with supporters of all parties, and privately owned Railtrack’s management of the track and infrastructure from 1994 to 2002 remains associated with fatal train crashes including Potters Bar and Hatfield, in Hertfordshire.
Despite this, Grayling hopes the restored Oxford to Cambridge line, axed following the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, will be the first integrated rail operation in Britain since privatisation in the 1990s. Funding towards restoring the rail link between the cities, on a route that will have a branch to Milton Keynes, and eventually extend to Norwich and Ipswich, was announced in the autumn statement last month. A new organisation, East West Rail, will be created early in 2017 to secure investment and build the line, eventually becoming a private company that will operate train services. In the meantime, Grayling will demand that Network Rail and TOCs work more closely together in the interests of passengers, with proposals for more “vertical integration” to be built into the upcoming South Eastern and East Midlands franchises (pdf). Grayling will say: “I believe it will mean they run better on a day-to-day basis … Our railway is much better run by one joined-up team of people. They don’t have to work for the same company. They do have to work in the same team.” A lack of communication and shared incentives between track and train operators has been identified as one factor in the long-running problems at Southern, the commuter network to the south of London, which has been plagued by delays and cancelled services. In September, Grayling appointed Chris Gibb to run a board with a £20m fund to ensure rail maintenance worked in tandem with Southern’s train operations. Cash said the government was “dragging the railways back to the failed and lethal Railtrack model”. “The idea that what Britain’s railways need is more privatisation is ludicrous,” he said. “The introduction of the profit motive into infrastructure raises again the spectre of Hatfield and Potters Bar and the other grotesque failures that led to the creation of Network Rail.” The general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, Mick Whelan, said: “The failures and tragedies of the Railtrack era remind us that infrastructure should never be run for profit. I’m concerned that in 2016, [Grayling] is seriously considering a return to one of the darkest times in the history of Britain’s railways.” The idea of alliances between TOCs and Network Rail had been tried recently without success, Whelan said. “What he is proposing is a desperate, half-baked reform that will only add another layer of unnecessary complexity to the rail industry.”"
2016-12-06T12:45:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland police investigate IRA rocket launcher footage,"Police are investigating a video in which republican dissident terror group the New IRA displays what appears to be a rocket launcher on the streets of Northern Ireland. The weapon was shown on a propaganda video the paramilitary organisation recorded in the Ardoyne district of north Belfast. The film appeared on social media on Monday evening. The New IRA has a presence in Ardoyne and has launched a number of home-made grenade launcher attacks in recent years against police patrols in the north and west of the city. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed on Tuesday that it was investigating the show of strength by the anti-peace process terror group. Supt Darrin Jones said: “Police are aware of a video having been posted on a social media site. Inquiries are ongoing.” The 40-second video shows masked men patrolling the streets of Ardoyne. One man carries what appears to be a military-grade rocket launcher, while another holds an assault rifle. It is the second time in two years the New IRA has released propaganda images of weapons it claims to have at its disposal. In November 2014, the group released photographic stills to the Belfast media of masked men holding improvised grenade launchers, one of which was later used in an attack on a police Land Rover near Ardoyne. No officers were killed or injured in the attack, in which the PSNI later confirmed the New IRA had fired a new type of armour-piercing warhead. The New IRA announced its existence in a communique to the Guardian three years ago. The terror group’s statement said it was formed out of an amalgam of former Real IRA activists, independent hardline armed republican units from East Tyrone and members of the Derry-based vigilante organisation, Republican Action Against Drugs. Over the last three years, it has murdered prison officers David Black and Adrian Ismay as well as being responsible for the killings of at least two Catholic civilians it accused of being involved in the drug trade. It has bases in north and west Belfast, Derry, and North Armagh. However, the overwhelming majority of nationalists and mainstream republicans in Northern Ireland continue to support the peace process and still vote for Sinn Féin rather than back the dissidents’ armed campaigns."

“What we are doing is taking this line out of Network Rail’s control,” Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The transport secretary said the new private line, to be funded by “private finance, in a form to be decided”, would provide “a degree of comparison with Network Rail to say, ‘can we build lines quicker and cheaper than we are at the moment?’.” Readers below the line largely echoed the RMT union and Labour’s shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald in expressing scepticism at the proposals. Below we highlight a selection of reader views. This amounts to a state regulated private monopoly
We will see higher fares
Let them raise their own capital
There will still be subsidies
Rail requires a monopoly - state or private
Will they pay for track maintenance?
The plan could end up worse than Railtrack
It’s a very British kind of privatisation"
2016-12-06T14:12:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Len McCluskey supporters plan slate of candidates for Unite,"Supporters of Len McCluskey are planning to run a slate of candidates for positions in Britain’s biggest union as their general secretary prepares to stand down. A new faction calling itself Unite Alliance hopes to take up positions on the executive council, according to the group’s website, which appears to anticipate McCluskey’s resignation. Union sources on Monday confirmed McCluskey had told executive council members he hoped to resign and then stand again to lead Unite.
McCluskey’s influence and the union’s money have been crucial in winning the Labour leadership for Jeremy Corbyn and supporting him for 15 months. McCluskey’s critics believe he may have to gain more support on the executive council if he is to maintain support for Corbyn. Gerard Coyne, the regional secretary of Unite for the West Midlands, who has argued against some of McCluskey’s political decisions, is expected to stand against him. Unite Alliance’s website calls on Unite’s 1.4 million members to recognise that McCluskey has done a good job and refers to his anticipated resignation. It said: “We are fortunate to currently have a general secretary in Len McCluskey who always has and always will have members’ best interests at heart and who truly believes in a ‘fighting back union’. “However, when the election for the general secretary of Unite is announced, this means the future direction of our union is once again uncertain and it is our job as reps to provide that certainty, because all of us will remember that ‘fighting back’ was not always high on the agenda with some past general secretaries.” Union representatives needed to be relevant and ready to take action, the website said. “We feel there is no better place to start than by ensuring that the highest decision-making body of our union, our executive council, is made up of people who not only reflect those concerns but will act upon them,” it said. Unite’s executive council meets on Tuesday after McCluskey told allies on Monday he planned to stand down on Wednesday. Union insiders have raised concerns with the Guardian that McCluskey has been too involved in internal Labour politics rather than fighting for its members. McCluskey was criticised by some council members after the Guardian disclosed that the union had helped him to buy a £700,000 flat near Borough Market in south London. Unite is now Labour’s most generous donor and has provided a number of staff members for Corbyn’s office. The union’s supporters hold crucial votes on Labour’s national executive committee and McCluskey’s friend Karie Murphy is Corbyn’s office manager. McCluskey was elected as general secretary in November 2010, a few months after Ed Miliband became Labour leader. He was re-elected in 2013 for a five-year term, but if he wins a new mandate it would authorise him to continue his support for Corbyn’s leadership. A Militant sympathiser in the 1980s, McCluskey was national secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union and became assistant general secretary of Unite, formed from a merger of the TGWU and Amicus. Unite’s press officers have failed to respond to requests for a comment."
2016-12-06T15:15:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Billy goat's rough:  video of Northern Ireland goat rampage goes viral,"Never mind the proverbial bull in a china shop – a goat in Northern Ireland has shot to internet fame after causing chaos at a County Antrim shop. Video footage of the rogue goat terrorising shoppers at a Eurospar convenience store in the coastal town of Carrickfergus, north of Belfast, has gone viral. During the incident at the weekend the billy goat headbutted a pensioner named Billy, munched on flowerbeds, and forced staff and customers to shelter in nearby cars as it reared up on its hind legs. The goat was eventually grabbed by the horns and removed from the scene. Store manager Jonathan Smyth said the goat incident has been the “talk of the store” since it occurred at the weekend. After knocking on the store door the goat, according to Smyth, “was into the baskets eating all the plants and running round the car park. I thought: ‘You’ve got to be kidding me!’” Smyth told local paper the Carrick Times: “It has really captured people’s imagination. I’ve been fielding calls all morning from major papers and the BBC came out to do a radio interview. The goat’s gone viral, especially on Facebook!”"
2016-12-06T17:00:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Plans for Transport for London to take over capital's rail lines ditched,"Plans for the capital’s rail lines to be run by Transport for London have been scuttled, as the government instead said it would make the Southeastern franchise a testbed for controversial reforms that will lead to private train companies taking joint control of the tracks. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has blocked a deal announced in January by his predecessor, Patrick McLoughlin, and the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, for TfL to take charge of train services within Greater London as the franchises were renewed.
Grayling said TfL would be “invited to be involved in developing” a new Southeastern franchise, which is likely instead to hand greater control over the rail infrastructure to private firms after 2018. The move was met with dismay by the mayor for London, Sadiq Khan, as well as local Conservative MPs. Bob Neill, the MP for Bromley, said it was “a complete cop-out and failure and certainly [makes] no sense at all as far as rail users in my constituency or I am concerned”. Sources in the Department for Transport said Grayling had not been convinced by the business case presented by Khan. The transport secretary is thought to have scant regard for the Labour mayor’s closer relations with rail unions Grayling has condemned in the Southern dispute. Khan said he would keep pushing for devolution, although the mayor’s office conceded that the decision meant TfL was unlikely to take control of other rail services at the end of the decade as planned. “The only proven way of improving services for passengers is giving control of suburban rail lines to TfL,” Khan said. “There is cross-party support for this from MPs, assembly members, councils inside and out of London, and businesses and their representatives.” The news emerged as Grayling outlined potentially far-reaching reforms, including plans for a fully privatised railway line with track and trains operated by the same company. A new body, East West Rail, will be created in early 2017 to build and develop a rail line linking Oxford and Cambridge, and will be expected to eventually run the trains too.
While Grayling denied he was intent on privatising Network Rail, unions denounced his plans as “piecemeal privatisation”. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This is the Tory government dragging the railways back to the failed and lethal Railtrack model of the private sector running infrastructure.” The transport secretary told the House of Commons that he would build on two major reports into the rail industry, the 2011 McNulty report and the 2015 Shaw report, that advocated cost-cutting, devolution and bringing in private finance. He added: “But there is much more to do.” Future rail franchises will have to create integrated operating teams between train operating companies and Network Rail. Grayling said: “I believe it will mean they run better on a day-to-day basis … Our railway is much better run by one joined-up team of people.”
Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said they were the “wrong plans” for the railways. He said: “Inviting private train companies to take responsibility for safety, critical repairs and maintenance is an irresponsible move. We don’t want to see a return to the bad old days of Railtrack, where under-investment and a poor safety record led to passengers being put at risk. “Private companies are only likely to have concern for our infrastructure for their period of commercial interest, but our railways require long-term investment and strategic thinking.” Meanwhile, Grayling said he would meet the RMT union over the Southern dispute, but only if it suspended its industrial action. Cash said his union had been seeking talks with Grayling since he was appointed to his role in June. But Grayling signalled he was unlikely to get involved in talks, saying it would not be “proper for me to insert myself into a negotiation between a private company and a trade union over a strike I think is politically motivated”. Southern is changing the role of conductors and bringing in more driver-only operated trains, which unions argue threatens safety as well as jobs. Commuters on the troubled network suffered further disruption on Tuesday as an overtime ban by Aslef’s drivers took effect, compounding a fresh three-day strike by conductors in the RMT. Southern, which does not have enough drivers to operate its timetable, has told customers it expects services to be severely disrupted until further notice. The company is seeking an injunction to halt Aslef’s industrial action, and a hearing is due at the high court in London on Wednesday. Further strikes by the RMT and Aslef are planned in the run-up to Christmas and over the new year."
2016-12-06T17:45:54Z,uk-news,UK news,West Yorkshire police and agencies 'failed to protect' groomed girl,"Police and social services in West Yorkshire were guilty of “a serious systematic failure” to safeguard a vulnerable girl who was groomed and raped by at least 13 men, an investigation has found. A serious case review by the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board found insufficient steps were taken to protect the girl from exploitation. Known by the pseudonym Autumn, the girl was 12 when she was assessed by the children’s charity Barnados as being at high risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE). At that point, in July 2010, she had gone missing twice from her home in Keighley, near Bradford, and had received texts and phone calls from much older, unknown men. The review said West Yorkshire police held the belief that children such as Autumn were “actively consenting and choosing to become involved” with the men. Although members of Autumn’s family suspected she was being exploited it was not until July 2012 that police began to actively investigate her abusers. By that point she had been recorded missing 70 times, her school attendance was down to 42%, and she had been deemed by social workers to be “in the top 10 young people at risk of CSE in Bradford”. The review blamed a “multi-agency failure” to respond appropriately after Autumn reported being raped in May 2011, when she was 13. She quickly withdrew the allegations and police did not try to get her to consent to a forensic examination. Neither police, nor her school, nor her GP reported the allegation to Children’s Specialist Services. No pertinent questions were asked when she went to get a contraceptive implant fitted in March 2012, despite local concerns “about young girls being encouraged by groomers to have implants fitted”. In September 2011, staff at Autumn’s school found a used condom in her coat. They threw it away after calling the police, who said no crime had been committed and so it could be disposed of, rather than it being analysed for DNA. Autumn reported being terrified that her abusers would hurt her or her family. In July 2011 her school and police recorded an incident in which Autumn alleged she had been “roughed up” by an Asian man. Buttons were missing from her shirt and there were finger/hand marks where she had been grabbed. The report noted she wasn’t medically examined but staff from her school “were sufficiently concerned about the external threats to Autumn to have stopped picking her up in their own car”. Police installed alarms at Autumn’s grandmother’s house, where she was living, and the fire service fitted alarms and devices to the letter box to protect it from petrol bombs. In February 2012, three masked men assaulted Autumn’s uncle with a baseball bat. He believed the men wanted Autumn’s laptop, which contained photos and phone numbers. The uncle was left with 18 stitches in a head wound and Autumn told the local CSE worker she had broken ribs. This was neither reported nor investigated further. “The police also defined Autumn as unreliable and as someone who would lie to them at this time and this was communicated to other agencies,” the review authors said. At the time, West Yorkshire police held the view “that troublesome teenagers going missing were diverting attention from other strategic priorities in relation to acquisitive crime”, they said. Twelve men, aged 19 to 63, were jailed in February for abusing Autumn. But her main abuser, a convicted drug dealer called Arif Chowdhury, who took her virginity when he raped her in May 2011, skipped bail and was later tracked down living in Bangladesh. Det Supt Nick Wallen, the investigating officer, confirmed on Tuesday they were still trying to bring a final suspect back to Britain: “At the moment there are some difficult logistical and diplomatic difficulties in respect of where we believe he is in the world. West Yorkshire police are absolutely determined to bring him back to face justice.” He said the force accepted all of the criticisms in the report. All of Autumn’s abusers were of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin. She looked white, but her paternal grandfather was Pakistani and she grew up in a predominantly Asian part of her community, with relatively few white families living nearby. When she started secondary school she “embraced aspects of a Pakistani identity”, wearing Asian dress and speaking some Urdu, the review said. Prity Patel, who chaired the review, said the panel examined whether any of the failures were due to misplaced political correctness which made the authorities reluctant to blame Asian men for grooming white girls. “It was something that was considered as part of the review. But as part of the process, practitioners were spoken to and there was no evidence we could find that it had a bearing on what happened to Autumn,” Patel said. David Niven, the independent chair of the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, said: “These offences were committed a number of years ago. So much since then has changed in awareness, learning and education when it comes to the sexual exploitation of children. We all learn things in retrospect. Of course, we wish we were as aware then as we are now – our work with Autumn has shown that. “With all we have learned since then, I am absolutely convinced that many other potential Autumns have been prevented in the last few years.” West Yorkshire police said it was investigating complaints from 222 potential CSE victims against 284 suspects in the Bradford district. • This article was amended on 7 December 2016 to correct an editing error which resulted in a misspelling of Prity Patel’s name"
2016-12-06T19:30:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Staff at Cameron and Xi pub bought by Chinese say nothing will change,"Many a British leader has propped up the bar of the Plough at Cadsden, a tiny hamlet near Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, since it opened its doors in the 16th century. They include Harold Wilson, Edward Heath – who locals say called in for a swift one on his way home one day – and the Camerons, who famously left their then eight-year-old daughter Nancy behind after a visit in 2012. The Plough, with its exposed brick walls and low-hanging wooden beams, is a hilly stroll away from Chequers, the official country residence of the prime minister, after all. Describing itself as “probably the most famous pub in England”, it sits in a small valley just beside the Ridgeway, an ancient footpath considered to be Britain’s oldest road. And on Tuesday afternoon, as a dense December mist descended on the inn and its surrounding woodlands and green fields, the phones started ringing off the hook. Hours earlier, it was reported that the tavern had been sold by its long-time owner, Steve Hollings, to Chinese investors for an undisclosed fee. The news came a little more than a year after Cameron and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sealed the UK and China’s “golden” friendship over a fish and chip supper and a pint of Greene King IPA.
Since that day, the Plough has become a symbol of warming but controversial diplomatic relations between the two countries, as well as a tourist attraction for Chinese visitors who are keen to sample the classic British food and beer on offer. Paul Hackett, who became manager of the pub two weeks ago, said Hollings and his wife, Sharon, sold the pub because “they’d been here for 18 years, they wanted to retire and enjoy the fruits of their labour”. According to Hackett, many Chinese tourists come to the pub on a regular basis and have their photos taken next to the picture of their president. “We’ve got 28 tourists coming in just on Thursday,” he said. “I think maybe the Chinese look at their politicians slightly differently than we do.”
The attraction, he added, was that it was “a nice pub with a beautiful atmosphere and clientele. You could be walking across the Ridgeway and could come in here and have a pint of ale. That’s paradise,” he said. Which is perhaps why the Plough has always been a watering hole to the well-heeled and famous. Its website says it “regularly hosts a variety of local celebrities from the world of film, television and the music industry”, and even appeared in the Midsomer Murders TV series.
“It shouldn’t lose any of its magic,” Hackett said, addressing concerns that the pub’s atmosphere would change with its owners. “Steve and his wife were very central to the success of the pub because they were the personality of the pub. Successful pubs revolve around landlords, and I think the new owners will find somebody who will come and love it as much as they did. “How it operates day to day won’t change. I’ve had a few negative comments from locals only because they didn’t understand what happened. Most of the regulars were already aware that Steve had sold it – people who weren’t regulars were concerned, but only because people don’t like change. “If somebody were to say ‘do you think it’s going to change into a Chinese restaurant’, I’d think it was a ridiculous comment. I was talking about it with the fish men today, we don’t bat an eyelid, because in the same way we go ‘let’s go and have a Chinese’, I’m sure the Chinese go ‘let’s go out and have an English’.” Freya Pharo, who has been bar manager at the Plough for the past eight months, was also unconcerned about potential changes. “I’m in control of all front of house, the plan is to keep it exactly the same as it is,” she said. “I know how it was run when Steve was here, so I can keep things the same as they’ve always been.”
Pharo said the pub had not changed much since she started working there last year. “I’ve had many conversations with David Cameron,” she recalled. “I’m a Labour supporter but he’s a lovely man. In the last couple of months when he was prime minister he was coming down here often. When he did people acted normally, you’d see heads turning but that’s it. He wasn’t here as prime minister, he was just here for a drink with his family.” Pharo was interrupted in the middle of her sentence by the phone ringing again. “We don’t really have a landlord at the moment,” she told the caller. “We’ve got owners ... Well you can’t, they’re in China at the moment.” She put the phone down and turned back to continue: “There’s nowhere else in the area particularly local to here. We’re kind of in the middle of nowhere,” she said. “The regulars have been coming here for years, this pub is like its own community. We have people who come here daily, there’s about 20 to 30 of them who are here every night. Mostly men over 40, but it varies. There’s Ben who is 23, and Stuart, who comes in with his 18-year-old son. Friday nights are the big get-together, when the blokes all bring their wives along, it’s the end of work and everyone comes down to the pub.” Hackett and Pharo were jovial as they prepared the bar for its evening opening. We briefly discussed the pub’s history, including reports that in 1643 a wake was held here for John Hampden, one of the MPs whose arrest by King Charles I sparked the English civil war, by his Greencoats regiment, who called in while escorting his body back to the family home at Great Hampden from Thame in Oxfordshire, where he died following the Battle of Chalgrove Field. Then there is the mystery of Halina Żaboklicka, a Polish woman whose treasured letters were found in the pub’s old barn during a clear-out in 1995 by the then owners Jo Dorkings and Joe Stephens. The letters were stuffed into a handbag hiding in the corner of the room along with documents and photographs, and next to it was a Polish army uniform and two cameras. Żaboklicka was in her early 20s and was an Auxillary Territorial Service member during the second world war, according to her Polish identification number. The date of her letters ranged from 1942-46. “They never figured out why she ended up at Cadsden,” Pharo mused."
2016-12-06T19:36:21Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK investment shows signs of slowing, says ONS","British businesses are becoming more reluctant to spend, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK relies heavily on consumers to prop up the post-Brexit vote economy. In its latest monthly snapshot of the UK economy, the ONS said there were signs that business investment growth was starting to slow. Investment by companies grew by 0.9% in the third quarter, down from 1% in the previous quarter. It fell by 1.6% on an annual basis. “While there has been stronger consumer spending and retail growth, the contribution from investment has showed signs of waning slightly in recent quarters,” the ONS said.
Investment among Britain’s manufacturers started to fall back from the turn of 2016, while investment in other sectors has driven an overall increase. Machinery and IT investment is still 8% below its pre-crisis levels. Nick Vaughan, the chief economist at the ONS, said that while the Brexit vote in June had had a notable impact on the value of the pound, driving the currency sharply lower, the broader economy was as yet relatively unscathed. He said: “The economy as a whole has continued to grow roughly on trend with both consumer spending and business investment holding up. Meanwhile, the number of people in work has remained at a record high, although there are perhaps some early signs that the long and steady growth in employment we’ve seen these last few years is starting finally to slow.” The ONS said that there were signs in recent months that the weaker pound, which makes British goods cheaper abroad, had boosted exports. “Anecdotal evidence from our survey respondents suggests that some buyers brought forward UK export orders in order to take advantage of the lower levels of sterling,” it said. In value terms, manufacturing export turnover rose by 9.6% in the year to September, while domestic turnover was roughly flat. However, the weaker pound is starting to push up the prices of raw materials for UK companies, which are having to pay more for imported goods and oil, which is priced in dollars. The services sector, including hotels, restaurants and bars, as well as professional and business services, has been strong compared with other parts of the UK economy since the financial crisis. However, the ONS said it was being held back by financial services, where output remains 10% below the levels in the third quarter of 2009."
2016-12-06T23:14:26Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's trade deficit before Brexit vote narrower than first calculated,"Britain’s trade deficit in the months before the Brexit vote was narrower than first calculated after the government’s statistics agency uncovered a major mistake in monthly import and export data going back to 2015. The multi-billion pound errors mean the UK appears to have relied slightly less on the “kindness of strangers” in the run up to the referendum. Bank of England governor Mark Carney used the phrase to highlight how Britain, to balance its books, depends on foreign investors to bridge the shortfall in the balance of payments with the rest of the world. After the Office for National Statistics revised down the gap to 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) from 7%, Britain no longer chalked up a record deficit in the final three months of 2015. The downward revision continued into 2016. Carney’s warning was widely seen as an intervention in the Brexit vote and revealed his concern that a no vote would worsen an already deteriorating situation. But while the trade deficit was healthier than previously estimated before the referendum, the ONS found that a deteriorating picture emerged following the Brexit decision, with the figures in the three months to the end of September widening from an initial £11.1bn to a record £17bn. Trade in goods and services is the largest component of a country’s current account balance. “It’s a difficult area of the economy to measure, in fairness to the ONS, but these are big revisions and you get this unease in drawing firm conclusions on the external position of the UK,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. The current account deficit for 2015, while cut from an earlier 5.4% of GDP, was still the largest on record at 5%. The gap for the second quarter of 2016 was revised down to 5.4% from 5.9%. Former BoE deputy governor Charles Bean said in a report earlier this year that many UK statistics were “deficient” and that the ONS needed to improve its capabilities. The agency said revisions were due to a “processing error” in how it factored in trade in gold, part of a category known as erratics – which also includes precious gems and aircraft – that can sometimes distort monthly trade figures due to unpredictable flows. “Because the ‘erratics’ series is volatile, a total trade series that excludes erratics may provide a better guide to the emerging trade picture,” the ONS said."
2016-12-07T09:00:26Z,uk-news,UK news,China's terracotta warriors to return to UK for first time in nearly a decade,"China’s terracotta warriors are to return to the UK almost a decade after they thrilled visitors in a landmark exhibition at the British Museum. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, announced that Liverpool’s World Museum would be the next destination for the spectacular treasures which China’s first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, had made to accompany him into the afterlife. Bradley is in China on a cultural bridge-building mission. She said: “The terracotta army represents one of the most significant archaeological excavations of the 20th century, and I am delighted that a selection of the warriors will be coming to Liverpool for the first time in 2018. I am sure that the exhibition will be very warmly received by the people of Merseyside and beyond as Britain welcomes back the terracotta warriors. “The exhibition will also encourage an ongoing cultural exchange between China and Britain, further progressing the relationship between our two nations and strengthening lasting ties.” The warriors were last in the UK in 2007 for what was the British Museum’s second most successful exhibition ever after the Tutankhamun fever of 1972. That show was seen by 1.7 million people, while the terracotta army was seen by 850,000. Before that the warriors were last in the UK in 1985, at a much smaller exhibition at the City Art Centre in Edinburgh. Liverpool expects the blockbuster show to be on a similar scale to London, with visitors from across the UK and Europe. About 120 objects or sets of objects will be on display, some of which have never been seen in the UK. Unlike the London show, it will cover the the pre-unification Qin kings (307 to 221BC) and the first emperor’s legacy in the Han Dynasty (206BC to AD220). David Fleming, director of National Museums Liverpool, said the organisation was “hugely excited” to have signed a memorandum of understanding to bring the warriors to the city. The show will run for six months from February to October 2018. “Following the success of our Mayas exhibition in 2015, and the reopening of our Ancient Egypt gallery in 2017, this is a significant time for World Museum and National Museums Liverpool. It is really important that we stay in healthy dialogue with our international colleagues.” Fleming said it would be a particularly proud moment for the city as Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe. “We are proud to be strengthening the city’s connections with other cultural organisations in China and creating an exhibition programme that continues to excite and inspire visitors from across the globe,” he added. It was 1974 when a man digging a well struck upon one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries the world has seen. Since then, more than 8,000 lifesized terracotta warriors – with individual clothing, hair and facial features – have been discovered near the city of Xi’an. They tell a remarkable story about an emperor who put an end to 350 years of warring states in the late third century BC and wanted to extend his rule into eternity. The vast army of clay warriors was there to protect him forever. This week, Bradley is leading a delegation of the UK’s cultural industries to China, the latest attempt to build bridges after the damaging row earlier this summer over Hinkley Point C. Last month Theresa May talked about a “golden era” of relations between the two countries as she met Ma Kai, one of China’s vice-premiers. The UK has been using culture as a soft power tool in China for a number of years. This year, for example, the Royal Shakespeare Company embarked on its first major tour of China and the British Library has organised exhibitions with literary treasures such as Shakespeare’s First Folio and Charlotte Bronte’s fair copy manuscript to Jane Eyre. Bradley also visited the McKinnon Hotel in Shanghai where the theatre group Punchdrunk is about to open its hit show Sleep No More with Chinese partners."
2016-12-07T14:14:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Major cut in EU migrants risks long-term damage to UK economy – report,"A major cut in immigration from the European Union to Britain after Brexit would produce a damaging long-term hit to future economic growth while yielding only a “modest boost” of under 1% to the wages of low-paid workers, new research has found. The study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank says a “middle range” Brexit where EU immigration falls by as much as 91,000 a year would cut the growth of gross domestic product per head by 3.4% lower than it would otherwise have been by 2030. But in the more extreme scenario of a hard Brexit where EU immigration was cut by 150,000 a year – which may be needed to hit Theresa May’s 100,000 a year net migration target – the economists say this would hit annual GDP per head by 5.4%. While the economy was taking such a long-term damaging hit the NIESR economists say the effect on wages of those in low-skilled jobs in the most directly affected industries such as construction, retail, hospitality and food processing would be, if at all, relatively modest. The study’s “middle range” scenario says the pay of those in such low-skilled jobs would rise by up to 0.51% by 2030 while in the hard Brexit scenario they would increase by 0.82% a year.
Jonathan Portes, NIESR research fellow and one of the report’s authors, said: “Prior to the referendum, a number of analyses estimated the long-term impacts of Brexit on the UK economy; but none incorporated the impacts of Brexit-induced reductions in migration. Our estimates suggest that the negative impacts on per capita GDP will be significant, potentially approaching those resulting from reduced trade.” He said the 3.4% hit to per capita GDP from a 91,000 reduction in EU migration in the NIESR’s central scenario was on a similar scale to the impact from the falls in trade and investment projected by the Treasury, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the Brexit referendum. The analysis by Portes and his co-author, Giuseppe Forte, shows that the economic damage of deep cuts in EU migration go even beyond the estimate made by the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the chancellor’s autumn statement last month. The OBR, in the absence of a new government policy on immigration, based its assumptions on a conservative 80,000 a year reduction in net migration to Britain. It estimated that this cut would cost the economy £0.8bn in 2016-17 rising to £5.9bn a year by 2000-21 and with a total hit of £16bn over the next five years. The NIESR estimate suggests a similar fall in EU immigration will prove even more damaging to the British economy. This is because, unlike the OBR model, it includes an assumption that the fall in net migration will also cut the growth in labour productivity in Britain by reducing the competition for work. The authors say their analysis uses a methodology similar to that employed by mainstream economic forecasters to model the impact of Brexit-induced reductions in trade on productivity and growth. “The broad scenario (not forecasts) we depict imply that the negative impacts on per capita GDP will be significant, potentially approaching those resulting from reduced trade. By contrast, the increase in low-skilled wages, resulting from reduced migration is expected to be, if at all, relatively modest,” they conclude. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said she welcomed the report as it was being published at a time when evidence-based analysis on immigration and its effects was becoming a rarity: “The report requires further scrutiny, but in broad terms it clearly shows that economic growth would be hit substantially by sharp cuts in immigration, while any boost to wages is likely to be minimal and confined to some of the very lowest-paid sectors. “Labour will offer a fair immigration policy, which benefits the whole economy and maximises prosperity for all. The government should abandon its unachievable and damaging net migration targets.”"
2016-12-07T17:01:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Family criticises social services over deaths of elderly couple in Wales,"The family of an 86-year-old man who bludgeoned his wife to death then tried to kill himself have said authorities did not do enough to help him cope with caring for her. Angus Mayer had gone to a train station to kill himself. After he was found on the tracks he told a police officer who came to his aid: “I’ve killed my wife. She has Alzheimer’s. I didn’t want her to suffer any more.” “I just want to die. Let me die. I’m going to be spending the rest of my life in prison. My wife suffers with dementia and incontinence. She told me if I ever put her in a home she’d kill herself. I told her it would be quick then I’d throw myself under a train.” Police rushed to the Mayers’ house in Heath, Cardiff, and forced their way in to find Margaret Mayer, 85, dead in the couple’s bed. An inquest into her death heard on Wednesday that she had suffered from Alzheimer’s disease for four years and was progressively getting worse. Pathologist Dr Ryk James said she suffered eight blunt-force injuries to her head and face, while a bedside lamp with its base stained in blood was found nearby. Injuries to her hands meant she may have raised them to protect her face, he added. “My wife took a lot of killing,” Mayer later told paramedics. “I just wanted to suffocate her. There was a lot of blood.” The coroner was told that in the months before Mayer killed his wife, the couple’s six children had become increasingly worried about the strain that caring was having on him. They had raised concerns in February, after which Margaret Mayer began attending a day centre twice a week. But in the week before her death, in July, the children again contacted Cardiff council about their fears. The council’s adult services manager told the inquest there was nothing to suggest Margaret Mayer was in danger and, in hindsight, nothing would have been done differently. But the couple’s sons questioned why the wider family was not contacted in early July when there were concerns. “The council were passive rather than proactive,” their son Andrew, a BBC cameraman, said. “We don’t think the system is fit for purpose.” Mayer, a retired salesman, had travelled three miles to Cardiff Central station and slid down the platform as a London Paddington to Swansea train pulled in. The inquest heard that he told a conductor he had wanted the train to run over his head. “But I couldn’t even do that right,” he added. Mayer was charged with murder while in hospital, but died from his injuries seven weeks later. In a letter to the inquest, Mayer’s children said their father “wanted to enjoy independent living, but, caught in the fog of fatigue, he gave up”. The letter added that the family “will never know” if their parents would be alive today if more had been done. The coroner, Andrew Barkley, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing."
2016-12-07T17:59:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"Oxford student didn't go partying before French Alps death, says brother","The brother of an Oxford undergraduate who is believed to have died of a heart attack in the French Alps has criticised reports that he had been partying before his death. Matt Smith, 21, is understood to have suffered cardiac arrest after the first night of the Oxford and Cambridge universities’ ski trip in Val Thorens on Sunday morning. The state prosecutor in Albertville, Jean-Pascal Violet, said the authorities suspected “heart failure linked to a combination of consuming alcohol and medicines” but that they had no certainty that this was true. Smith’s brother Harry told the Guardian: “Matt had definitely not gone out drinking or partying upon arrival in the resort. He went straight to his girlfriend’s hotel room, and so we believe it must have been an underlying health condition. “It’s been upsetting how most articles have been focusing on details which aren’t even true. There has been little attention to the fact that he was an excellent academic and sportsman who had achieved so much in his 21 years. He brought joy to so many around him and it’s deeply saddening how early he was taken. “My family and I have been incredibly touched by the amazing love and support that we have been receiving. We have had messages from friends new and old, near and far. Matt would’ve been extremely proud of the support that his friends have been showing.” It has also been reported that the postmortem examination revealed “no evidence of an intervention by a third party”. Smith was in his third year studying history at St John’s College and, according to Facebook, had recently completed a three-month internship as a junior press officer at Sotheby’s in London. In tribute to his brother, Harry Smith added: “He was brilliant, charming and much more than a brother to me, he was a mentor and someone that I strived to be like while also being my best friend. Without him I wouldn’t be who I am today. He brought so much joy to my life and many others, and the memories we all shared with him will stay with us forever. I loved him so much and I’m going to miss him more than words can describe.” Thousands of Oxbridge students arrived at the French ski resort, the highest in Europe, at the weekend for the annual event, a fixture on the social calendars of both universities. Publicity for this year’s event billed it as the biggest ski party in the world. “Those lucky enough to attend can ski all day on the slopes of one of the best ski areas in the world, and party all night,” one advert said. Eóin Barrett-Fulton, who attended Bedford modern school with Smith for nine years, said: “There is no way I could possibly put into words how much Matt meant to me. There was never a dull moment with Matt, be it traveling the world, rowing the Thames, or just hanging out at his house and doing nothing, Matt was always there with a smile on his face and an idea of something fun to do to pass the time.”
James Rodgers, who also went to school with Matt, said: “I want him to be remembered as the statuesque individual he was. In life, his person and his achievements towered above everyone else. He achieved so much in such a short life yet remained endlessly humble.”"
2016-12-07T18:11:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Illustrious farewell: aircraft carrier leaves port bound for scrapyard,"The former Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, known to her crews down the years as Lusty, left Portsmouth naval base for the last time on Wednesday, bound for a Turkish scrapyard. Former crewmembers and their families were joined by onlookers on the harbour walls to give three cheers and wave goodbye as the vessel set off. The Illustrious, launched on the Tyne by Swan Hunter in 1978, was still being fitted out when the Falklands war began in 1982. It was rushed into service, but by the time it arrived in the South Atlantic, the hostilities had ended. It went on to take part in combat operations in the Balkans, Iraq and Sierra Leone, and latterly in humanitarian work such as helping to deliver aid in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013. A six-part documentary, Warship, broadcast on Channel 5 in 2011, followed the Illustrious during deployments in the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia. Although efforts were made to retain Illustrious as a museum piece or a hotel, the Ministry of Defence decided none of the bids were viable and instead decided to sell it to the scrapyard for £2.1m. David Stares, 51, from Fareham, who served as an able seaman aboard Illustrious between 1982 and 1985, told PA: “She was a lovely ship. She was cutting-edge technology. Now she’s gone despite a lot of people wanting to save her. She was a brilliant ship, great crew – she was a large family.” The carrier had to be moved from its berth in Portsmouth so that work could begin on harbour and dockyard renovations in preparation for the arrival next year of the first of two new carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, is scheduled to arrive a year later. Captain Jerry Kyd, former commanding officer of HMS Illustrious and now commanding officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth, said: “Lusty provided a world-class service to the Royal Navy, and we bid her goodbye with fond memories. As she leaves Portsmouth, I’m looking forward to the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth, which will ensure that we remain a global maritime power.” The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said: “Over three decades, Illustrious set the highest standards for service that the Royal Navy will continue with HMS Queen Elizabeth when she arrives into Portsmouth next year.” The navy’s surface fleet has been dwindling, with the number of frigates and destroyers now at a level that a Commons defence select committee report this month described as “woefully low”. Some navy analysts have argued that instead of two big-budget carriers – potentially vulnerable to airstrikes, given ever more sophisticated technology - the money would have been better spent on expanding the number of frigates and destroyers. The decision to scrap the carrier was taken as part of the 2010 defence review, and it left service in 2014. It is the last of the Invincible class of aircraft carriers that included the Ark Royal and Invincible."
2016-12-07T19:14:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Myron Yarde stabbing: three teenagers found guilty of manslaughter,"Three teenagers have been found guilty of the manslaughter of Myron Yarde, a 17-year-old aspiring rapper from south London who was stabbed to death in a fight over a stolen bicycle. Myron, who performed under the pseudonym Mdot, was backed up against a wall in New Cross, south London, and stabbed five times in the legs on the evening of 13 April this year. He collapsed near the scene, bleeding heavily from a severed femoral artery, and was pronounced dead shortly after arriving in hospital. Fauz Richards, 19, known as Mags or Maggie, and two youths aged 15 and 16, who cannot be named, were acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter after a trial at the Old Bailey. Adjourning sentencing until 13 January, the judge Nicholas Cooke said “the evil” of knife crime “has to stop – too many young men lose their lives in this way”. Myron was the second teenager to die in a knife attack on the streets of London this year. A promising rapper who was studying music performance at the Big Creative academy in Walthamstow, his death led to an outpouring of grief on social media, much of it carrying the hashtags #Mdot, #Mdotsworld and #RIPmdot. Hundreds of people turned out for Myron’s Nine-Nights at a community hall on the Woodpecker estate, where he lived and had grown up. One local woman said she believed him to be the 14th young person from the neighbourhood to be killed in 17 years. The events that led to Myron’s death were the culmination of friction arising partly from the theft of a bicycle, but also from ongoing tension between youths living in neighbouring parts of New Cross, Lisa Wilding QC, the prosecutor, told jurors. Myron had lent his bike to his friend Leoandro Osemeke, 16 – who was himself later fatally stabbed in an unrelated incident in nearby Peckham – who had ridden it to the rival Monson neighbourhood to buy pizza, the court heard. After Leoandro arrived in Monson, the bicycle was snatched.
It was said that Myron armed himself with a machete as he and a group of friends ventured into Monson to get the bike back. The court heard that the youngest defendant lured four of them to Camplin Street, where Richards lived. There, that same defendant was said to have taunted Myron, telling him: “What you gonna do? My olders are here now.” All three defendants, who the court told were armed with a flick-knife and two kitchen knives, cornered Myron, who was backed up against a wall as two of his friends ran off. According to Myron’s remaining friend, who tried to stop the killing, the victim tried to lash out at Richards before being stabbed. Jurors also heard accounts from members of the public at the scene. “It is clear that the events on Camplin Street were fast, terrifying and shocking, both for participants and witnesses,” Wilding said. “Each witness noticed different things and had a different perspective. What is clear is that at the moment he was fatally stabbed, Myron Yarde quite literally had his back against the wall. The eyewitnesses did not see him with a weapon, nor do anything that amounted to assaulting or trying to assault any of those who had him surrounded.” Regardless of whether he was armed at the time of the attack, Myron was “effectively helpless”, Wilding added. Upon hearing on Snapchat that Myron had been seriously injured, the 15-year-old defendant allegedly said: “Why the F did he have to come to Monson? I think I’ve killed him.” When he was arrested four days later, he told officers: “Some people deserve to die, I just mean not everyone is innocent, including that boy that died.” The defendants all denied murder and were found not guilty of that charge but guilty of manslaughter. The 15-year-old told jurors that he had stabbed Myron once in self-defence, causing the fatal wound, and that Richards had knifed him four times. Richards told jurors he was not at the scene and a witness was mistaken. However, a red and white kitchen knife found in his back garden had Myron’s blood on it, the court heard. The 16-year-old defendant did not give evidence. The machete Myron was said to have had on him was not found at the scene. Charlotte Edmonds, 32, and Jamie Kennedy, 31, of New Cross, were convicted of perverting the course of justice."
2016-12-07T20:33:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Amnesty for gay men convicted under outdated laws extended to Northern Ireland,"An amnesty for gay and bisexual men convicted of consensual sex with people of the same sex has been extended to Northern Ireland. Until Wednesday, the region was excluded from legislation that posthumously pardons men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal and allows the living to apply to have convictions overturned. The legislation did not apply to Northern Ireland because justice powers have been devolved to the Stormont parliament since 2010. But an amendment to the policing and crime bill tabled in the House of Lords by Lord Lexden on Wednesday was passed, and means that hundreds of Northern Irish gay and bisexual men can apply to have their names cleared of such offences. Announcing the measure, Northern Ireland Office minister Kris Hopkins said: “It is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today. While respecting that this is a devolved issue in Northern Ireland, both the secretary of state and I voted in support of equal marriage in England and Wales in 2013 and will continue to advocate LGBT equality issues across the UK. “Today’s amendment is an important milestone for tolerance and equality in Northern Ireland and I welcome it unreservedly.” An applicant from Northern Ireland will now be eligible for a “disregard” if the other person involved consented and was aged 17 or over at the time, and the conduct would not now constitute the offence of sexual activity in a public lavatory. The Northern Ireland Department of Justice must be satisfied that the conduct is no longer criminal. A similar scheme operates for offences in England and Wales. The legislation has been nicknamed Turing’s law, after the Bletchley Park codebreaker and father of modern computing, Alan Turing, who killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of gross indecency with a 19-year-old man in 1952. The British government only pardoned Turing for his conviction in 2013. The amendment is different from the “Turing law” proposed by John Nicolson of the SNP, which would have given an automatic pardon to men convicted under the obsolete laws relating to gross indecency with other men. It was obstructed in October by a justice minister, Sam Gyimah, who ensured the bill could not go forward because he spoke for so long that it ran out of time. However, the Scottish parliament is bringing forward a Scottish “Turing law” to automatically pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer criminal. Northern Ireland is still the main battleground in the UK in the struggle for gay rights. It remains the only region where gay marriage is not recognised in law, mainly due to the opposition of the Democratic Unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly."
2016-12-07T21:14:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Investigation after death of second immigrant in UK detention in a week,"An investigation has been launched following the death of a second man in immigration detention in a week. Home Office officials confirmed that a 49-year-old man, who has not been named, died on Tuesday. He had been detained at Morton Hall immigration removal centre in Lincoln and died in hospital. The prisons and probation ombudsman is carrying out the investigation. Last Thursday, 64-year-old Tarek Chowdhury died at Colnbrook immigration removal centre near Heathrow. Zana Assad Yusif, 31, has been charged with his murder. The latest death brings the total death toll in immigration removal centres to 28 since 2000. Fellow detainees believe the man was from Sierra Leone. Medical Justice, a charity working to improve the health of immigration detainees, has accused the Home Office of failing to address systemic failings in the system. “We are saddened and deeply troubled by the reports of yet another death in detention, the second in only a week and the 28th death of an immigration detainee since 2000,” said Kris Harris, policy and research worker at Medical Justice. “Investigations into these deaths have revealed ongoing systemic failings and a failure to address these. We fear that as long as these failings go unaddressed we will continue to see deaths in detention. We call for urgent action and our thoughts are with the family of the dead man and all those held in immigration detention.” One detainee at Morton Hall posted a message on Detained Voices about the latest death. It read: “He was a very quiet man. He kept himself to himself. He was very caring and helpful to people doing applications and writing letters. He would just help people through the goodness of his heart for nothing in return. He was a really nice person. You don’t often find people like that. When you find them it’s like a diamond in the rough, you know. “He’s also the type of person who you can talk to if you’re stressed out in detention. He would talk to you and say keep strong when he saw that you were depressed or stressed out. When a guy like that leaves us like this, it puts a lot of stress on the people who really connected with him on a spiritual level. If he was given bail and left here [sic]. People would have been proud and happy. But the way he left, really weighs heavy on your heart. “The tone is not good at Morton Hall. Everyone is sad.” IRC Morton Hall is a 392-bed unit run by the prison service on behalf of the Home Office. It was previously a women’s prison. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We can confirm that a 49-year-old man who had been detained at Morton Hall immigration removal centre died in hospital on the 6 December 2016. Our thoughts are with his family at this very sad time. A full independent investigation will be conducted by the prisons and probation ombudsman.”"
2016-12-07T23:31:19Z,uk-news,UK news,"Brexit talks without Wales's input is unconstitutional, warns Plaid Cymru","Welsh politicians are demanding a substantive role in the government’s Brexit negotiations to ensure their devolved powers are not diminished in the rush to exit the European Union. Plaid Cymru wants to be able to test the broad regulatory, legal and economic aspects of the Brexit package before the government triggers article 50 and believes it has a constitutional right to do so. Steffan Lewis, a member of the Welsh assembly, has tabled the notion of Britain following the reverse path accession states such as Romania and Bulgaria were forced to travel before approval was granted to join the EU.
Wales’s devolved powers policy responsibilities in agriculture, economic development, environment and food standards. If Wales wants to peg its food standards with the EU’s standards for instance, a broad UK-wide Brexit agreement may not be appropriate. Plaid Cymru says it will not be silenced just because it has not got the political heft in Westminster where Brexit decisions are being made. “If we don’t have the first phase of a joint and mature of respectful process in terms of establishing a UK position then it becomes difficult for the government to involve the different governments in the UK in the actual negotiations themselves,” Lewis said. Plaid Cymru says if it doesn’t get a mini “accession in reverse”, it will push for a European continuity bill to be published ahead of the great repeal bill promised by Theresa May to annul the 1972 European Communities Act. “The danger with the UK bill is that they decide to enact a bill that relates directly to the European Communities Act that could directly impact on devolved matters,” said Lewis. Otherwise, he says, the UK could be in danger of breaking the Welsh administration’s constitutional rights. Wales is the single biggest beneficiary of EU funding and its economy stands to be greatly damaged by the exit process. “We’re adamant as a party that we won’t give the government of the UK a blank cheque when it comes to Brexit,” said Lewis. His party fears that quitting the single market will destroy its ports, depopulate rural towns and villages and lead to further poverty in a part of the country which has already suffering wage stagnation. “We are hugely exposed,” he said. “This is why in terms of the post-withdrawal context, why we need to ensure that the funding levels are maintained at least. We cannot pretend that the UK is an economically homogenous state.”"
2016-12-08T07:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Sudanese refugee in UK voices fears for brother stranded in France,"A Sudanese radiographer living in Liverpool after fleeing Darfur has made an emotional plea to the government to be reunited with his teenage brother, who remains stranded in France five weeks after the Calais migrant camp was demolished. Mohamed Adam Hamad Ahamed said he was becoming increasingly anxious about his 17-year-old sibling Moubrak’s mental state. Moubrak is is one of more than 1,500 unaccompanied minors dispersed throughout France in temporary accommodation who have yet to find out whether they will be accepted into the UK. Ahamed’s hopes of seeing his brother for the first time in two years were raised when he received a phone call from a Home Office official in mid-October. But he has not heard anything since. “When [Moubrak] calls me, always he is crying,” Ahamed said. “I do not know what is going on. I can’t tell him, because I have not heard anything. The Home Office call came from a withheld number and I do not know who to call to find out what is happening.” Ahamed, 37, was told his brother could be eligible for a fast-track transfer to the UK under an EU law that allows unaccompanied minors to make asylum applications in another country if they have family there. Everything appeared in place after a follow-up visit from a social worker from Liverpool city council to verify there was a bed at Ahamed’s home. Five weeks on, he fears his brother will risk his life by returning to Calais and trying to jump on to a lorry. Moubrak told him he had been told by someone in authority that he was too tall to be 17, though he has documentary evidence to show he was born on 12 May 1999.
Ahamed was given asylum in the UK two years ago and is unlikely ever to be in a position to return to Darfur. “This situation is very, very bad in Sudan. People know about Syria, but people forget about Darfur,” he said. “There are still problems there, it is very bad, people being killed, areas where journalists cannot go. You cannot talk, you cannot say anything about this situation, no free talk, especially in Darfur. The government kill the black people and they give guns to other tribes to kill black people.” Ahamed is the eldest brother of a family of eight. They were moved to the Hesahesa displaced people camp in Zahinge after their home town was torched by the Janjaweed militia. Their mother was killed in an air raid. Government security forces threatened to kill Ahamed after he vocally objected to a decision to expel all foreign aid organisations from the camp. He escaped, and soon afterwards problems began for Moubark. “They said they would kill him if he didn’t tell them where I was,” Ahamed said. Moubark escaped too and set off on a treacherous journey involving people smugglers to try to join his brother in the UK. He found his way to the Calais camp, and disappeared during the clearance week. He was detained by the police and given sanctuary at a refuge is St Omer that deals with unaccompanied minors. “I want to leave, I can’t stay here,” Moubrak said. “In St Omer, I do not know what is happening.” Ahamed said: “My message to the Home Office is: I want my brother to join me here. He is only 17 years old. I want to be able to assure him that he can come. He is scared there.” Charities say the transfer of unaccompanied minors to the UK has virtually ground to a halt since the Calais camp was cleared, despite indications from the government in October that it would endeavour to take half of the young people from the camp, then estimated to total 1,300. Refugee Youth Service said it had lost contact with a third of the children it had been monitoring in the camp, and blamed a lack of information about their options. “This continued uncertainty and confusion escalates the children’s negative feelings of hopelessness and self-worth,” said Karen Moynihan, a protection officer with the group.
The Ahamed brothers are not the only relatives being kept in the dark. At a centre in Cayeux-sur-Mer, in northern France, 14-year-old Jamshid Jan is also waiting for news. Jamshid fled Afghanistan 18 months ago. “He disappeared for six months and we didn’t know where he was,” said his cousin Amruddin, 20, who works in London and drove to the Calais camp in October after discovering via Facebook that he was there. Jamshid stayed at the Calais camp for six months. “It felt like six years,” he said. He was threatened by older men and was at risk of people trafficking with no protective adult to care for him. “It is a better life here [in Cayeux-sur-Mer], but I do not know how long I will be here. I have been here for three weeks now and have no information,” he said. Amruddin came to the UK two years ago and now has indefinite leave to remain in the country. He says he will look after Jamshid and has made arrangements at his home to take him in. “He is my responsibility now. We want him with his, because we will be happy. He needs us.” But he said he had not heard from the Home Office. In a statement, the Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases. It said it had made “significant progress in improving and speeding up the existing processes since the beginning of the year” but added that “the primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French authorities.” Rabbi Janet Darley, the leader of Citizens UK, called on government to deliver on its promise. “We call on Amber Rudd [the home secretary] to keep her word and transfer half the children from Calais; there is no reason why this cannot happen before Christmas,” she said."
2016-12-08T07:49:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds of police in England and Wales accused of sexual abuse,"Hundreds of police officers are being accused of sexually abusing victims and suspects in what a senior police watchdog has called “the most serious corruption issue facing the service”. Forces across England and Wales received 436 allegations of abuse of power for sexual gain against 306 police officers, 20 police community support officers and eight staff in the two years to March but inspectors believe the problem is even more prevalent than the numbers suggest. Despite the large numbers, there is evidence that only 40 officers or staff have been dismissed for abusing authority for sexual gain in a similar period.
Vulnerable individuals, including domestic abuse victims, alcohol and drug addicts, sex workers and arrested suspects were among those targeted by officers and staff, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said. Victim groups have said the findings are “deeply concerning” and involved some of the most vulnerable people in society. Mike Cunningham, inspector of constabulary and former chief constable of Staffordshire police, said: “This is the most serious corruption issue facing the service. What can be worse than a guardian abusing the trust and confidence of an abused person? There can be no greater violation of public trust.” “It is probably more likely the problem is more serious than the numbers reported back to us,” he added. “In many cases the victims are vulnerable people. They are victims of domestic abuse, they’re victims who might have been arrested and they have drug or alcohol dependency. It is an exploitation of power where the guardian becomes the abuser.” One of the most high-profile cases of police officers abusing their power in recent history was that of Stephen Mitchell, who was jailed for life in 2011 for raping and sexually assaulting vulnerable women he had arrested. Mitchell, who was a constable with Northumbria police, abused heroin addicts, shoplifters and a disabled teenager by offering them help while in custody, then demanding sexual favours afterwards. Earlier this year, DS Robert Dawson, a Metropolitan police officer who had sex with a vulnerable alleged rape victim, was formally dismissed from the force. A tribunal heard that in 2010, while investigating an allegation of serious sexual assault, Dawson engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with the victim. PC Simon Salway, who had sex with vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime, and fathered a child with one of the women he exploited, was found guilty of six charges of misconduct in a public office at Luton crown court last year. HMIC found that more than a third (39%) of the allegations of abuse of authority for sexual gain involved victims of domestic abuse. As part of its research the inspectorate carried out an online survey of domestic abuse practitioners between July and August. Sixty-eight practitioners (16%) of the 414 who took part said victims of domestic abuse had disclosed that an officer or member of police staff had abused their authority to exploit them or develop an inappropriate relationship with them. The chief executive of the domestic violence charity Refuge, Sandra Horley, said: “Widespread reports of police officers exploiting women for sexual gain … are horrific – but unsurprising. “Refuge is glad HMIC’s report has shone a light on this issue, following a consultation with domestic violence practitioners including our frontline staff. The police are meant to protect the public from harm; how can women be expected to report their abuse, if they fear the police will abuse them all over again? Women have the right to safety and protection. “Refuge commends the work HMIC has already done in improving the police response to domestic violence; we hope this report will mean an end to what is an appalling abuse of power.” Mark Castle, chief executive of the independent charity Victim Support, said: “These allegations are deeply concerning. The victims involved are some of the most vulnerable people in our society, who have been exploited by the people they should be able to trust the most, the police. “In order to maintain public confidence in the police it’s critical that forces recognise this behaviour as the serious corruption that it is and report all cases to the IPCC to ensure that they are thoroughly and robustly investigated.” The HMIC findings formed part of a broader inspection of police legitimacy, which concluded victims’ satisfaction with the way they were treated by police remained high. The investigation was ordered by the then home secretary, Theresa May. But the inspectorate said forces still needed to become more proactive in rooting out officers and staff abusing power for sexual gain. This could involve profiling officers to single out those who might be likely to commit such abuse. Cunningham said one of the reasons the inspectorate believed the figures belied a greater problem was that forces in England and Wales did not have a consistent and coherent approach to tackling the problem. Not all forces class the abuse of authority for sexual gain as a serious corruption issue, which HMIC says they should. This would mean any allegation would be automatically referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation. HMIC was only able to find 40 cases on the national disapproved register in which officers or staff were dismissed for abusing power for sexual gain during the period in which more than 400 allegations were received. “What’s less clear is what’s happening with those allegations, how those allegations are being pursued, how they translate into gross misconduct hearings and sackings,” Cunningham said. HMIC said the problem remained despite recommendations in a 2012 IPCC report on the issue, which appear to have not been acted on. In her speech to the Police Federation conference earlier this year, May said: “We know of officers who develop inappropriate relationships with victims of domestic abuse. They have ignored their professional duty and their moral responsibility, and instead abused their position of power to exploit victims. We do not know the true scale of this, but everyone in this room will know it goes on far more than we might care to admit.”"
2016-12-08T08:31:24Z,uk-news,UK news,MPs launch inquiry seeking public views on immigration,"A committee of MPs has announced a new and far-reaching inquiry into the public’s view on immigration in the wake of Brexit, in which members will tour the country to seek views directly from the people affected. The investigation by the home affairs committee was being formally launched on Thursday by its chair, the Labour MP Yvette Cooper. In advance of the event, Cooper said the inquiry was needed to look into what sort of approach to immigration might be needed as the UK prepared to leave the EU. “Immigration is one of the most important issues facing our country and will be central to the Brexit deal,” Cooper said in extracts from a launch speech released in advance. “Britain voted for change, especially on free movement, but there has been very little debate about what kind of reforms or immigration control that should now mean or how we get the best deal for the country. “Successive governments have failed on immigration and public concern has grown. Yet too often the polarised nature of the debate makes it hard to get consensus over what should be done instead. If there is no consensus behind the most important parts of the Brexit deal, in the end it will unravel.” Cooper said the committee’s response was “a different kind of inquiry, looking outward at the country, not inward at the government”. She said: “Instead of just taking evidence in Westminster, we will be travelling round every region and nation, holding public meetings, bringing local people together for debates and discussions, citizen juries and online consultations.” The committee will also seek to inspire other organisations to run events and debates, including community and faith groups, councils and thinktanks. She said: “We want to hear people’s views both about immigration and about how they believe that common ground can be found to stop this issue dividing the country.” Cooper was elected by her fellow MPs to chair the committee in October, taking over from Keith Vaz who resigned the previous month after three days of allegations involving sex workers and drugs."
2016-12-08T09:45:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Sheffield council leader ignores calls to resign over 5am  tree felling operation,"A council leader has ignored calls to resign over a pre-dawn tree-felling operation in which five people were arrested. Simon Crump and Calvin Payne were detained in the battle over Sheffield’s tree-felling programme. Campaigners say 4,000 trees across the city have been chopped down since a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal with the private contractor Amey was signed in 2012. The deal to maintain the city’s roads and pavements is said to be transforming Sheffield’s roads “from some of the worst in the country to the best”. This month two women in their 70s spent eight hours in a police cell after they staged a similar demonstration to prevent trees on their road being chopped down. At a heated council meeting on Wednesday night, the Labour leader, Julie Dore, did not speak in response to a motion by the Liberal Democrat Joe Otten calling for her to go. Otten also called for the resignation of Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for the environment, over the events in Rustlings Road on 17 November. Campaigners said residents were woken at 5am to move their cars ahead of eight trees being chopped down in Rustlings Road as council contractors took part in a “secretly planned” operation, backed by police officers. The council subsequently apologised for the way the operation was handled and promised that future tree removals would not take place before 7am. At the council meeting in Sheffield town hall on Wednesday, Otten said an apology was not enough. Lodge responded by accusing the Liberal Democrat group of hypocrisy on the issue, claiming “trees were being felled across the city on a regular basis with no consultation with residents” when they controlled the local authority. Dore did not make a speech in relation to the motion and left the chamber for part of the debate on it, returning for the vote, which rejected it. Shaffaq Mohammed, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, said: “I expected her to be involved in this debate. This was the chance to look people in the eye and say: ‘We are sorry.’” Meanwhile, Dore said in an earlier meeting that she would be reporting the Sheffield Hallam MP Nick Clegg to the Parliamentary Standards Board over “out of order” comments she claims he made about her denying responsibility. “I have never said the decision on Rustlings Road was taken out of our hands,” she said. Before the council meeting, around 100 protesters gathered outside the town hall chanting “save our trees”, with dozens packing out the public gallery during the meeting."
2016-12-08T10:10:42Z,uk-news,UK news,MPs visit Sunderland to ask what city wants from Brexit negotiations,"MPs are visiting Sunderland on Thursday to take evidence from local politicians and business representatives on the consequences of Britain leaving the EU. The new Exiting the European Union select committee will ask key figures from the city and wider north-east what they want from the Brexit negotiations. The committee, led by the Labour MP Hilary Benn, will also seek to understand why Sunderland voted so resoundingly to leave the EU. To some outsiders, Sunderland’s 61.3% vote in favour of leaving the European Union didn’t seem to make sense. “What about Nissan?” they asked. The Japanese car company provides 7,000 jobs at its plant in Washington, a few miles out of the city, and supports a further 40,000 in the UK supply chain. About 80% of the 500,000 cars the plant produces each year are exported, many to the EU.
Others questioned how a region so reliant on EU funds could opt to leave the union that dished out the money. Sunderland has received more than £23m of direct investment from Europe since 2007, complemented by more than £130m of region-wide business support services accessible to a wide range of Sunderland firms, according to a report commissioned by the city’s economic leadership board before the referendum. The result was not much of a surprise to many people living in Sunderland, however. John Kelly, a Labour councillor for Washington North, which includes the Nissan plant, defied his party line by voting to leave. He told the Guardian that his constituents had been failed by globalisation. “My ward is one of the most deprived in the city of Sunderland and we weren’t seeing anything coming to us [from the EU]. Nissan has a fantastic workforce, is a fantastic employer, fantastic output, but that wasn’t being seen on the ground in Washington,” he said. “Europe had become a symbol of globalisation. I’m a local ward representative and to me I’ve got to represent the best interests of my ward and I genuinely didn’t think that Europe was doing that for us any more. Globalisation and the fact that people have been forgotten about in the race to make money, that’s what has an impact on my residents.”
Many Nissan workers voted to leave – a cheer reportedly rang through the factory on the night shift when Sunderland’s vote came through, with one employee telling the Guardian later that 19 out of 20 workers on his Infiniti luxury car production line had voted out. They, like Kelly, believed firmly that Nissan would not leave Washington – and they were proved right when, in late October, Nissan announced it was not only staying but would build two new models there. “There was no way on earth that Nissan, or Renault, the partners in [the] plant, were ever going to sacrifice a plant that has the highest output, the best workforce, the least amount of strikes,” said Kelly. He does not believe the EU will impose tariffs on Nissan. “It won’t happen because the Germans sell to us as many cars as we sell to them. Charge us 10% [extra], we’ll charge them 10%,” he said. Though Nissan’s future in Sunderland is secure for now, many businesses in the supply chain are faring less well. AV Dawson, a logistics company that transports and delivers the steel used to make Nissans, saw 15-year, multimillion-pound contracts fall through within days of the Brexit vote. “It has been a real rollercoaster,” said Charlie Nettle, the company’s marketing and business development manager. “We saw it mostly in the construction sector, where we had three businesses that were looking to work with us who pulled out overnight because of loss of confidence due to Brexit. It was scary really to see that happen quite so quickly.” AV Dawson’s directors made it clear to their workforce that they would be voting to stay in the EU, yet the majority of their employees voted the other way, said Nettle.
Crane operator Ronnie Johnson, 64, said he never doubted that Nissan would stay in Sunderland, even when its chairman, Carlos Ghosn, issued a fairly bald threat in late September that it may pull out of the north-east if it was unable to extract “compensation” from the government. “Don’t you think they were holding the government to ransom? Saying ‘if you don’t give me this, we’ll go?’” he said. His colleague Jordan Griffiths, 24, also voted out. “In my personal opinion it was scaremongering. I always thought that the quality of work that we can produce in England is much greater than anywhere else. So if they really want top quality they are not going to go over just a couple of quid.” He said he expected the uncompromising response from European leaders, who are determined that the UK should not get a better deal outside the EU. “Leaving, they were always going to make it hard for us because they don’t want other countries to follow us and leave Europe. But I think in the long run everything will be better for it,” he said, adding that for the first time “it did make you feel like you counted this time around”. Giving evidence to the select committee in Sunderland on Thursday will be Richard Baker, the head of policy and strategy at the North East Local Enterprise Partnership; John Elliott, the executive chairman of Ebac – which manufactures dehumidifiers and watercoolers in the north-east – and representative of campaign group Business for Britain in the north-east; Ross Smith, the director of policy at the north-east England chamber of commerce; and councillor Paul Watson, the leader of Sunderland city council and chair of the North East Combined Authority."
2016-12-08T11:56:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Man fined for first crime committed on tiny Caldey Island,"The first crime in living memory to be recorded on a holy island off the coast of west Wales has resulted in a man receiving a fine and community order. The 45-year-old man became the first convicted criminal on tiny Caldey Island, which has a population of 40 and is home to an order of monks who follow a vow of silence. The visitor, who was on a day trip from Dudley, West Midlands, admitted assaulting his seven-year-old son during a day trip to the monks’ “chocolate factory”, a large kitchen where some produce handmade treats. He confessed to grabbing his son by the neck, slapping him and frogmarching him away. He was freed with a £200 fine and a community order after he apologised to the monks for disturbing their peace. He told a court at Haverfordwest on the mainland that he was “very sorry” for the offence. Such is the remote nature of the island that when police were called officers had to be taken on an RNLI lifeboat to the island, two miles off the resort of Tenby, to make an arrest. The prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard-Jones told the court that the child had been diagnosed with ADHD and autism, and had been “quite naughty” on the day in question. He said the father was trying to tell him to behave, but his actions went beyond “reasonable chastisement”. He said: “He picked him up by the neck so that he could look him in the eye and tell him off. He appears to have been in quite a rage.” A witness said the man had shown a “considerable amount of aggression” and frightened nearby children. After being arrested and taken to the mainland, the father broke down during a police interview and said he would never hurt his son. The defence lawyer Mike Kelleher said his client had apologised for his offence and accepted he may have “gone too far”. Kelleher said the father had been dealing with a child who was unaware what could place himself or others in danger. “It’s a very, very unfortunate incident,” he said. “As a result of this incident, the help and assistance that this family has been asking for, for a very long time, has suddenly come into place. It’s a shame that did not happen before.” Magistrates imposed an 18-month community order with 20 rehabilitation requirement days and a £200 fine. The father was also ordered to pay £85 court costs and an £85 victim surcharge. At the time of the incident, John Cattini, 65, the island’s commercial manager, said: “This is the first crime in court I can recall and I’ve been here more than 40 years. “I’m glad to say I didn’t witness it but I’m sorry to say I was told about it. It is very sad. We are happy to say we live here very peacefully. This person was a visitor and it is a sign of the modern world, I expect.” Caldey, which is a mile and a half long, has been a religious retreat since the first monastery was set up there 1,500 years ago. Around 3,000 visitors make the boat ride that operates from April to October to enjoy the prized homemade chocolate, perfume and shortbread made by the Cistercian monks. The monks take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and observe a rule of silence between the hours of 7pm to 7am."
2016-12-08T13:31:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hostile states pose 'fundamental threat' to Europe, says MI6 chief","The head of the British intelligence agency MI6, Alex Younger, has said cyber-attacks, propaganda and subversion from hostile states pose a “fundamental threat” to European democracies, including the UK. In a rare speech by an MI6 chief while in office, Younger did not specifically name Russia but left no doubt that this was the target of his remarks. Russia has been accused of interfering in the US presidential election and there are concerns it could do the same in French and German elections next year. He did mention Russia in relation to Syria, portraying Russian military support for the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad, in the takeover of Aleppo and elsewhere as potentially creating a long-term problem that could increase radicalisation. “In Aleppo, Russia and the Syrian regime seek to make a desert and call it peace. The human tragedy is heartbreaking,” Younger said. Russia has moved ever closer to centre stage for the US and UK intelligence agencies over the last year. During the US election campaign Donald Trump said he would seek to engage in some sort of discourse with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.
Younger delivered the speech at the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service, the official name for MI6, at Vauxhall Cross in central London. It was the first time an MI6 chief has made a speech at the HQ, a move aimed at trying to show the secret organisation is making an effort to be a bit more transparent. He described the internet as having turned the work of the intelligence services on its head and said it represented “an existential threat” as well as an opportunity. He said hybrid warfare – which Russia has employed in Ukraine, though he again did not mention Russia – was a dangerous phenomenon. “The connectivity that is at the heart of globalisation can be exploited by states with hostile intent to further their aims deniably,” he said. “They do this through means as varied as cyber-attacks, propaganda or subversion of democratic process. Our job is to give the government the information advantage: to shine a light on these activities and help our country and our allies, in particular across Europe, build the resilience they need to protect themselves. “The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty. They should be a concern to all those who share democratic values.” Younger declined to provide details of how Britain was responding to such threats, citing operational reasons, but it is known the UK government does not see a need to respond to Russia in a symmetrical way, such as launching a counter-cyber-attack. Instead it could launch a series of counter-measures such as sanctions.The US intelligence services claim to have evidence that Russia was behind the leaking of information from the Democratic party that undermined Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Senators are pushing for the White House to have any such intelligence declassified. Russia has denied any such involvement.
Younger ran through various threats posed to the UK other than cyber-security, noting that counter-terrorism, his speciality, had been a niche concern when he began his career but had now become central. He said the UK intelligence and security services had disrupted 12 terrorist plots in the UK since June 2013. MI5 and the police were running hundreds of investigations into those intent on carrying out or supporting terrorist atrocities. “As I speak, the highly organised external attack-planning structures within Daesh [the preferred government name for Islamic State], even as they face military threat, are plotting ways to project violence against the UK and our allies without ever having to leave Syria.” He said the events unfolding in Syria created as many, if not more, problems. The strongest weapon against international terrorism was legitimacy, he said, and Assad, backed by Russia, did not have it. The end result could be an increase in terrorism. “If you doubt the link between legitimacy and effective counter-terrorism, then – albeit negatively – the unfolding tragedy in Syria will, I fear, provide proof. I believe Russian conduct in Syria, allied with that of Assad’s discredited regime, will, if they do not change course, provide a tragic example of the perils of forfeiting legitimacy. “In defining as a terrorist anyone who opposes a brutal government, they alienate precisely that group that has to be on side if the extremists are to be defeated.” In a reference to the Chilcot report on Iraq, he came as close as anyone from MI6 to acknowledging that the agency had made a huge mistake through its part in falsely claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 invasion. The Chilcot report singled out the intelligence agencies for falling into line with what Tony Blair’s government wanted rather challenging it over WMD. “A vital lesson I take from the Chilcot report is the danger of groupthink. I will do anything I can to stimulate a contrary view: to create a culture where everyone has the confidence to challenge, whatever their seniority,” Younger said. He played down the impact of Brexit and the Trump election win. “I’m often asked what effect the big political changes of 2016, Brexit and the US election result, will have on these relationships. My answer is that I will aim for, and expect, continuity.” Comments made by Trump on the campaign trail such as support for the US resuming torture would create legal problems for MI6 if the president-elect was to follow through. But there is scepticism in the US intelligence community that Trump will actually implement this, and there are already signs that he is backing off. Younger did not directly address the torture issue. But one remark could be read as a promise that MI6 would not be implicated in any such move. “We can work with a wide range of partner countries overseas, partners who often do not share our laws but who do know our red lines,” he said."
2016-12-08T14:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Sprucing up Robert the Bruce: Scottish king's face gets 3D treatment,"The heavy-set face of Robert the Bruce, the father of Scottish independence, has re-emerged from the shadows nearly 700 years after his death. Facial reconstruction experts at Liverpool John Moores University have released 3D digital images of the Scottish king, who led the Scots to victory against the English at Bannockburn in 1314, that show a privileged and muscular man, with large, broad features. After a two-year project in collaboration with Glasgow University, they have found that King Robert, the descendant of Anglo-Norman nobles and Scottish aristocrats, had a powerful physique and ate an excellent diet during his 55 years. The reconstructions are based on a cast held at the Hunterian museum of Robert the Bruce’s skull, which historians believe was recovered along with his skeleton in 1818-19 from Dunfermline Abbey and then reinterred. They said that in his youth he was a match for the superathletes of today. Yet historians also believe that Robert had leprosy, which weakened him repeatedly during his later life. The cast of his skull shows apparent signs of leprosy, which seems to have disfigured his upper jaw and nose, so another set of digital images portray an older, more worn and marked face carrying its scars.
Until now depictions of the king, such as the striking monument at the Bannockburn battle memorial near Stirling and various Victorian engravings, have been based on speculation or the death mask on his tomb. There have also been modern facial reconstructions, which show some similarities to the latest one from Liverpool, but not with the same level of detail. The joint project was launched after Dr Martin MacGregor, a Scottish history lecturer at Glasgow, watched the discovery of the remains of Richard III underneath a car park in Leicester in 2012. MacGregor then approached Prof Caroline Wilkinson, a craniofacial identification expert and director of the LJMU’s Face Lab, who led the reconstruction of Richard’s face. There was some guesswork involved: they had no DNA samples to test and had to rely on statistics to speculate that he had brown eyes and hair. The authenticity of this reconstruction is based heavily on faith in the historical record. Before reinterment, Bruce’s skeleton and skull were sealed in pitch, preventing the researchers from extracting usable DNA. The Hunterian, part of the University of Glasgow, possesses a toe bone thought to come from the grave, but it was too fragile to sample. “We had hoped to try and obtain DNA from this and test it against a living descendant of Robert the Bruce, but the bone would probably have been destroyed in the process,” said MacGregor. “I was aware of previous attempts to recreate the face of the skull linked to Robert the Bruce,” he added. “The case of Richard III revealed how far the technology had advanced. I saw an opportunity to apply the technology to the Hunterian skull: first to test the credibility of its connection to Bruce, and then to try to add to our knowledge of Scotland’s greatest king.” Wilkinson said: “Using the skull cast, we could accurately establish the muscle formation from the positions of the skull bones to determine the shape and structure of the face. “But what the reconstruction cannot show is the colour of his eyes, his skin tones and the colour of his hair. We produced two versions – one without leprosy and one with a mild representation of leprosy. He may have had leprosy, but if he did it is likely that it did not manifest strongly on his face, as this is not documented.” Of Scotland’s historical figures, Robert the Bruce has the greatest resonance and casts the longest shadow. A fourth grandson of the 12th century Scots king David I through a female line, he believed he had a clear claim to the throne after John Balliol was taken into English custody before becoming Scotland’s king in exile in France. After what was seen as an act of treachery, Bruce murdered John Comyn, his main rival for the throne, in a Dumfries church in February 1306, and then continued the campaign of resistance to English domination begun by William Wallace, the Scots leader portrayed in the Mel Gibson film Braveheart. After his defeat by Edward I’s English forces at Falkirk, Wallace went on the run, before being captured in 1305. He was hung, drawn and quartered at Smithfield in London, the year before Bruce seized the throne. Bruce’s act was controversial, said MacGregor, since Balliol was still alive and some Scots disputed his claim. “Edward I had just reduced Scotland to a ‘land’, just part of his empire. It ceased to be a kingdom; the kingship [of Scotland] was dead,” MacGregor said. “And Bruce, by resurrecting Scottish kingship, laid down the gauntlet [to the English].” His victory over Edward II in 1314 secured Scotland as an independent kingdom. Yet unlike Wallace, and despite his historical dominance, Bruce never attracted the same cinematic attention."
2016-12-08T14:50:28Z,uk-news,UK news,"James Bond would not get job with real MI6, says spy chief","The chief of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, Alex Younger, acknowledged on Thursday that the organisation’s most famous fictional agent, James Bond, is both a blessing and curse. The upside of the Bond novels and movies is that MI6, as SIS is more commonly referred to, is one of the best-known intelligence agencies in the world, and guarantees that almost anyone Younger invites to lunch will attend. The downside to such “fictional stereotypes”, he said, was that Bond created a view of an MI6 officer that bore no resemblance to reality. Younger mused about the impact of the Bond movies during a rare public speech by the chief of an organisation whose existence was not even officially recognised until 1994. Younger, the 16th chief since MI6 was founded in 1909, is known as “C” – like all those who have held the position since the service’s first chief, Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming – rather than “M” as in the Bond films.
Younger, the only member of MI6 who can be publicly identified, assumed office in November 2014. Only few details of his life have been published. The former army officer, 53, joined MI6 in 1991, specialising in counter-terrorism and serving in the Middle East and Afghanistan. He was involved in organising security for the London Olympic Games. “I’m conflicted about Bond. He has created a powerful brand for MI6: as C, the real-life version of M, there are few people who will not come to lunch if I invite them. Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym,” Younger said. “And to be fair, there are a few aspects of the genre that do resonate in real life: fierce dedication to the defence of Britain, for example. The real life ‘Q’ would want me to say that we too enjoy – and, indeed, need – a deep grasp of gadgetry. But’s that’s pretty much where the similarity ends. And, were Bond to apply to join MI6 now, he would have to change his ways.” MI6 officers do travel to exotic and dangerous parts of the world but, according to Younger, someone as reckless and immoral as Bond, who broke the law with such frequency, would not be welcome in MI6. “For too long – often because of the fictional stereotypes I have mentioned – people have felt that there is a single quality that defines an MI6 officer, be it an Oxbridge education or a proficiency in hand-to-hand combat. This is, of course, patently untrue. There is no standard MI6 officer.” Younger said he wanted MI6 to be as diverse as possible. Younger’s public speech follows the heads of the other two intelligence agencies, Andrew Parker at MI5 and Robert Hannigan at GCHQ, in coming out from the shadows and attempting to be a bit more transparent. He has spoken in public before, not least as part of a panel in the US with his American counterpart. The novelty of the speech on Thursday was that it was made at MI6 headquarters. Reporters, who made up the audience, were transported in by van and saw little inside other than portraits of the Queen and Prince Philip at the entrance.
The HQ, known as Vauxhall Cross, is well known, compared with MI6’s previous HQ near Waterloo, which was supposedly secret. Vauxhall Cross has appeared in several Bond movies including The World Is Not Enough. A special showing was arranged for staff at HQ, who reportedly cheered when part of the building was destroyed. The building was hit by an explosion again in Skyfall."
2016-12-08T15:26:25Z,uk-news,UK news,"Driver of bus stranded in York floods ignored road closed signs, court hears","A school bus driver drove past two road closed signs before stranding his vehicle in floodwater with 23 children onboard, a court has heard. The pupils, who were heading for Easingwold school in North Yorkshire, were rescued by firefighters after the school bus they were in was caught in the flooding caused by last winter’s Storm Frank, a jury at York crown court was told. The incident happened near the village of Newton-on-Ouse on 5 January following what judge Paul Batty QC described as “floods of biblical proportions” in the York area. Firefighters were called by children on the bus when it tilted into a verge and began to fill with water. Flood rescue officers smashed a back window to rescue the children, who were lifted from the partially submerged Stephensons school bus on to another vehicle by North Yorkshire fire and rescue workers. After the children were rescued, the single-decker bus lay abandoned, with the front of the vehicle submerged in the waist-high water. The pupils were given hot food, drinks and dry clothes and counselling was offered. Bus driver Graham Jones, 43, went on trial on Thursday accused of dangerous driving. Graham O’Sullivan, prosecuting, told the jury that Jones denies that charge but admits that he drove carelessly. O’Sullivan said Jones drove his bus along Tollerton Lane from Newton-on-Ouse on the first day back after the Christmas break. He said this was not the normal bus route but the driver had been told to pick up a child at an isolated farmhouse because a closed bridge meant the normal bus could not reach him. The prosecutor said Jones drove through one stretch of floodwater before losing control of the bus in a second section. He told the jury: “Mr Jones had driven through two road closed signs.” Jones, of Linton Woods Lane, Linton-on-Ouse, denies one charge of dangerous driving. The village of Newton-on-Ouse, which is about 10 miles north-west of York city centre, was one of the North Yorkshire areas worst hit by Storm Frank, which caused the river Ouse to rise dramatically. Storm Frank was the sixth named storm of last winter and brought gales to western parts of the UK, with gusts as high as 85 mph in north-west Scotland. The storm resulted in yet more flooding in parts of the north of England. The trial continues."
2016-12-08T15:54:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Cut fixed-odds betting stakes to Â£2, MPs urge","The amount gamblers can stake on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) should be slashed and councils given powers to stop bookmakers “clustering” betting shops on high streets, an influential group of MPs has said. The recommendations, timed to coincide with a government review of betting machines, won support from gambling campaigners but were dismissed as a “kangaroo court” by bookmakers. The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on FOBTs, which are often dubbed the “crack cocaine” of gambling due to their addictive nature, is recommending a number of curbs on the machines. The findings come just days after it emerged that the boss of Paddy Power had lobbied against the explosion in the number of FOBTs. The group called for the maximum bet to be reduced to £2 from £100, an amount that can be wagered every 20 seconds under current regulations. “At the very least, the stake should be reduced on a FOBT on a precautionary basis,” said the group’s chair, Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East. “The government has a duty to protect the most vulnerable in our society and to act in the public interest. We therefore strongly urge them to properly regulate FOBTs and to do so with immediate effect.” She said cutting the maximum stake had support from all political parties, both houses of parliament and “a significant majority of the public”. Professor Peter Collins, a veteran gambling expert who has advised successive governments, said failure to reduce the maximum stake would now be seen by the public as a measure of “corruption or stupidity” among politicians. He pointed to his own research showing that a reduction in the stake would cause less harm among vulnerable gamblers. But the Association of British Bookmakers issued an angry rebuttal of the group’s findings. “The anti-FOBT APPG is a kangaroo court,” it said. “It is a small group of anti-bookmaking MPs, funded by casinos and arcades that will benefit from undermining bookmakers. “When a properly balanced and independent select committee of MPs investigated FOBTs they came out strongly in favour of them. “As opposed to that select committee report, this is a biased and highly misleading piece of work, with no material evidence to support their claims.” The MPs also recommended that the government review the regime governing how many FOBTs are allowed in one area. Bookmakers are currently permitted to put four machines in each betting shop, a restriction that campaigners against FOBTs say has led to gambling firms opening multiple shops on the same street in a bid to circumvent the limits. The parliamentary group said local authorities should be given powers to stop this “clustering” of betting shops. And it also urged the government to review staffing levels in bookmakers to address incidents of crime linked to FOBTs – such as vandalism of the machines by people who have lost money. The gambling addiction charity GambleAware pointed to research that suggested the measure would be ineffective on its own. A report conducted by Sophro for GambleAware highlighted the ease with which gamblers can use their debit cards to access funds to keep gambling. Customers could be stopped from using debit cards to load up their betting accounts, or face limits on how often they could use their card or how much they could withdraw to gamble, the report said. It also suggested restrictions on the speed with which gamblers can play game after game and highlighted so-called near misses, where machines give the impression that a player narrowly missed out on a big win. It said these were responsible for an “increase in arousal” that convinced punters to keep gambling. “There is growing evidence that access to additional funds in a gambling venue is a significant risk factor for problem gambling,” said Dr Jonathan Parke, lead researcher at Sophro. “This may be because it facilitates the decision to continue spending more than planned. Stopping players from spending more than they can afford is important. “However, restricting stake size while failing to consider the other cost determinants, like game speed and volatility, will likely prove ineffective.” A report due to be published next week by the Institute for Public Policy Research will estimate the total cost of problem gambling to the public purse. The cost of secondary mental health services linked to gambling could be as high as £110m a year, the report will say, suggesting the overall cost is much higher."
2016-12-08T16:35:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who harassed MP Luciana Berger online is jailed for two years,"A man who harassed Luciana Berger, the Labour MP, in a string of antisemitic online rants has been jailed for two years after a trial at the Old Bailey. Joshua Bonehill-Paine, 24, wrote five hate-filled blogs about Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree. He variously called her a “dominatrix” and “an evil money-grabber” with a “deep-rooted hatred of men”. In one, he claimed the number of Jewish Labour MPs was a “problem”. He illustrated his posts with offensive pictures, including a rat with Berger’s face superimposed on it, and hailed the “Filthy Jew Bitch Campaign” led by US white supremacist website Daily Stormer as “fantastically successful” after the MP was sent 2,500 tweets. Giving evidence, Berger said the posts had made her feel sick and “under attack”. She told jurors: “It’s fair to say I was the most concerned I have ever been about my personal safety since I was elected … In the midst of this ‘Filthy Jewish Bitch’ campaign the police were in constant contact with me. They were in my office and home and assisted my personal safety.”
The court heard Bonehill-Paine had a history of online abuse, leaving a trail of devastation in the lives of those with whom he chose to “pick a dispute”. Bonehill-Paine, who smirked in the dock as he was found guilty on Wednesday, was already serving a sentence of three years and four months for stirring up racial hatred with a flyer for a neo-Nazi rally in Golders Green, north London, that was illustrated with a picture of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp. While he was posting abusive blogs about Berger, Bonehill-Paine, of Yeovil in Somerset, was on bail awaiting sentence for making false claims on Twitter that several people were paedophiles. Sentencing, Mr Justice Spencer told the defendant he had “amassed a formidable record of hate crime” at the age of just 24. The judge took into account that he was due for release in April 2017, but said a consecutive sentence was “fully justified”. He also imposed a criminal behaviour order, carrying a penalty of up to five years in jail, barring the defendant from directly or indirectly contacting Berger, her former assistant and other named individuals. Police will have the power to monitor Bonehill-Paine’s online activities for the duration of the order, which is effective on his release from jail. “It is abundantly clear from all the evidence in the case and the material I have been provided with that he is tenacious in his use of the internet as a retaliatory weapon against anyone with whom he wishes to pick a dispute,” the judge said."
2016-12-08T16:39:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"No new inquiry into killings by British troops, say Northern Irish police","Police in Northern Ireland have no plans to launch a fresh inquiry into killings carried out by British troops during the Troubles. The force issued the statement after a front-page report in the Sun said officers would reinvestigate all 302 killings carried out by British troops. The paper said at least 500 ex-servicemen, many now in their 60s and 70s, would be “viewed as suspects” during the process. The move was described to the Sun as a “brand new witch-hunt” by Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former army officer. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) clarified that officers in the Legacy Investigations Branch (LIB) were reviewing all murder cases linked to the Troubles, including those carried out by loyalist and republican paramilitary forces, and state personnel. “There is no new single probe or bespoke inquiry into deaths attributed to the British army,” said assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, head of the PSNI’s legacy and justice department. “All Troubles-related deaths will be reviewed by LIB using the case sequencing model, which does not prioritise military cases. This is not a new decision.” The Ministry of Defence would provide legal representation for all affected soldiers, a spokesman told the Guardian. The PSNI announced in 2013 that it would review all killings attributed to the military, following a report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) that year which found that troops and police officers could face murder or manslaughter charges for killings that occurred when they were on duty. The report criticised the LIB’s predecessor, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), for failing to treat killings attributed to British troops in the same way as those believed to have been carried out by paramilitary forces. After the report, PSNI announced it would revisit all military-related cases “to ensure the quality of the review reached the required standard”. In 2014, the LIB took over responsibility for investigating the 3,200 homicides that took place during the Troubles. Rather than treating cases chronologically, the LIB looks at forensic opportunities, available witnesses and other investigative material when deciding which cases to tackle first, a spokeswoman for the PSNI explained. The branch’s workload includes 238 incidents attributed to British troops, the spokeswoman confirmed. This week officers in the LIB passed a report to the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland to decide whether former members of the Parachute Regiment should be prosecuted over the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings, in which 14 activists were shot. The murder investigation started in 2012 following a public inquiry that found the killings were unjustifiable. The Sun reported that 302 people died in these incidents, which were mostly shootings, and that many of the incidents involved several personnel opening fire, meaning at least 500 veterans will have their cases reviewed. Half the dead are believed to be IRA or loyalist fighters, while the others are civilians, the paper said. It said that some of those whose cases will now be re-examined were given pardons in the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, or received “letters of comfort” from Tony Blair assuring them they would not face prosecution. Prosecutions stemming from killings during the Troubles are extremely rare. The Irish News journalist Allison Morris, who has reported extensively on the legacy process, has identified six criminal prosecutions resulting from such review processes in the past 18 years, all of which have taken place in the past five years. None of the prosecutions were of armed forces personnel or police officers. The process of investigating unsolved murders by state forces as well as by loyalist and republican paramilitary units was a key aspect of 2015’s Fresh Start agreement. Mercer told the Sun: “This is a brand new witch-hunt, as well as total and complete betrayal by the government of those who have done its bidding.” A spokesman for James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Sun that the PSNI acted independently of the government. He added: “While this government firmly believes in upholding the rule of law, we are concerned that investigations into Northern Ireland’s past focus almost entirely on former police officers and soldiers. This is wrong, and does not reflect the fact that the overwhelming majority of those who served did so with great bravery and distinction.” A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “The overwhelming majority of those who served in Northern Ireland did so with great bravery and distinction. Any member of the military affected by this process will rightly be supported throughout, and will have free Ministry of Defence legal representation.”"
2016-12-08T22:41:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan takes Transport for London into new business territory,"Rows about the finances of Transport for London (TfL) were prominent during this year’s election campaign and also a bit odd. For years, Conservatives had claimed that the large and powerful mayoral agency is a bloated bureaucracy in need of ruthless trimming, yet there was the Tory candidate – a Mr Goldsmith, you might recall - insisting that it could not cope with its fares being frozen for four years, while Labour man Sadiq Khan was pledging to transform it into a paragon of enterprise and efficiency. Seven months on from Khan’s big win, the first TfL business plan of his mayoralty has appeared. The sums are there on paper. So are Khan’s ambitious promises. Political opponents, naturally, say neither add up, with Tory AM Keith Prince worrying that the number crunching bites too deeply into TfL’s reserves and even using the word “socialist” to describe them - on Her Majesty’s BBC too! He also points out, quite correctly, that borrowing is going to soar. Certainly, Khan is pushing the principle of “less from more”, embraced by his predecessor Boris Johnson as an exacting and yet bracing austerity obligation, into adventurous new territory. TfL’s income is in a pincer squeeze, as the government’s operational grant is phased out and Khan’s fares policy means less coming in than would have been the case had he allowed them to rise by inflation or more. In round numbers, TfL says it will have £3.5bn less from those sources over the next five years but that £4bn of savings will more than make up for it, by shedding expensive staff, renegotiating contracts and merging departments. Its annual budget is £11.5bn. “We are driving efficiency through the biggest ever overhaul of our organisation,” writes TfL commissioner Mike Brown in his foreword. Meanwhile, the network’s capacity to move people around, both above ground and below it, needs to go on enlarging as London’s population booms. The opening of Crossrail – the Elizabeth Line – in 2018 will create more space and bring in more money too, but the then TfL commissioner Sir Peter Hendy predicted way back in March 2013 that “it will be immediately full”. Rising passenger numbers and trips in general will bump revenues up too - by 38% by 2021, TfL predicts - including on the buses, though be warned that the numbers of journeys made on London’s buses fell by 3.6% in the year to June. Green Party AM Caroline Russell has welcomed a £770m commitment to cycling, but says she fears that without measures to reduce the number of cars, “less space on the roads thanks to new measures for cycling and walking means buses will be stuck in traffic”. Congestion isn’t good for anyone’s business, including TfL’s. In the longer term, TfL has plans to increase the frequency of trains on the Underground and to bring forward the Bakerloo Line extension by two years to 2029. More immediately, it is stressing its own importance as a facilitator of economic growth, stimulating employment and development. Brown writes that this benefits not only Londoners but also “the entire country”. It is, perhaps, a measure of government incoherence over dealing with withdrawal from the European Union that transport minister Chris Grayling has ditched the deal to hand control of Southern and other suburban rail services to TfL, infuriating even London fellow Tory politicians. Giving the capital more autonomy could usefully assist with propping up the UK economy in the uncertain years ahead. And should Khan’s transport budgets start to come unstuck, maybe bailing him out will be thought worth it. Like it or not, Leave Nation cannot afford to let Remain City fail. The new draft Transport for London business plan is here."
2016-12-09T11:44:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Glasgow bin lorry crash: private prosecution against driver rejected,"Relatives of those who died in the Glasgow bin lorry crash have failed in their attempt to bring a private prosecution against the driver who killed six people after he fainted at the wheel. Senior judges at the appeal court in Edinburgh rejected the case – brought by the family of three of the crash victims – that 59-year-old Harry Clarke should be put on trial in an exceptionally rare private criminal prosecution, after warning that to allow it would “open the floodgates” for similar prosecutions. The family of three of the victims of the 2014 crash, Erin McQuade and her grandparents Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, pursued the highly unusual legal route after the Crown Office refused to charge Clarke over their deaths, despite a fatal accident inquiry finding that he had lied about his medical history. Stephenie Tait, 29, Jacqueline Morton, 51, and Gillian Ewing, 52, also died in the crash. The relatives, as well as the driver, were granted legal aid for the case in March by the Scottish government’s justice secretary, Michael Matheson.
At the time, Matheson said: “Private prosecutions are, and should remain, exceptionally rare in Scotland. However, in light of the unique and special circumstances of this case, which raises fundamental questions that have not previously been tested in case law, Scottish ministers believe it is in the public interest that all parties are adequately represented.” The fatal accident inquiry in the summer of 2015 heard that Clarke had a history of health issues including a previous blackout in 2010 at the wheel of a stationary bus, but he had repeatedly failed to disclose his medical background to his employers or the DVLA. Six people were killed and eight seriously injured after the out-of-control bin lorry ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians in Glasgow city centre just before Christmas, scattering pedestrians “like pinballs”, in the words of onlookers. The accident happened at 2.30pm on Monday 22 December on busy George Square when the area was teeming with Christmas shoppers and visitors to the ice rink and amusements in the square. The judges Lady Dorrian, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young had been considering the bill for criminal letters since hearing final arguments in the case in October, and ruled on Friday that the family could not pursue a private prosecution of Clarke. The court also rejected a similar plea for a private prosecution of motorist William Payne lodged by the families of students Mhairi Convy and Laura Stewart, who were knocked down and killed in Glasgow in 2010. The two women, who were aged 18 and 20, were walking in the city’s North Hanover Street when a Range Rover being driven by William Payne mounted the kerb and hit them after he blacked out at the wheel. During earlier hearings, which could not be reported at the time, the lord advocate James Wolffe QC argued there was “not sufficient evidence to support prosecution” in either case. He also argued that prosecutors must be free to take unpopular decisions. John Scott QC, representing Clarke, told the court that the prosecution bid wanted to rely on the fatal accident inquiry conclusions, but the determination of the sheriff was not admissible in evidence. The solicitor advocate said other parties had started considering private proceedings in other cases, and to grant this one could “open the floodgates”."
2016-12-09T13:29:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Troubles envoy warns of damage from row about prosecuting UK troops,"Instructing the Police Service of Northern Ireland to investigate British soldiers over deaths during the Troubles risks “polluting” policing in the region, a former envoy between the IRA and the UK government has warned. Denis Bradley, who later co-chaired the Consultative Group on the Past tasked with dealing with the Troubles’ legacy, also predicted that full disclosure of all intelligence files relating to the conflict would expose the identities of thousands of informers both inside the IRA and loyalist terror groups. Bradley said the squabbling over any retrospective prosecutions of British soldiers, republicans or loyalists found guilty of past crimes was “intensifying the collective” trauma Northern Irish society in general continued to endure.
The PSNI on Thursday denied it had plans to launch a fresh inquiry into killings carried out by British troops during the Troubles. The force issued the statement after a front-page report in the Sun that said officers would reinvestigate all 302 killings carried out by British troops. The newspaper said at least 500 former servicemen, many now in their 60s and 70s, would be “viewed as suspects” during the process. The PSNI is carrying out criminal inquiries into the actions of a number of British soldiers during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972 when troops opened fire on an anti-interment rally in Derry, killing 13 civilians. Arguments over what the British state is prepared to disclose from its intelligence archive have even impacted on Anglo-Irish relations. For the first time in years Dublin has criticised what it perceives as London’s foot-dragging over disclosures relating to the Troubles. The Fine Gael-led minority government said on Thursday it “deeply regretted” the lack of visible progress on establishing institutions to deal with the fallout from more than a quarter of a century of violence in Northern Ireland. Bradley told the Guardian the “mess” over how to deal with the Troubles’ legacy was having a toxic impact on society. The former priest, who was a vice-chairman of Northern Ireland’s Policing Board and acted as a go-between between IRA leaders and the UK government in the early 1990s, chaired the Consultative Group on the Past with a former head of the Church of Ireland, Archbishop Robin Eames. On the PSNI’s role in Troubles inquiries, he said: “We are still throwing police in the middle of this mess. I think part of the reason we should have done the task 10 years ago was to get the police out of it. Instead this is contaminating the police and policing.” “In addition, it’s costing an absolute fortune where we have £50m being spent one case alone, ie Stakeknife,” he said, referring to the investigation into Freddie Scappaticci, who infiltrated the IRA and became head of its spy-catching unit. “There are hundreds of others. Our aim in the group was to take inquiries over the Troubles out of the policing and judicial system but this is polluting both.” Bradley also expressed concern about the fate of thousands of one-time informers if there was “full disclosure” of all sensitive Troubles-related security files. “What Robin Eames and I found out in our investigations leading to the Consultative Group on the Past report was that at any given time there were at least 800 informers working within the ranks not only of the loyalist paramilitaries but also the IRA. Others have said that figure was closer to 1,000. “If there was full disclosure of files you would be going around saying that your sons, daughters, friends were all informers. Full disclosure would mean that and our society needs that no more than a hole in the head. Do we want every name brought out there? I don’t think so. Maybe in a thematic sense there can be full disclosure but leaving individual names out of this, yes. It would be far worse than the actual reality. “What you should not do is expose Joe Bloggs who might have been buried as a hero but was in fact an informant for the Brits. That is what would happen countless times. Republicans and nationalists used to believe that all the informers were on the loyalist side when in fact as we found out in having limited access to security file was it was nearly as big as on the republican side.” Bradley added that an already traumatised society such as Northern Ireland was being further traumatised by the political disagreements over how to deal with its violent past. “I honestly don’t know how the politicians and the two governments in London and Dublin are going to get around this mess but it keeps each other at our throats and maintains a low level of pain. It is intensifying the collective PTSD this society is suffering.”"
2016-12-09T14:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Driver of school bus stranded in York flood water jailed for a year,"A school bus driver, who drove past two road closed signs before stranding his vehicle in flood water with 23 children onboard, has been jailed for a year. A jury at York crown court heard that the former soldier Graham Jones, 43, ignored evidence of flooding during Storm Frank last winter and drove his bus into thigh-deep water near the village of Newton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. Flood rescue officers had to break a back window to rescue the children, aged between 11 and 18, who were lifted from the partially submerged Stephensons school bus on to another vehicle. The pupils from Easingwold school in North Yorkshire were given hot food, drinks and dry clothes, and counselling was offered. Jones admitted driving carelessly, but pleaded not guilty to the charge of dangerous driving. The jury took one hour to reach a guilty verdict and the judge, Paul Batty QC, sentenced him to 12 months in prison and banned him from driving.
Sentencing Jones, Batty said: “Having managed to get through the first extensive area of flooded road, you then came upon the second, much more extensive area of flooded road. “It was basically an expanse of water as far as the eye could see. There was absolutely no indication whatsoever of the depth of the water. “Notwithstanding that, you took the decision – goodness knows why – to drive through it. Of course, the inevitable happened.” Batty said Jones had shown no appreciation of the danger he put the children in and “the potentially devastating consequences that could have occurred” due to his “dangerous, reckless act”. “This was an extremely bad case of dangerous driving. The consequences that could have followed simply do not bear thinking about,” he said. The court heard that Jones had diverted the bus from its normal route when he was told to pick up a child at an isolated farmhouse, because a closed bridge meant the usual bus could not reach him. Jones told the court that he had made a “genuine mistake”. Newton-on-Ouse, which is about 10 miles north-west of York city centre, was one of the areas of North Yorkshire worst hit by Storm Frank, which caused the river Ouse to rise dramatically. Storm Frank was the sixth named storm of last winter and brought gales to western parts of the UK, with gusts as high as 85mph in north-west Scotland. The storm resulted in further flooding in parts of the north of England."
2016-12-09T14:21:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Two near-misses renew fears drones could cause major air accident,"Fears that drones could cause a major air accident have been reignited after two more near-misses in London and Manchester, with one drone passing over the wing of a passenger jet. Investigators said a drone about 2ft (60cm) wide had just missed the right wing of a Boeing 767 that was coming in to land at Manchester airport. While the pilot was uncertain about what he had seen passing about six metres from the plane, investigators said his report, along with radar images and video recordings, meant that the object was most probably a drone with a camera. They said the drone operator, who could not be traced, had “recklessly endangered” the plane in the incident on 20 July. In another incident classed as high risk two weeks later, a drone the size of a football was as close as 20 metres to a passenger jet as it circledabove south-east London on its way to Heathrow. The Airbus A320’s first officer shouted: “Look”, as the drone, which had a flashing magenta light, passed close to the plane at around 11,000ft (3,350 metres). Air traffic control was immediately alerted to the incident, which occurred on 4 August. Details were passed to the Metropolitan police but the drone operator could not be traced. A collision “had only been narrowly avoided” and chance had played a “major part”, the report noted. The UK Airprox Board, an air safety body, said a minority of drone operators were continuing to “flagrantly disregarding regulation and common sense” to film “ever more spectacular video footage”. Flight crews are rarely able to take any action to avoid potential collision with drones on a visual sighting. Civil Aviation Authority rules also state that drones should not be flown above 400ft. Pilots have called for urgent action to address the risks to passenger aircraft from drones, after a spate of near-misses. Balpa, the pilots union, has pressed for better education on drone operation, as well as compulsory registration of drones and more high-profile prosecutions of offenders. The union has also called for “geo-fencing” to be used for all drones, fitting them with technology that would stop them being flown in prohibited airspace. It also has called for testing to establish what the possible effect of a drone striking an engine. Similar tests are done with frozen birds at engine manufacturers. Pilots fear that the shrapnel from a collision between an engine and a drone could cause catastrophic damage to other parts of the plane."
2016-12-09T15:00:32Z,uk-news,UK news,A brief encounter at Britainâ€™s least-used railway station,"You don’t see much out the window as the 7.04 from Cambridge to Norwich rattles across the Fens on a dank December morning – fields, mainly, which start to take shape as the sun rises somewhere behind the gloom. Then the train slows down and, out of nowhere, a platform appears. Kash, the conductor, seemed surprised when I had requested the stop. “Oh, this is very rare,” he said before alerting the driver. “Very rare.” Only one pair of doors open. I step out on to the empty platform, with no idea where to go. As the train pulls away – right on time, at 7.28am – I’m alone. By the time the third carriage rushes past, Kash is a blur as he leans out of his window. “Have fun!” he shouts into the half-light. A cold wind strikes my face as silence returns to Britain’s quietest train station. Shippea Hill barely clings to the rail network. According to ticket sales figures published this week by the Office of Road and Rail, 12 people used it in the year to last April, fewer than any other station. With one small step I have just increased its annual footfall by more than 8%. You’re welcome, Shippea Hill. But am I? It’s hard to imagine a more desolate place to get off a train. Shipping containers for sale stand in a muddy yard behind the far platform, opposite the pitched-roof signal box, now shuttered. Otherwise the view is of field after field, some showing maize stumps, others now peat-black and ploughed. On weekdays, one train stops here on its way to Norwich, if requested. That’s it. It comes once on a Saturday and not at all on Sundays. No trains stop on their way back to Cambridge, which adds to the sense of isolation under the tiny platform shelter. Someone has carved “I love you Mel Nunn” into the unused bench. Mel Nunn probably doesn’t know.
I’m almost startled when a young woman appears from a parked car. She is delighted to spot whom she thinks is Shippea Hill’s monthly passenger. Joanne, a reporter at a Cambridge news agency, is here on a speculative assignment for the Daily Mail. Her face drops when I break it to her that I, too, am a journalist. “Did anyone else get off?” she asks. Nobody. She drives back to Cambridge. There is nothing to do in Shippea Hill, nor any safety in walking along the A1101, which falls steeply into dykes on either side. Black birds sit along the telephone wires. A temporary hostel for seasonal vegetable-pickers lies on one side of the railway, down a muddy track. There’s no answer at the house by the road, a former pub. I skip over the tracks and down another lane. It leads to Railway Cottage, which has seen better days. “Powdered milk or long-life?” asks Peter Mingay, who lives here with his partner, Polly Wainwright, and their 10 racing greyhounds. Peter makes the tea while Malicious Gossip, otherwise known as Nelly, slurps her breakfast. The couple have lived 150 metres from the station for 10 years, but have never caught a train. “Before they changed the level crossing to electric about four years ago, they had a chap up there in the signal box,” Wainwright, 62, says. “They had a generator, so when there was a power cut we’d go up there and he’d put the kettle on.”
The couple moved here so that their dogs could bark without disturbing anyone. They used to live three miles down track in Prickwillow, site of the annual Prickwillow Ploughing festival. That village lost its station in 1850, five years after it and Shippea Hill were opened during the great Victorian “railway mania”. Top-hatted planners hurriedly drew lines between towns, plonking stations at reasonable intervals. Some, like Prickwillow, failed fast. Others were vital, until they weren’t. When the Beeching report threatened to fillet hundreds of lines and stations in the early 1960s, it was easier and cheaper in many cases to reduce services to almost nothing. The railway company Greater Anglia, which operates the Cambridge to Norwich line, confirms that Shippea Hill station, which now serves primarily as an automated level crossing, requires minimal maintenance. It wasn’t always like this. In nearby Ely, Harry Bye, a month short of his 100th birthday, remembers the last of the station’s glory days. He got a job as a porter in 1955, when Shippea Hill was still used to distribute vegetables across the region and to London. “I used to climb up the signals and fill the lamps,” he says. “It was still all steam trains then, and there’d be a lot of shunting in the yard. We had two freight trains leave a day. We’d call them the Shippea Hills. I’ve seen 35 trucks of cauliflowers go away on the train, and there used to be celery and potatoes – all of it.”
Bye retired as a signalman in 1982, by which time Shippea Hill had lost its porters and ticket officers. He has lived alone in the same house since his wife died in 1987. He keeps photos of the busy days, when hundreds of passengers used the station, including airmen from nearby RAF Lakenheath. “But times change, don’t they,” he says in a break between writing his Christmas cards. Lorries killed the vegetable trains, and the narrow stretch of road past Shippea Hill is known to some locals as the Casserole Highway, thanks to the frequency of shed loads. Chris and Kate Fulford live with their three children in the former schoolhouse on a sharp corner, 300 metres from the station. A church and village hall have long disappeared, and the school closed in the 1970s as farms merged and the village died. But the Fulfords, who have never used the station, are joining forces with other young families now finding affordable homes in the wider area. “We’re planning to all catch the train to Norwich one Saturday and show that there’s still life here,” says Chris, 39, an architectural technician. “If we get the numbers up, perhaps they’ll provide a proper service again.”"
2016-12-09T16:05:17Z,uk-news,UK news,'It could be any of these men': how we learned to take stalking seriously,"About five years after the first emails arrived, the death threats started. When Sarah first began receiving messages from a man expressing a romantic interest, she shrugged them off. “I didn’t realise for some time that I had a stalker,” she says. They seemed confused and clumsy; strange, but nothing much to worry about. Later, when they became threatening – the man stalking her said he would attack her, or kill her – she went to the police. Even then, the police said it wasn’t very significant and not to worry about it. She was reassured at first, until she began to suspect that wasn’t the best advice. “I realised from the content of some of the messages that he was referring to real events in my life and that, according to him, we had met on one or two occasions. I don’t recall ever meeting him. I was alarmed – he wasn’t just a random person on the internet. Or he was, but he had taken a great deal of trouble to find out information about me. It was at that stage that I became really quite frightened that he might carry out one of these threats.” She kept contacting the police, including making one statement at 4am “when I had received a number of threats and I couldn’t take it any more, and thought I would have to go and sleep at the police station”. Still nothing was done about it. “Eventually I found a very motivated police officer, who hadn’t had much training in this, but she made it her business to make something happen. With her support, I did eventually get somewhere, but I still had to do all of the preparation myself. I had started a long process of educating myself and educating the police. I had to learn everything myself.” The victim log she put together would detail how at one point she was receiving up to 10 emails a day. Thinking back to when it started, Sarah says that if she had known more about stalking then, she would have gone to the police much earlier and pushed them to take it seriously. “I think it’s normal for people to think it doesn’t mean anything, or it will go away, but in my case it reached a point where it was unbearable. The earlier it can be stopped, the better.” This week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, announced plans for new Stalking Protection Orders, which would hopefully address this, and at an early stage. It would allow courts to ban stalkers from contacting their victims, even if they hadn’t been charged or convicted. It has largely been welcomed by anti-stalking campaigners. “Anything that is another tool to deal with a stalker is great news,” says Jane Harvey, campaigns director of Network for Surviving Stalking. “But we need to get some of the basic building blocks in place. It takes people a long time to recognise what’s happening to them as stalking, so there’s under-reporting, and then at an early stage of a case, things can go wrong – a police officer hasn’t had training in stalking and the case is dismissed, or another element, such as criminal damage, will be seized upon instead of seeing the wider picture.”
Catherine Skinner, chief executive of the charity Paladin, says: “You still hear that [police officers and others in the criminal justice system] don’t see the risks; they don’t see how the behaviour of the perpetrator can not just psychologically affect the victim – we see issues of suicidal ideation from our clients. But also there could be threats to kill, a history of violence, and things that could put victims at high risk.” Research by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust has found that one in five women and one in 12 men will experience stalking. There have been several high-profile cases recently – a man was jailed in September for stalking the broadcaster Emily Maitlis for 25 years; in June, a man who stalked the singer Lily Allen for seven years, breaking into her house and entering her bedroom, was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.
It is largely an unreported crime. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust estimates that in England and Wales, more than 1.1 million people are stalked each year, but police recorded 4,156 stalking crimes in the year to June, and just 1,102 cases were prosecuted. The proposed new protection orders are “a good thing,” says Victoria Charleston, policy and campaigns officer of the trust. “Where we are cautious is if the police are responsible for applying for these orders. If they’re not recognising stalking at the moment, are we clear that they are going to think about using them? We hope that there will be further training for police.” It’s not a typical crime, Charleston says. “It’s a pattern of behaviour. It can be very small to begin with, before it escalates.” It is also a fairly new area for many health and criminal justice professionals. “It wasn’t really recognised until the 1980s, and the current anti-stalking legislation didn’t come in until 2012 [in England and Wales],” she adds. In October, Alex Chalk launched a private members’ bill to increase the maximum sentencing of five years. One of his constituents, Dr Eleanor Aston, a GP, had been targeted for seven years by a man who continued to stalk her even after serving a prison sentence for it. Ruth, who lives in north Wales with her partner and daughter, has experienced stalking by a neighbour for the past five years. He would watch from his doorstep every time she left the house or came home. After about six months, when Ruth was returning to work after maternity leave, he would follow her to work in his car. Around six months after that, he started following her partner as well. “On the days when he didn’t, it still made me nervous because I didn’t know where he was,” she says. “I didn’t know if he would turn up somewhere else.” The police have been repeatedly involved, but Ruth feels there has been little support. “I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks. It’s caused a lot of stress between me and my partner. I feel awful for my daughter, who has had to grow up with visits from the police, and us watching over our shoulders.” This year, research by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust found that 36% of stalking cases included online behaviours. For Emily, the man who stalked her was not someone she had met, but someone who became fixated on her and her family online. He found out her family’s email addresses and bombarded them with emails about her. “We reported it to the police and they said: ‘Just keep an eye on it and see what happens.’” He went quiet for a while, then started up again, trying to follow their various social media accounts. Shortly after this, he turned up at her parents’ house and tried to get in; he was arrested, and is awaiting sentencing. “It has been absolutely horrific,” Emily says. “I didn’t feel safe anywhere. I still check under my bed, in my cupboard. I spent £1,500 getting new locks put on my house. On the street, I don’t make eye contact with men. You lose all sense of faith in people.”
Something similar happened to Beth, an actor and writer, who was stalked for several months in 2014 by a man who followed her on Twitter. She noticed him “liking” or replying to every tweet she wrote, and he would write about her on his own account. Eventually she blocked him and complained to Twitter several times. “But he would often delete his tweets, so Twitter would say they weren’t violent or harmful, and they couldn’t do anything about them. It was often a robotic reply. It wasn’t like they’d actually researched it and checked out what was going on. They did nothing.” He started contacting her friends, and a few months later, he turned up on her doorstep. “It was horrific. When I started getting a bit worried about it, I used to picture in my head what I would do if I saw him. You think of the worst-case scenario, so when he turned up I wasn’t expecting it – but I also sort of was.” She screamed, slammed the door and called the police. When they arrived, they found him still sitting on her doorstep, tweeting about her. Later, looking at his account, she saw that the man – who lived several hundred miles away – had spent the week walking around her area, looking in pubs and cafes for her. Amy has been stalked by a man for the last four years – an acquaintance from several years ago who developed a fixation with her. “It has gone from unwanted text messages and phone calls to hand-delivered letters and gifts,” she says. “They are all of a very strange nature. He’s delusional and has mentioned God having a plan for us to be together.” The first couple of times she went to the police about it, they talked her out of making a complaint, saying they would just have a word with the man. Later, he was charged with harassment without violence (rather than stalking), and after it went to court, he was given a restraining order, which he ignored. Even though he had breached the order, she says the police were dismissive of her – it was only after she got in touch with the National Stalking Helpline, who contacted the police on her behalf, that they followed it up. “Before, they would say things like ‘chances are you won’t hear from him again’. But it was obvious I would.” The experience has had a huge effect on her life. In the summer, she says she was staying at home all day with the curtains closed because she was worried he would walk past the window and see her. “As soon as I walk in the door, I check for any letters. I feel really tense. Every time he is punished with a restraining order or community service hours, I don’t completely relax because the pattern is that it will start again at some point. The thing I would really like is for the mental health aspect to be recognised, because I think that is the root cause of the problem with him. People say [we should] make the stalking laws stricter, but it seems a shame to put someone into prison when it could be dealt with as a mental health issue. I would feel more reassured if he was being treated than if he was just going into prison and coming out again.” Frank Farnham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, and a specialist in stalking behaviours, also favours treatment over custodial sentences for many offenders – not least because it is more likely to reduce reoffending, and is far cheaper. But one of the problems with the new stalking prevention order model, he says, is that requiring mental health treatment as part of the order might be too optimistic – if the offender doesn’t give consent, it can only be done under the Mental Health Act. But he does like the idea of requiring assessments. Stalking behaviours can look similar, but the motivations can be very different. It is widely accepted there are five categories of stalker. The largest – thought to be somewhere between a third and a half – is the “rejected” stalker: someone, usually a man, upset by the end of a relationship who harasses his ex-partner. “That group are not usually mentally ill, but they might have personality problems – they can be quite grandiose, narcissistic. If you take that group away, there are very high rates of mental illness in [the other] groups.” Intimacy seekers are “deluded” people who believe they are in a relationship with their victim, or could be. “The problem with that group is that if you believe you are on a mission from God, or convinced you’re destined to be [together], simply imposing an order isn’t going to stop you from doing it.” A third group – “incompetent suitors” – are not deluded but their behaviour may be due to a learning disability, and they don’t realise it is frightening or inappropriate. The “resentful” stalker is someone who harasses a person they believe is to blame for something that has happened to them – it is not uncommon for MPs, councillors and GPs to be stalked like this. “Some of those people are mentally ill – their paranoia is so severe that they are deluded. But underpinning all of this is a process where [there should be a] good assessment, to spot the people who are mentally ill and give them treatment.” (A fifth group, mercifully small, are “predatory” stalkers, whose victims are unaware they are being stalked; the stalking can be a prelude to a sexual attack.) “Even if you do identify someone who is unwell, with the current state of mental health services, how do you get them into treatment?” asks Farnham, who used to treat people convicted of stalking until his funding was cut. He, along with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust and others, are trying to get a pilot programme going with the police service to look at intervention treatment – to treat stalking behaviour before it becomes dangerously entrenched – but they are yet to receive funding.
For the victims who have to endure stalking for years, the effects are profound. Sarah’s relationship with her partner broke down because of the stress it caused them; he felt worried about her, but also worried for his own safety. “There were times when [the man who was stalking her] would say he was going to come and kill me. Part of my rational brain said, ‘Well, he hasn’t up until now,’ but the other part thought: ‘Where do I go? To the police station? Where is he and what does he know? Should I move?’ It makes you hypervigilant. I would leave the gym, look around and think: ‘I just don’t know who it is. It could be any of those men.’ In my career I should probably be using the internet a lot more to publicise the work I do, and I don’t do that. I used to be a very sociable person but I entirely stopped socialising at one point.” The man who has stalked her for 10 years eventually pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. She isn’t wholly optimistic that her ordeal is over. “The truth is you never know.”"
2016-12-09T16:10:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Judge grants lifelong anonymity to brothers who tortured two boys,"Two brothers who beat and tortured another pair of boys when they were aged 10 and 11 will remain anonymous for the rest of their lives, a court ruled on Friday. A judge sentenced the brothers to a minimum detention period of five years in 2010 for causing grievous bodily harm and ruled that they could not be named until they reached the age of 18. But the brothers, now in their late teens, have been told that their new identities will remain a secret. A senior judge at the high court on Friday granted indefinite anonymity to the brothers, who are no longer in detention. Sir Geoffrey Vos said he was satisfied that the anonymity order was in the public interest and ruled that neither the brothers’ original names nor their new identities could be revealed. The brothers carried out “appalling and terrible” assaults on their younger victims after leading them from a playground to wasteland in Edlington, South Yorkshire, in April 2009, Sheffield crown court heard. Following their trial the head of child protection services in their home town apologised for the way staff had failed the public. Phillippa Kaufmann QC – instructed by the official solicitor’s office, which helps vulnerable people involved in court cases – said there was a “real possibility” that the brothers would be attacked by vigilantes if their names became known. The application was made as the younger brother approached his 18th birthday. It was not contested formally by any media organisation, though a reporter covering the hearing argued that journalists should be able to reveal the brothers’ original names. In the most notorious crime committed by British children since the murder of James Bulger in 1993, the brothers targeted their victims seemingly at random as they rode their BMX bikes in Edlington in April 2009. After leading their victims, then nine and 11, to waste ground they subjected them to a 90-minute ordeal that included a series of sexual humiliations. The victims were robbed, beaten, stamped on, struck with bricks and other objects, choked and burned to an extent that left the older child close to death. Parts of the attack were recorded on a mobile phone. The brothers had experienced a “toxic” and violent family life, and had been placed with foster parents in Edlington less than three weeks before the attack. Following the trial the acting head of children’s services in Doncaster gave an unqualified apology for the “admitted failings which led to this terrible incident”. A serious case review found that various agencies missed 31 opportunities to intervene with the boys’ family."
2016-12-09T17:23:40Z,uk-news,UK news,RAF urged to recruit video game players to operate Reaper drones,"The commander who oversaw the use of Reaper drones in Syria has said the relentless demand to deploy the unmanned aircraft means the RAF needs to test recruiting “18- and 19-year-olds straight out of the PlayStation bedroom” to operate the weapons. Air Marshal Greg Bagwell, a former RAF deputy commander of operations, disclosed that the psychological pressure on drone operators in the UK was such that some had quit due to mental stress or illness. He said the law governing the use of drones needed to be recast due to advances in technology that would lead inexorably to the greater use of remote and autonomously operated weaponry.
Bagwell, who retired this year, oversaw RAF Reaper operations, including two controversial drone strikes in 2015 on two UK citizens supporting Islamic State in Syria. Bagwell insisted the strikes were legal but argued the law needed to be revisited to give drone operators greater confidence that they were acting legally. The controversy over the attacks led to some of the operators needing repeated assurance that they had acted legally. Explaining the demand for drone operators, Bagwell said: “We need to test harder whether we can take a young 18- or 19-year-old out of their PlayStation bedroom and put them into a Reaper cabin and say: ‘Right, you have never flown an aircraft before [but] that does not matter, you can operate this’.” He added: “In order to be a very good Reaper operator you need that three-dimensional view of what is going on around you, even though you are 3,000 miles away. You are playing three-dimensional chess in your mind, so you understand how the various pieces fit together in terms of prosecuting a target.”
Reaper drones have carried out more than a third of the coalition airstrikes against Isis in Iraq and Syria. Bagwell’s call for a rethink of the law governing drones was echoed by Gen Sir Richard Barrons, the joint forces commander until his retirement in April. Barrons said: “We need to set ourselves up for a future where a combination of robotics, autonomous systems and artificial systems will create capabilities that our enemies may have before we do – where machines kill on the basis of an algorithm without a human in the room. “That is not science fiction and it will not be very long before western armed forces are acquiring capability like that, and they will need to be absolutely clear what rules we have and when they apply.” He added he was concerned that “we have not thought through the application of current technology in the setting … where you cannot necessarily have such a high-level control of the targeting process, allowing rigour and advice at every stage. You cannot apply that in a more cyclical, dynamic conflict. It will not work.” Both men were giving evidence to the all-party committee inquiring into the law governing the use of drones, especially their joint operations. The committee has released a new memorandum of understanding on the use of drones reached by the UK and the US. A joint select committee argued earlier this year that the law on drones needed clarifying. The joint committee launched its inquiry after David Cameron announced that UK drones had targeted and killed a 21-year-old Briton, Reyaad Khan, in Syria in August 2015. Another Briton, Ruhul Amin, and a Belgian, Abu Ayman al-Belgiki, who were travelling in the same vehicle, also died.
Revealing the pressure on drone operations, Bagwell said: “The problem we have had is that in seven years of constant operations we have not been allowed to have a break point, to step back and take stock without having to keep pushing crews.” He said it was stressful for the operators to mount complex attacks over Syria and Iraq and then to return at night to a family home in the UK. Barrons said he was comfortable about the law governing the existing use of drones, but the pace of change required a rethink. He said the technology being used in aerial drones could equally be applied to underwater warfare, requiring a new legal framework."
2016-12-09T18:08:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Andrew denounces 'made up' newspaper stories about daughters,"Prince Andrew has denied claims of a rift between him and his brother, Prince Charles, over his daughters’ roles in the royal family. In a rare public statement, he moved to end speculation that he wanted princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to become more central figures, and bear greater responsibilities at public engagements. He also insisted he has not asked that his daughters’ future husbands be given titles. “As a father, my wish for my daughters is for them is to be modern working young women, who happen to be members of the royal family, and I am delighted to see them building their careers,” Prince Andrew said, in a statement released on Friday. “When they do support the royal family in its work, this is very much appreciated by my family and, most importantly, by those organisations and to those for whom their participation makes such a difference to their lives.” The statement follows a series of newspaper articles suggesting he was at odds with other members of the royal family. He was reported to have wanted his daughters, who are seventh and eighth in line to the throne, to carry out royal duties on a par with their cousins William and Harry. His brother Charles, however, favoured a slimmed-down monarchy, centred on him, his children and grandchildren, it was claimed. In his letter, Prince Andrew wrote: “Over the past few weeks, a number of stories have been run in various newspapers that have no basis of fact and the most recent, relating to my daughters, requires correction to terminate further speculation and innuendo.” He added: “Whilst I appreciate, as granddaughters of the queen, there is considerable interest in my daughters, I cannot continue to stand by and have the media speculate on their futures based on my purported interventions, which are completely made up and an invention.”
Earlier on Friday, Prince Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson called on media outlets to “stop bullying the York family”, saying her two daughters were “extraordinary examples of … good parenting”. She spoke as princesses Beatrice, 28, and Eugenie, 26, became patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust, visiting a specialist teen cancer unit in London to meet young people with the disease. Praising their hard work, the Duchess of York said: “Both the duke and myself, we could not be more proud of this moment because these two girls that work so hard in their own careers have taken time off today to spread the word of teen cancer, which is so important, and then go back to work. “It’s really an extraordinary example that, I think, good parenting and listening to your children and getting them to take responsibility for their own actions.” She said she was proud of her family’s charity work, adding: “Let’s focus more on this and less on tittle-tattle gossip. Stop bullying the York family, please.” Beatrice, who is said to be focusing on her “entrepreneurial ambitions”, having had several jobs over the past five years, has been criticised in the media for the number of holidays she takes – 15 in 2015, according to one report. She recently made headlines when she cut singer Ed Sheeran’s face with a sword while pretending to “knight” James Blunt at a party at her father’s Royal Lodge residence near Windsor. Eugenie works as an associate director at a modern art gallery. While statements from members of the royal family attacking the press are uncommon, it is not the first time the royal have felt the need to defend themselves and those near them in recent weeks. Last month, Prince Harry released a letter asking media outlets and their readers to respect the privacy of his partner Meghan Markle, who he said had been “subjected to a wave of abuse” that had taken on “racial undertones”."
2016-12-09T18:39:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office stops transfer of Calais child refugees to UK,"Home Office transfers of unaccompanied minors who were registered in the Calais refugee camp have stopped, meaning up to 1,000 children are unlikely to be given sanctuary in the UK. The immigration minister Robert Goodwill said more than 750 refugee children from Calais had arrived in the UK. Officials said all the children taken from the camp in early November had been interviewed and those eligible to enter the UK had been moved. “Many have been reunited with family members already in the UK, while others are being cared for by local authorities across the UK. The remaining children are safe and in the care of the French authorities,” Goodwill said. Charities expressed concern about the fate of those who had been interviewed and found to be ineligible for transfer. They said that if the Home Office closed the door to legal transfers, more unofficial camps would spring up near the port as children desperate to join relatives in the UK tried to make their way illegally via people traffickers and lorries. Safe Passage, a charity that offers legal support to refugee children applying to join relatives in the UK, said it estimated several hundred Calais children remained in France despite having a legal right to be in the UK. It has more than 40 live cases of children it is trying to help to relocate. Alf Dubs, the Labour peer whose amendment to the Immigration Act commits the government to giving homes to vulnerable refugee children travelling alone, said: “I’m dismayed to learn that transfers are about to cease having only just begun. Had the bridge been pulled up so soon after the start of the Kindertransport, through which my life was saved, many of us would never have made it to Britain.” Mike Penrose, Unicef UK’s executive director, said: “Bringing 750 children to safety in the UK over the last six weeks is a real achievement. That progress is worth celebrating, but we must be clear that the job is not finished. The government must provide assurances that the system will continue to work for the children who have not yet reached safety. If sustained, safe and legal routes to the UK are not made available to children, they will continue to fall into the hands of smugglers and traffickers.” Many unaccompanied minors currently dispersed around France complain that they have been left in the dark about their future by French and British authorities. This week a Sudanese radiographer living in Liverpool after fleeing Darfur made an emotional plea to the government to be reunited with his teenage brother, who remains in France five weeks after the Calais migrant camp was demolished.
Mohamed Adam Hamad Ahamed said he was becoming increasingly anxious about the mental state of his 17-year-old sibling Moubrak. He had fled death threats in a Darfur camp for displaced people and now faced another “situation” in France, he said. His hopes of seeing his brother for the first time in two years were raised when he received a phone call from a Home Office official in mid-October. But he has not heard anything since. Although the remaining children from Calais look unlikely to travel to the UK, the Home Office said it would continue to transfer other children from Europe in coming months. “The Dubs process has not ended. More eligible children will be transferred from Europe, in line with the terms of the Immigration Act, in the coming months,” Goodwill said."
2016-12-10T14:13:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Peter Tatchell disrupts Jeremy Corbyn speech with Syria protest,"Protesters led by Peter Tatchell have disrupted a speech by Jeremy Corbyn, calling on the Labour leader to demand action to end the conflict in Syria. Corbyn halted his speech while several protesters held up banners with slogans including: “Step up and demand action in Syria” and “End the suffering in Aleppo”. Tatchell, a human rights campaigner who has previously supported the Labour party, shouted over the party leader to demand he do more to condemn the actions of Russia in the Syrian conflict. As the protesters stood silently in front of Corbyn, the Labour leader said: “It’s all right, it’s OK.” Tatchell then said: “What is happening in Aleppo is a modern-day Guernica. We haven’t heard the leader of the Labour party speak out enough to demand UK air drops to besieged civilians who are dying in their thousands.” Corbyn could be heard consulting the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti before temporarily leaving the stage while the protest continued. Chakrabarti was heard telling the Labour leader “just let them do this”. Corbyn then asked the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry: “When did we condemn the bombing?”
After returning to the podium at the Methodist central hall in Westminster, he told the audience Thornberry had clearly expressed Labour’s opposition to the war in Syria and had called for an end to the conflict. Corbyn was then heckled from the audience by Tatchell, who continued to demand he do more to criticise the Russian regime, which is propping up Bashar al-Assad’s brutal dictatorship. “There has to be an end to the bombing, there has to be a ceasefire, there has to be a political solution in Syria,” the Labour leader said. He added in a question and answer session after the speech: “We have condemned all bombing in Syria, including Russian bombing, and continue to do so.” Thornberry said Labour had called on the government to back air drops of aid in rebel-held eastern Aleppo. “We have taken the strongest possible stand on this issue,” she said. Tatchell said he had staged the demonstration out of desperation over Corbyn’s inaction on the humanitarian crisis in the country. “We are so frustrated that the leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, seems to have forsaken the principle of international solidarity,” he said. “He’s made no statements as far as we know in solidarity with civil societies in Syria. He’s not listening to their demands, he’s not promoting their demands, which are very simple – a UN-supervised ceasefire, for the UN to supervise the evacuation of civilians to safe havens, and, most importantly right now, the airdrop of aid and medicine to besieged civilian populations. “Those are things that Jeremy Corbyn could push for in parliament right now this week. He hasn’t done so, so far. We hope as a result of today he will.” Tatchell joined forces with Syria Solidarity UK, whose spokesman said: “Western diplomats have conceded that there are no technical obstacles to delivering airdrops of food and medicine to Aleppo. What is lacking is the political will. If we stay silent, if western politicians refuse to take what actions are available to them, then they are complicit in these massacres.” Corbyn’s speech marked the anniversary of the United Nations general assembly signing the universal declaration of human rights in 1948. Earlier this year the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair condemned Corbyn for inaction over Syria. “Jeremy is seen as a progressive icon as we stand by and watch the people of Syria barrel-bombed, beaten and starved into submission and do nothing,” Blair said in June."
2016-12-10T20:37:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office forced to defend anti-fracking groups from extremism claims,"The Home Office has been forced to make it clear that anti-fracking campaigners should not be considered extremists after a council and a school in North Yorkshire used the government’s counter-terrorism programme to target environmental protesters. City of York council included anti-fracking activists in its Prevent programme, the controversial centrepiece of the government’s strategy to tackle extremism and thwart terrorism. In response, the Home Office on Saturday issued a statement saying “support for anti-fracking is not an indicator of vulnerability” to extremism. The council had placed anti-fracking protesters on a list of “key risks to York”, along with Islamic terrorists and far-right extremists. And an East Yorkshire secondary, Driffield school, was condemned for including anti-fracking campaigers in its counter-terrorism advice for parents. The information commissioner recently backed the decision by five police forces – Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside – to refuse to release data about the number of people they viewed as allegedly at risk of being drawn into extremism through their involvement in anti-fracking campaigns. The use of Prevent’s powers to target anti-fracking campaigners has prompted renewed criticism that the counter-terrorism programme is seriously flawed. Amrit Singh, senior legal officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative, said: “This is yet another sign that Prevent is structurally flawed and in dire need of independent review and reform. It is a clear example of how Prevent’s sweeping definition of extremism threatens the very British values it seeks to uphold, by penalising free expression on issues vitally important to the public.” In October the initiative released a detailed report claiming that Prevent presented a serious risk of human rights violations and was so flawed it was counterproductive. Fiyaz Mughal, director of anti-extremism group Faith Matters, said: “This is a direct attack on democratic opposition and a direct attack on dissent against the state. News that fracking protectors are being lined up with IS- [Islamic State-] inspired extremists is farcical and deeply worrying. Ever seen a fracking protestor set off a bomb? The answer is no, and any attempt to include them is an insult to democratic values, which include the right to dissent.” This week, the government faces a legal challenge in the high court over claims that parts of its programme go against the right to free speech. The action is being taken by a British Muslim activist who claims he was identified as a “non-violent extremist” as part of Prevent. In April the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to freedom of assembly said attempts to identify and counter Islamist extremism through the Prevent programme had “created unease around what can be legitimately discussed in public”. Other high-profile critics have included David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, and the Commons home affairs select committee, which called for Prevent to be abandoned in favour of a more inclusive “Engage” title. The Prevent strategy has been described as a counterproductive “big brother” security operation by the UK’s Muslim communities. Last Monday, a government report into social integration in Britain, which found that some communities had become increasingly segregated, also contained a significant section devoted to Prevent. Commissioned by David Cameron as prime minister and carried out by Dame Louise Casey, the review found that the programme had disrupted more than 150 attempted journeys to Syria or Iraq to join the conflict, including action by the family courts to protect approximately 50 children from being taken to the region last year. Casey’s review also claimed that the agenda of Prevent’s critics was to alienate Muslims from mainstream society. One passage stated: “In some cases, local leaders have been too ready to complain about Prevent without any real understanding of its work or knowledge of its community-based projects and partnership working with local people on the ground. “More worrying are some elements of this lobby who appear to have an agenda to turn British Muslims against Britain.” The Home Office said: “Prevent is about safeguarding people at risk of being drawn into terrorism – support for anti-fracking is not an indicator of vulnerability.”"
2016-12-11T00:04:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Riot flashpoint to housing hotspot: hipsters help to bring St Pauls back to life,"Take a walk along City Road in St Paul’s today, the area of Bristol that gained notoriety following serious riots in the 1980s, and the fried chicken joints and mini-markets give way to something less expected: estate agent signs bearing the message “Sold”. The property website Zoopla has included St Paul’s alongside two other Bristol neighbourhoods in its Top 10 Hipster Hotspots Across the UK – the areas to have seen the biggest growth in property prices over the last five years. Something, apparently, has changed.
“I remember in the 90s when people were scared to go into St Paul’s,” says Oona Goldsworthy, chief executive of the United Communities housing association. “Now we’ve got houses just off Portland Square and it’s crazy what’s going on. It’s a bonanza.” According to the report, property in St Paul’s has gone up by 38.5% over five years to reach an average price of £261,300. With its proximity to the city centre, decent transport and grand Georgian town houses, St Paul’s is succumbing to the forces that have transformed the other two areas on the list, Montpelier and Stokes Croft. For the local newspaper, the news has confirmed all its worst suspicions. “It’s official,” declared the headline in the Bristol Post. “Hipsters are to blame for soaring house prices in Bristol.” The paper went on to state that, “All three areas are now dominated by men wearing beards and women riding bikes complete with the mandatory wicker basket on the handlebars.” While the Montpelier district, with offerings such as the gin, cheese and cake emporium Cox & Baloney, has long been established as a gem of gentrification, Stokes Croft is a more recent addition. Described by one local as a concept rather than a place, Stokes Croft is little more than a single street, its decidedly humdrum collection of high street shops and takeaways transformed in recent years by the arrival of popup artisan bakeries, disco barbers and eateries bearing names such as the Love Inn and Kale & Kettle. The property prices match the fare: Montpelier has seen a 39.9% rise to an average of £494,158 over the last five years, while in Stokes Croft properties have gone up by 37.1% to an average of £317,800.
Like many in St Paul’s and the wider city, Goldsworthy’s organisation is struggling to cope with the impact of gentrification on an area that has a strong sense of community. “Just because an area becomes successful it doesn’t mean poor people can’t live there once it gets an artisan pop-up bakery,” she says. “We’ve never had artisan bakeries before but now we have, property developers have noticed and moved in.” One such developer, Gary Sheppard from Helm Construction, told the Post that credit should be given to the hipsters. “These districts had been rundown, neglected and avoided since they began to decline after the [second world] war. No other agency had managed to stem that decline. But the hipster generation has succeeded in bringing the life back to previously deserted streets.” The hipsters, of course, are people too: many are students who have graduated from Bristol’s booming universities and simply chosen to stay in the city, while others are young professionals escaping London’s high prices – and bringing them to Bristol. For Adam Cantwell-Corn, a coordinator of the Bristol Cable media co-op, “hipster bashing is obscuring the real causes and culprits behind the housing crisis”. He shows me the site of the Chocolate Factory, a relic that has been the subject of a fierce battle between residents, developers and the city council. The Chocolate Factory is in Easton, where the appearance of organic cafes and groceries in the modest terraced streets marks it out, Cantwell-Corn says, as “the thin end of the wedge of what we know to be gentrification”.
Back in St Paul’s, Aileen Edwards stands in her second-floor office in Brunswick Square and points to a recently developed building on the other side of the square. Spick and span, and rather tasteful, it offers a blend of office space and residential living close to both the retail expanse of Cabot Circus shopping centre and the boho dreamland of Stokes Croft. It is an offer that Second Step, the homelessness charity Edwards runs, would never be able to match. “I don’t know how long we’ll be able to afford to stay here,” she says. “This area is changing, there’s no doubt about that. Inequality is increasing, the private sector is buoyant because of the gentrification and affluence but it’s having a terrible effect. People are finding it harder and harder to get social housing or private sector rents that are affordable, so they are being pushed out to the margins of the city. With gentrification you lose the personality of the place.” As the city council’s cabinet member for homes and communities, Councillor Paul Smith has helped set up a gentrification commission, an initiative of the city’s new mayor, Marvin Rees. “It isn’t the fault of the gentrifiers but of the housing market,” says Smith. “People want to live in St Paul’s to be part of a diverse community, but that community moves out. When I was young St Paul’s was seen as an Afro-Caribbean area largely, although it was always a majority white working-class area. It is still a very mixed community but it is changing. The council blocks anchor it a bit. If they weren’t there you could see it gentrifying much quicker.” Rees, who spent part of his childhood in St Paul’s, addressed the dangers of gentrification in his state of the city speech in October. “Our fundamental challenge is that while Bristol is getting wealthier, inequality is increasing and the city becoming ever more unaffordable,” he said. “Affordable housing is also an element in the tough challenge to ensure gentrification does not inexorably change the look and feel of our city and reduce its diversity.” Amirah Cole is vice-chair of the Malcolm X community centre in St Paul’s, set up after the 1980 riots. There is a sense that she feels the organisation’s sense of purpose is dissolving as the community it was formed to serve disappears. “A community centre should serve its local community,” she says. “So if it’s not doing that because the community isn’t interested, you have to ask what its purpose is. Most people now think only about themselves, and that’s the whole thing about gentrification, destroying communities. I guess it’s social cleansing.” In a cafe on Cheltenham Road, opposite a Tesco Express that was the scene of the last riot in the area, in 2011, the woman serving coffee at the counter calls to three young men seated on pews at one of the wooden tables. “Guys, you’re washing’s ready,” she says. Rachel Walker takes a break from distributing coffee and laundry at the At the Well Cafe & Launderette, one of the quirkier examples of gentrification in the area. “I’m at the forefront of gentrification,” she says. Walker was living in St Paul’s, paying £430 per month for a share of a four-bedroom house, but had to move out because she couldn’t afford the rent. “It was very St Paulsy,” she says. “There were council buildings either side, there were lots of drugs and drunks, but it didn’t feel dangerous, just surreal. It’s central, it’s interesting, I love the cross-cultural aspect of it all. There are beautiful houses that could easily become a Notting Hill-like area. It feels like everyone in the entire country knows that Bristol is a nice place to live. The secret’s out. It’s an alternative to London.” THE HISTORY OF ST PAUL’S 1780s The Georgian townhouses and squares of St Paul’s are built – but it never attains the fashionable status of Clifton. 1948 After wartime bombing, housing is cheap and the Windrush generation of immigrants move in. 1968 The first St Paul’s Carnival. It grows to rival Notting Hill as a celebration of black culture. 1980 After a police raid on a cafe, social tensions erupt in the St Paul’s riot. 1999 Banksy’s Mild Mild West mural appears on Stokes Croft, next to St Paul’s. There were plans to cover it in glass to protect it from vandals, but it is now maintained by local activists."
2016-12-11T00:05:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scottish spirits are soaring (but itâ€™s gin, not whisky)","A couple of miles outside St Andrews, the Eden Mill whisky distillery has been part of the Fife landscape for more than 200 years. It was founded by the Haig family and the whisky still bears their name. After 50 years, though, the distillery was shut down and converted into a paper mill. And so it remained until 2012, when Fife businessman Paul Miller decided to return the site to its former glory. His small team of distillers are now famous locally for their pale, chocolate and crystal malt whiskies – which are matured for several years in wooden casks before they are ready to drink. Therein lies the rub. Because despite its deep heritage, it’s not whisky that’s driving the sales growth, but gin.
In fact, sales of the latter are proving so good that Christmas sales of scotch, a quintessentially festive drink, may well be surpassed by gin for the first time. “When we started out we thought whisky, we didn’t really give gin a second thought,” Miller said. “But then gin happened.” Across Scotland independent whisky distillers increasingly favour gin over whisky because it’s quicker and easier to make, and gives them a faster return. The way gin has muscled in on scotch in its heartland is telling. Some 70% of the gin consumed in the UK is made in Scotland, even though many people think of it as an English drink. In 2010 gin sales, at £774m a year, were about half those of scotch. Today, both are worth about £1.2bn, though by 2020, gin is predicted to soar to more than £1.5bn while scotch sales will stay flat, according to Euromonitor. “Whisky is fantastic and my distillers love making it,” Miller said. “But with gin, they love the fact that what they are creating can be in a box for Christmas within weeks. They don’t have to wait three or four years for what may or may not be the marginal difference they make to the whisky product.” Miller’s gin now sells more than all his whisky products put together, making up 80% of total sales. Gin brought in almost £4m this year, and Miller expects that to double in 2017.
“Gin was in the right place at the right time”, said Jonny Forsyth, a drinks analyst at Mintel, who says boutique brands such as Eden Mill have reinvented the market for it. “They’ve come up with a much more contemporary packaging and by using botanical ingredients they also appeal to young people who are really interested in natural products.” Older brands are having to adapt. Gordon’s, for example, which is owned by drinks giant Diageo, has revamped its bottle for the first time in 15 years. Stephanie Jordan, who manages Diageo’s Tanqueray gin, acknowledges that smaller brands have shaken up the market, but is not overly worried by the competition. “You get some juniper essential oils and a few other things. You pretend you’re a chemist and Bob’s your uncle, you’ve made gin”, she said. “Often there isn’t even distillation involved, which is why so many brands can be launched.” Jordan believes that half the gin brands coming to market will not be able to survive. Scotch, by contrast, has incredibly strict regulation “which means you don’t get people making it in their garages”. But is she missing the point? Scott Fergusson, Eden Mill’s head distiller, thinks formerly hardened whisky makers are enjoying their foray into gin, and that won’t stop any time soon. “With whisky, there’s such a long lead-in time. There’s a process, there are ingredients, and you cannot deviate,” said Fergusson, who graduated from St Andrews University with a first in physics. “Distillers love making gin because it’s almost the reverse. I spend lots of time thinking about recipes that will work, you’re free to experiment and you can taste the effects in a matter of days. So if it needs a bit more pepper, for example, you can change the results quickly. It’s made the job much more fun.” Fergusson is working on a gin for Christmas called “chestnuts roasting on an open fire”. “It captures the consumer in a way that’s not just a cheesy gimmick. It’s authentic,” he said. Visitors will be able to decide for themselves when the gin is available for tasting during special Christmas distillery tours. Both in England and across Scotland, the whisky trail used to be the big lure, especially over the festive season. But this year 20,000 visitors have flocked to Eden Mill to see the gin being made, and there is a waiting list for the Christmas tour. Online, Eden Mill is selling about 500 boxes a day of its “12 gins of Christmas” gift box. “I’d love to say that we cleverly thought all this through, but we didn’t,” said Miller. “We just happened to be in a good place to do it.”"
2016-12-11T15:50:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester residents told to boil tap water after technical fault,"Thousands of residents in Greater Manchester have been told to boil their tap water until further notice after untreated water was allowed to enter the pipe network. Water provider United Utilities issued a statement on Sunday morning telling people in 17,000 properties in Tameside, Saddleworth and Greenfield to boil water for drinking, food preparation and brushing teeth. A spokesperson for the firm said that an overnight technical fault at a treatment works in Buckton Castle had been fixed, but that some water, “not treated to the usual high standards”, had entered the local pipe network. “You can continue to use tap water for general domestic purposes such as bathing and flushing toilets,” the statement read. “If your water looks dirty or cloudy, we would recommend to wait until the water has cleared before washing clothes.” The company apologised to its customers and said it hoped to lift the precautionary advice as soon as possible. “We are proactively contacting vulnerable customers in the area to make sure they have adequate support and we would also ask all customers to tell friends, family and neighbours who they know live in these areas and could be affected,” read the statement from the firm, which is the UK’s largest listed water company. “Customers will receive compensation automatically and this will be paid proactively in the next five working days, so there is no need to contact us about that.” In August 2015, United Utilities – which manages the regulated water and waste water network in the north-west – issued a similar warning to 300,000 households in Lancashire to boil their water after routine tests found traces of the microbial parasite cryptosporidium at a treatment works outside Preston. There is no specific treatment for cryptosporidium, but it can cause diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, with symptoms lasting for up to two weeks. The Drinking Water Inspectorate is investigating the source of the contamination. Last month, Prof John Ashton, former director of public health for north-west England, called for a parliamentary inquiry into why the body had not yet reported its findings."
2016-12-12T00:01:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"Prince Philip is 'fantastic partner' for the Queen, says Sophie Wessex","The Queen could not have chosen a better life partner than Prince Philip and the couple still make each other laugh, the Countess of Wessex reveals in a documentary celebrating the diamond anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh’s award. “He has been a fantastic life partner for her. I think it’s maybe a fairly lonely job being queen. As a female in the top job I think to have somebody you can lean on, you can discuss things with, she can be honest with behind closed doors … I don’t think she could have chosen better. “And they make each other laugh, which is half the battle, isn’t it?” Sophie Wessex, wife of Prince Edward, tells Phillip Schofield. Schofield was given rare access to the duke and to home movies filmed by the Queen in the 1960s, which show the prince as a young man playing with his children at Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, and aboard the royal yacht Britannia.
Philip, 95, who launched the awards in 1956 to encourage personal discovery and self-reliance among young people, reveals he was surprised but pleased the DoE award had taken off in more than 141 countries and territories around the world. “The curious thing is we never tried to export it. People came along and said, ‘Can we do it? And we said yes,” he tells Schofield. In the ITV documentary, When Phillip Met Prince Philip: 60 years of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, Schofield undertakes his own DoE award challenge, wing-walking on a biplane, and talking to celebrities, athletes and others who have gained their gold awards about how the scheme has benefited them. On hearing of the wing-walking challenge, the duke warns Schofield: “Who wants to get rid of you?” and advises him: “I wouldn’t open your mouth if I were you, you’ll blow up like a balloon.” Introducing Schofield to a sky diver, the duke jokes: “That’s what happens to you if you fall off.” The award has been undertaken by millions of young people, including 2.5 million in the UK.
Those paying tribute to the duke’s achievement include his youngest son, Edward, who said his father “never talks about himself”. “He’s got a brilliant mind. He’s always amazingly innovative so people would come with ideas to suggest to him and he’d always turn them into something 10 times better”. He said his father described the DoE award, which involves sporting, volunteering and physical challenges, as a “do-it-yourself kit for growing up, which everybody always sees as a bit flippant but, actually, it is true”. Prince Philip says: “This sort of experience is going to help anybody.” Dame Judi Dench describes the duke as “an indomitable person”. Joanna Lumley, who has known him for years, says despite his stern image he is “extremely affectionate” and a “go-to-dad”.“I think he has just got an extraordinary character. He rides, sails, drives horses, fishes, swims. He’s incredibly good fun to be with, but he’s quite shy,” says Lumley. Even in his advanced years Philip, who describes himself as “the world’s most experienced plaque unveiler”, still enjoys carriage driving, though he no longer competes. As for his famed barbecues, he still keeps his hand in. “A grouse isn’t worth eating unless it’s come off his barbecue,” says Sophie, who cycled from Edinburgh to London earlier this year to help raise £300,000 for the charity. Both the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Cambridge have achieved gold DoE awards. Asked if he encouraged his children and grandchildren to take part, Philip replies: “It’s up to them. I’m not going to twist their arm.” When Phillip Met Prince Philip: 60 Years of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, Monday 9pm, ITV"
2016-12-12T07:10:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Stoke Newington flood: 150 north London homes under water,"A burst water main has forced hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes in north London. About 350 people from 150 properties had to flee after a 30-inch pipe burst in Northwold Road, Stoke Newington, on Sunday, leaving nearby streets under 3ft (1 metre) of water. Thames Water said it had begun a full investigation into the incident, which followed similar instances of mains bursting in Blackheath in south-east London, on Saturday, and in Islington, north London, last Monday.
Bob Collington, director of Thames Water, said it had been an “extremely difficult week”. He added: “I am personally devastated for those customers who have suffered flooding so close to Christmas. We are doing everything we can to help them and will make sure they are not left out of pocket for what has happened. “The bursts are a clear reminder that we need to keep investing in our ageing and sometimes fragile network, with many pipes in London well over 100 years old.”
London fire brigade station manager Nicol McCallum, who was at the scene, said: “Crews used specialist inflatable boats to evacuate the most vulnerable residents and help others recover valuables. Firefighters laid down sandbags to try and minimise the water damage.” Six fire engines and two fire and rescue units from stations including Stoke Newington, Homerton, Tottenham and Bethnal Green. The brigade said several basements were left under water by the flooding. Hackney council said Stoke Newington town hall had been made available for emergency accommodation for anyone forced out of their homes. Some residents expressed their anger about the situation on Twitter.
Thames Water said it was sending as many loss adjustors as possible to help customers. The burst main should not affect water supplies in the area, the firm added. The average UK household paid £396 for water and sewerage in 2014-15, according to the regulator Ofwat. This represents a 40% increase in real terms since privatisation, though most of this rise took place in the first five-year period between 1990 and 1995. The regulator has been criticised by MPs on the public accounts committee for allowing bills to rise too much. In September Ofwat said consumers would be able to choose their water supplier for the first time under proposals that it claimed would cut bills and improve services by introducing competition. However, the proposed overhaul would only save households about £8 a year on their water bill, the industry watchdog said."
2016-12-12T10:55:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Croydon tram crash survivors sue TfL and FirstGroup,"Survivors of the Croydon tram crash are suing Transport for London (TfL) and First Group for compensation for injuries and trauma. Seven people were killed and 51 injured when a speeding tram derailed on a bend in south London in November. Several passengers who survived the crash have instructed injury lawyers Irwin Mitchell to help them investigate who was responsible and demand payouts to help them cope with their injuries. According to an interim report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), the tram, operated by FirstGroup on behalf of TfL, was travelling at more than three times the 12mph (20km/h) speed limit when it came off the tracks on a sharp bend after a tunnel before Sandilands station. It landed on its side and travelled 25 metres (82ft) before coming to a stop. The driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and is on bail. One of the passengers taking legal action, Matthew Hewish, 25, sustained hip and ankle injuries, and was taken to Croydon hospital. He was off work for three weeks while being cared for at home. “I can’t remember much from the crash,” he said. “I must have been knocked out or passed out, but when I came to, I remember scrambling for my phone and using the light to try to see. “People died that day and while I, and others like me, know how lucky we are to have survived, we have the same questions as the families of those who died. We want to know what happened. We want to know what could have been done, if anything, to stop it, and most importantly, we need to stop it ever happening again.” The RAIB investigation ruled out defects in the track or a brake malfunction. TfL has introduced extra safety signage regarding speed restrictions before the bend, on the RAIB’s recommendation. Irwin Mitchell has previously represented people injured in train crashes at Hatfield, Ladbroke Grove and Selby. A TfL spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by the tram derailment. We continue to do all we can to offer support, including providing counselling and advising those affected to seek independent legal advice. “Claims are being handled quickly and a number of interim payments have already been made. We completely understand the call for answers on what happened and what lessons should be learned and continue to assist with the investigations.”"
2016-12-12T11:13:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Convicted terrorist says MI5 'pumped and dumped' him,"A Birmingham man who gave cash to the “man in the hat” Brussels bombing suspect claims he was recruited by MI5 and then “thrown to the wolves”, it can now be disclosed. Zakaria Boufassil, 26, said he held several meetings with the British intelligence agency’s personnel, who paid him £3,000 for information and bought him gifts, including Camel cigarettes, a Samsung mobile phone and clothes. Boufassil and Mohammed Ali Ahmed, 27, also of Birmingham were jailed on Monday for handing over £3,000 to Mohamed Abrini at a meeting in Small Heath Park, Birmingham, on 11 July 2015. Abrini earned his nickname “man in the hat” after being spotted on CCTV at Brussels airport just before the bombings in March. Boufassil was sentenced to three years in prison, while Ahmed was sentenced to eight years in prison. Boufassil claimed the MI5 officers approached him after Abrini was arrested in April. Six weeks after sharing what he knew with MI5 about his meeting with Abrini, Boufassil was arrested by West Midlands police on his return from a holiday in Morocco which he claims to have paid for with the money from MI5. Boufassil had hoped to tell the jury about his alleged recruitment by MI5 but the prosecution objected on the grounds of relevance and admissibility and it was ruled out by the judge, Mr Justice Baker. Boufassil was found guilty last week of engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism. His claims can be reported after an attempt to keep them secret by prosecutors was dropped. At a legal argument hearing held away from the jury in Boufassil’s trial, his defending barrister, Dorian Lovell-Pank QC, said: “In Zakaria’s eyes, he feels he was effectively picked up by MI5 and was pumped and dumped. “He found himself approached by the security service and he was reluctant at first, then more gradually, he told them what he knew about Abrini and the meeting in the park. “He was told by MI5 he wasn’t in any trouble and was told they were interested in signing him up or having him on their books. “He feels he ceased to be of any use to them and he was effectively thrown to the wolves.” The prosecution said they could “neither confirm nor deny” Boufassil’s claim, which is a standard response from MI5. The money given to Abrini was taken from an account that held overpaid housing benefits, the court heard. Abrini, 31, was arrested in Belgium and accused of “participating in terrorist acts” linked to the Brussels Zaventem airport suicide bombing on 22 March. The Belgian Moroccan was also wanted by French authorities over the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris in which 130 people died. Abrini fled Brussels airport after his two alleged accomplices blew themselves up. He had been on Europe’s most-wanted list since being identified as one of two suspects seen on CCTV travelling in a car two days before the Paris attacks. During his UK visit, which took place between 9 and 16 July 2015, Abrini visited Old Trafford football stadium and the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester and the Bullring in Birmingham, as well as casinos in both cities, after travelling from Syria via Turkey. A number of images were found on the phone he had been using, including one of a roulette machine, a number of pictures of Manchester United’s ground, and some of a moth in a hotel room. Abrini claimed he had not been on any “reconnaissance trips in relation to preparatory terrorist attacks” in either Birmingham, Manchester or London. He said there was no plan to attack the UK because the country has a “more developed secret service” as well as “better observation techniques”. The court heard how money was taken from an account held by Anouar Haddouchi, an associate of Ahmed who previously lived in Birmingham and had travelled to Syria to fight for Islamic State. The account contained overpaid housing benefits totalling £5,413 that had been paid between 21 December 2014 and 1 November 2015. Ahmed used a replacement debit card for the account to make 17 withdrawals between 30 May and 30 June 2015, and £3,000 of the cash was handed to Abrini in Small Heath Park. Ahmed pleaded guilty last month to the same charge against Boufassil. During his trial, Boufassil admitted meeting Abrini in the park, but denied it had anything to do with terrorism and its funding. He insisted Ahmed had never communicated his plans, but took advantage of his naivety and had not told him that Abrini, who he claimed to never have met before, was a “bad person”. He said he was a cannabis user and a “moderate and tolerant” Sufi Muslim. He said members of Isis were “worse than animals”."
2016-12-12T11:25:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who dissolved PC Gordon Semple's body in acid jailed for life,"A crystal meth addict who murdered a police officer before using techniques seen in the US TV series Breaking Bad to dispose of his body has been jailed for life and will serve a minimum of 24 years in prison. Stefano Brizzi, 50, was found guilty last month of murdering Gordon Semple, 59, in April. A court heard that he lured the officer to his London flat for sex and drugs before strangling him, dismembering his body and dissolving it in acid in a bath, copying the method of corpse disposal used by Walter White, the lead character in the US TV series. In gruesome details that emerged in court, the prosecution also accused Brizzi of cannibalism after bite marks were found on the dead officer’s rib and it was revealed that the Italian had cooked other parts of his body.
Brizzi admitted dismembering and disposing of Semple’s body, but claimed the officer, who served in the Metropolitan police for 30 years, died accidentally during a sex game after a dog leash around his neck slipped. In November, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted the Italian national of murder by a 10 to two majority after more than 30 hours of deliberation. On Monday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC sentenced Brizzi to life in prison with a minimum of 24 years. Brizzi was also sentenced to seven years for obstructing a coroner, which will run concurrently. The judge said there were “terrible features” of the case and that Brizzi’s drug addiction had ruined his life. He added: “Regret you express now for Mr Semple’s death has to be seen against what you did over a number of days to his body.” The defendant sat in the dock with his head bowed throughout the hearing. Before the murder, Brizzi had been a £70,000-a-year web developer at Morgan Stanley, but lost his job because of his crystal meth addiction. The court was told he sought help from a users’ support group, whose organiser described how Brizzi had been obsessed with Breaking Bad. Brizzi later became a social worker. He regularly took part in domination, bondage and sexual asphyxiation. He admitted to an intellectual interest in satanism after officers found a copy of the satanic bible downloaded on his computer and handwritten notes to the devil, although he denied being a satanist. Semple, who also took part in extreme sexual practices, went to Brizzi’s flat in Southwark, south London, on 1 April after the pair made contact on the gay dating app Grindr. The officer, who was based in the Westminster antisocial behaviour team and was supposed to be on duty, messaged Brizzi to say he was “free now for [a] hot, dirty, sleazy session”. The court heard that on the day of the murder Brizzi was tired and bad-tempered because he had been engaged in heavy drug use, had not slept and had been let down by someone else on Grindr. He was also dissatisfied with Semple’s appearance, describing him as fat, ugly and unattractive. Brizzi and Semple had been trying to persuade other gay men in the area to join them for a “chemsex” party, but when one man agreed to join them he was sent away by Brizzi, who told him via intercom: “We’re having a situation here. Someone fell ill but we’re taking care of it. So our party is cancelled,” the court was told. Pathologists believe he killed the officer after the pair had sex. Four days later, Brizzi was captured in CCTV footage buying items at the Leyland DIY store in nearby Southwark Street. He bought equipment including pincers, heavy-duty scissors, a putty knife, plastic buckets, carpet cleaner and a perforated metal sheet from a hardware store. He used them to strip flesh from the corpse of Semple, whose remains were found in the bath and in plastic buckets on the floor. Police officers who found their colleague’s body had been left traumatised, the court heard. Semple’s partner, Gary Meeks, made more than 20 unanswered calls to his mobile phone on 1 April and reported him missing the next morning. Semple’s body was found on 7 April when officers were called to Brizzi’s flat after neighbours complained about the smell. Officers found a pool of fat and grease inside Brizzi’s oven, which had a blood-stained handle. Semple’s DNA was found on chopsticks, a cooking pot and the oven. Brizzi, who answered the door to officers wearing pink underpants, initially confessed to deliberately killing Semple, telling police at the scene: “Satan told me to.” But he later changed his account, claiming it was an accident caused by sexual asphyxiation. A pathologist concluded that while strangulation was a possible cause of death, it would have taken minutes, rather than the momentary slip of the dog leash described by Brizzi. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC confirmed that an odontologist found that Brizzi had eaten part the body of his victim after matching a bite mark on a rib discarded in the kitchen bin with the defendant’s lower teeth. He told the court: “It would be open to my lord to sentence on the basis Mr Brizzi did indeed attempt to eat part of PC Semple’s body.” In mitigation, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC blamed Brizzi’s crystal meth addiction as she accepted the expert evidence. She said: “The behaviour can only be ascribed to taking of the drug cystal meth, which, as the court will know, has appalling effects on those who become addicted to it.” Brizzi had “absolutely no recollection” of it and was “utterly horrified by it”, the barrister added. In a statement after the murder, Semple’s family described him as “a loyal and much-loved long-term partner, brother, brother-in-law, uncle, cousin and friend to all”. “We were devastated when the news broke of Gordon’s murder and the circumstances, which are still incredibly hard to deal with. It is still insurmountably upsetting.” In a victim impact statement read to the court, PC Semple’s older brother, Ronald Semple, said his sibling had been regarded as a “Dixon of Dock Green character”. He said his brother first took a job at RBS but then joined the police and completed more than 30 years’ service. He ran several marathons and organised trips to France and elsewhere for charity. PC Semple was a “caring and gentle person” and “much loved” by his family, who were left devastated with the news of his murder, the court heard."
2016-12-12T11:49:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Neo-Nazi group National Action banned by UK home secretary,"A neo-Nazi group that celebrated the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox is to become the first far-right group to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the home secretary. Support or membership of National Action, an antisemitic white supremacist group, will become a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act 2000, pending approval from parliament. National Action has held demonstrations in UK cities with banners that say “Hitler was right”, and speakers have been filmed telling a small group of supporters about “the disease of international Jewry” and that “when the time comes they’ll be in the chambers”. The group has also been filmed training supporters in hand-to-hand combat, and putting up posters across Liverpool and Newbury declaring them “white zones”. The slogan on its website is “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain,” which was the only statement given in court by Cox’s murderer, Thomas Mair. After the order comes into force, arranging meetings or wearing branded clothing from the group will also be illegal, with breaches of the order carrying a possible maximum sentence of 10 years in prison or an unlimited fine. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the group had no place in British society. “I am clear that the safety and security of our families, communities and country comes first,” she said. “So today I am taking action to proscribe the neo-Nazi group National Action. This will mean that being a member of, or inviting support for, this organisation will be a criminal offence. “National Action is a racist, antisemitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology, and I will not stand for it. It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone.” The order is expected to come into force on Friday after debates in parliament on Wednesday and Thursday.
The Home Office said the decision had been taken by Rudd prior to the trial of Mair, a far-right extremist who was convicted and sentenced for the murder of Cox outside her constituency surgery shortly before the EU referendum. However, the debate could not be put before the House of Commons until after the trial had concluded in order not to affect the outcome. A spokesman for the Community Security Trust, an antisemitism monitoring charity, said: “National Action is a viciously antisemitic neo-Nazi group that repeatedly incites hatred and violence and whose supporters have been involved in hate crimes. We have raised our concerns about them with the government and the police on many occasions over the past two years and we welcome the news that they are to be proscribed.” Gideon Falter, the chairman of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “In common with other terrorist groups, National Action radicalises and indoctrinates the young, teaches them violence, attacks the police and the public and demands the annihilation of Jews. “This decision by the home secretary is something we have long called for and sends a strong message that the far right is in the government’s sights and will not be permitted to continue its incitement and violence.” Rudd said last month that far-right groups were becoming increasingly sophisticated, and about a quarter of the cases being handled by the government’s counter-extremism programme, Channel, concerned rightwing radicalisation."
2016-12-12T12:53:17Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2 accused of brainwashing schoolchildren on high-speed rail route,"The company behind the HS2 rail project has been accused of using Orwellian propaganda tactics after it awarded a £280,000 contract to promote the high-speed rail project to children at primary schools on the proposed route. HS2 Ltd has contracted London-based Hopscotch Consulting to develop an education programme aimed at young children. Primary schools near the route have received an email from Hopscotch inviting them to “come aboard Zoom Rail, HS2’s Primary School Engagement Programme”. Materials for teachers from HS2 Ltd’s existing education programme, seen by the Guardian, include an exercise that encourages pupils to assess four possible routes for the “Zoom Rail project”. “With no perfect answer, students must weigh the competing advantages and disadvantages, balancing community, environmental and economic factors to make the best choice,” the task description for teachers reads. “One of the four options – Route D – is the preferred route. This is not the only acceptable ‘right answer’. However, students who have closely understood the opportunities and constraints faced by Zoom Rail as it tries to strike the best balance are more likely to opt for the preferred route.” In one activity aimed at younger children, pupils are urged to create their own “powertrain” by cutting out a template of a locomotive and making it move with balloons.
Whether individual schools choose to use the education materials provided, and how teachers use them, is entirely up to the school . But anti-HS2 campaigners have accused HS2 Ltd of trying to brainwash the children who will be most affected by the proposed route for the high-speed line. “Just when we thought HS2 Ltd couldn’t sink any lower, we find they are spending quarter of a million on targeting primary schoolchildren along the route of HS2 for brainwashing,” said Joe Rukin, campaign manager at Stop HS2. “The concept of state-sponsored propaganda, which is tailored so children in communities impacted by HS2 must come to the conclusion HS2 is a brilliant idea, is truly Orwellian.” Jonathan Pile, a spokesman for Yorkshire against HS2, whose family home in Crofton, Wakefield, is 265 metres from the proposed high-speed train line, said that many teachers in the region were furious that the company had decided to target schools. “If this wasn’t so sinister and unacceptable it would be funny, but to the hundreds of families facing enforced relocation by HS2, and the thousands being financially blighted and facing years of noise and construction pollution, it is anything but a joke,” he said. A spokesperson for HS2 said the goal of the education programme was to “provide Britain with a legacy of skills and experience that will benefit the whole industry. “We are committed to ensuring that young people receive access to learning and skills opportunities which will enable them to play a role in the construction, development and ongoing operation of HS2 and other transport and infrastructure projects. “We’re 17 years away from introducing high-speed rail between the Midlands and the north of England, so it’s right that we plan ahead and help young people to develop the skills and knowledge they need to take advantage of the opportunities available. Research shows that early awareness of the value of Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects can remove gender barriers and help to reduce skills shortages in areas as diverse as the environment and engineering.”"
2016-12-12T13:46:07Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK heading for warmest Christmas Day ever, according to bookies","Bookmakers have slashed the odds on the UK having the warmest Christmas Day ever after a spell of unseasonably mild weather. The previous peak is believed to have been 16C in Teignmouth, Devon, last year. Ladbrokes has shortened the odds of that being beaten from 16-1 to 8-1. Last year central England had the hottest December in 350 years. The cold start to the month means this December is unlikely to be as warm, but the mercury has risen in recent days. The highest temperature of the month so far was 17C, recorded in Hawarden, Wales, on 7 December, more than twice the average for this time of year and the second warmest December temperature ever recorded in Wales. Grahame Madge, a Met Office spokesman, said: “In comparison to last December obviously that was quite an extreme month, certainly for rainfall and temperatures across the UK. It’s unlikely we’re going to see anything like that. The first part of December has been quite crisp weather and then the transition to much milder conditions. That weather looks likely to remain over the next few days, although temperatures might come down a bit.” He said how long those conditions remained would determine the chances of a warm 25 December, but he stressed that it was too early to speculate as it lay outside the usual forecasting window of five to seven days. The Met Office said it was trying to verify the 16C reading recorded in Teignmouth last Christmas Day. According to its data, the high remains at 15.6C, registered twice on 25 December, in Edinburgh in 1896, and Killerton, Devon, in 1920. Ladbrokes is quoting 5-1 on a white Christmas in London with identical odds for Manchester and Liverpool. It is quoting 2-1 for snow falling in Edinburgh on Christmas Day and the same for Glasgow. The UN has said that 2016 will very probably be the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year in a row. Its analysis combines the three main records, from the Met Office, Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
2016-12-12T14:00:22Z,uk-news,UK news,British couple suspected of trying to join Isis allowed to keep children,"A British couple have won a legal fight to be reunited with their children after being arrested on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria to join Islamic State. The couple, from the north-east of England, were arrested at the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone on 10 July 2015 on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts and child cruelty or neglect. Their teenage son and two younger children were in the back of the car and later told police they did not know where they had been going. The parents always insisted they were going on a surprise weekend away in the German Alps, where they planned to hike and “taste the local pastries”. No evidence was ever found that they had made any direct communication with anyone living in Syria or in Isis-controlled territories. When told that police thought the family were heading to Syria, the teenager reportedly said: “Oh my days, I never thought that my dad would really go to Syria or Morocco or somewhere like that.” The three children were placed in foster care for four months but were returned to their parents in November 2015. A high court judge has now ruled they can stay together as a family, along with their new baby sibling. Mr Justice Cobb said he was not convinced the family had been going for a weekend away in Germany, but he believed the attitudes of the parents had “genuinely changed” after they took part in an extensive deradicalisation programme. Suspicions about the family were raised four months before their arrest at Folkestone, when the father posted a picture on Facebook of a man with whom he had been in an altercation, calling him an “apostate”. He was arrested on suspicion of publishing threatening written material intending to stir up religious hatred. The family home was searched and a number of electronic devices were seized. Analysis of videos, documents and social media communications aroused concern that the parents supported forms of Islamic extremism, terrorism and jihadi activity, and that they had associations with proscribed terrorist organisations with connections in Syria and Iraq. Among the material found was a picture of a woman and children being hanged over a bridge, a video of a captured Jordanian pilot being executed, and The Book of Jihad by Abi Zakaryya. The father was a member of a WhatsApp group that included various suspected terrorists and criminals, and on which he praised the actions of a leading al-Qaida figure who was allegedly responsible for several terrorist attacks, dispatching suicide bombers, and the beheading of hostages. The father was interviewed by police but he offered no comment. The police formed the view that the father was associated or connected with al-Muhajiroun, a proscribed organisation. The father denied this and told police he had been researching the attitudes of those who espoused radical or extreme Islamic views. He was never charged with any terror offence. The mother had retweeted messages from a well-known Islamic extremist preacher as well as pictures of men in orange boiler suits being prepared for death, under the banner: “This is the recompense for every spy helping to kill innocent Muslims #Isis #IS”. In his fact-finding ruling, Cobb said the parents’ claim that they had been going for a weekend away was “wholly unconvincing”, partly because of their behaviour en route and also because of how much they had packed. Shortly before reaching the Eurotunnel terminal, the parents pulled into a supermarket car park off the motorway to change out of their traditional Muslim clothing. The mother removed her abaya and niqab, and the father changed his T-shirt and shaved off his long beard. The mother had not been without a scarf or hijab since she was 16; she said she had never known the father without a beard. The father had been to Germany at least four times in the previous 15 years, and on no previous occasion had he shaved his beard, the judge said. In the back of the car was “a substantial quantity of clothes for all seasons”, despite the alleged holiday taking place in mid-summer, plus 17 pairs of male boxer shorts, more than 40 pairs of socks, approximately 30 pairs of knickers, 17 baby-grows, a black balaclava, 112 sanitary towels, multiple razors, refills and shavers, sun creams and deodorants as well as several sim cards. The parents were carrying £3,000 in cash, £2,000 of which the father had raised in the weeks before the trip by selling items on eBay, many of which he didn’t appear to own and none of which he ever sent to the purchasers. Before leaving their home they gave away their family pet. Concluding his judgment, Cobb acknowledged “a risk that the parents have simply complied superficially” with the deradicalisation programme and that “once the proceedings are over and the glare of social work interest has faded, they will revert to their previous views and behaviours”. But he said: “There is now good evidence that the parents reject their previous ideological beliefs, which they now acknowledge to have been extreme and unorthodox; there is no evidence that they have in any sense indoctrinated [the two older children, who] have a much more resilient attitude to extreme ideology than previously.” The children will continue to be monitored by social workers."
2016-12-12T14:22:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"Soviet dissident had thousands of child abuse images, UK court told","The Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky downloaded thousands of indecent images of children over a 15-year period, most of them featuring boys, a court has been told. Bukovsky, 73, is charged with 10 counts of making and possessing indecent photos and one count of possessing an indecent computer-generated graphic. He denies all charges. William Carter, prosecuting, told a jury at Cambridge crown court on Monday that Bukovsky’s computer was identified during an operation by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. Police arrested him in October 2014 at his home on the outskirts of Cambridge. Bukovsky, who was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1976, told detectives he had indecent material, the court heard. “He [Bukovsky] responded immediately by saying he did download images and that they would be on the computer in his study,” Carter said. The police subsequently discovered “a very great deal of material” on two hard drives. It showed some “very young” children up to the ages of 12 and 13. They were “largely but by no means exclusively boys”, the court was told. There were some adults involved. In an interview, Bukovsky told detectives he had become interested in child abuse images in the 1990s in the context of a debate on the control and censorship of the internet. “He became curious,” Carter said. Bukovsky then looked for and discovered this material online, the prosecutor said. “Bukovsky said his initial curiosity turned into a hobby, rather like stamp collecting,” Carter said. The dissident continued to download images between 1999 and 2014, and estimated that he had accumulated a collection of “1,500 movies”. His interest varied year by year. The last downloads took place days before his arrest. “His computer was looking for material constantly,” Carter told the jury. “Mr Bukovsky said in essence he didn’t see what harm he was doing. He said the children in most of the material looked as if they were enjoying themselves.” The prosecution acknowledged that Bukovsky was a notable Kremlin critic seen as a hero by those who supported “the extension of human rights and democratic reform in Russia”. “There was unfortunately another side to this man, which was far from laudable: an extensive interest in real children being really abused,” Carter said. The indecent images were allegedly found on Bukovsky’s laptop months before he testified at a public inquiry into the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko, who was a close friend. Two Kremlin agents, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, poisoned Litvinenko in a Mayfair hotel with a cup of polonium tea. Bukovsky told the inquiry he was “pretty sure” the Kremlin was behind Litvinenko’s death. The inquiry chairman, Sir Robert Owen, concluded in January that Vladimir Putin and his former FSB spy chief Nikolai Patrushev had “probably approved” Litvinenko’s death. Bukovsky has been a longstanding opponent of Soviet and Russian power. He began his struggle against the Soviet regime in the early 1960s. Soviet authorities eventually kicked him out of the country after he exposed the use of psychiatric treatment against political prisoners to the west. He has lived in the UK ever since. The trial continues."
2016-12-12T19:15:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"EU citizenship deal for British nationals has no chance, say experts","A proposal to allow British nationals to keep EU citizenship after Brexit has been dismissed as a non-starter by EU experts and officials. EU insiders have given a chilly reception to the idea that Britons might enjoy associate citizenship after leaving the EU, following a claim from a leading MEP that it would feature in Brexit negotiations. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s representative on Brexit, promised last week to ensure that associate citizenship for Britons “was on the table” during the UK’s EU exit talks. He was picking up a plan from his fellow Liberal, Luxembourg’s Charles Goerens, who proposed giving British citizens the right to live and work on the continent after Brexit, in exchange for an annual membership fee. The proposal has been embraced by dejected remainers but condemned as “sinister” and “an outrage” by diehard leavers. However, it is very unlikely to happen. Introducing citizenship rights for a non-EU country would require changing European treaties, an arduous legal task no member state wishes to undertake. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council’s legal service, told the Guardian that it was legally impossible to allow nationals of a non-EU country to have associate citizenship of the union. “Moreover, politically, a revision of the treaty on this would not be accepted.” The idea would have to win the unanimous backing of the EU’s 27 remaining countries, which control the Brexit process. Jean De Ruyt, who was Belgium’s ambassador to the EU, said the plan had no chance of being supported by governments. “This proposal is absolutely not serious,” he told the Guardian. “It is very vague and for the distant future, it is not something which is made for Brexit. Maybe it can be discussed 10 years from now if member states want to change the treaty.” He added that the EU exit agreement foreseen by article 50 made no provision for any substantive treaty change. “The changes in the treaty linked to Brexit will be minimal and directly linked to Brexit.” One EU source reflected the sceptical view, describing the idea as a non-starter. “Everybody who hears about this, their first reaction is: ‘How would this ever work?’, so I think we can disregard this idea for practical reasons.” Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, along with EU governments, has rebuffed attempts by British officials to strike a quick deal on reciprocal rights for EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent. In a letter to Tory eurosceptic backbenchers, Tusk called for “precise and comprehensive solutions rather than nice-sounding expressions [which] will provide citizens with genuine guarantees of security”. EU insiders view the associate citizenship idea as similarly vague and impractical. The Liberal MEPs sounded confident they could bring the citizenship plan to the negotiating table, by tacking it onto the European parliament’s official position on Brexit, due to be voted in spring 2017 after Theresa May triggers the long-awaited article 50. But their proposal would struggle to win a majority of MEPs. The two largest groups, the centre-right EPP and the Socialists, are full of sceptical voices, while the Greens are also critical. Jo Leinen, a German socialist MEP and specialist on constitutional affairs, said there was no majority in the European parliament for the Verhofstadt plan. The idea also contradicts the repeated assertions of EU leaders that there will be no cherry-picking or sweetheart deal for the UK. “You heard Angela Merkel telling the British partners that you are either in the common market or you are not in and this applies to all the rules,” said Leinen. “If free movement is not granted by Britain, why should the EU grant free movement to British citizens. At least there should be reciprocity.” The EU would look weak if it granted British citizens rights not enjoyed by EU nationals in the UK, he added. Spelling out the daunting political obstacles, he said: “One would need treaty change and the 27 member states and their parliaments to agree special rights for a country that is leaving us, and I have doubts.” Even if the plan won the backing of MEPs, EU officials stress that Verhofstadt has no power to insist the plan will be part of Brexit negotiations. The EU rulebook makes clear the European parliament is the junior partner in negotiations over any country’s departure from the bloc. Article 50 specifies that EU governments will negotiate an exit deal, which requires the consent of the European parliament. Michel Barnier, the European commission’s chief negotiator, will lead the day-to-day process of Brexit on behalf of governments. While he did not pick up this issue at his first press conference last week, he made clear his top priority was the unity of the 27 other member states. De Ruyt said the Verhofstadt idea was likely to irritate national governments, who are in the driving seat of the Brexit process. “It is a mistake from him if he wants credibility.”"
2016-12-12T20:10:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Terror arrests made after 'significant plot to attack UK is disrupted',"Counter-terrorism investigators have made six arrests after disrupting what they believe was a “significant plot” to attack the UK that was influenced by Islamic State. Material recovered from an address raided in Derby has been initially assessed as being consistent with that needed to make homemade explosives, the Guardian understands. The arrests were intelligence led but past cases have shown that initial assumptions among investigators are sometimes incorrect because materials for making homemade explosives can also have innocent uses. It followed an operation by the domestic security service MI5 and counter-terrorism police. Counter-terrorism officials believe they have disrupted three attacks this year. The arrests on Monday morning were made at four addresses in Derby, east Midlands, where those detained were aged 22, 27, 35 and 36. A 27-year-old man was also arrested in Burton on Trent, Staffordshire, as was a 32-year-old woman in London. All six were detained on suspicion of engaging in the preparation of an act of terrorism, with the police operation being led by the north east counter-terrorism unit. Bomb experts were called to an address after one of the arrests in Derby. Police said: “As a result of the arrests today, an army bomb disposal team has been called in as a precautionary measure to the Normanton area of Derby. No houses have been evacuated.” As the day progressed, there was a noticeable and unusually high level of police activity in Leopold Street in Derby. Forensic teams entered a property and started carrying out searches. Steven Allen, 32, who lives on the road, said: “It’s usually a very quiet street. It’s just such a shock to the system because this is a very quiet street.” One of those arrested worked at a poultry factory in Ashbourne, the factory owners confirmed. Six addresses were being searched and police said the suspects were in custody, with detectives having 48 hours to release them, charge them or obtain a warrant for further detention. Ch Supt Jack Atwal of Derbyshire police said: “People living and working in Normanton will have seen a large police presence in the area today.” He added: “I would like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding while officers remain in the area, supporting the investigation. “Derby is a vibrant, multicultural city with a great community spirit and everyone has been very supportive of the action taken in Normanton today.” The rise of Isis and its threats to attack the west, led Britain in 2014 to raise its terrorist threat level to “severe”. This means that the joint terrorism analysis centre, which is housed within MI5, has advised ministers that an attack is highly likely."
2016-12-13T11:45:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan pledges to put residents at the heart of estate regenerations,"Someone comes to your door and says: “We’re going to knock your home down, but don’t worry because you’ll get a better one.” What might you say in reply? Two words, the second of which is “off”, come quickly to mind. But maybe you don’t much care for where you live. Maybe your home is tatty, draughty or too small. Maybe its surroundings depress you. Maybe the thought of a brand new place in a nicer setting holds some appeal. So if you haven’t told your visitor to go away, your reply might well be “that depends”. Sadiq Khan’s draft good practice guide to estate regeneration is at pains to address the “that depends” end of such an imaginary doorstep exchange. The 38-page document, aimed at London’s local authorities and housing associations, stresses the mayor’s wish for the support of residents to be secured for any plan to demolish where they live and build something else there instead; or to “infill” spaces around or between or even above the existing homes; or, at the least radical end of the regeneration scale, to substantially refurbish and repair them. The mayor’s foreword frames his favoured approach in terms of conservation and upgrade. “We must protect and improve estates,” he writes, setting this goal in the context of maintaining neighbourhood diversity: “The social housing they provide is a foundation of our mixed city.” The introduction repeats his manifesto pledge that demolition of estates should only occur if all other options for fixing problems and enhancing them have been exhausted. Chapter One, entitled the “aims and objectives of estate regeneration”, points out that demolition and rebuild is “a time-consuming, expensive and highly disruptive process” and says alternative ways of achieving the project’s desired goals and objectives should be considered before this most drastic route is chosen. It adds that it should only be taken “where it does not result in a loss of social housing” and that “this principle will apply” to schemes looking for funding from City Hall. In other words, London councils and housing associations, if your regeneration plan involves rebuilding with fewer social rented dwellings than there were before, you’ll get no money to assist you from the mayor. He also aims to bring his best practice views to bear throughout the planning system, including on schemes that don’t involve him directly. Chapter Two looks at consultation and engagement with residents in depth. Unsurprisingly, people become angry and upset if they feel their wishes and fears about their homes and estates are not being respected and that consultations are meaningless formalities after big decisions have already effectively been taken, or even covert ploys for neutralising opposition. The guidance, recognising this, says that consultation and engagement “should be a process, not an event” and begin “at the earliest stages of a project”. Potential costs and benefits, financial and social - a kind of regeneration balance sheet - should be set out in transparent detail from the start, including “the cost of doing nothing”. Everyone affected should be engaged, including temporary tenants and owners of small businesses on estates, and that engagement should be ongoing. The drawbacks of one-off ballots are highlighted: “They can risk turning a complex set of issues that affects different people in different ways in to a simple yes/no decision at a single point in time.” The third and final chapter looks at the vexed issue of the rights of tenants and leaseholders. What exactly is a fair deal and how can these be guaranteed? Residents have legal entitlements to financial compensation, though there are well-documented cases of leaseholders discovering that these fall well short of what they need to buy a new home in the same area. There’s not much the mayor can do about that, other than urge landlords to be as generous as possible and to negotiate before resorting to compulsory purchase. The draft guidance says that social housing tenants should always have a “right to return”, with overcrowded households offered a larger dwelling. The mayor acknowledges that many councils and housing associations offer these terms already. City Hall is emphasising that the draft guidance, which is out for public consultation for three months, aims to “put local people at the heart of estate regeneration in the capital”. As you would expect, its default reluctance to favour wholesale demolition is consistent with the approach preferred by his housing deputy, James Murray, when he was housing lead at Islington Council. Other Labour boroughs have had a big input too, notably Lewisham, Ealing and Hackney, whose own mayors or leaders have endorsed the draft. Like Khan, they argue that estate regeneration of whatever type done well and with the backing of residents can viably maintain and increase the supply of “genuinely affordable” homes of various types, improve the quality of housing and enhance neighbourhoods without betraying residents or harmfully disrupting communities that often have far more going for them than is appreciated by politicians who believe council estates to have become inherently undesirable, “sink” entities best expunged. This draft guidance won’t satisfy everyone. Those who advocate a massive estate development programme across the capital will think it far too conservative. They, perhaps, should bear in mind that a recent Centre for London report found that most of the larger Inner London estates have already undergone some form of regeneration and that the theoretical potential for “densification”, though significant, is not as vast in London as is sometimes claimed. On the other hand, some will contend that the guidance should include an explicit ultimate power of veto for residents, while champions of stock transfers from councils to bespoke, community-led housing associations may be disappointed that their regeneration recipe is not acknowledged, though the driving impulse of such campaigners to align the evolution of estates, including any redevelopment of them, with the wishes of their residents seems not massively at odds with the mayor’s words. “Involving residents at the start helps build trust in the [regeneration] process,” writes Khan. “It also means residents can help shape the options that emerge”. It is a good principle. The success of future estate regenerations will depend greatly on it being honoured. Sadiq Khan’s draft good practice guide to estate regeneration and ways to respond to the consultation can be read here."
2016-12-13T12:48:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Ampleforth College: charity watchdog to investigate handling of abuse claims,"The Charity Commission has launched an investigation into safeguarding and the handling of sexual abuse allegations at a prestigious independent Catholic boarding school in North Yorkshire. Police have been investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse at Ampleforth College, which has educated cultural luminaries such as the Downton Abbey creator, Julian Fellowes, the sculptor Antony Gormley and the actor Rupert Everett. Announcing its inquiry on Tuesday, the commission – which is the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales – stressed that its role was not to investigate allegations or actual incidents of abuse, whether historical or recent. Its remit is solely to look into the trustees’ approach to safeguarding and their handling of allegations of sexual abuse. Ampleforth Abbey, a registered charity, is the home of a Catholic religious community which is based on the same site. The St Laurence Education Trust is the registered charity which runs Ampleforth College and a second independent school, St Martin’s Ampleforth. The Charity Commission will examine whether there has been any misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charities; the charities’ handling of safeguarding policy and procedures, and how they dealt with the risks to the charities and their beneficiaries arising from alleged abuse incidents. “The commission stresses that it is not a safeguarding authority and its inquiries will not investigate allegations of abuse or actual incidents of abuse, whether historic or recent,” it said in a statement. “Its concern is with the proper regulation of charities. Anyone with concerns about specific incidents of alleged abuses, whether historic or recent, regarding any charity, should report their concerns to the police and the relevant safeguarding authorities.” A report will be issued once inquiries have been concluded, the commission added. An Ampleforth spokesperson said trustees were cooperating fully with the commission, adding: “Ampleforth is strongly committed to good governance and a January 2016 inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate found the college to be fully compliant with regard to all aspects of safeguarding. “In addition, an independent audit of the abbey trust’s safeguarding commission carried out by the Catholic Safeguarding Advisory Service on behalf of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission in June 2015 endorsed the work of that commission in safeguarding children and vulnerable adults.”"
2016-12-13T13:00:45Z,uk-news,UK news,"McCluskey too focused on Labour party, says Unite leadership rival","Len McCluskey is “dabbling in politics all the time” and focused on the Labour party instead of running Unite, according to a rival who hopes to become the new head of Britain’s most powerful union. Gerard Coyne, the regional secretary from the West Midlands, has declared he will stand against McCluskey, who is seeking a third term as leader. During a speech setting out his leadership campaign at an event in Birmingham on Tuesday, Coyne said the “time is right for change” at the top as he vowed that his primary focus would be Unite’s 1.4 million members. “Unite has become too much of a political commentator and not actually focusing on the concerns of our membership,” he told journalists at the city’s landmark Fort Dunlop building. “The reality here is there’s been much criticism about the fact that the general secretary and the union more generally has just been dabbling in politics all the time.” Coyne’s official declaration draws up the battle lines for a contest that could also dictate the future of Labour. Questioned by reporters, Coyne refused to be drawn on whether he would maintain support for Jeremy Corbyn if he won.
McCluskey triggered a leadership contest last week by giving notice of his resignation, then immediately announced he would be standing for a third term. The month-long election will take place in the spring, with the result announced on 28 April. Coyne hopes to win the support of members concerned by Corbyn’s anti-Trident stance, given that thousands of Unite members work in the defence industry, as well as those worried about work in the car industry, after reports suggested that the Labour leader was considering advocating a ban on petrol cars. Corbyn’s allies see the challenge as another attempt to undermine the Labour leader. A senior source close to Corbyn said it was backed by “enemies within the party” but added that McCluskey would win. “He has support where it matters. This is a key battle for the party,” the source said. In an article for the Guardian, Coyne makes a direct appeal to ordinary union members, saying they are the ones whose views he wishes to represent. “Under my leadership, Unite would be a more flexible, responsive and transparent union for all our members,” he said. “Often, they are people who don’t feel ‘political’, even if they are affected by political events. I believe they want a general secretary who spends less time trying to run the Labour party and more time looking after their interests.” Coyne also made comments that will be seen as a criticism of McCluskey over the use of £400,000 of union funds to help him buy a £700,000 flat near Borough Market in south London. “All too often, members feel the leadership of their union is too remote and out of touch and they get angry and disillusioned when they read about allegations of inappropriate uses of union money. That has to change,” Coyne said. The union has said the money was part an equity share arrangement commonly used to help general secretaries buy homes in London, and insisted the deal would raise more money for its members when the flat was eventually sold. Coyne, the son of union activists who has been regional secretary for 15 years and a Unite member for 28, said he would continue to campaign for a Labour government but would prioritise pay deals. “I passionately believe Unite members would be better off under a Labour government and I will continue to work with anyone to bring that about,” he said. “But I also understand that most of those members want their union officials to concentrate on negotiating pay deals rather than playing at politics.” McCluskey was elected general secretary in November 2010, shortly after Ed Miliband became the Labour leader. He was re-elected in 2013 for a five-year term and if he wins a new mandate it would authorise him to continue to support Corbyn’s leadership. Unite has 1.4 million members and has given millions of pounds to the party. McCluskey’s decision to force a new election will be seen by some as a gamble because some Unite members are concerned by Corbyn’s support for a ban on fracking and his lukewarm support for nuclear power. However, McCluskey has a high profile, which has been carefully nurtured this year to appeal to the mainly leftwing activists who tend to vote in Unite elections. McCluskey’s five-year term was to end in 2018 so he has effectively brought the election forward a year. The 66-year-old would have come under pressure to retire if he had stayed until the end of the scheduled term. A Militant sympathiser in the 1980s, McCluskey was national secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union before becoming assistant general secretary of Unite, formed from a merger of the TGWU and Amicus. Despite Coyne’s support from Labour’s parliamentary party and large sections of the union movement, McCluskey is still seen by many as the favourite."
2016-12-13T16:43:54Z,uk-news,UK news,'My life shouldnâ€™t be dictated by Southern rail strikes',"In London Bridge station at 9.30am on Tuesday, big red crosses in LED lights shone above all but three of the 15 platforms. Beneath them, a young woman darted, talking into a hands-free mobile phone headset. “I have an exam today and I don’t think I’m going to make it on time,” Benan Yolcu, 21, said. She was trying to get to Brighton, where she is studying law and criminology. She had known a strike was coming but said that when she checked a rail timetable app there was nothing to suggest it was that day. “I thought it was not going to be today,” she said. “And when I checked online [on a rail timetable app] it said that everything was running normally.”
Yolcu was one of thousands of commuters caught up in the first of three days of strike action by train drivers on Southern rail. Staff have walked out over plans to dispense with control of the doors by guards on all the operator’s services. All Southern’s 2,242 weekday services were cancelled as a result of the industrial action by train drivers’ union Aslef. As a result, London Bridge, a terminus for Southern services, was quiet at what would have been the tail end of the morning rush hour.
Commuters were urged not to travel. But that message had not got through to the dozens who turned up at Balham station, in south-west London, for their morning train. Jessica Knight, 23, arrived there just before 8am, hoping to make her way to work at a branch of Savills, the estate agent, in Richmond. “I didn’t realise it was completely not working,” she said. “It’s annoying because there are so many people trying to get to work and do their jobs. They need to sort it out, really.” Joseph Volcy, 32, who works in digital marketing, was another of those turned away at Balham. “I just didn’t know and it’s awful,” he said. “By the way I’m seeing it I won’t get to work until 11, because it’s in Kingston. I need to get on my phone, talk to all my clients one by one. “It’s not the first time. I’m really disappointed. The train is never on time, sometimes it says it’s coming and just disappears. I’m thinking I have to move house. It’s bad because it really affects your morale.” Many found that journeys they expected to measure in minutes stretched into hours. Allie Filippova, from Croydon, said her 45-minute trip to Clapham took two hours. ”I usually take the train to Balham in the mornings to get the Northern line to Clapham. This morning I took the No 50 bus, but after 90 minutes it stopped in the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason,” she said. However, such a delay was not unusual, according to Filippova, even when drivers were working: “Last night it took me 1hr 40mins to get home because of unreliable Southern trains and a bus that also terminated early for no reason.”
Rebecca Ellis, from Coulsdon, avoided tortuous travel arrangements by staying with her boyfriend in central London. “My step-mum is having to stay at a friend’s for the next few days, and my father is having to book a hotel,” she said. “All in all, I’d say we as a family are completely sick of these strikes. We understand the point of the unions, but we think both parties need to be stopped. It feels like for December we are in a constant state of unrest for work commitments. “My life shouldn’t be dictated by rail strikes, but it has, and will continue to be until this madness stops. Too many evenings I have stood cold with hundreds of other commuters waiting for 30-45 minutes, sometimes longer for delayed or cancelled trains. Many times in the morning we have fought to get on an already packed train because they refuse to run a regular service, or simply cannot because of driver’s on strike. “This whole situation has been an appalling mess for the past year, and I, as a citizen, demand the government do something.”"
2016-12-14T10:02:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan says his team is ready to run strike-hit Southern rail,"The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said his team could go in this week to tackle the Southern rail strike if the government stopped “playing politics” and gave Transport for London (TfL) responsibility for commuter services. Pleading with the government on behalf of commuters and London businesses, Khan said: “My message to the government is let my team go in. We can go in this week to help run this Southern line.” Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he urged the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to put party politics aside by giving a Labour mayor responsibility for Southern. On Tuesday, Grayling dismissed the idea as “nonsense” and said in a letter to MPs: “Transport for London has no experience of running a mainline railway like this.”
But Khan said TfL had a better record than private operators. “Transport for London has fewer cancellations, fewer delays and fewer strikes. Since I became mayor, we have had 92% fewer strikes because I talk to those who represent our workers,” he told the BBC. He also pointed out that Grayling’s predecessor, Patrick McLoughlin, and the former mayor of London Boris Johnson agreed in January that the government would hand over responsibility for running commuter trains on the Southern, Southeastern and South West Trains networks to TfL. Khan said: “The previous government made a deal with the previous mayor. The only difference is I’m a Labour mayor. How is that fair on the commuters and businesses? “Chris Grayling is playing party politics with commuters, with businesses and with London. I say stop it. We can do a deal with you, the government.” He pointed out that last week, a letter from Grayling to Johnson had rejected the idea of transferring suburban lines to TfL, because the transport secretary did not want to see the services “in the clutches of [a] Labour mayor”. Khan said: “We have got to do better than this. We have got to provide a system that is fair to commuters and hasn’t had the appalling service that commuters receive every day from Govia [Southern’s owner].” He pointed out that Conservative-run councils, including Surrey, Hertfordshire and Kent, supported the idea of TfL taking over suburban services.
“We would make sure the longer lines carry on running under the franchise system, so the government can focus on the longer lines and let us look after the suburban lines. It’s a win win,” Khan said. “Why the government says no is purely party politics. And in the meantime, we are losing tens of millions of pounds for our businesses, commuters are suffering and patients can’t make appointments. How is that right?” Grayling was scathing about the suggestion in an interview with LBC. “He’s got some significant problems with Transport for London having big financial difficulties, the Piccadilly line is in a state of chaos, he’s running out of money for projects already in the pipeline and he’s making grand promises about things like bridges over the Thames he hasn’t got the money to build. So I’m afraid people should take what the mayor says with a pinch of salt,” he said."
2016-12-14T10:17:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Met chief: police should not believe all sexual offence complainants,"Britain’s most senior police officer has again called for an end to the practice of automatically believing alleged victims of sexual crime, despite fears in the policing establishment that such a move would lead to rapists going unpunished. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said the current advice about believing victims led to confusion of the kind that dogged Operation Midland, Scotland Yard’s investigation into VIPs based on the account of a false accuser. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said: “At the moment much of the advice that is given to the police by the inspectorate has been that we should believe, particularly in sexual offences, the complainant. I think to use the word belief confuses this, and there is some evidence in these cases it confused some of the investigations.” He added: “We should be rigorous, independent and sympathetic but we shouldn’t believe the complainant, because to believe leaves us in a difficult position when we talk to the suspect, who says: ‘Well hang on, you just believe the victim, what are you going to believe of my claim?’” A scathing review earlier last month by the retired judge Sir Richard Henriques found that automatically believing victims “perverts our system of justice”. Hogan-Howe, who commissioned Henriques, wants the College of Policing to rewrite its guidance by removing any mention of believing victims. But he faces across-the-board resistance from the policing establishment, the Guardian can reveal. Police and crime commissioners, the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), the mayor’s office, the victim’s commissioner, and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) have all voiced their determination to block Hogan-Howe’s attempt to change the guidance fearing it will deter victims from coming forward. Vera Baird, the former solicitor general and chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: “Hogan-Howe is completely incorrect on this. There is huge resistance to it [dropping automatically believing victims] pretty well everywhere.” Baird, who is the police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, told the Guardian that the instruction to believe victims had succeeded in encouraging more survivors to come forward. “Police have a history of disbelieving complainants. As Thames Valley, Rotherham and other areas have shown it is very difficult to complain about intimate crime. The guidance is hard-won – it is the product of failures which have been redressed by a change of attitude. We mustn’t now turn the clock back.” This view was echoed by the victims’ commissioner, Lady Newlove. She said: “I strongly feel that if police no longer believed a victim of sexual assault’s account, it would be a great step backwards in how they are treated. “Victims have not asked to become a victim of crime, so if or when they decide to report a crime it is important to know that the police will take the matter seriously.” The college has reluctantly agreed to review its guidance in light of Henriques’ recommendation, but it is in no mood to change. Dave Tucker, crime lead at the college, said the guidance was designed to give victims confidence in coming forward. “If we don’t do that, people who have committed awful offences will get away with it.” He said: “There is evidence to suggest that a more accepting and supportive approach to victims has increased the level of reporting. We need to be really careful before we lose any of that of progress.” One rape victim, known as Ivy, wrote on her blog: “Fear of speaking out and not being believed ensured my silence and kept me trapped in the abuse for 39 years. “Do police officers honestly believe that a victim would voluntarily come forward and report sexual assaults having been informed that their account will not be believed or accepted?” Baird predicted that the college would not change its guidance. “They fundamentally disagree with Hogan-Howe and think he is on his own on this,” she said. “It is better for the Met to just confront the fact that a few officers made significant errors and not try to change something which, in innumerable other investigations, is working extremely well.” The HMIC says it stands by its 2014 recommendation that the “presumption that the complainer should always be believed should be institutionalised”. But it added that this applied to recording crime and officers “must always proceed with an open mind” in investigations. Sophie Linden, London’s deputy mayor for crime and policing, expressed her disagreement with Hogan-Howe at a meeting of the London assembly’s crime and policing committee on the lessons from Operation Midland. Sitting alongside Linden, Hogan-Howe explained why he had asked the Home Office to look again at guidance on automatically believing victims. “As soon as the word belief comes in there are dangers,” he said. “Having met some of the suspects in these cases, who were damaged by what happened to them, one of the things that really concerned them was that the officers had believed the victim and then allegedly approached the suspects with an open mind and were not persuaded. That’s a serious issue that needs to be addressed and … I would park the word belief.” Linden said: “When they [victims] come forward they need to be believed … because it is so important that we don’t undermine the confidence of the trust of victims to come forward.” In a rare public show of public disagreement, Hogan-Howe then said: “That is the the complete antithesis of what I have just said … the dangers inherent in that approach are writ large in this case.” Hogan-Howe has also failed to get the backing of his fellow chief constables. The NPCC’s lead on child protection and abuse, Ch Con Simon Bailey, told Henriques that the current guidance should remain in place. “It is important to highlight that whilst the starting point for the police service is one of belief, this is not ‘blind’ belief that has no regard for credible evidence,” Henriques’s report quotes Bailey as saying. But Henriques takes issue with Bailey. In his report he says: “The present police guidance causes those not telling the truth to be artificially believed, and thus liars and fantasists and those genuinely mistaken are given a free run both unquestioned and unchallenged.” The Police Foundation thinktank says opposition to the call by Henriques and Hogan-Howe should not shut down debate. The research officer Andy Higgins said: “The Henriques report has exposed a clear faultline in policing. “An independent and open debate is now required that should start from a different position than a focus on belief: instead it should ask how the police service can ensure both that victims have confidence to report their experiences to the police, and that fundamental legal principles are protected, in particular the rights of those accused.”"

Surrey police said officers received the call from people inside the trailer of the vehicle with concerns for their welfare at 3.10pm on Tuesday. Officers attended junction 11 of the M25 motorway near Chertsey, Surrey, and discovered 13 suspected illegal immigrants inside, the force said. The group included 10 adults and three children, according to local reports. The group was checked by paramedics and then taken to Dover by immigration enforcement."
2016-12-14T11:24:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"Operation Midland case VIPs could get payouts, says Met chief","High-profile figures wrongly accused of child sexual abuse as part of Scotland Yard’s controversial Operation Midland investigation are likely to receive compensation from the police force, its chief has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said it was “perfectly possible” that the likes of the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor and Lord Bramall, the former head of the British armed forces, would receive payouts. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hogan-Howe defended the force’s reputation following a damning report from Sir Richard Henriques, a retired British judge, on its handling of Operation Midland, which hinged on what were ultimately deemed to be the fantasies of a single complainant, known as Nick. He is being investigated by Northumbria police for allegedly perverting the course of justice. Asked if families affected by Operation Midland should be compensated, Hogan-Howe, who will retire in February, said: “I think it’s perfectly possible. We’re eager to resolve things as quickly as possible. “I’ve met both Lord Bramall and Harvey Proctor and I’ve apologised to them personally. I think all we’re waiting for now is for them to formulate what they would explain are the damages in the case. “The sad reality is that in these cases we got it wrong. The reputation of the Met police should not be damaged by these errors in these cases.”
The Henriques report found one of the reasons detectives blundered was because they had to believe the victim under a policy originally aimed at stopping officers hiding the scale of sexual violence. Hogan-Howe reasserted his view that complainants should not automatically be described as victims and police officers should avoid using the word “belief” or “believe” when dealing with unproven allegations. “What we should be as police officers is independent, we should be comforting, understanding and sympathetic and accept their complaint,” he said. “To use the word ‘belief’ confuses this. They shouldn’t be automatically described as a victim.” Detectives helped Nick fill out a claim for criminal injury compensation and at one point described his claims as “credible and true”. Asked if the officer who used that phrase had been fired, Hogan-Howe said this was subject to investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the conduct of five officers linked to Operation Midland. Hogan-Howe briefly touched on the issue of hate crime in the capital following the EU referendum. He said social media had helped to reveal the “shocking” level of abuse directed against minority communities. “What gets told to us and what we record certainly went up after Brexit,” he said. “I think it went up by about two-thirds, three-quarters for about 12 weeks and then it has gone back, but not quite to the levels that we saw before Brexit. “I think it has always been there and what YouTube and social media is bringing to us is the reality of it for our minority communities.”"
2016-12-14T12:42:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Former child abuse inquiry counsel cleared of wrongdoing,"The former senior counsel on the national child abuse inquiry has been cleared of any wrongdoing in an independent investigation by his chambers. Ben Emmerson QC, who quit the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) in September, was named in a BBC Newsnight programme after an inquiry worker revealed details of an alleged sexual assault in a lift. The abuse inquiry, under the chairmanship of Prof Alexis Jay, has repeatedly refused to release any further information about Emmerson’s departure. His law chambers, Matrix, set up an independent inquiry into the allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment. It was led by the former director of public prosecutions, Sir David Calvert-Smith. Matrix said on Wednesday: “After examining the evidence, Sir David submitted his final report to the management committee earlier this week. In his report, Sir David concluded ‘without hesitation’ that Mr Emmerson had not committed any act of sexual assault or sexual harassment.” Welcoming the inquiry’s findings, Emmerson said: “This has been a difficult period and I am naturally very pleased that an independent senior judge has now confirmed that the allegations against me were always unfounded. I hope that the inquiry can now be left to get on with its important work, free from unnecessary distractions.” Emmerson resigned after being suspended by the inquiry over concerns, it said, “about aspects of Mr Emmerson’s leadership of the counsel team”. The prime minister, Theresa May, was forced to step in to express her confidence in the inquiry, which is costing £100m over five years. A review of the inquiry’s work, which has been carried out by Jay, is due to be published in the near future. The allegation of sexual harassment was not put to Emmerson before he resigned from the inquiry. Panel members on the inquiry were made aware of the allegations. The highly experienced QC had already made his decision to leave the child abuse inquiry before he was told about the allegation. In the meantime, IICSA has formally launched a separate, independent examination of the way Emmerson’s resignation was handled. It may now ask why Emmerson was not asked about the now discredited allegation at the time so that he could respond. Emmerson is now back working on international cases, his previous area of legal specialisation. The human rights campaigner Helena Kennedy, who has worked with Emmerson, welcomed the independent inquiry’s finding that dismissed the allegations of sexual misconduct. “I have known Ben for many, many years,” Lady Kennedy said. “He’s a feminist. He lives as he speaks. He had discussed this matter with me. He’s not someone who takes liberties with people. I shared his shock when a public allegation was made. I’m satisfied that it was ill-founded.”"
2016-12-14T12:45:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail strike: RMT leader says he was barred from Acas talks,"Talks between Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, and Aslef began on Wednesday morning, with hopes that the escalating row and the extreme disruption will push the two sides into some form of agreement. Southern rail passengers are facing more misery with no trains running at all for a second consecutive day as the drivers’ union and the company started talks at Acas to seek a breakthrough in the long-running dispute. Drivers from Aslef have continued their strike, with a third day planned for Friday. However, relations between GTR and the RMT union, representing conductors, may have been further damaged after the RMT leader, Mick Cash, left Acas, claiming to have been “barred” from talks.
Cash said GTR was fully aware on Tuesday night he would be attending talks, but that he was told on arrival by the company that he would not be allowed to take part. He said: “RMT is furious at the complete contempt that has been shown to us by Southern rail this morning, which leaves us in a state of limbo when we should all be around the table thrashing out the issues that have led to the current action. “Our members were expecting discussions to take place today and instead we have had the door slammed in our faces. That is no way to rebuild the confidence of the workforce in the Southern management and the talks process and it is no way to reach a solution, which is what the public are crying out for.” But GTR said it still hoped to talk to Cash, although only Aslef had been invited by Acas to discuss the current strike by drivers. Nick Brown, GTR’s chief operating officer, said: “We hope today’s talks with the Aslef leadership are productive. I have spoken with the general secretary of the RMT this morning and informed him we’d be happy to meet him at Acas later today to talk about any new proposals he has to try and end the conductors’ dispute and I also asked him to call off their programme of strikes planned for Christmas and new year.”"
2016-12-14T14:16:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Former army officer to launch legal action over MoD 'witch-hunt',"A former British army officer is to launch fresh legal action against the Ministry of Defence over her alleged treatment at the hands of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat). Rachel Webster, who rose to the rank of captain and completed four tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, called on the prime minister, Theresa May, to put an end to Ihat and its “bloated, discredited and damaging witch-hunt” as she and her legal team revealed damages claims would be lodged at the high court against the MoD. Ihat has been investigating alleged abuses by UK military personnel against Iraqi civilians dating back more than a decade. Webster’s comments coincided with a pledge from the defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, who said investigations into alleged abuses by the British military in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland would not be allowed to develop into a flood of legal claims on the scale of Iraq. Webster, who has already received a payout from the MoD in relation to her contact with Ihat investigators, claims to have been roughly treated and humiliated when arrested and physically restrained in her own home in a dawn raid in 2014. In a statement, her barrister, David Taylor, said on her behalf that Ihat was an “unstoppable double-jeopardy juggernaut running dangerously out of control”. “Rachel calls for an end to this self-inflicted military fiasco and that an inquiry be ordered to see what went so badly wrong,” the statement said. “The prime minister, Theresa May, said recently that the bravest of the brave would be protected. Rachel Webster served her country well for 24 years. “So she calls upon the prime minister, Theresa May, an honourable woman, who like Rachel has spent her whole life defending British values and protecting British lives, to shut down Ihat now and put an end to this bloated, discredited and damaging witch-hunt.” Soon after the statement was read on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice, Webster, who was wearing her military service medals, broke down in tears. Webster, who was awarded a commander’s commendation for “exceptionally valuable service” in Kosovo, was initially contacted by the inquiry team in October 2013 asking her to provide a witness statement about the activities of a former colleague, but she declined. Fallon was giving evidence to a Commons defence sub-committee looking into the handling of accusations against members of the British armed forces, in particular the work of Ihat, set up by Labour in 2010. The chairman of the committee, the Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former British army officer, expressed frustration that the number of cases in relation to Iraq had got out of control and that past and present members of the armed services been put under unnecessary pressure.
Ihat investigators have faced relentless criticism from parts of the media, which have portrayed the troops as innocent victims of lawyer-driven actions. But defenders of Ihat recall the notorious case of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi who died in British detention, and note that the MoD has paid out £22m in compensation to victims of alleged abuse in Iraq. Ihat has looked at 1,490 cases of alleged abuse, many of them brought by Public Interest Lawyers, which has since closed down. Fallon told the committee the MoD had not anticipated the “industrial scale” of alleged cases in Iraq. Asked by MPs on the defence sub-committee if he could ensure that there would not be a repeat in relation to Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, he said he would work to ensure there would not be and that legislation was planned that would include time limits on cases. Asked about the Afghanistan investigation, Operation Northmoor, Fallon said: “I am not going to let it descend into a witch-hunt.” And he promised to work alongside the Northern Ireland secretary over the allegations there to ensure they were kept in proportion. “We are not going to allow Northern Ireland to become another Ihat,” Fallon said. The military police are investigating allegations by 150 Afghan detainees of mistreatment. The Police Service of Northern Ireland’s legacy investigation branch is looking at 302 deaths during the Troubles that involved the military."

Riaz Makhmood, 38, Sajid Ali, 37 and Zaheer Iqbal, 39, all from Rotherham, have been charged with assaulting a girl under the age of 14 between June 1994 and June 1995. Riaz Makhmood faces three charges of indecent assault; Sajid Ali faces seven charges of indecent assault and Zaheer Iqbal faces five charges of indecent assault. The three men are the first people to be charged as part of Operation Stovewood, the independent NCA investigation into allegations of non-familial child sexual exploitation and abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The men have been bailed and will appear at Sheffield magistrates court on 9 January. The NCA launched Operation Stovewood following the publication of the Jay report in 2014 into allegations of widespread sexual abuse of children in Rotherham over a 16-year period from 1997. The report led to the resignation of the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. To date, the operation has resulted in 15 men being arrested, interviewed and bailed pending further inquiries. The investigation has identified 46 suspects and has begun the process of engaging with 157 victims and survivors."
2016-12-14T16:20:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"Boris Johnson's unused water cannon had stereos fitted at cost of Â£1,000","Officials in Boris Johnson’s administration while he was London mayor spent nearly £1,000 fitting stereos to three water cannon that were never approved for use on the capital’s streets, it has emerged. Johnson’s successor, Sadiq Khan, revealed that nearly £323,000 had been spent to buy, modify and maintain vehicles, which were purchased secondhand from German federal police in 2014 in anticipation of social unrest. Greater London Authority officials said they hoped to sell on the water cannon for between £35,000 and £43,000 – more than they cost to purchase, but far less than the funds spent on them to date. However, no deal has yet been agreed.
A minimal reserve price will be set to ensure the machines, which were built in 1990, are sold for more than their scrap value, the GLA said. Any funds recouped will go towards communities and youth projects. “It beggars belief that such a huge amount of taxpayers’ money has been wasted on paying to store these redundant machines,” Khan said. “We’ve been left in this position by the previous mayor, who rashly purchased them before he even had permission to use them, and now it’s my job to claw back as much of London taxpayers’ money as I can. “I have spent a significant amount of time looking into how I can do this and have been left with no choice but to sell these machines through a process that charges a fee.” A GLA source said she understood that the stereos, which included radios and CD players, had been installed to the water cannon so police officers operating the vehicles were able to listen to the news while out on the streets. But a second official stressed that while the money for the machines’ modifications came from the GLA, it was the Metropolitan police that had decided how it was spent. The Guardian has contacted the Met for an explanation of why it decided that they required stereos with CD players. Other costs incurred during the modification and maintenance of the machines between April 2014 – when they were bought – and April 2016 include: £30,625.96 for conversion to UK specification and service parts £19,376.70 for the supply and fitting of CCTV £8,584.50 for the supply and fitting of warning equipment £3,109.20 for the supply and fitting of 999 sirens £1,688.04 on MOT tests Johnson decided to buy the three Wasserweffer 9000 water cannon in 2014 after the Met requested that they be made available to address a gap in public order tactics recognised following the riots of 2011. However, their purchase came before Theresa May, then home secretary, had approved their use – in the face of overwhelming opposition from the public. The following year, May refused to authorise their use by any police force in England and Wales, in what was seen as a snub to Johnson. By selling the cannon, a key Khan manifesto pledge, the GLA would save almost £175,000 over the next eight years, officials claimed. They said this money would be spent on vital frontline services to help tackle the causes of crime. Khan said: “By working with communities and returning to real neighbourhood policing, we can do far more for the safety of our city rather than relying on obsolete and illegal water cannon. “They do not belong on the streets of London and by selling them, we’re able to put money back into helping young people affected by gang crime, and keeping Londoners safe.”"
2016-12-14T17:59:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Is the government truly on London's side?,"Here’s a story I believe. That’s partly because I want to. But it’s also because the people I heard it from believe it, which, given who they are, matters more. It goes that when Theresa May found out that Philip Hammond had met Sadiq Khan before delivering his autumn statement to discuss what powers and monies would be handed down to City Hall, Number 10 sent a rocket through the party wall. I can’t say if this was because the PM was annoyed at not being told in advance that her man at Number 11 would be sitting down to natter with the London mayor, or because she didn’t want him hobnobbing with Khan at all. Either way, the tale is being seen as not only confirming May’s determination to impose her authority over her ministers but also showing her to be wary of allowing Khan to get a larger grip on the capital’s affairs. Well, you can see how there might be a dilemma. Not everyone views the Brexit vote as primarily a regional revolt against we smug gits of the “metropolitan elite”, but with Ukip attitudes more of a threat to the PM than the Labour Party in parliament is, you can imagine why she might not wish to risk being portrayed as favouring the voracious, multicultural, remain-stay capital. On the other hand, the implications of Brexit appear to mean that the country may become still more dependent on London’s resilient, highly-productive economy and the subsidy this supplies to the rest of the UK – good reasons for listening to its businesses and politicians of several shades who think more autonomy would help it do so more effectively. Whatever is in the PM’s mind, the government’s approach to devolution to London government is looking just a bit uneven. Is it truly on the capital’s side? The affordable housing deal announced by Hammond last month is seen in City Hall as quite a triumph and a reflection of its good working relationship with housing and London minister Gavin Barwell, also MP for Croydon Central, whose praises Khan sang at mayor’s question time on Wednesday. But at the other end of the scale is transport minister Chris Grayling’s long-feared refusal to hand control of the Southern and other suburban rail services to Transport for London despite his predecessor agreeing to. Khan is squeezing political profit from this for all he’s worth. Can’t blame him for that, but it shows that he knows there’s nothing else to be extracted for the time being. Then there’s the lower profile devo prizes in between. Khan welcomed Hammond’s saying that the budget for adult education in London will be put at the direct disposal of the city itself, believing it can be deployed to best effect at local level. But his deputy for planning, regeneration and skills, Jules Pipe, recently spoke of exactly the same commitment being made in the budget 18 months earlier. “I’m hoping this thing’s for real this time and that this chancellor wasn’t holding crossed fingers behind his back,” he observed. It’s supposed to happen from 2019. Another Hammond announcement, to transfer the work and health programme budget to London subject to meeting “certain conditions, including on co-funding” was greeted by Pipe with a similarly measured “maybe”. The sums involved are relatively small, but could go quite a long way. Pipe remained hopeful that such moves, if they occur, could be “symbolic” of a larger, long-term intent and stressed again London’s need for the type of bold, fiscal devolution recommend by the London Finance Commission under Boris Johnson, and whose second report, asked for by Khan, is being worked on by an array of major brains. Some say the wheels of central government are moving slower than ever just now, but the fragmented Britain revealed by the referendum result suggests that devolution impetus could help fend off national paralysis - something Brexit Britain really doesn’t need."
2016-12-14T20:08:31Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rolls-Royce winning contracts legitimately key to growth, says CEO","The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, which is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over bribery allegations, has said winning business ethically plays a key role in his plans for future growth. Warren East said the Derby-based engineering group was focusing on securing contracts legitimately. “We are spending time training people and making sure everyone understands there is a right way to do business,” he said. “We are keeping training up to date, and steps have been taken to ensure there is a zero tolerance policy to unethical behaviour.” Rolls-Royce, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft, has been accused of hiring a network of agents to help it land lucrative contracts. East told the Guardian that the FTSE 100 company was committed to winning business by fair means. “I think if we can win with really good products and good service and actually superior products and service, then we are winning sustainably and I am interested in winning sustainably,” he said. A recent Guardian and BBC investigation uncovered leaked documents and testimony from insiders that suggest that Rolls-Royce may have benefited from the use of illicit payments to boost profits for years. When asked whether he was ashamed of the allegations, East said: “It’s not a very desirable situation. But it is what it is, now we have to deal with it and the important thing is, we are dealing with it. I can’t do anything about the past. I can only do things about now and the future.” He refused, however, to comment on the substance of the allegations but said the company was cooperating with the authorities. Speaking at the group’s main Derby site where its flagship Trent XWB jet engine is assembled, he said it was wrong to claim that bribes were a legitimate cost of doing business in some regions and that to do so was “a little bit of an excuse”. The defence sector has been riddled with allegations of corruption because of the secrecy surrounding contracts and their high value. In 2006 Tony Blair’s government halted a SFO investigation into defence firm BAE Systems, saying Britain’s security would be put in danger if it was allowed to continue. But at Rolls-Royce, allegations of corruption were just one of the problems that have dragged the group down. It shares slumped almost 40% in 2015 and this year its first-half pre-tax profit fell 80% to £104m as governments and airlines reined in spending. The airlines switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient, planes which tend not to use Rolls-Royce engines. The engineering group makes the lion’s share of its earnings from maintenance contracts related to its engines and it had not expected airline customers to mothball jets containing its engines earlier than planned. Also its marine business, which services offshore oil rigs, has been heavily affected by the low oil prices. East’s transformation plan has involved stripping away layers of senior management and a raft of positions. More than 5,000 workers have lost their jobs over the past two years. This includes 800 who are set to go in the marine division. When asked if this is now an end to the job cuts, East said the efficiency drive is a never-ending process. “What we have done so far is a stage on the way,. There is no end result per se because we always have to improve as an organisation. It’s a never ending process of maintaining your competitiveness that’s why there is a bit of pace around the changes we have made so far and it will continue that pace through 2017.” But he drew the line at a breakup of the business. ValueAct, the San Francisco-based investor that has built a stake of more than 10% in tRolls-Royce, and recently won a board position as argued that there was more value in splitting it up. East said he disagreed with that view, saying:. “I think my predecessors over multiple generations have worked hard to create the business that we have today and one of the aspects of that is we take our technology and deploy that in multiple sectors. ‘The advantages are in the financial robustness and technology transfer. Their interests [ValueAct’s] and our interests are aligned in terms of improving the competitiveness of the business.” When it comes to manufacturing the economic footprint of Rolls-Royce in the UK is significant. Research by economic forecasting and modelling firm Oxford Economics shows Rolls-Royce supports a total of 135,100 jobs directly and indirectly in the UK – that equivalent of one in every 250 jobs nationwide. Its also contributes more than £12bn to GDP (about 0.7% of the UK economy). Rolls-Royce is vital to Britain’s economic health and while East welcomed government plans to shape a new industrial strategy he said it would only work if policies remain consistent. “The bets we make in the aerospace sector are very chunky, they’re very long term and they transcend multiple governments, so having a strategy which support businesses like us is a good thing,” he said. “Consistency is important for us – what we can’t be doing with is industrial strategies that change every few years.”"
2016-12-15T00:01:24Z,uk-news,UK news,New police officers face degree requirement,"All new police officers in England and Wales will need a degree-level qualification, under plans to get policing fit for the demands of the 21st century. Recruits will have the option of taking up a training post with one of the 43 forces and studying for a degree part-time while working. They will be paid £21,000 to £23,000 during the apprenticeship and will have three years to complete the degree, spending around a fifth of their time in the classroom. Alternatively, would-be officers can pursue a self-funded policing degree at a university, or join a police-funded six-month graduate programme. Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, said he was in discussions with 12 universities about the new system. “Policing is more complex and difficult than it used to be and police need better training and education than they have had up until now,” he said, “If you compare it to medicine or the military [where] there is massive investment in training and development, in policing there is a tiny investment.” The money for the apprenticeships is expected to come from an apprenticeship levy due to come into force in April. This will require employers with an annual salary bill of more than £3m to spend the equivalent of 0.5% of it on apprenticeships. The changes are being driven by two factors. The first is a longstanding view in government and the upper echelons of policing that rank and file policing has to professionalise and that pay should match skills rather than time served. Policing was traditionally a preserve of the white working class, offering some officers better terms and conditions than other public sector jobs, with social standing and secure employment. A review of pay by Sir Tom Winsor in 2011 found they were “comparatively well paid – 10% to 15% higher than some other emergency workers and the armed forces.” The second factor is the changing nature of the job. There has been a shift towards tackling internet crimes and crimes of vulnerability such as hidden sexual abuse, which requires different skills. At present nearly four in 10 new recruits have a degree or postgraduate qualification. Under the changes, officers applying for the rank of of assistant chief constable or higher will need a master’s degree. Andy Fittes, general secretary of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “There is a balance to be struck around encouraging people to have a certain level of education before joining the force, and marginalising and excluding good quality candidates from all communities by limiting the pool of potential candidates if they are unable to afford it.” Giles York the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for workforce, said: “As crime and demand change, so must policing. Our workforce is our most valuable resource so police officers and staff need the right skills, knowledge and attributes to prevent harm and keep people safe in the 21st century. “The changes announced today will help modernise the service and improve our ability to attract and retain really good people. It is also fair and right that police officers, as professionals, receive the recognition and accreditation they deserve, meaning the public will continue to get the high quality service they need.”"
2016-12-15T00:01:24Z,uk-news,UK news,"NSPCC football abuse hotline receives over 1,700 calls in 3 weeks","A telephone hotline dedicated to dealing with abuse within football has received more than 1,700 calls since it was set up three weeks ago, a children’s charity has said. According to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), which is running the service, more than 900 calls came in the past fortnight – showing a dip on average from the number received in the first week. Three-quarters of those calls which resulted in a referral to police or another agency came from victims of abuse themselves, the NSPCC said.
“It’s clear that for far too long, hundreds of people who suffered abuse as youngsters in the game have not been able to speak up but it is encouraging that so many are finally finding their voice in a climate today where they know they will be listened to and supported,” said the NSPCC’s chief executive Peter Wanless. “What’s important now is that those victims get that much-needed support and that perpetrators are identified and brought to justice by police. Anyone can contact our hotline in confidence and we will get them the help they need.” The hotline, which is being funded by the Football Association, was set up on 23 November as the scandal began to engulf football. It has since been claimed that 98 clubs have been named to the charity. The NSPCC said it received 50 contacts from members of the public within two hours of opening the hotline and 860 calls in the first week. It added that 94% of its referrals were to the police, though it stressed that the number of calls does not reflect the number of victims, since multiple calls can come from one individual and not all calls result in further action."
2016-12-15T00:01:25Z,uk-news,UK news,UK troops sent to train anti-Isis rebels 'have arrived in Syria',"The British defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, is to announce that UK forces have arrived in the Middle East to help train moderate Syrian rebels engaged in the fight against Islamic State. Fallon is hosting a conference in London of defence ministers from the 67-member US-led coalition against Isis, and the defence secretary is keen to talk up the British contribution. The conference is being held to discuss the next phase of the campaign against Isis as the group is squeezed in its Syrian headquarters in Raqqa and in its Iraqi headquarters in Mosul.
At a similar conference in Paris in October, Fallon announced that the UK would send about 20 trainers to help Syrian moderates with basic infantry skills, frontline medical treatment and identification of hidden explosive devices. His announcement on Thursday confirmed of their arrival. In a statement before today’s meeting the defence secretary said: “Daesh [the government’s name for Isis] is being taken on in eastern Mosul. Last week we opened up a second front around Raqqa. Daesh is losing ground, finance and fighters … In 2017, we must maintain momentum to deal these terrorists a decisive blow.” In spite of the push on Mosul and Raqqa, Isis fighters managed a success this week, temporarily retaking Palmyra in Syria, a development that highlighted how overstretched the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have become. Most of Palmyra has since been reported to have been retaken. The Iraqi army’s push on Mosul has also recently stalled in the face of strong Isis resistance. The UK already has a modest force of 500 infantry in Iraq to help train the Iraqi army. The Ministry of Defence says British troops have trained more than 31,000 Iraqi and Kurdish fighters. The extra 20 trainers have been sent specifically to train Syrian groups, a controversial issue in the past, given the difficulty of distinguishing “moderate” rebels from more extreme groups. Fallon stressed in October that they would be thoroughly vetted to ensure that the UK was not training Islamist factions. The US has special forces on the ground in Syria helping Kurdish troops and Syrian rebels who have surrounded Raqqa. Officially the UK has no troops in Syria, though some are known to have gone at least on reconnaissance trips.
The Syrian Democratic Forces, classified by the UK as moderates, said they had started a new phase of an operation to isolate Raqqa with the help of the airstrikes from the US-led coalition, which has carried out 300 raids since November. About 70% of UK airstrikes since June have been in support of the Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters trying to retake Mosul. Fallon will also announce that the UK is to send more intelligence specialists to help sift through the thousands of documents expected to be seized as Mosul and Raqqa fall, in the hope of learning more about the internal structures of Isis, any planned overseas terrorist plots and the identities of financiers. The fall of Manbij in Syria earlier this year provided the US-led coalition with a trove of documents that allegedly pointed to plots in Europe, though not specifically against the UK. The conference in London marks the last visit to the UK by Ash Carter in his capacity of US defence secretary before the Trump administration takes over on 20 January."
2016-12-15T00:01:25Z,uk-news,UK news,UK to help fast-track European deportations of asylum seekers,"Britain is to step up efforts to fast-track European deportations of migrants from Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea. At the European council in Brussels, Theresa May is expected to pledge an extra 40 staff over winter to help Greek border officials with asylum claims that Downing Street says are “likely to be deemed inadmissible”. Greece is currently trialling a system to fast-track deportations with the aid of UK staff. “Rather than going into the asylum case flow they go into a faster process to return them [more quickly],” a Downing Street source said, adding that the 40 staff would have a number of specialists with experience of deportations. “It is exactly about that deterrent effect … The message is that you will be sent back.” During the summit, at which migration will be one of three main topics, May is likely to express support for the continuation of the EU-Turkey deal that has seen Syrian refugees on the Greek islands returned to Turkey. In exchange Syrian asylum seekers in Turkey found a home in Europe, there has been a loosening of EU visa restrictions on Turks and Turkey has received around €6bn in aid. A Downing Street official said the deal had radically reduced the numbers crossing the Aegean and the plan for new staff to speed up the process of returning failed asylum seekers would be a further deterrent to those attempting the perilous journey. “It’s important to reduce the pull factor for migrants seeking a place in Europe, and getting better at differentiating between economic migrants and refugees needing protection,” the official said. Downing Street said the prime minister was determined to use the UK’s influence to shape EU migration policy while Britain remains a member of the bloc. “There is a while yet while we will still be at the table [at the EU] and we think there are things we can be doing now to… reduce the numbers coming to Europe,” the official said. “Once the UK has left the EU, there will be a number of issues we will want to co-operate on with other countries in Europe because of shared challenges that we face. We have a lot of expertise on returns.” Syria will also be one of the main items on the EU leaders’ agenda. No 10 said May would push for tougher language from EU leaders on the crisis in Aleppo, but the focus will be on the need for humanitarian corridors and for information gathering on possible war crimes, rather than further sanctions against Russia. “The PM will want to make sure the EU takes a tough stance on that given the appalling situation,” a Downing Street source said. “The backdrop of this summit is Aleppo and the appalling crisis there and so our focus is how do we urge humanitarian access, and also to make clear that ... those who are carrying out ... atrocities in Aleppo should be held accountable.” The prime minister is also expected to stress a need for closer EU ties with Egypt on the migration crisis. “They are a big source of unaccompanied minors,” a Downing Street official said. “We think it is right to be stepping up engagement with them.” Before the summit, May will meet leaders from Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Martin Schulz, the president of the EU parliament. A No 10 source said the meeting had been at Schulz’s request but played down any suggestion there would be mention of his decision to run for the German parliament. “This is focused on the role the European parliament will play in the Brexit negotiations,” the source said. As well as the Syria crisis and EU migration, the leaders are expected to spend a working lunch discussing Ukraine and the recent Dutch referendum, which emphatically rejected a Ukraine-European Union treaty on closer political and economic ties. After lunch, they will attend a session on defence and security with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Downing Street said the prime minister was not concerned that the UK was not invited to the dinner of the EU27 and said no British observer would be present. “It’s their process to work out their approach. We’re preparing our side,” a No 10 source said. May’s exclusion has been made possible because the EU council’s president, Donald Tusk, changed the format of EU summits, which have usually begun on Thursday afternoons with discussions until late into the night and conclusions announced on Friday mornings. This council session will see meetings begin in the morning and conclude by early evening. May will give a press conference and return to London, while EU leaders meet for an informal dinner where the subject is expected to be the UK’s departure from the EU."
2016-12-15T10:53:55Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2 chairman takes job at Gatwick,"HS2’s chairman, Sir David Higgins, is to become chairman of Gatwick next month, leaving the £55bn high-speed rail project with an increasingly occupied figurehead and no permanent chief executive. Higgins, who also spends time working in Australia as a director of the Commonwealth Bank, will take over from Sir Roy McNulty on 1 January at the Sussex airport. He is paid £240,000 for three days a week at HS2 and is understood to be remaining in post as chair for up to a year, until a replacement is found and as the search for a new chief executive continues. The previous chief executive, Simon Kirby, whom Higgins brought over from Network Rail on a salary of £775,000, announced his departure in September for a more lucrative role at Rolls-Royce. Earlier this week Higgins told the transport select committee that HS2 should consider offering loyalty bonuses to ensure its top people stayed in the job. He told MPs on Monday: “It is always difficult to talk about bonuses in the public sector … but we should look at some sort of bonus over a period of years that encourages people to stay – it is something we should consider.” Higgins was chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority from 2005-11 and ran Network Rail from 2011-14. Gatwick is continuing to invest and remains poised to push its claim for a second runway should Heathrow’s planned expansion be blocked by parliament next year. Higgins said Gatwick had made “remarkable progress” in recent years: “Whilst the case for Gatwick expansion in the future remains very strong, the challenge for Gatwick now is to continue to invest so it can maximise the use of its existing facilities and so can do even more for Britain in the coming years.” HS2 said the extra work would not affect or conflict with Higgins’s current role at HS2."
2016-12-15T13:57:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Karen Danczuk's brother jailed for raping her and two other women,"The brother of Karen Danczuk has been jailed for 15 years for raping her and two other women. Michael Burke, 38, was jailed after being convicted of eight counts of rape and one other serious sexual offence against her and two other women following a trial last month. Danczuk, 33, the former wife of MP Simon Danczuk, waived her right to anonymity as a victim of sexual offences to brand her brother a “monster”, who had “robbed me of my childhood”. During the three-week trial at Manchester crown court, Danczuk, who has two children, told the court her brother abused her at the family home in Middleton, near Rochdale, from the age of six and raped her from the age of 11 until her mid-teens. Burke denied 15 counts of rape, one attempted rape and one indecent assault against his sister and two other women, spanning 1992 to 2010. But the jury found him guilty of eight counts of rape and another serious sexual offence against the three women, including three counts of rape against his sister between 1992 and 1994. He was cleared of nine other serious sexual offences. The two other women have not waived their right to anonymity and cannot be identified. Dressed in a navy blue suit, Burke, a former school governor and Labour party activist, shook his head and threw up his hands as he stood in the dock and was sentenced. Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Gilbart said: “She was your little sister, over whom you held sway. Your actions affected her emotionally well into adulthood. As she put it, instead of looking back on her first sexual experience as something to be remembered fondly, she looked back on being raped by her brother before she reached puberty. “You groomed her. Your little sister was your playmate and susceptible to anything you suggested. You have shown not a shred of remorse.” Reality TV star Danczuk was not in court but her father sat in the public gallery to see his son jailed. Karen Danczuk had told the jury the abuse had ruined her schooling, left her incapable of love and intimacy and that she had received counselling struggling with depression and anxiety. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC, said Danczuk’s personal problems stemmed from the abuse by her brother. He said: “The catalyst for the treatment she sought, we respectfully submit, is the abuse she suffered at the hands of this defendant. This abuse that was suffered by her at an early age, blighted her life throughout her childhood and into her adulthood. Blighted her ability to form and maintain relationships. “It’s a legacy she has borne in her formative years and into adulthood. It involves the rape of a child, in her own bed, under her own roof, involving a family member, at dead of night.” He added: “There’s multiple victims, a background of coercion.” Gilbart described Burke as “violent and controlling” who showed no remorse and was considered a danger to women. He was given an extended five years on licence when he is released from jail after serving his sentence and put on the sex offender register for life. An NSPCC spokesperson said: “Justice has caught up with Burke, who must have thought his crimes were consigned to history. “There is no doubt the sex abuse Burke committed against these women has had a lasting effect on their lives. But today is proof survivors of abuse will be listened to if they come forward and action will be taken. We hope they will now get the support they need to recover.”"
2016-12-15T14:19:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Met chief verdict is third blow to Hillsborough families' faith in IPCC,"The report clearing Britain’s most senior police officer of misconduct is the third decision in quick succession that has severely undermined bereaved Hillsborough families’ confidence in the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The watchdog has for years been subject to criticism from complainants, lawyers and politicians that it lacks adequate independence and backbone to hold police to account for wrongdoing, and its credibility is seen by some to depend on the outcome of its Hillsborough investigations. The IPCC, which the government has already committed to overhauling and renaming, has spent four years investigating the South Yorkshire police failures that caused the 96 deaths at Hillsborough in 1989, the failure of that force afterwards to take responsibility and its attempts instead to blame the victims, and the alleged collusion of West Midlands police, the force appointed in 1989 to investigate. Rachel Cerfontyne, the deputy chair of the IPCC and commissioner with responsibility for the Hillsborough investigations, has said the total cost is likely to be about £80m. She and senior investigators hold regular meetings with the bereaved families and give public monthly updates. Cerfontyne has emphasised the seriousness and dedication with which the IPCC has approached its task. Yet Pete Weatherby QC, the lead lawyer who represented 22 families at the new inquests that found the 96 people were unlawfully killed due to South Yorkshire police failures at Hillsborough, says confidence in the IPCC is now at zero. Weatherby accuses the IPCC of repeatedly finding reasons not to pursue disciplinary cases against police officers, and says his experience and those of the families he represents have led them to conclude it is not fit for purpose. The report clearing the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, follows the rejection a fortnight ago of a complaint by Hayley Court, a former South Yorkshire police media officer. There had been claims she was given unethical instructions to spin coverage of the new inquests. That development came after the decision that has most damaged the faith of the families in the IPCC: the clearing of David Crompton, the South Yorkshire police chief constable during the new inquests, of seeking to improperly maintain the force’s original stance of blaming the victims for the disaster. The families had complained to the IPCC that despite Crompton having issued a full apology in 2012, he did not maintain that stance at the inquests. Instead, the South Yorkshire police barrister, Fiona Barton QC, highlighted alleged misbehaviour by supporters, remained silent when other police lawyers and witnesses were making similar claims, and argued forcefully against the apology being made known to the inquests jury. The coroner, Sir John Goldring, accepted her argument and did not require the force’s series of previous apologies and legal admissions for its failures to be put before the jury. The families complained that this stance at the inquests, which began in 2014, subjected them to a traumatic re-run of the discredited police lies and lengthened the proceedings to two years, the longest case ever heard by a British jury. However, the IPCC, with Cerfontyne herself as the commissioner, found there were no grounds for a misconduct charge against Crompton, concluding that the force did not advance “a particular scenario” at the inquests and that Barton’s questions alleging misbehaviour by supporters were “not part of a deliberate, predetermined strategy”. That decision was upheld last month in a review by Hugh Tomlinson QC. The report on Hayley Court’s experience of working as South Yorkshire police’s media officer at the inquests failed to examine all the relevant evidence. It set itself terms of reference that excluded Court’s claim that she had been bullied in the job, which the force had not upheld. Within Court’s personnel documents, as revealed by the Guardian in May, was an official view that she had failed to “proactively redress” what the force considered to be “obvious imbalance in media reporting” of the inquests. However, the IPCC report did not cite this document or investigate what “imbalance” the force believed had been portrayed in the media. Instead, the report listed a series of meetings in which other people disputed Court’s account, and it concluded that she had “misunderstood” her instructions. The report also recited extensive alleged criticism of Court and her abilities, including from South Yorkshire police’s barrister, which could seem almost designed to deter future complainants and whistleblowers within the police from ever coming forward. Court, who now has a media relations role outside of the police service, issued a statement saying the report was “manifestly wrong” and that she was very disappointed in the IPCC. Files are due to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service imminently on the full criminal investigations into the deaths at Hillsborough and subsequent alleged perjury, perverting the course of justice and misconduct in a public office by police officers. Along with all those terribly serious questions about the most devastating and far-reaching police failures is a very pressing one about the competence of the IPCC itself to do a proper job."
2016-12-15T16:42:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Met to apologise to woman after admitting officer stole dead son's identity,"Police are to give a personal apology to a woman after admitting an undercover officer sent to spy on leftwing activists stole the identity of her dead son. Barbara Shaw’s son, Rod Richardson, died two days after he was born in 1973. The officer took his identity and used it when he pretended to be an anti-capitalist protester between 2000 and 2003 in radical groups in London and Nottingham.
In a statement on Thursday, the Metropolitan police said: “We acknowledge this tactic has caused Ms Shaw, whose deceased son Rod Richardson’s identity was used, huge hurt and offence. The Metropolitan police will make every effort to meet with Ms Shaw, if she wishes, to apologise to her in person and explain how this came to be. It is only right that any apology is given privately to her.” Undercover officers who spied on political groups routinely stole the identities of dead children and used them to build plausible fake personae. After trawling through national birth and death records in search of suitable matches, the spies created aliases based on the details of the dead children and were issued with identity records such as passports, driving licences and national insurance numbers. None of the families were consulted or told by police, who have admitted that at least 42 officers used the technique (pdf) which has been criticised by MPs for being “ghoulish and disrespectful”. Richardson was unmasked three years ago following investigations by the Guardian and the campaigners he spied on. However police have been refusing to admit he was an undercover officer. Shaw’s lawyer, Jules Carey of the legal firm Bindmans, said: “The gathering and use of dead children’s identities by police officers for cover names was macabre and a gross intrusion into the private lives of families. “The appropriation of her dead child’s identity has caused her hurt and offence but so too has the fact that it has taken almost four years for the police to admit to her that her son’s identity was used. The complaint she lodged with the Metropolitan police in 2013 remains outstanding.” Shaw has previously said it was “wrong that someone took Rod’s identity without us knowing”, adding that he was “still my baby. I’ll never forget him.” On Thursday, the public inquiry into the undercover infiltration of hundreds of political groups – led by the senior judge Lord Justice Pitchford – confirmed (pdf) the person pretending to be Richardson was an undercover officer.
One of the strands of the inquiry, which is expected to start public hearings next year, will examine how the police used the technique (pdf) and whether parents should be told. In 2013, Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met’s commissioner, issued a general apology for “the shock and offence the use of this tactic has caused” among the public, after the Guardian revealed details of the policing method. However none of the parents of the dead children were informed. The Met’s statement on Thursday is the first time that police have publicly admitted that a specific undercover officer stole the identity of a dead child and that they would give a personal apology to the parents of that child. More than 20 parents whose children died at a young age have come forward wanting to know whether their identities were stolen by the police, but their questions have been blocked by the police. The Met said it “understands the anger that the use of this tactic has caused, and the desire for answers that a number of families have”. There is some dispute about the cause of Rod’s death. His death certificate attributes it to respiratory problems and pneumonia. Shaw believes her son died after choking on his milk, because of a mistake by the nursing staff."
2016-12-15T16:45:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Police set up special unit to tackle spate of carjackings in Bradford,"Police in Yorkshire have set up a special unit to deal with a spate of carjackings in Bradford after 26 incidents in the past 10 weeks, including one involving a mother and baby. The latest victim was a 72-year-old man who was shot with an airgun in a pub car park in Heaton in north-west Bradford on Tuesday evening. A masked gang then tried to steal his black Jaguar XJ. A 23-year-old man was arrested and then bailed pending further inquiries, a West Yorkshire police spokesman said on Thursday. The victim was released from hospital after undergoing surgery to remove the pellets in his hand and neck, the spokesman added. The spokesman confirmed that a dedicated team of detectives had been set up to investigate 26 carjackings or attempted carjackings since 1 October. In one of the other attacks, on 26 November, a woman was in her silver Volkswagen Polo GTI outside Shezzaan’s restaurant in Halifax Road, when two men wearing face coverings approached the vehicle and demanded she get out. The woman, who was in the car with an 11-month-old child, was able to remove the child before the men drove off towards Odsal Top. Neither the woman nor the child were hurt. One of the men appeared to have a metal object in his hand. One of the suspects was believed to be wearing a hooded top with a grey body, back and hood and darker grey or black sleeves. DCI Ian Bryar, of Bradford district CID, told the Bradford Telegraph and Argus that the police were greatly concerned by the wave of similar crimes. “I’ve brought a team together from the Bradford organised crime unit to tackle this specific type of crime because we have seen a noticeable spike. “It is of great concern to us. We do not yet know the motives, such as whether the cars are destined for overseas, for selling on or simply for joy-riding but they all appear to be German models or high-performance cars. “We have recovered some of the vehicles, though not all of the 26 were stolen; some were attempts but we are still regarding all incidents as very serious,” he told the paper. He added: “The shooting on Tuesday evening was the first to have a firearm involved. I don’t want people to stop enjoying their cars, but to be vigilant. If they see something suspicious they should contact us on 101. We also suggest locking the car doors when they are in the vehicle for additional safety. “These sort of crimes, however distressing, are relatively low in number but we are determined to address them which is why we’ve brought on a dedicated team of detectives.” The latest crime statistics show that victim-based crime involving vehicles is up 16% year on year in West Yorkshire, compared with a national average increase of 4%. Some 23,285 such offences were recorded in the year up to June 2016."
2016-12-15T17:13:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police officer who abused teenage boys dies in hospital,"A former police superintendent who was jailed last month for sexually abusing vulnerable boys in the 1980s has died. Gordon Anglesea, 79, was sentenced to 12 years for the abuse, which took place at a Home Office attendance centre for young offenders and at a children’s home. He was the highest-profile offender brought to justice through the National Crime Agency’s Operation Pallial, which has been investigating allegations of widespread and organised child abuse in north Wales.
His solicitor, Jonathan Wall, from Burton Copeland, said: “I have had confirmation from his family that he passed away peacefully this morning in hospital. I know he had been in hospital for a few days.” Anglesea was found guilty of indecent assaults on two boys aged 14 and 15. One said he had been assaulted by Anglesea in the shower and a changing room at the attendance centre he ran in Wrexham. Such centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for youths, and provided physical training and woodwork lessons. The second victim lived at a children’s home called Bryn Estyn in Wrexham. He claimed he was taken from there to various addresses and passed around “like a handbag” to men including Anglesea. The judge Geraint Walters told Anglesea he had “grossly abused the trust placed in you. The consequences for them have been profound, indeed life-changing.” Anglesea continued to insist on his innocence. His barrister, Tania Griffiths QC, said the verdicts were “perverse” and unsuccessfully applied for her client to be freed on bail while he sought an appeal. Anglesea had faced claims for a quarter of a century that he preyed on young boys, and in the mid-90s was awarded £375,000 in damages after successfully suing news organisations including the Observer that had linked him to abuse. In victims’ impact statements put before the court in north Wales before his sentencing, one victim said: “Anglesea was the worst.

2016-12-15T18:20:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Pupil data shared with Home Office to 'create hostile environment' for illegal migrants,"Education officials have an agreement to share the personal details of up to 1,500 schoolchildren a month with the Home Office to “create a hostile environment” in schools for illegal migrants, a newly released document has revealed. The agreement, which has been in place since June 2015, is outlined in a memorandum of understanding between the Department for Education (DfE) and the Home Office that was released on Thursday after several organisations made a freedom of information request. It says: “Where it is suspected that an [immigration offence] has been, or is being committed, the DfE will [share] their data with the HO [Home Office] to assist in the process of identifying potential new contact details (including addresses) for the individual(s) and their family members.” Later, it adds that the “strategic aims” of the data sharing include re-establishing contact with families the Home Office has lost contact with, to reduce the population of illegal migrants, and to “create a hostile environment for those who seek to benefit from the abuse of immigration control.”.
The memorandum passed to the Guardian, which the DfE said was the latest agreement, says the department would share pupils’ names, recent addresses, school and some attendance records, including earliest and latest attendance dates. That data is collected through the annual school’s census and collated in the national pupil database. Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: “This isn’t a data-sharing agreement – it is a secret government programme that turns the Department for Education into a border control force with an explicit aim to create a hostile environment in schools and assist with mass deportation of innocent children and their families. This has Theresa May’s fingerprints all over it.” The revelation comes after an uproar over plans to include questions on schoolchildren’s nationalities and countries of birth on the annual schools census, which campaigners warned could turn teachers into de facto border guards and stoke divisions in the classroom. Human rights groups urged parents to boycott the questions, which are not compulsory, and the DfE was forced to respond to the backlash with a public commitment to change the existing data-sharing agreement so that information would not be shared with the Home Office. In a further attempt to address privacy concerns, the school system minister, John Nash, said in a letter to peers, seen by Schools Week, the new data would be held separately from the national pupil database, and claimed this would prevent other departments from accessing it. Gracie Mae Bradley, coordinator of Against Borders for Children, said: “This latest report confirms what we always suspected – that the Home Office had intended to access and use nationality data collected from every single pupil in England to help it carry out immigration enforcement against migrant children and families. It seems that only after we intervened in September and wrote to Justine Greening expressing precisely that fear that the policy was overturned. “However, this newly released MoU makes clear in chilling detail that the DfE still plans to collaborate with the Home Office to share the personal details on over 1,000 children every single month, including name, address, and school details. Using school records to track down and deport migrant children and families is totally indefensible. Schools should be a place where all children feel safe.” Fears over the collection of children’s nationality and country of birth data took on a fresh urgency earlier this month when leaked Cabinet Office letters revealed that Theresa May, as home secretary, wanted children of parents living unlawfully in the UK to be dropped to the bottom of the lists for school places. Current laws mean all under-16s have the right to a school place, even if their parents entered the country illegally, a policy in line with international law, including article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nicky Morgan, education secretary at the time, is understood to have blocked the move. Jen Persson, coordinator of defenddigitalme, one of the organisations that had requested the memorandum, said: “This collection has lost all legitimacy. It can’t continue to grab every child’s personal data under false pretences of the purposes for its collection. “It’s time to call off the changes in the school census before its next due date on 19 January and a review needs to take place of the whole use of pupil census data, with full transparency, safeguards and independent oversight built into its safe management. “If this policy continues it will come at an enormous cost of public and professional trust in all data collection by the department and undermines its data integrity and its reputation.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Without evidence and data, we cannot have a clear picture of how the school system is working. We take privacy extremely seriously and access to sensitive data is strictly controlled.”"
2016-12-15T18:56:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish government accused of cutting £330m from council funding,"The Scottish government has been accused of cutting nearly £330m from council funding to help pay for education and social care spending in next year’s draft budget. Opposition parties and the Scottish TUC said Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, was guilty of squeezing local councils rather than using Holyrood’s new powers to raise income tax to fund £170m of extra spending on schools in the poorest areas. Scottish government officials rejected the complaints. They insisted the like-for-like cuts were in fact only £182m, but were more than compensated for by up to £180m in extra council tax income and £150m in more capital spending. Mackay told MSPs that overall council spending power, boosted by new responsibilities for social care and improving attainment, would increase by £240m. “This is a settlement that invests in education, invests in social care and invests in local services,” he said. Backed by the Scottish TUC, Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, accused Mackay of spin. She said other tables in the budget paper showed that core council funding had fallen by £327m, which would see “the heart ripped out of public services”. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, threatened to oppose the budget unless spending for education increased further, reducing the chances that Nicola Sturgeon’s minority government will win a final vote for the budget. “The first minister said today that there were acres of common ground between the parties but can I tell the finance secretary that he has got miles to travel before we can reach an agreement,” Rennie said. With an eye to next May’s council elections, when the Scottish National party hopes to win control of nearly all Scotland’s cities, Mackay was forced into two key reversals on policies that threaten to be central to that campaign. He abandoned plans to use higher council taxes levied next year on the most expensive homes to fund a national £100m education investment policy, and offered £3m to help cut train fares after weeks of criticism over underperforming rail services. While spending on social services, education and health increased, opposition parties identified further funding cuts to universities, the Scottish prosecution service, buses and bus fares, and the investment agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Spending on arts, historic monuments and roads would increase, Mackay said. He also announced that the number of small firms and shops exempt from business rates would rise to 100,000 and there would be a 3.7% cut in the main business rates for other companies. The budget also confirmed the Scottish government would lose at least £190m next year in extra borrowing from the Treasury for infrastructure, after tighter EU rules forced them to include £932m worth of privately financed construction works in its budgets. Mackay acknowledged that this year’s draft budget was a historic one: he was the first finance secretary able to set income tax rates and bands wholly independent to those in the rest of UK. But that new funding deal agreed with the Treasury in February also directly links the Scottish government’s income with Scotland’s economic performance and its tax receipts. “This is one key reason why this draft budget is focused on growing a sustainable and productive economy, supporting more and better jobs”, Mackay’s budget report said. Labour, the Scottish Greens and the Liberal Democrats have put him under intense pressure to increase income tax rates, including a new additional rate of 50% for those who earn over £150,000; the Scottish Tories urged him to cut taxes in line with a new £45,000 threshold for 40% taxpayers in the rest of the UK. As already forecast by his predecessor, John Swinney, Mackay announced that the basic rate would be frozen in cash terms, with only modest changes to other rates. The 40% rate threshold would rise from £43,000 to £43,430 next April, in line with forecast inflation but much less than the jump to £45,000 for other UK taxpayers. The additional rate of 45% would also be frozen at £150,000, a decision likely to increase the number of the highest earners paying that rate if their salaries increase, and helping boost Scottish government revenues. Mackay said this very centrist policy was designed to protect Scotland’s sluggish economy, which has been underperforming after the collapse in global oil prices hit North Sea industries. Mackay had originally planned to use far higher council taxes on the most expensive homes, which would see rates on Band H homes rise by nearly 25% next year after eight years of a council tax freeze, to fund the £100m strategy to improve attainment among the poorest pupils. Instead, councils would now be able to keep that £110m for local services, helping them stave off angry complaints from wealthier homeowners about higher council tax rates. However only a small number of wealthier council areas such as Edinburgh, Aberdeen and East Renfrewshire will benefit. If other councils want extra money for local services, they will also have new powers to increase all council bands by 3% for the first time since council tax was frozen in 2008. Opposition parties and council leaders admit higher rates for the most expensive homes is a more progressive use of the tax system but complain that this still forces them to charge families more for public services, while the Scottish government refuses to raise income tax rates."
2016-12-15T19:58:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Most terrorism arrests lead to no charge or conviction, figures show","The overwhelming majority of people arrested for alleged terrorism offences over the past 15 years have been freed without charge or conviction, official figures show. Fewer than two in 10 people detained by police since September 2001 were convicted directly of terrorism or a terrorism-related offence. The figures released by the Home Office showed that 3,349 people in England and Wales were arrested under terrorism laws since the 9/11 attacks on the US. Of those arrested for terrorism and related offences, 17.8% were convicted in relation to involvement in violent jihad, for instance plotting attacks, funding or facilitating. Another 10% arrested on suspicion of terrorism were convicted of offences unrelated to the terrorism charges they were originally arrested for, taking the total to 27.6%. The majority of those arrested were from British Muslim communities. The figures sparked debate about why most of those arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorism end up not being charged or convicted of any criminal offence. Lord Paddick, the Lib Dem spokesman on home affairs in the House of Lords, and a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said: “The police need to account for these figures. It is extremely worrying that there is such a high attrition rate between those arrested and those convicted of terrorism offences. “The most important thing with terrorism is community intelligence and building trust and confidence with those communities from where terrorists come. This sort of statistic will tend to undermine that trust and confidence.” A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “No one is arrested without sufficient grounds for suspicion but the legal bar for offences is rightly set very high, meaning many will not go on to be charged or convicted. “These powers are applied appropriately and proportionately to keep the public safe and we do not target a specific community. We take all forms of terrorism and extremism seriously – including from the extreme right wing – and will work hard with all communities to tackle it.” In Britain’s counter-terrorism system, intelligence is developed by the security service MI5, and then passed to police to take enforcement action and build a case that can convict someone to the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. David Videcette, who served as a detective with Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command for a decade, said: “A lot of the information comes from the security services. A lot of what they give cannot be used as evidence; it is difficult to convert the intelligence into something that can be used in the criminal justice system. “No one would thank the police if, because the intelligence cannot be converted, they did nothing.” The Home Office said decisions to arrest were a matter for the police and decisions to prosecute a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service. The latest terrorism figures showed arrests were down from their peak a year ago. Counter-terrorism officials say they are working flat out to thwart plots to attack the UK. In 2001, the biggest threat was from al-Qaida, which was inspired by Osama bin Laden. Since 2014 the Islamic State ideology has been linked to most terror threats on British soil. The security minister, Ben Wallace, said: “We are determined to detect, disrupt and where possible prosecute all those who pose a threat to the UK. The figures released today once again highlight the hard work carried out by the police, security service and Crown Prosecution Service day in and day out to keep the people of this country safe.”"
2016-12-15T20:36:30Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man shouted 'I am going to kill a Muslim', says wife of Forest Hill victim","The wife of a man left in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed on a train in London this week has described the moment her husband was attacked by a person she says shouted “I am going to kill a Muslim”. Speaking as her family released a picture of her husband Muhammed-Askar Ali in his hospital bed on Thursday, Kulsuma Ali described sitting next to him when the attack happened. It is the first time Kulsuma Ali has spoken about the incident, which took place on Monday. She praised the nurse who came forward to help her stricken husband, calling her a hero. And she said the person who attacked her husband was “shouting go back to Syria and things like that”. “It was terrifying. The man stabbed my husband … One wound is near the lung and very dangerous and the doctors are very worried about his sight because he was stabbed near the eye.” The 39-year-old told the London Evening Standard: “The man was wandering around with [the knife] and showing it but no one had stopped him. How can he not have been stopped before? “No one came to help us at first. My husband had been stabbed loads of times before anyone moved. I was in total shock and was holding him. “A lady on the train who was a nurse helped. She was amazing. I need to say thank you – she has maybe saved his life. “There was blood everywhere. I was in shock and I have not slept since. The scene keeps playing in my head.” She said their three sons have not been able to go to school since the incident. Other witnesses have described seeing a man shouting at the station. Miguel Oliveira said: “The first few [people leaving the station] were shouting ‘he’s got a knife, he’s got a knife’ and then all of a sudden the next ones said ‘oh he’s been stabbed, call the police’.” Muhammad-Askar Ali, a father-of-three who works as a delivery driver, was described as a “brilliant father and husband” and a family man. He suffered a punctured lung and stab wounds in his head and body during the attack on a train at Forest Hill station, in south London. The couple, who are of Bangladeshi origin, had visited a mosque for prayers earlier in the day before the stabbing. They had then gone to pick up some flight tickets and were taking the train home, the Evening Standard reported. A man aged 38 has appeared in court charged with attempted murder, possession of an offensive weapon and assault by battery."
2016-12-16T10:10:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested after violent attack on four police officers in London,"A man violently attacked four police officers in south-east London, leaving one seriously injured and another with cuts to the face. One male officer suffered a suspected broken arm in the assault on Thursday while a female officer sustained cuts to her face after the 55-year-old lashed out when police tried to arrest him. Another male officer was bitten and a third sustained facial injuries after being called to a suspected incident of domestic violence in Woolwich. Ch Supt Simon Dobinson, responsible for policing in the borough of Greenwich, said he was proud of his officers. “This incident highlights the dangers police officers can face every time they attend any 999 call, and I am proud of my officers’ bravery in dealing with this incident,” he said. Police were called to the address in Woolwich just before 10pm on Thursday after a suspected assault on a woman. Officers used teargas to arrest the man, but a violent struggle ensued, according to police. One officer was taken to hospital while the three others were treated at a police station. The woman assaulted at the house was treated by the London ambulance service. The alleged attacker was eventually arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and assault. He was taken into custody at a south London police station."
2016-12-16T10:48:31Z,uk-news,UK news,London night tube services to Heathrow start this weekend,"All-night London underground services to Heathrow airport begin this weekend with the launch of the night tube on the Piccadilly line. Passengers catching early flights on Saturday and Sunday mornings will now be able to travel by tube to the UK’s busiest airport. Services will run through the night between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5, providing another transport option for people working at or visiting bars, restaurants and music venues in Kensington, Hammersmith and the West End. Weekend 24-hour tube trains already operate on the Victoria, Central, Jubilee and Northern lines.
The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “I promised that five lines would be up and running by the end of the year, and I’m proud that we are delivering this fifth service in time for the festive season. “With 2m journeys made already, the night tube has surpassed our predictions and made a huge difference to the lives of so many Londoners. I look forward to exploring the option of rolling it out even further in the future to provide even greater support to our vital night-time economy.” The Piccadilly line has suffered disruption during the past three weeks as a number of trains have been taken out of service because of a problem with wheels. London Underground said a longer than usual period of leaf fall has damaged the wheels, and there is a backlog for carrying out repairs. A rail union called for the launch of night tube services on the line to be postponed until the problem was resolved. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “It is utter madness that while the service on the Piccadilly line is at breaking point the company plan to run trains right through from 5am Friday morning until 12.30am Sunday. London Underground Limited should postpone night tube on the Piccadilly line until all these engineering problems are fixed and the trains are signed off as safe.” By mid-October, two months after services began on the Central and Victoria lines, a higher than expected average of 100,000 people were using the services in the early hours. The busiest station in that period was Oxford Circus, with Liverpool Street, Brixton, Stratford and Tottenham Court Road also among the most popular."
2016-12-16T13:24:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour demands answers after Camelot pays £3m penalty for fraudulent claim,"Labour has demanded an explanation from the government about the circumstances that led to National Lottery operator Camelot receiving a £3m penalty for paying out on a damaged ticket in 2009. The Gambling Commission said the situation only came to light last year and that the whole penalty will be given to good causes – £500,000 on top of the £2.5m they would have received had the prize claim not been paid. Camelot has apologised but Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said: “Camelot has very serious questions to answer about this fraud, which should never have been allowed to take place. So too do ministers.”
He said the culture, media and sport secretary, Karen Bradley, had been asked on Thursday about security breaches at the National Lottery. “She failed to offer assurance that the government is taking steps to improve it,” said Watson. “Thousands of organisations rely on money from the National Lottery and the millions of people who play it are right to expect that the rules of the game are fair,” he added. Watson has written to Bradley, setting out 10 questions including when ministers were made aware of the case and what action is under way to recover any money paid out. “The government must now make an urgent statement about the great Lotto robbery,” he said. The Gambling Commission, which has fined Camelot twice before, said its investigation “could not be certain a fraud had taken place, it was more likely than not that a fraudulent prize claim had been made and paid out”. Camelot has paid the penalty imposed by the commission and said that it was not connected to the draws for the winning numbers, but to do with its system for preventing fraudulent claims on a deliberately damaged ticket. It described the incident as “unique”. The company would not comment on a report by ITV that a £2.5m draw from March 2009 from a winning ticket sold in Worcestershire had gone unclaimed until close to the September deadline for claiming a prize. The commission’s chief executive, Sarah Harrison, said its main concern was to ensure the National Lottery was run with integrity and that players’ interests were protected. “Camelot’s failures in this case are serious and the penalty package reflects this,” she said. “Importantly, the package also ensures that good causes will not lose out as a result of Camelot’s licence breach. “Lottery players can feel reassured that our investigations have found no evidence of similar events happening and that controls are in place today to mitigate against future prize payout failings of this type.” Andy Duncan, the chief executive of Camelot, said the lottery operator admitted mistakes had been made. “We accept that, at the time, there were some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident and we’re very sorry for that. We’ve strengthened our processes significantly since 2009 and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,” he said. Duncan added: “It’s really important that people understand that this allegation relates to a unique, one-off incident dating back to 2009 and involves a potentially fraudulent claim on a deliberately damaged ticket. It has nothing to do with the National Lottery draws themselves.” It was not immediately apparent where the £2.5m prize payout ended up. Herfordshire police said it had closed its investigation. “An allegation of fraud connected to a lottery win from 2009 was investigated by Hertfordshire constabulary’s specialist cyber and financial investigation unit working with the Gambling Commission. As part of the investigation a man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. Following a thorough investigation the man was released with no further action to be taken against him,” the police said. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “The integrity of the National Lottery is absolutely paramount and it is crucial that both players and returns to good causes are protected and not at risk from fraudulent activity. It is right that the Gambling Commission has acted in this case and assured us that Camelot has put controls in place to mitigate against any similar licence breach in the future.” This is the largest penalty that has been imposed on Camelot to date. In July, it was fined £300,000 after inaccurate Lotto Millionaire Raffle results were published on the National Lottery website for an hour and more than 100,000 people viewed them. In 2014, it was fined £100,000 for miscalculating a National Lottery Lotto jackpot prize."
2016-12-16T13:57:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Two British soldiers to be charged over IRA leader's 1972 murder,"Two retired soldiers have become the first members of the military to be charged with murder in connection with a Troubles-related death in Northern Ireland. They are being prosecuted over the killing of Official IRA commander John McCann, who was shot dead in central Belfast in 1972. They are known as Soldier A and Soldier C and are believed to have been paratroopers. Charging the pair 42 years after McCann’s death will provoke controversy over the retrospective prosecution of members of the security forces over killings related to the Troubles. A Public Prosecution Service (PPS) spokesperson said: “Following a careful consideration of all the available evidence, it has been decided to prosecute two men for the offence of murder. “The two defendants in the case are surviving members of the army patrol which shot Mr McCann. A third member of the patrol who also fired at Mr McCann died in the intervening years. At present, these individuals are not being named and are identified as Soldier A and Soldier C.” The Official IRA leader was a republican legend even before his killing for organising the “Battle of Inglis’ Bakery” in the Market district of Belfast on 9 August 1971. Nine months later, McCann was shot dead by troops in the same area. The original RUC investigation was conducted in 1972 and, based on the evidence then available, it was decided not to prosecute anyone. The PPS spokesperson said: “The decision to prosecute is the outcome of a review which was undertaken after the case was referred to the director of public prosecutions by the attorney general for Northern Ireland in March 2014. The decision was reached following an objective and impartial application of the test for prosecution that was conducted in accordance with the code for prosecutors and with the benefit of advice from senior counsel.” An annual commemoration of McCann’s death is held in Joy Street where he was gunned down and where there is a permanent plaque erected on a wall in his honour. His two sons, Ferghal and Ciaran, and his widow Anne run a website called bigjoemccann to commemorate the Official IRA commander. The family claim McCann was shot in the back by members of the Parachute Regiment at a time when he was one of the most wanted republican gunmen in Northern Ireland. McCann sided with the Marxist Officials when the IRA split in 1969. He took part in the Official IRA gun battle with the British army in the Lower Falls district a year later. In 1971, McCann led an Official IRA unit that temporarily held back 600 British troops who had flooded into the Market district to arrest local men without trial when the late Edward Heath agreed to unionist demands for internment. Photographed amid flames in Eliza Street, holding an M1 carbine rifle beside the Starry Plough – the flag of the Irish labour movement – McCann’s image during the gun battle became one of the earliest iconic images of the Troubles. The PPS’ decision to prosecute two soldiers in connection with McCann’s death is bound to provoke fierce opposition from within the British military establishment, the Tories and the Conservative press. Earlier this month, the Sun reported that police officers would be reinvestigating all 302 killings carried out by British troops. The paper said at least 500 ex-servicemen, many now in their 60s and 70s, would be “viewed as suspects” during the process. The investigation was branded a witch-hunt by Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former army officer. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Friday that it was not behind the decision to prosecute the two ex-soldiers. ACC Mark Hamilton, head of the PSNI’s legacy and justice department, said: “The decision to prosecute two former soldiers in relation to the death of Mr John Joseph McCann in 1972 follows an internal review of the case by the PPS. Itt is not as a result of a police investigation or re-investigation and, as such, we are unable to comment further on this.” However, the PSNI and the police-linked Historical Enquiries Team (HET) – the body that investigates unsolved crimes from the near 4,000 deaths of the Troubles – has been criticised by unionist politicians, loyalist paramilitary representatives and former senior army officers for being one sided. They allege the HET and the legacy investigations are over-focused on killings involving police officers and soldiers between 1969 and 1997. The PSNI is carrying out criminal inquiries into the actions of a number of British soldiers during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972 when troops opened fire on an anti-interment rally in Derry, killing 13 civilians. No soldier has ever been prosecuted over the Bloody Sunday deaths. Denis Bradley, a former secret envoy between the IRA and the UK government and ex-chair of a consultative group investigating Northern Ireland’s past, has argued that putting the PSNI into the historic prosecutions from the Troubles is “polluting” policing in the region. Bradley has expressed concern that Troubles-related crime inquiries could expose the identities of thousands of informers inside the IRA and loyalist terror groups if there was full disclosure of all British intelligence files in these investigations."
2016-12-16T14:00:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Child abuse inquiry to cut number of public hearings,"Public inquiry style hearings into key institutions in the national child abuse investigation are being reduced to speed up the process and refocus on preventing abuse now and in the future.
In an internal review published on Friday, the inquiry chair, Prof Alexis Jay, says she is committed to pursuing all 13 investigations into non-recent abuse within institutions. But in some cases, the review reveals, there will only be one public hearing into a key area or institution, although the single hearings are likely to last days or weeks. The apparent move away from a public inquiry in the mould of the Leveson and Bloody Sunday inquiries may anger some participants and their lawyers, who pressed the then home secretary, Theresa May, for a statutory public inquiry in which witnesses would be forced to answer questions under oath. In 2017 four public inquiry-style hearings will be held: two on child migrants, one on abuse within the English Benedictine congregation of the Roman Catholic church, and one on Knowl View school in Rochdale, which was linked to abuse by the late MP Cyril Smith. Each public hearing is likely to last weeks it is understood. In the case of child migrants two weeks have been set aside for each hearing. But key hearings into the late Greville Janner, the Anglican church and Westminster will not be held until 2018 at the earliest. Jay’s review said the inquiry had failed to demonstrate progress overall and that she did not think it had carried out its work in a “timely, inclusive and transparent” way.
“It was apparent to me and the panel that the inquiry could not be delivered through a traditional public inquiry approach alone,” she said. “Children are being abused and exploited today – we cannot wait until the inquiry has concluded before it has a positive impact on their lives … I am determined the inquiry makes substantial progress by 2020.” Jay’s review also revealed that an increased programme of research and public seminars which will aim to deliver evidence about the current state of child protection. These will be based on research into how child sexual exploitation networks are formed - including interviews with perpetrators - and will advise on how to prevent abuse taking place. The programme will include a survey of the scale of sexual abuse in residential schools and research with the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches to understand how national safeguarding policies had been implemented at a local level. Seminars will be held on the health sector, the criminal justice system and “the social and political narratives about child abuse”. Jay said the inquiry had two equally important tasks: to unravel institutional failures of the past and make meaningful recommendations to keep children safe.
Friday’s review comes after a troubled period for the inquiry that has seen the departure of senior lawyers, and the decision by the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association – one of the biggest victims’ groups – to pull out of the investigation into Lambeth council because it had lost faith in the inquiry and wanted a more forensic, judge-led investigation. The review reveals there will be only two public hearings into the Anglican church. The Church of England bishop Peter Ball was sentenced to 32 months in prison last year for abusing 18 young men between 1977 and 1992. The inquiry into the Roman Catholic Benedictine congregation will hold one full public hearing in December 2017. Future public hearings – the review does not specify how many – in connection with the archdiocese of Birmingham and the wider Catholic church will follow in 2018. In February 2017 the first public hearing will begin into the child migration programmes that sent children to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. There will be a second child migrant hearing in July. In October 2017 a single public hearing will be held in relation to the Cambridge House boys’ hostel and Knowl View school in Rochdale, where more than 25 pupils alleged they were abused by Smith and others. The review said the Janner investigation, which has been delayed due to an ongoing investigation by Leicestershire police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, was considering 100,000 pages of material. The public hearing will not be held until at least 2018. Jay said a “robust delivery plan” was required to fulfil the terms of the abuse inquiry with a renewed focus on identifying the most important actions to protect children today. “Since becoming chair I have spoken to many people who have been affected in some way by child sexual abuse … The message to me is loud and clear: this inquiry must deliver on its promise to expose what went wrong in the past and provide a safer future for today’s children,” she said. Jay said the issue of abuse within football was being monitored and that she would request that the Football Association provide her with the findings of its review into allegations of historical abuse."
2016-12-16T14:45:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Briton Ben Hooper calls off attempt to swim across Atlantic Ocean,"The wetsuit designed to make him invisible to sharks appears to have worked – but a British man has nevertheless had to call off his bid to become the first to swim the breadth of the Atlantic Ocean after bad weather severely damaged his support vessel. Ben Hooper, a 38-year-old father and former police officer from Gloucestershire with a deceptively languid-looking front crawl, set off from Senegal 33 days ago and was aiming to reach the coastline of Brazil sometime in March.
But on Friday he admitted defeat – for the time being at least – after his support vessel, the Big Blue, was bashed about by terrible weather and high waves. In a statement on his Facebook page, Hooper said: “We were subjected to our fifth day of Atlantic storms as a result of which the sailing catamaran Big Blue suffered damage to her steering and rigging. “The crew worked through the night to make the vessel safe for all onboard and we were able to assess the extent of the damage and the impact on the expedition at first light.” Emergency repairs were made that means she can continue to sail towards Brazil but the damage had led the team to “reappraise” the expedition. It had by no means been an easy trip thus far. The sharks may have been flummoxed but Hooper was injured by another marine beast – a Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish that left him incapacitated in the water. Big Blue picked him up but the fear was that further damage to the boat’s steering might have made it harder to reach him quickly if there was another emergency. Hooper said: “I would add that we are all safe and that Big Blue remains seaworthy and capable of completing crossing of the Atlantic Ocean during the months of December and January.” Much of Hooper’s training had taken place in a swimming pool in Cheltenham, where the sight of him ploughing up and down became a familiar one to fellow swimmers and staff. He also trained in open water in Florida and in the Mediterranean, notching up 7,450 miles (12,000km) of training in pool and ocean. Such is his attention to detail that he worked with Hartpury College in Gloucestershire to find out what music – played on a waterproof MP3 player – helped him most. It turned out that if he listened to Eminem his performance was bolstered by up to 10%, though he leavened the American rapper with tunes by the Prodigy and Faithless. The swimwear specialist Arena designed a Sams (shark attack mitigation systems) wetsuit with Hooper in mind. It features a camouflage print that apparently makes the wearer harder for sharks to spot. Hooper was aiming to cover 2,000 miles. By the time he called a halt he had completed 87 miles in 33 days. Fifteen days had been lost to weather, medical problems and issues with the boat. He remains determined to try again. “My attempt to become the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean – every single mile – remains but it has been postponed for the time being,” he said. “My crew have worked tirelessly to make this possible and this decision has not been taken lightly; indeed, the easy option would have been to carry on at all costs. That would have been foolhardy and unnecessary. “To quote Theodore Roosevelt, ‘It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.’ We have not failed; we have achieved and gained the knowledge to succeed in the future.”"
2016-12-16T15:12:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Unite chief Len McCluskey accused of 'backsliding' on free movement,"Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, has been accused of “backsliding” on immigration by a hard left challenger for his job who wants to create a grassroots movement to support Jeremy Corbyn. Union organiser Ian Allinson, who works at IT firm Fujitsu, has announced that he will seek nominations to enter the leadership race, joining Gerard Coyne, who is regarded as a more centrist candidate. Allinson on Friday criticised McCluskey for suggesting that workers could benefit from reforms to the free movement of people when Britain leaves the European Union.
“Following the Brexit vote Len McCluskey’s backsliding on free movement of workers is not good enough,” he said, referring to his two rivals, McCluskey and Coyne, as “the establishment candidates”. He also criticised the union’s backing for huge government-funded projects, including Trident renewal and the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. Unite is Labour’s biggest donor, and McCluskey has been one of Corbyn’s most vocal backers. He launched his re-election bid on Friday morning with a video message in which he repeated his call for curbs on free movement, and warned rebellious MPs to fall in line behind the leader. “Workers have always done best when the labour supply is controlled and communities are stable,” he said. “While we must reject any form of racism, and help refugees fleeing war, we must also listen to the concerns of working people. “That’s why I have called for new safeguards to stop companies cutting costs by slashing workers’ wages and transforming a race-to-the-bottom culture into a rate-for-the-job society.” McCluskey triggered the leadership race by resigning, in the hope of winning a fresh five-year term in the job. Unite has 1.4 million members and has given millions to Labour. McCluskey’s five-year term was due to end in 2018, so he is effectively bringing the election forward a year. The 66-year-old could have come under pressure to retire if he had stayed until the end of the scheduled term. Candidates for general secretary must gather nominations from at least 50 workplaces or branches by 22 February next year, and the vote will take place between late March and mid-April. Coyne, who is the union’s regional secretary in the West Midlands, has accused McCluskey of “playing Westminster power games”, by intervening in Labour party disputes. McCluskey was a staunch defender of Corbyn during the summer leadership contest, at one point saying rebel MPs had behaved “despicably”, and should be “held to account”."
2016-12-16T16:47:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Brexit Britain has the deepest faultlines of any country I have known,"I love British humour. When something goes fundamentally wrong, the British laugh at it. Brexit? The EU now has 1GB of free space. If that gives you a wry smile, better jokes will be along soon – Brexit has a lot of potential to go wrong. Travelling for two months around Britain and Ireland, visiting Birmingham, Hull, Grimsby, York, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newry and Dundalk, I got an idea of why so many people voted for Brexit and how difficult it will be. For Britain, Europe and the rest of the world. Guardian readers gave me inspiration for where to go and who to meet, sending nearly 100 emails after I asked for tips in my first article. “You should visit my 76-year-old mum in Grimsby. In a Brexit heartland, she was the one swearing at our bridge club players, telling them not to betray their grandchildren,” wrote Paul. It was a pleasure to meet the resolute Mary Randall and her friends Margaret and Beat Haessig in Grimsby, and it helped me understand people’s anxieties and challenges in an area that has suffered a long period of economic decline. When Margaret was growing up in the 1950s and 60s, Grimsby was thriving. By the time Mary moved to the town in 1983, the decline had already begun. “But when the fish industry went downhill there was no investment at all,” she said. “The young people went away because there were no jobs for them.” They showed me around once-busy shopping areas, now run-down, and pointed out shops and businesses that had closed. Travelling to Hull the next day, practically a stone’s throw away on the other side of the river Humber, took almost two hours because there is no proper train connection. Local entrepreneurs told me how fed up they were with the bad infrastructure and the lack of investment from Westminster. I heard “you in London” a lot, even though I was only a temporary Londoner for two months. The people I spoke to who had voted for Brexit and claimed to be fed up with Europe really had more specific concerns: sinking living standards, a lack of affordable housing, rising poverty and an inefficient NHS. All good reasons to be disgruntled, though Brussels is hardly to blame. The morning I left Grimsby was the day the world learned that Donald Trump had won the US election. The outsider had beaten the establishment. Plenty of people, including me, felt that Brexit had happened again. Frank Stauss, a political consultant who has organised several election campaigns for the Social Democrats in Germany, said Trump’s biggest asset was “that he didn’t stand for going on with business as usual”. Trump’s voters in the US wanted a change, and so did leave voters in Britain. They were fed up with an establishment that promised wealth and prosperity in the EU when they were experiencing the opposite. When I came to Britain I had a picture in my mind of a divided society in which young, urban and well-educated people had voted for remain, while elderly and working-class people, and xenophobic ones, had voted to leave.
But it isn’t that simple. I met a shipowner who employs only Polish people on his trawlers but voted to leave. (If the Poles left, he said, he would hire Russians instead.) I talked to a porter who was proud to have voted remain. British society as I experienced it has more and deeper faultlines than any other country I have lived in – namely Poland, Sweden, Germany and Italy. According to research by Poverty and Social Exclusion, 30 million people in the UK suffer from financial insecurity, 4 million people are not properly fed and 2.3m households cannot afford to heat the living areas of their homes. On the other hand, more billionaires live here than in many other countries, and the economy has grown over the last six years. “Privileged” young Londoners with good jobs told me that starting a family was out of the question because they could not afford flats with enough space. “Our parents live in houses we could never afford,” say the millennials. The Northern Irish and Scottish complain that they are neglected by decision-makers in London. Some Britons claim Polish people are taking their jobs, but the Poles say they were welcomed at first as cheap labour, then treated with mistrust when they took on better jobs and homes. “The British liked us in these cheap jobs and became concerned when they improved,” my friend Ania Faluta, with whom I studied in Poland, told me. She started her career in London 11 years ago as a cleaner and is now a project manager. It struck me sometimes that the British are so occupied with competing – in their jobs, dancing, baking, with other nations – that they miss the bigger picture. An education system that provides chances for everybody irrespective of social background? Well, has there ever been a Guardian editor from a comprehensive school? A modern childcare system that is affordable and adapted to the needs of families? Women told me how they jeopardised their careers by staying at home with their toddlers because it was cheaper than sending them to nursery. An efficient healthcare system? I spent hours listening to my housemate’s enraged reports about his experiences in waiting rooms. With every week I spent in Britain, I grew fonder of the German federal system that allows states to set their own key issues, independent of the government in Berlin, and of a social system that allows me to have four children, a full-time job and to afford a two-month break abroad. British society could do with modernisation, in my view. It’s so 1980s. But I doubt if Brexit will bring that about. Instead, the British will be occupied with rebuilding the bridges to the EU that they are just about to tear down. That’s what the negotiations are aimed at, aren’t they? To leave Europe and the European single market, and at the same time guarantee access to the latter. Norway, which could serve as an example, is not a member of the EU but of the European Economic Area, and has 70% of EU directives and 17% of EU regulations in force. Brexit seems like a big waste of time and money, but nevertheless I’d prefer the British to be as close as possible to the EU. When Theresa May sets off to embrace the autocrats in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the other Gulf countries, the democratic opposition in these countries will be even less heard. But the EU is also far from perfect. Its harshest critics should not be easily dismissed. And we Germans could do with a good deal more of the politeness, consideration and respect that people in Britain show to their fellow humans. And, of course, with some British humour. How many Germans do you need to change a lightbulb? One! They are so efficient and have no sense of humour. You see?"
2016-12-16T17:03:50Z,uk-news,UK news,ScotRail commuters given free week of travel after disruption,"Scottish commuters are to be given a free week’s rail travel to head off mounting complaints and unrest caused by cancellations, overcrowding and disruption to services. A £3m package of discounted travel will be shared among season ticket holders as an implied apology for the decline in performance by ScotRail – a gesture that will be met with envy by commuters using strike-hit services in southern England. The latest ScotRail performance figures showed that only 83.7% of trains arrived within five minutes of their scheduled time over the last four weeks. On one day in that period, services across central Scotland were hit when a train broke down crossing several tracks just outside Waverley station in Edinburgh at rush hour. Among the price cuts being rolled out in the new year, weekly and monthly season ticket holders on the busiest Edinburgh to Glasgow line will get the equivalent of £95.50 worth of rail travel, and commuters travelling from Stonehaven to Aberdeen will get £32.40. Humza Yousaf, who as Scottish transport minister has fended off calls to resign in recent weeks, said the package was a thank you to passengers for their patience. At the height of the controversy last month, Yousaf said ministers wanted to work up a public sector bid for the service.
“We recognise any level of delay or disruption on the rail network in Scotland affects people’s lives,” he said on Friday. “This year has been particularly challenging as we take forward our record-breaking investment programme on the live network to deliver newer, longer, greener trains on our flagship routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow as well as further afield.” The Scottish government said the free week was worth more than the fare freeze demanded this week by Scottish Labour, which has led an increasingly fierce campaign on rail services. There would be additional promotions and fare offers for other passengers. But Neil Bibby, Labour’s transport spokesman at Holyrood, said it would not help frequent travellers who did not hold season tickets. “Like everything with the Scottish National party and ScotRail, this doesn’t hit the mark. Labour’s fare freeze policy would have benefited every ScotRail passenger – the SNP’s policy won’t,” Bibby said. Prices were still set to rise on average by a record 1.9% in the new year for the majority of passengers, he said."
2016-12-16T17:13:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Two pharmacists arrested in Yorkshire in black market drug raid,"Two pharmacists have been arrested as a result of an investigation into a plot to divert “significant” quantities of prescription drugs to the black market. Investigators from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) believe they have uncovered an extensive criminal network that has been siphoning huge amounts of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, and other hypnotics from the regulated supply chain. The arrests in Yorkshire on Wednesday followed the purchase of more than 200,000 packs of benzodiazepines and other drugs by the pharmacists, who were found to have only dispensed a small proportion of the drugs. Local police acting on behalf of the MHRA arrested the pair on suspicion of possession with intent to supply, unlawful supply, conspiracy to supply and unlawful possession of a controlled drug. Both have been bailed while investigators continue their inquiries. “Evidence shows extensive criminality involving a number of businesses,” said Alastair Jeffrey, the MHRA head of enforcement. “As a matter of priority we are working with our regulatory and law enforcement colleagues to identify and prosecute those involved in this activity and to implement preventative measures to make sure this illegal industry is shut down.” “Prescription-only medicines are, by their very nature, potent and should only be prescribed by a doctor or appropriate healthcare professional. We would advise people not to buy medicines from unregulated sources as they pose a danger to their health.” An MHRA spokeswoman said the investigation followed two unrelated referrals from police in Ireland and Scotland in 2015 and 2016, in which investigations found suspects in possession of seemingly legitimate UK medicines. It is usually more common to find unlicensed versions of the drugs that have been illegally imported into the UK, she said. Five benzodiazepines have been identified as a priority by investigators, including diazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, zolpidem and zopiclone. The main market for illegally sold benzodiazepines is heroin users who are looking for ways to dampen withdrawal symptoms, although stimulant drug users may also use them “if they get bored or want to go to sleep”, said Dr Simon Brandt, a drug chemist at Liverpool John Moores University. “Like with any medicines, they need to be taken in consultation with a GP,” Brandt said. “What you generally find is, depending on the indications, for instance people with anxiety or who struggle to get to sleep, they may receive prescription benzos for a short time. “As people start to take them for longer, then you have tolerance, so people would have to increase the dosage. Then, later on, when they are in a position to stop taking them, they will have developed some form of dependency.”"
2016-12-16T17:22:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Man pleads guilty to killing woman while her husband listened helplessly on phone,"A man has pleaded guilty to stabbing a mother to death in her home while her children were asleep and her husband, who was away on business, listened helplessly on the phone. Nicola Cross was killed by a Polish car mechanic, Marcin Porczynski, who “smashed his way into the house” on the night of 14 September last year and stabbed her 10 times in the torso. St Albans crown court heard that he had paranoid schizophrenia and may have been hearing voices in the two years before the killing. After stabbing the 37-year-old, he tried to leave her Hemel Hempstead house with the two children. Porczynksi, 24, who had moved to the UK in 2014, was charged with murder, two counts of kidnap, burglary of a neighbour’s house and aggravated burglary involving a weapon of offence, namely a knife. He pleaded not guilty to the five counts but guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility. Fourteen members of Cross’s family were present in court including her husband, Daniel, her sister and her mother. Daniel Cross said in a victim impact statement read out to the court: “I see no future happiness, I see no end to this trauma until my own life comes to an end.” He added: “When Marcin Porczynski killed Nik, he killed one person, but destroyed numerous other lives.” Porczynski has been detained in Rampton high security hospital and will be sentenced on Monday. The court heard that Porczynski had no previous mental health record, and neither he nor his family knew he had an illness. The court heard that traces of cocaine and cannabis were found in his blood, but the prosecution psychiatrist did not believe this had any bearing on the incident. Cross, who died defending her children, had phoned the police 30 minutes earlier after Porczynski “banged on her door” and she refused to let him in. Officers arrived and searched him, and although he “appeared distant” they concluded there was no reason to detain him. Terrified, Cross phoned her husband, who was away on business in Hull, again as Porczynski broke into the house. “She was on her phone to her husband again saying how worried he was when the defendant broke in. She said she heard a noise and told her husband to hold on while she went to investigate,” said Christopher Donnellan QC, prosecuting. “He heard her screaming: ‘Get out of my house, what do you want?’ He then heard further screaming: ‘You don’t need to do this.’ Then her husband heard a male voice saying: ‘I do, I do.’ After a further very loud scream it went quiet.” The court heard that Cross would have been unconscious in seconds. Daniel Cross said in his statement: “I was on the phone before, during and after. That phone call plays over and over in my head, along with Nik’s screams and her pleading for her life. I will never forgive myself for not being there to protect her. I am totally and utterly heartbroken.” He said that before his wife’s death his family’s life had been “almost sickeningly perfect”. They had 11 years of being totally in love and “to top it off we had two beautiful children” and “a warm family home”. Describing it has a “mindless and fericous knife attack”, he told the court: “Our family had been broken and our futures taken away from us in a blink of an eye.” The court heard that Porczynski was “a total stranger” to the family and had lived a few streets away. Daniel Cross had been up since 5am to travel to Hull and had gone to bed when he was woken up by a call from his anxious wife. She told him that a man had banged on her front door and that she had not answered it. He had knocked on a neighbour’s door moments before muttering something about “kids”. The court heard that Porczynski returned home where his housemate Robert Dziel also became concerned and considered calling the police. “Nicola Cross was still very bothered by what was happening. She had rung police for updates; she also rang her husband and told him what was happening. She told him the the police had been and they had let him go,” said Donnellan. Porczynski took a small kitchen knife from his home and at about 11.25pm or 11.30pm returned to the road where the Crosses lived. “He got the wrong house and smashed the rear patio door to the neighbouring house of Mr Shah. Mr Shah was there and had just finished a shower. He shouted at him: ‘What are you doing here?’ and the defendant ran back out,” said Donnellan. Shah called police and while they attended the scene there was “a loud crash followed very shortly afterwards by screaming” from Cross’s house. They could not access the house through the front door and then discovered the defendant and asked him to open another door. They entered the house and saw a child downstairs, who told them: “He has hurt my mummy badly.” They found a small broken kitchen knife in the bathroom alongside a pair of Cross’s glasses. Upstairs they found Cross and tried but failed to resuscitate her. “Nicola Cross was clearly defenceless … the degree of force is severe, as is absolutely clear. She could have only survived the fatal injury for a few seconds before unconsciousness,” said Donnellan. The court heard that Porczynski had been hearing voices telling him to “free some children” or his own family would be killed. In a witness statement, Dziel who worked with Porczynski in a warehouse, said he had become worried about his housemate’s behaviour three weeks earlier. He hadn’t gone to work for a week before the killing, and one occasion Dziel came home and found Porczynski sitting in the garden alone in the dark. Porczynski’s defence barrister described the killing as “a sad and terribly tragic case with overwhelming consequences” for the Cross family. Porczynski will be sentenced on Monday morning."
2016-12-16T18:32:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds of Calais child refugees have UK asylum claims rejected,"Hundreds of child asylum seekers in France who had been expecting to come to the UK have been told that the Home Office has rejected their claims. The children and teenagers dispersed from Calais in October have been advised to lodge their applications in France instead. The Home Office confirmed that the transfer of children previously in the Calais camp and now in French reception centres had ended, and said those it had decided could not come to the UK had been given advice about how to claim asylum in France. A spokeswoman said more unaccompanied children were undergoing initial screening in Italy and Greece and may also be brought to the UK. According to the Home Office, 750 children have been brought to the UK, but there were 1,900 registered after the Calais refugee camp was demolished. One 15-year-old Eritrean boy, Taher, said all 14 boys in his centre run by the Taizé community, a monastic order, were devastated by the news. “I have been on hunger strike since Sunday, drinking only water and coffee to protest about the unfairness of the Home Office keeping us waiting for so long. We haven’t been able to go to school or anything while we have been waiting. And now we have heard this very bad news,” he said.
Taher said many of the boys were planning to run away rather than claim asylum in France, where they were distrustful of the authorities after witnessing police violence against inhabitants of the Calais camp. “Some will try to get to the UK on a lorry from Belgium. I think I will go back to Calais and try to get to England that way,” he said. Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at the UK-based Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing a large number of asylum seeker children dispersed across France, said he and his team had received reports on Friday from more than 12 children they are representing, all of whom are at different centres. “From the reports we have received it seems as if this is an organised operation between the Home Office and the French authorities. The children have been told verbally that their asylum claims have not succeeded, but they have not been given any reasons why in writing. This is absolutely shocking.” Hossain added: “The children are very upset but we are telling them not to run away.” Although the Home Office recently issued guidance saying it would prioritise under-15s from Sudan and Syria, he said he assumed that officials would then consider the cases of the other children dispersed around France.
“These children are very vulnerable. They have just been told verbally that they can’t come to England without an appropriate adult present to help them deal with this news. We are now looking to see what we can do legally to challenge the fact that the Home Office have failed to provide us with written reasons why they have rejected the children’s asylum claims.” Rebecca Carr, Taher’s legal representative, said he was a highly intelligent boy who had been offered a scholarship at a school in the UK if he was able to get there. She added that he had worked hard to learn English and said the fear now was that many of the children would run away after receiving the news. “I’ve been waiting and hoping for more than three months that I will be able to come to England,” said Taher. “I was in Calais for two months and have been in this centre for more than one month. There are 14 of us here who have received this bad news. The British government and the Home Office have been playing games with us. It has always been my dream to come to the UK because I love hearing British accents. “Whenever I hear a British accent I feel happy so I think if I can come to the UK and hear British accents all the time I will be happy for the rest of my life. If I can come to the UK I want to study to be a doctor so I can help people. And I love Manchester City and One Direction and can see them if I reach the UK.” A busload of child asylum seekers were brought from France to the UK last Friday, but it is thought that was the last of the Calais transfers. Charities have expressed concern about the children left behind and warned that more unofficial camps will spring up.Children with close family members in the UK may be eligible to come under rules known as the Dublin regulation. Under an amendment to the Immigration Act proposed by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, some vulnerable children without family members in the UK are also eligible to come to the UK. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We have been working with the French authorities to bring children eligible to come here and more than 750 children have arrived so far. We are working closely with the French authorities to ensure the remaining children in their care are provided with information on how to claim asylum in France. “The current phase of transfers is being concluded. This is a planned process, done in conjunction with the French authorities. We have interviewed all the children who were transferred from the camp to the children centres in France. Those transferred to the UK include all Dublin cases where the family relationship has been verified.” She continued: “Between the start of the year and 10 October, over 140 unaccompanied asylum seeking children were accepted for transfer from Europe to the UK under the Dublin regulation. In addition, the UK has taken over 750 unaccompanied children from France following the closure of the Calais camp – under both Dublin and Dubs. “The Dubs process has not ended. More eligible children will be transferred from across Europe, in line with the terms of the Immigration Act, in the coming months. This could include children from France, Greece and Italy. “We are working closely with partners across Europe – including the Greek and Italian authorities, the UNHCR and NGOs – to further enable this process and have seconded an expert to Greece, where hundreds of unaccompanied children have undergone initial screening. We also have a longstanding secondee in Italy to support efforts to transfer children to the UK.”"
2016-12-16T21:09:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Muslim woman dragged on ground by her hijab in east London assault,"A young Muslim woman was forced to the ground in a busy shopping precinct and dragged along by her hijab by two men in what police are treating as a racist attack. The woman, who police said was in her 20s, was walking alone in Chingford, east London, when the two men dressed in black approached her, tried to pull off her headscarf and pushed her to the ground. She reportedly said she was then dragged along the ground during the struggle. Police said the attackers, described as two white males aged 17 to 19, ran off north along Old Church Road. Witnesses told the Evening Standard the victim was lying on the pavement for almost 20 minutes after the attack, before managing to call police and limp to a nearby Turkish restaurant, where she was helped by staff. Koksal Zeyek, 40, the owner of Fes restaurant on Old Church Road, said his staff first noticed the woman sitting on a table outside. “My colleague, he went out and talked to her and she was explaining she had been attacked because she had been wearing a scarf – a hijab – and two white men were trying to take off her scarf,” he said. A waiter at the restaurant told the Evening Standard: “She told us two white guys shoved her then dragged her along the floor by her headscarf and left her on the pavement. She was having a panic attack when we saw her and could barely breathe.” Zeyek said he noticed that the woman’s injuries were compounded by the scars from a recent operation, and that she was struggling to move. “I held her hand and I helped her to walk in and she called the police and ambulance,” he said. “The ambulance didn’t come, the police didn’t turn up and then after 45 minutes first aid came, they checked her blood pressure and then after 15 minutes … the ambulance came. And then 20 minutes after the ambulance, the police came. They took more than one hour or something like that. “We were shocked as well, don’t get me wrong, because the lady had been attacked. Police didn’t come, the ambulance didn’t come and she was shaking and she was struggling and everything.” The Metropolitan police said officers answered reports of a woman having been assaulted at 8.35pm on Wednesday. “No arrests have been made. Officers from Waltham Forest CID are investigating,” the force said in a statement."
2016-12-17T11:42:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Baggage handlers down suitcases as Britons get ready for wave of strikes,"A fresh wave of strikes will hit Britain in the final week before Christmas, with 1,500 check-in staff and baggage handlers at 18 airports preparing to walk out and rail operator Southern warning of severe disruption when conductors do the same. British Airways cabin crew based at Heathrow airport announced on Friday that they are to strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay and conditions. The action, backed by the Unite union, could involve up to 4,500 staff on “mixed fleet” contracts who joined the airline since 2010. Virgin Atlantic pilots voted to take industrial action short of a strike in a row over union recognition, and will work “strictly to contract” from 23 December. That news came after the announcement earlier this week that Post Office workers would stage five days of strikes in the run-up to Christmas. Southern rail Southern saw the complete cancellation of its train services on Friday, for the third day in a week. About 300,000 passengers were affected when Southern cancelled all its 2,242 weekday services.
An overtime ban in place by drivers in the Aslef union will compound the effects of a two-day strike on Southern services by RMT conductors starting on Monday. Prospects of an imminent resolution of the rail dispute appeared remote after talks between Southern’s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, and Aslef collapsed on Thursday. Airport staff On Friday 23 December and Christmas Eve, members of Unite employed by Swissport will walk out at Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Bristol, Cardiff, Doncaster, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds/Bradford, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle, Southampton and Stansted airports. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson called on the company to “engage in constructive talks”. Airport representatives have said they are putting contingency plans in place. British Airways Members of the same union voted to strike over what have been described as “poverty pay” levels. They say staff members employed in the last six years are on lower pay and conditions than existing crew. BA has accused the union of “creating uncertainty for our customers”. Virgin Atlantic
Pilots at the airline who are members of the Professional Pilots’ Union (PPU) will work to rule after they voted to take industrial action short of a strike. The action will see a removal of “pilot goodwill”, with pilots who are members of the PPU working strictly to their contracts. Virgin Atlantic said it values its pilots “enormously” and expected its “flying programme to remain unaffected”. Post Office A five-day strike, including on Christmas Eve, threatens to cause disruption for those wanting to send gifts and cards. The Communications Workers Union blamed a long-running dispute over jobs, pensions and branch closures. The union blamed the “intransigence” of the Post Office, while the company said it was “extremely disappointed” and had believed talks were due to resume this week. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “Royal Mail will be operating as normal next week when the CWU union says its members in the Post Office will take industrial action. We expect there to be little or no impact on the services we provide to our customers. “There is no change in the Royal Mail guidance on last posting dates.”"
2016-12-17T13:46:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Camelot considers options after alleged fraudulent winner named as rapist,"The National Lottery operator, Camelot, is “considering its options” after the man who allegedly claimed a £2.5m prize by fraudulent means was named in the media as a convicted rapist. The Gambling Commission said on Thursday that it had fined Camelot£3m for paying out the £2.5m prize in 2009 on a ticket that had allegedly been deliberately damaged. The suspected fraud was not discovered until last year. Neither Camelot nor the Gambling Commission would confirm or deny that Edward Putman, who was convicted of rape in the 1990s and whose lottery win emerged in a fraud case four years ago, was the winner under suspicion. The 51-year-old from Kings Langley, who has previous convictions for rape, wounding and benefit fraud, was arrested for fraud last October but was released without charge because of a lack of evidence. Hertfordshire police say they will reopen the case if new evidence comes to light. Putman, who opted out of publicity opportunities at the time of his win, was in the headlines in 2012 when he was taken to court for illegally claiming £13,000 of welfare benefits after winning his jackpot. His previous convictions, for the rape of a 17-year-old in the 1990s and wounding in the 1980s, also emerged. The gambling watchdog, which has fined Camelot twice before, said that although its investigation “could not be certain a fraud had taken place, it was more likely than not that a fraudulent prize claim had been made and paid out”. The commission ruled that the lottery operator had breached the terms of its lottery operating licence over control of its databases, the way it investigated prize claims and its processes “around the decision to pay a prize”. Andy Duncan, Camelot’s chief executive, apologised for its failures but said such an incident was “not repeatable today”. Camelot has paid the penalty imposed by the commission, which will been given to charities, and said that it was not connected to the draws for the winning numbers, but to do with its system for preventing fraudulent claims on a deliberately damaged ticket. The incident was described as “unique”. None of the money has been paid back by Putman, and Camelot said it was now considering its options. The company would not comment on reports that Putman was the individual concerned. Herfordshire police said it had closed its investigation. “An allegation of fraud connected to a lottery win from 2009 was investigated by Hertfordshire constabulary’s specialist cyber and financial investigation unit working with the Gambling Commission. As part of the investigation a man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. Following a thorough investigation, the man was released with no further action to be taken against him.”The lottery operator admitted it had made mistakes, but would not comment on whether any employees may have been involved. Duncan said: “We accept that, at the time, there were some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident and we’re very sorry for that. We’ve strengthened our processes significantly since 2009 and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,” he said. “It’s really important that people understand that this allegation relates to a unique, one-off incident dating back to 2009 and involves a potentially fraudulent claim on a deliberately damaged ticket. It has nothing to do with the National Lottery draws themselves.” The commission’s chief executive, Sarah Harrison, said its main concern was to ensure the National Lottery was run with integrity and that players’ interests were protected. “Camelot’s failures in this case are serious and the penalty package reflects this,” she said. “Importantly, the package also ensures that good causes will not lose out as a result of Camelot’s licence breach. “Lottery players can feel reassured that our investigations have found no evidence of similar events happening and that controls are in place today to mitigate against future prize payout failings of this type.”"
2016-12-17T16:56:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Fog disrupts flights in south-east England,"Thousands of passengers have been left stranded as a thick fog descended on London, forcing airlines to cancel departures and divert arrivals. Caused by high pressure and moisture in the air, dense fog is covering much of the south-east of England, while the rest of the country was also covered in mist. Heathrow, Gatwick and London City have all been affected by the weather, with the latter saying it had caused “significant disruption”.
Passengers flying in and out airports in the south-east have been told to expect delays and to contact their airline before travelling to the airport. A Heathrow spokesman said about 50 flights had been cancelled so far. He said: “There are currently delays to flights at Heathrow because of fog across the south-east and large parts of Europe. The fog and mist are slowly improving.”
Charlotte Beeching, a spokesperson for the London City airport, said: “The airport closed at lunchtime and will reopen tomorrow but there was significant disruption all morning.” She did not know how many flights or passengers had been affected by the fog.
Greg Dewhurst, meteorologist for the Met Office, said the thick fog had been caused by high pressure combined with moisture in the air, which at this time of the year, when the nights are long and cool, helps form fog.
He said: “We saw it form overnight and it has lasted through the day, it’ll likely stay through the night and into tomorrow morning as the high pressure is unlikely to change. “As we go through tomorrow, the air will become a little bit drier and it will begin to clear, but in the short term, it’s likely to stay on the misty-murky-foggy side of things, especially across the south-east part of the country.”
There will be further disruption for travellers over the festive period due to a wave of strikes and planned industrial action by employees of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, as well as airport staff. British Airways said: “In common with other airlines, we are experiencing some disruption to our flights from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports today. “With a reduced landing/take-off rate imposed, there will be delays and a small number of cancellations. We apologise to any customers who have been affected but safety remains our main priority.”"
2016-12-17T21:28:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Family seeks justice over alleged ‘honour’ killing,"When Seeta Kaur arrived in India with her children for a three-week visit to her husband’s relatives she was determined that when she returned to Britain it would be with both the sons who had accompanied her. Since giving birth to the boys, who were aged 10 and two when they travelled to India, Seeta had confided in her family and close friends about the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband, Pawan, for resisting his demands to give one of them away. Pawan, an Indian national, lived with Seeta and their four children (they also had two daughters) in Edmonton, north London, where she was born and raised. He wanted his brother and sister-in-law in India to have one of their sons because they could not have children of their own and, at the end of the trip, threatened to leave one of them behind. Informal inter-family adoptions are not uncommon in India, because of an inefficient and disorganised legal adoption system. According to the government’s own figures, 3,000 children were adopted formally in the country last year, while there are an estimated 30 million orphans in the country.
Swinder Singh, Seeta’s sister, said: “She was open with us about the volatile relationship with her husband and the huge pressure she was under to give one of her sons away, which he had made a matter of family honour. She was a British woman and the idea horrified her.” On 31 March last year, Pawan phoned Seeta’s family in north London to tell them she had died of a heart attack at her in-laws’ home in Kurukshetra in the north Indian state of Haryana. They flew to India and began to suspect she was the victim of an “honour” killing when they saw bruising around Seeta’s neck and upper chest as she lay in her coffin. They announced their plan to take her back to Britain the following morning for a postmortem … but awoke to discover that Seeta had been cremated while they slept. When the case was closed by Indian police without a full investigation, Seeta’s family turned to the Metropolitan police for help, but say they were initially told that British officers had no jurisdiction to investigate because the alleged crime took place abroad. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not get involved, or help secure the return of Seeta’s four children, who remain in India with their father, despite the high court ordering their return in April last year. The family’s fight is now being led by the women’s group Southall Black Sisters, who have amassed a dossier of evidence and launched a “Justice for Seeta” campaign. They are backed by Kate Osamor, the family’s local MP, and Naz Shah, who has led the fight for justice for Samia Shahid, the Bradford woman killed in Pakistan last July. They are calling for the Metropolitan police to look into Seeta’s case, and demanding new legislation that would make it easier to investigate “honour” killings of British citizens abroad, claiming a legal grey area is letting perpetrators evade justice. Pragna Patel, director of Southall Black Sisters, said: “Men are taking women abroad and getting away with honour crimes because the law is not clear on what exactly is the duty of British authorities to investigate them.” Describing the current situation as a “lottery”, she cited cases such as that of Madeleine McCann and missing toddler Ben Needham as proof that British police are willing to investigate crimes abroad in some instances. “Clearly, when there are non-white Britons involved and it’s an ‘honour’ crime, then there appears to be a dereliction of duty on the part of the British police. This is what has happened in Seeta’s case, because we have collected concrete evidence and yet the Metropolitan police have not acted upon it.” This evidence includes 26 witness statements from friends and relatives with details of the abuse they say she suffered for opposing her husband. One of her closest friends testified that, ahead of the trip to India, Seeta confided to her that she feared for her life. It was also said that the couple had a heated argument on the night she died. Medical reports showed that Seeta, aged 33, had no condition to explain a heart attack. Shamik Dutta, solicitor for Seeta’s family, said: “A new law which recognises the international nature of honour killing would help families secure justice and act as a deterrent against such offences.” The dossier compiled by campaigners was sent to the Metropolitan police in August, but no response has yet been received. The police said in a statement: “We are in the process of responding to a number of queries raised with us by a firm of solicitors acting on behalf of the family of Seeta.”"
2016-12-17T22:00:33Z,uk-news,UK news,"Unite challenger: ‘We have to focus on how to grow unions, not influence in Westminster’","Gerard Coyne fought his first battle on behalf of working people at the age of 17, when he was stacking shelves at Sainsbury’s supermarket in West Bromwich.
“Bad employers always make good recruiters for trades unions,” he says. “We had one particular manager who decided he didn’t want people talking on the checkouts. So I started organising. When we ended, I had the whole store unionised.” Thirty-two years on, Coyne, 49, is embarking on a quest to become the most powerful figure in the British trade union movement. If he succeeds, it will have far-reaching implications for Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party. When we meet in a coffee shop next to King’s Cross station in London for his first newspaper interview since launching a challenge to topple Len McCluskey, 66, from the leadership of the super-union Unite, it is McCluskey who he now casts as the bad boss who does not have the interests of working people sufficiently at heart. The current Unite leader, he says at the outset, spends far too much time playing power politics and trying to “pull strings” at Westminster and not enough on the vital issues that affect his 1.4 million members. He says he cannot remember an occasion in the past three years on which McCluskey actually appeared on site to back Unite members in an industrial dispute. By contrast, his general secretary’s numerous appearances on the media in support of Corbyn and his predecessor Ed Miliband are all too fresh in the mind. “Of course we want to see the election of a Labour government in 2020, but what I want is to get away from this pulling of the strings of the Labour party.” It is not that Coyne thinks influence with Labour leaders does not matter. He knows it does. But he says the union will exercise even more if it can give better value for money to members and help them face the challenges of mechanisation and technological advance that are threatening their jobs. That, says Coyne, is the route to increasing Unite’s membership and enhancing its reputation. “If we can grow and show we are playing a real, constructive role in the lives of working people, Labour would be mad not to listen to us. Every morning we have to wake up and think, what is it I do to grow the movement? Not – what is it I do to grow influence [at Westminster]?” Mechanisation is a “massive issue”, he says. “We have not really grappled with the technological change that most of the world of work is going to be faced with, around manufacturing, food processing, transport. In the next 20 years we are going to be seeing such change … we need to explain it to our members and upskill them to be ready for it.” The union also needs to “up its game” in promoting the interests of women in the workplace, doing more to push pay equality and flexible working. “We have to make sure we are relevant to women. At the moment these issues are on the back burner.” Coyne is Unite’s regional secretary in the West Midlands, with more than 25 years of experience at senior levels in the movement. He is one of six brothers from a family of trade unionists and Labour activists. In 2005, he brokered agreements to get 6,500 Rover workers into new jobs after the company went into receivership. The fast-changing world of work, he says, not only threatens traditional jobs but also the very future of unions. “We have so many challenges that apply to the whole of the British trade union movement. I fundamentally believe in trade unions absolutely to my core. But if we don’t get this right in this generation I fear for the future of the movement.”
Unite is the Labour party’s biggest donor, pumping millions of pounds a year into its coffers. It loans staff to Corbyn’s office. McCluskey appoints Unite members to Labour’s ruling national executive council. It threw hefty financial and other resources behind Corbyn’s two leadership campaigns this year and last. It has huge voting power at party conference. McCluskey is arguably Corbyn’s most important supporter inside or outside parliament. Unite’s influence also extends into local Labour politics, where many MPs opposed to Corbyn fear local Unite officials are trying to pack their people on to key committees in constituencies, with the ultimate aim of bringing about mass deselections of the disloyal. Labour MPs are watching this election more closely than any other for many years. One MP and former shadow cabinet member told the Observer it was “by far the most important union moment in our party’s recent history”. That is because if Coyne wins, he will pull it back from the politics and redirect the focus. Coyne says: “Our members are suffering a tough time at the moment. Average earnings have gone down 10% since 2007; 1.6 million people are on temporary and agency contracts and zero-hours contracts are at nearly a million, having gone up 20% in the last year alone.” He won’t be drawn on whether he thinks Unite gives too much money to Labour but he notes that the surge in party membership means it is now far less dependent on union cash. If he prevails, he will insist on greater transparency on how Unite spends money. The donations issue will be addressed anew. There are concerns, he adds, about the £400,000 given by Unite to help McCluskey buy a £700,000 apartment in London. The union says the deal is an “equity share arrangement” which will deliver profits for members when the flat is sold. Coyne has age on his side in the battle against McCluskey. “When a union has a policy, as Unite does, which is ‘68 is too late’ (to retire), having a general secretary who stays on until he is 71 sends completely the wrong message. We need to bring people who are younger into well paid, good employment.” He accepts he is the underdog because McCluskey has the union machine at his disposal but says he would not have entered the race if he had not thought he could win. “There have been some elections recently where being the underdog has not been a bad place to be. There is an opportunity for change, for a fresh start, for members to get their union back.”"
2016-12-18T00:37:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen's 90th year marked by fashion and rock photographer,"A previously unseen portrait of the Queen by a photographer famed for his work on album covers and fashion has been released by Buckingham Palace to mark the end of the year in which the Queen celebrated her 90th birthday.
Nick Knight, well-known for his fashion collaborations with Alexander McQueen, Yves St Laurent and Yohji Yamamoto as well as album covers for artists such as David Bowie, Lady Gaga, Bjork and Paul Weller, photographed the monarch and Prince Charles in the white drawing room at Windsor Castle. The picture, shot last May before the final night of the Queen’s celebrations at the Royal Windsor horse show, has Prince Charles in a dinner jacket standing beside the Queen. Knight, 58, whose debut publication in 1982 was a book called Skinhead, has had his work showcased in the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Saatchi Gallery. “It was a great pleasure and an honour to photograph Her Majesty the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle. I wanted to create a modern portrait that showed warmth and humanity as well as strength and tradition,” he said of his portrait. The Queen thanked those who helped her celebrated her special day with a party in the Mall but said at the time: “How I will feel if people are still singing happy birthday to me in December remains to be seen.”"
2016-12-18T10:41:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Family pays tribute to killed Derbyshire woman,"The family of a woman who was killed in an incident that also left a man dead and another with stab wounds to his face have paid tribute to a “beautiful mother, daughter and sister”. Claire Nagle, 38, was found at a house in Derbyshire on Friday morning after a seriously injured 22-year-old man raised the alarm by running to nearby shops shouting: “Help me, please help me.” Thirty minutes later a 44-year-old man died in a collision with a lorry on the M1, a short distance away from where Nagle was found. Derbyshire police have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death of Nagle, who is related to both men. The 22-year-old man was being treated for head injuries in the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, police said. In a statement on behalf of the family, Nagle’s father, Martin Paton, said: “We are devastated at the loss of a much loved, beautiful and vibrant mother, daughter and sister, Claire. “We believe this was a tragic incident for everyone involved and their families. We don’t want to apportion any blame and wish to be left alone to grieve as a family. “We’d also like to thank everyone who has offered us messages of support.” The family tribute came as more detail emerged about the bloody scenes at 11am on Friday in the village of Borrowash. Witnesses said they saw a “young lad” with a blood-covered face desperately pleading for help before the emergency services were called. Local resident Michael Nightingale said the man ran into a flower shop with stab wounds to his face. “I saw the police wrapping up a young lad in tin foil,” he said. “He was on the ground, so I drove down into my drive and then a police van turned up and cordoned off the house. “I have lived here for 10 years and I have never seen anything like this. He ran over the road - that’s where they wrapped him up. He was shouting: ‘Help me, help me.’” Florist Louise Winson told the BBC: “I just heard shouting: ‘Help me, please help me.’ “I looked round, the guy’s just stood there, I couldn’t even see his face for blood – it was just pouring. “I just shut the door to be honest, I was in absolute shock and then I picked my phone up to ring 999 but somebody had already done it and then I went out and he was laying on the side of the road. [It was] just a mess.” It is believed the 22-year-old man alerted police officers to the incident at a house where they found Nagle seriously injured. She later died in hospital. A cameraman for BBC East Midlands Today reported seeing a body on the M1. Both carriageways of the motorwaywere closed for most of Friday, causing traffic disruption in the area. DCI Gareth Meadows, who is leading the murder investigation, said he was keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area of either Station Road or Charnwood Avenue in Borrowash on Friday morning. Meadows said: “I’d also be particularly interested in hearing from motorists on the M1 who were driving between junctions 25 and 26 at around 11.15 am to 11.30am on Friday. “Did you see a white Ford Focus on the hard shoulder? Did you see two men on an overbridge behaving in a way you now think was out of place? If anyone has any dashboard camera footage from that time please contact the incident room on 101.”"
2016-12-18T12:26:26Z,uk-news,UK news,London gentrification: cliches and conundrums (and hipsters),"Gentrification happens when the demand for living and working space outstrips its supply in cities that people want to live in. It is force of change that is shaded, shaped, speeded and slowed by various factors, such as the nature of a neighbourhood, flows of finance, the availability of land, the powers and priorities of different layers of government and by skittish stuff like personal taste. Its effects are various, some benefitting long-term residents, others not, in an array of different ways. Stopping it in London is probably impossible, though policies for making public transport worse, schools unsuccessful, streets more dangerous and parks unpleasant might help. The phenomenon’s advance guard are adventurous creative types and young professionals (I should know, I used to be one). They are often those most upset when ensuing stages of gentrification take hold, though any breakdown of winners and losers might not be quite as straightforward as they think. That’s my bite-size take at any rate. Not all see it that way, but many would agree that in London, a booming city, gentrification is happening at sometimes alarming speed and presents large challenges, pretty much by definition (including challenges of definition). Last month, the Centre for Cities thinktank tackled the issue in one of its podcasts. In a panel discussion, Shelter’s Toby Lloyd said: From our perspective, the most important thing is simply that cities are able to provide for the people that live in them. Change will happen and we can’t assume that that’s always bad - it can be good, it can be bad, it depends. But at a city-wide level, it is vital that change processes do still allow for enough diversity of income and diversity of different types of people. It is inevitable that when any kind of change happens there are some people who like it and some people who don’t like it, some people who benefit from it and some who lose out. We have to recognise that there will be competing interests. There will always be change, there will always be tensions, so it’s how we manage those changes and make sure that the losers don’t lose out too badly from change and that the winners don’t gain disproportionately at their expense. The whole discussion, which also involved Edward Clarke and Anna Minton, is well worth listening to. Find it here. If nothing else, it might persuade you that gentrification should not be reduced to a bunch of easy cliches and instead needs to be approached as a conundrum arising from London’s economic successes. Seeing it as all good or all bad doesn’t help with trying to understand and deal with it. Neither does just blaming hipsters, as this bit of mischief hints.
The film is the work of Jack McPartland, Paul Calway and Adam Morley. More by me on gentrification in London here, here and here."
2016-12-18T14:22:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Diane Abbott defends series of strikes planned in run-up to Christmas,"The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has defended union bosses planning a wave of strikes on the railways, in airports and at the Post Office in the run-up to Christmas. “Of course these strikes are going to be very disastrous if they all go ahead for the public over Christmas, but people do have a legal right to strike,” Abbott told the Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan. She added: “It’s not my role to second-guess the decisions of trade union leadership.” But Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, warned on the same programme that unions could be “shooting themselves in the foot” by opting for industrial action over the festive season. “There needs to be a wake-up call about the impact on hard-working people trying to get to work or go on holiday,” she said. The prime minister, Theresa May, is reportedly facing calls from Conservative colleagues to crack down on industrial action, but Abbott said she would oppose any plans to limit the right to strike. Industrial action by conductors in the RMT union on the Southern rail franchise are expected to bring a second week of havoc to 300,000 passengers between London and the south coast, with further strikes planned for next month. The move follows industrial action by the drivers’ union Aslef last week that entirely shut down the network for three days. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are also facing walkouts over Christmas. There will be talks on Tuesday between the airport services company Swissport and Unite, aimed at averting a 48-hour strike due to start on Friday by 1,500 baggage handlers and other airport staff in a dispute over pay. Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, welcomed Swissport’s decision to seek mediation. “This is a clearly a positive development. We are pleased that the company will sit down with us in an effort to resolve this dispute,” he said. “We are confident that our members’ case is extremely strong and that fairness will prevail.” The Post Office is facing possible shutdowns of branches as members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) strike in a pay dispute. The former cabinet ministers Lord Heseltine and Lord Tebbit were among the Tory figures quoted in the Sunday Telegraph who called on May to take a tough line on trade unions. Heseltine said: “You cannot have small groups of people holding society to ransom, regardless of personal inconvenience or cost.” The paper reported that about 20 MPs had called on the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to take action against strikes. MPs in seats across Southern’s network have faced angry demands for action from their constituencies, although the Department for Transport has declined to get involved in the long-running dispute between Southern’s operator, Govia Thameslink Railways (GTR), and Aslef and the RMT. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, was forced to deny that the union was part of a “Trot conspiracy” after the Sunday Times published a video showing the RMT union president, Sean Hoyle, at a rally saying trade unions were working together to “bring down this bloody working-class-hating Tory government”. Cash said: “We are a serious trade union dealing with serious issues around safety on the railways. That is our absolute priority. RMT is not party to any Trot conspiracy to bring down government.” RMT has spent months locked in a bitter dispute with GTR over the company’s plans to introduce driver-only trains, which would allow some services to run without a second staff member on board. The company says this would reduce delays and cancellations when a second staff member is not available, but the union says it poses a safety risk. Aslef has joined the row, striking for three days last week and entirely shutting down the Southern network. On Friday, its general secretary, Mick Whelan, wrote to members that talks at the mediation service Acas had been unsuccessful, and “at no time during the course of discussions did the company make any kind of formal offer” to end the dispute. A GTR spokeswoman said no further talks were planned but “our door remains open”. The RMT begins two days of strikes on Monday, while Aslef continues to enforce an overtime ban. GTR’s passenger services director, Angie Doll, said: “We know this is a busy time for passengers, and we are truly sorry that this damaging industrial action is making life even harder.” Speaking on Murnaghan, Abbott said Southern had been a catastrophe, adding: “We need to take that franchise away from Southern and give it to the mayor of London.” Talks aimed at averting strikes by some British Airways and airport ground staff are planned for next week. A BA spokeswoman said the company would announce plans to minimise disruption to passengers if a 48-hour strike by some cabin crew due to start on Christmas Day goes ahead. The company has approached Acas for mediation talks with the Unite union, the spokeswoman said. On Friday, Virgin Atlantic pilots in the Professional Pilots’ Union voted for action short of a strike starting on 23 December and continuing indefinitely, in a row over union recognition. Pilots will work strictly to their contracts, with the removal of “pilot goodwill” which could lead to some flight disruption. The Royal Mail has said it does not anticipate trouble for postal services in the run-up to Christmas despite a planned strike on Monday, Tuesday and Saturday by Post Office staff belonging to the CWU. A spokeswoman for the Post Office said the strike would only affect the 300 branches it directly manages, as the majority of the country’s 11,000 branches are managed through franchise arrangements. A previous strike in early December led to fewer than 100 branch closures, she added."
2016-12-18T14:34:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland's first minister faces vote of no confidence,"A vote of no confidence will be held in the Northern Ireland assembly, which could force the region’s first minister to step down and trigger fresh elections to the devolved parliament in Belfast. The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) has won cross-party support for its motion censuring Arlene Foster over allegations about a scandal that is estimated will cost taxpayers £400m. The main opposition parties – the Ulster Unionists, the Greens, Traditional Unionist Voice and the leftwing People Before Profit – are backing the SDLP’s move to exclude Foster from the highest office in the province. This latest crisis to imperil the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is related to the Renewable Heat Incentive, a scheme set up in November 2012 to encourage the consumption of heat from renewable sources in the region. It offered financial incentives to farms, businesses and other non-domestic consumers to use biomass boilers that mostly burned wood pellets, as well as solar thermal and heat pumps. A whistleblower alleged in February this year that the scheme was being abused and that one farmer had made £1m out of renting an empty shed. Northern Ireland’s auditor general, Kieran Donnelly, concluded this summer that there was “no upper limit on the amount of energy that would be paid for”. “The more heat that is generated, the more is paid,” he said. Last week, former Stormont minister Jonathan Bell accused fellow members of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) of delaying the closure of the controversial scheme. Bell also alleged that DUP advisers had tried to “cleanse the record” of any links between Foster and the decision-making process that led to the RHI scheme’s creation. Foster has apologised for not ensuring there was a cap on the millions being paid out to those who took up the scheme and made considerable profits from it. The DUP MP for Lagan Valley, Jeffrey Donaldson, confirmed on Sunday that Bell has been suspended from the party over his allegations. Donaldson said: “If you look at the DUP rules, Jonathan did not seek permission for the interview that he did. “He did not tell the party in advance what he was doing and that’s not the way that most political parties operate.” The leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, said the allegations of very serious wrongdoing were “the biggest public finance scandal in the history of devolution”. Eastwood said: “Parties from across the political spectrum have now rallied to sign the motion to exclude Arlene Foster for a period of six months while a full investigation can take place. It is our view that this should take the form of a robust and independent public inquiry. There can be no hiding place for any individual or any piece of evidence relevant to this fiasco that will cost taxpayers who haven’t even been born yet millions of pounds.” The focus on Monday will be fixed on what Sinn Féin will do when the vote is called. The Republican party is the DUP’s only partner in the power-sharing government at Stormont. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Féin deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has suggested that Foster should step down while an independent inquiry is held into what has been called the “cash for ash scandal”. The DUP is insisting that Foster is “going nowhere”, and only Sinn Féin supporting the vote of no confidence, and possibly McGuinness resigning as deputy first minister, would lead to the dissolution of the current parliament and a fresh election early in the new year."
2016-12-18T15:16:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Girl offers to replace Big Ben's bongs during upcoming renovation,"Eight-year-old Phoebe Hanson, a devoted listener to BBC Radio 4, was horrified to hear the bongs of Big Ben were going to stop next year while the clock was repaired, and wrote to the PM programme volunteering to provide a replacement. In a letter to Roger Sawyer, the show’s editor, Phoebe offered to hum the chimes and play an instrument for the bongs, recording everything on a microphone that she would bring to the studio.Sawyer responded, admitting that “some of the cleverest and most important people at BBC are scratching their heads wondering what to do,” but gently suggesting that Phoebe wasn’t perhaps aware of what an arduous task hers would be. He was much taken with her suggestion and would pass it on, he said, but added: “As you know, the bongs are live … and the beginning of the Westminster Chimes is always at a slightly different time. It depends on things like temperature and atmospheric pressure and stuff like that.”
“So it would be quite a task for you, doing the bongs: you’d have to rush in after school each day (and at the weekend), rush home for tea, homework, a bit of chillin’, then a quick sleep. And then – here’s the hard bit – you’d have to rush back in again at midnight because there are live bongs again before the midnight news. That’s an awful lot of work for someone who is still quite young. I know I wouldn’t like to do all that.” He signed off : “I’m very impressed that you listen to Radio 4. I wish my two children did. Have a spiffing Christmas and a stupendous and lucky 2017.” Her father, Jon Hanson, told BBC news: “She was listening to Radio 4 in the car and Eddie Mair was saying that Big Ben would stop chiming next year, and she said, ‘Oh no, we have to do something about it. I want to write a letter.’ She takes things very literally as she is on the autism spectrum, so I think she still wants to do the bongs.” The clock that drives Big Ben’s chimes is 157 years old, and will have to be stopped next year for several months at least, for £29m worth of repair work. Renovation work is also overdue on the 96-metre Elizabeth Tower that houses it. When the chimes last fell silent in 2007, Radio 4 substituted them with a birdsong, which was favourably received by most listeners. “Then the people behind Tweet of the Day stole our idea ... so we can’t do that again,” Sawyer said. Phoebe’s father posted the story and the letter on his Facebook page, which has since received over 14,000 likes. Hanson told the BBC: “I’m very proud of her. I work in IT and we try to increase our internet presence, but then she has stepped in and done it in one fell swoop.”"
2016-12-19T05:30:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Icy Wastwater is a world of adventure,"Seabirds swoop over the three divers standing chest-deep in Wastwater, adjusting their masks. A fourth hoists a garden gnome dressed as Santa from his pickup. “Is he diving?” I call. Apparently he is. “There’s a gnome community about 150ft down. Maybe 15, with a table plus Christmas tree with baubles.” “Can I make out shapes from here?” The diver shakes his neoprene-hooded head. “Pitch-black deep in Wastwater, pal.” On the ice-rimmed pebble shore a coughing sheep moves aside as the diver stoops to strap on rubber fins before joining his companions in the water. They buddy-check each other’s equipment, then disappear under the surface of England’s deepest lake. Forty minutes later, at Wastwater’s north-eastern end, I see another four adventurous souls embarking from a van, loaded up with trekking poles, ropes, ice axes and crampons. Their goal is the ice-tinselled buttresses topping Scafell. First, however, they must tackle lower slopes striped black and white with streaks of snow. Overhead, ravens perform mid-air tumbling tricks.
I pause and pull from my rucksack Nowt But a Fleein’ Thing, a book recently published by the Fell and Rock Climbing Club. Mostly photographed and written by Barrow craggie Al Phizacklea, with research by fellow climber Mike Cocker, this covers the 200-year history of rock climbing on Scafell. Coleridge’s Broad Stand descent (1802), Siegfried Herford’s Central Buttress ascent (1914), local hero Dave Birkett’s super-routes: there are diagrams and maps for these and many other climbs. Resting this magnificent volume on a boulder, I turn pages to better suss out scale. Across the dale head, sunbeams highlight Great Gable’s barcoded hillside like a supermarket scanner at work. “Nowt but a fleein’ thing cud git up t’crags on t’Wasdale Head side,” said the innkeeper Will Ritson, when told of the ascent of Scafell Crag in 1847. Nearby a shepherd is imploring a collie to “Gitawayoot!” and round up stray Herdwicks in the same broad Cumbrian, rooted in the Old English of the Anglo Saxons. “Tak care, ol’ fella,” I can hear Ritson warning me. “Divn’t drop yon beeuk on thi feutt.” Phizacklea’s book weighs half a stone."
2016-12-19T06:05:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK cluster bombs used in Yemen by Saudi Arabia, finds research","The British defence secretary Michael Fallon has seen government analysis indicating that UK-made cluster munitions were used by the Saudi-led coalition in the current conflict in Yemen, sources have told the Guardian. It is understood the government’s own investigations back up media reports that such cluster bombs have been deployed in the war, in which Britain is helping to train Saudi forces. A source told the Guardian that Fallon is among the ministers to have known about the analysis for about a month. But it is understood ministers have still not been given definitive confirmation one way or the other by Saudi Arabia, which has publicly denied the allegations and claimed that UK-made cluster bombs found are the relics of old conflicts. The revelation is likely to increase calls on the government to reconsider exports of arms to Saudi Arabia, which have already grown since the US suspended a planned sale of precision-guided munitions last week.
A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting a Houthi rebel uprising against the Yemeni government since 2015, with Britain providing some military training assistance. Establishing the truth is important because the UK is a signatory to a 2010 international treaty banning the use of cluster munitions. The weapons leave mini-bomblets that can explode much later, killing civilians. The Cluster Munitions Convention commits the UK to disposing of all cluster munitions and working to prevent their use by anyone else. Saudi Arabia is not a signatory. A senior defence source said the issue of UK-made cluster munitions was “something that has been raised at the highest possible levels and we have been trying to establish definitively for some time”. The Ministry of Defence would not reveal the contents of the analysis but a government spokesman said: “The government takes such allegations very seriously. We have analysed the case carefully using all available information, considering all possibilities, and raised the issue with the Saudi-led coalition.” Reports from ITV, Sky News and Amnesty International have all pointed to bombs made in the UK and exported before the ban having been dropped in the ongoing war. Philip Hammond, then the foreign secretary, pledged in May that the Ministry of Defence would investigate fully and seek concrete assurances from Saudi Arabia that there has been no use in the current conflict of British-made cluster munitions. At that time, ministers said the government does not possess any evidence that such weapons have been deployed, and suggested that the bomb found by Amnesty International could have been from a previous conflict in the region, adding that the last supply of this weapon to the Saudis was in 1989. Since then, further footage has been published by ITV and Sky, showing the leader of the rebel Houthi government, Abdulaziz bin Habtour, accusing Britain of war crimes. “They have sold cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia,” he told Sky News earlier this month. “They know the Saudis are going to drop them on Yemen ... in Sa’dah and in Sana’a and other provinces.I don’t think they are guilty of war crimes, I believe so. They are participating in the bombing of Yemen’s people.” Concerns about the Saudi military using weapons in Yemen that have been exported from the UK have been repeatedly raised in prime minister’s questions by Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster. Robertson said: “I too have heard from informed sources about the Saudis dropping UK-made cluster munitions in Yemen. It is totally unacceptable and piles pressure on the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office to come clean. The US has now stopped supplying Saudi with guided missiles and it’s high time for the UK to adopt an ethical approach.” When it was raised last week at prime minister’s questions by Robertson, Theresa May told the House of Commons that any allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law would be “properly investigated”. She also defended the UK’s support for Saudi Arabia, saying the intervention in Yemen is backed by the United Nations and “the security of the Gulf is important to us”. She added “the intelligence we get from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives here in the UK”.
Earlier this month, No 10 delivered a rebuke to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, for critical remarks at a conference saying that Saudi Arabia was engaged in puppeteering and proxy wars in the Gulf. Downing Street said that was not the official government position. The UK is a firm ally of Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, with British military personnel helping train its troops to how to target bombs. Britain has also sold billions of pounds in defence equipment including planes to the Saudi military since the start of the war. Last week, Tobias Ellwood, a Foreign Office minister, revealed he had formally urged all six Gulf states to sign up to the international convention banning the use of cluster munitions. He said Britain condemned the weapons’ use and that he had personally told the six Gulf foreign ministers that they should sign up to the treaty. “I absolutely condemn the use of cluster munitions,” he said. “They lie around the battlefield until it turns into a civilian arena, and that is why they cause damage.” Ellwood also said he would support an independent inquiry into war crimes by both sides in the Yemen civil war if the Saudi’s own inquiry proved unsatisfactory."
2016-12-19T07:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Downing Street distances itself from Grayling calls for anti-strike laws,"Downing Street has distanced itself from calls by the transport minister, Chris Grayling, and Tory backbenchers for new anti-strike laws as unions plan a wave of industrial action this week and over the festive period.
A spokesman for No 10 said the laws governing industrial action cannot be changed to halt current disputes, which are a matter for unions and employers. Grayling angered many union leaders last week by saying he would “not rule anything out” when asked if he might change the law to prevent future rail strikes. Former cabinet ministers Lord Heseltine and Lord Tebbit are among the Tory figures who have called on Theresa May to take a tough line on trade unions. A Downing Street source said there were no plans to change current union laws, which remain under review. “Any changes to union laws would not be able to solve the current disputes. They will be solved by mediation and we would urge the unions to get round the table. “In this parliament, we have already passed legislation to provide people with better protection from undemocratic industrial action. Of course, we will keep under review how these measures are working in practice,” the source said. Industrial action by conductors in the RMT union on the Southern rail franchise – coupled with a continuing ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union – is expected to bring a second week of havoc to 300,000 passengers between London and the south coast on Monday and Tuesday. The RMT strikes are part of a long-running dispute over the role of conductors, with further walk-outs planned for next month. Aslef has joined the RMT dispute, striking for three days last week and entirely shutting down the Southern network. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are also facing walkouts over Christmas. Talks aimed at averting strikes by British Airways cabin crew over Christmas will be held at Acas on Monday. Members of Unite are due to walk out on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. There will be talks on Tuesday between the airport services company Swissport and Unite, aimed at averting a 48-hour strike due to start on Friday by 1,500 baggage handlers and other airport staff in a dispute over pay. The Post Office is facing possible shutdowns of branches as members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) strike in a pay dispute. Last week, Grayling told the BBC that he would look at all options to stop rail unions from striking, and while he wasn’t “ruling anything in” he wasn’t “ruling anything out” either. Heseltine told the Sunday Telegraph: “You cannot have small groups of people holding society to ransom, regardless of personal inconvenience or cost.” It was reported that about 20 MPs had called on Grayling to take action against strikes. MPs in seats across Southern’s network have faced angry demands for action from their constituencies, although the Department for Transport has declined to get involved in the long-running dispute between Southern’s operator, Govia Thameslink Railways (GTR), and Aslef and the RMT. Labour MPs, however, appear to be split over how to approach the dispute. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has defended unions planning to strike. “Of course these strikes are going to be very disastrous if they all go ahead for the public over Christmas, but people do have a legal right to strike,” Abbott told the Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan on Sunday. She added: “It’s not my role to second-guess the decisions of trade union leadership.” But Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, warned on the same programme that unions could be “shooting themselves in the foot” by opting for industrial action over the festive season. “There needs to be a wake-up call about the impact on hard-working people trying to get to work or go on holiday,” she said. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, was forced to deny that the union was part of a “Trot conspiracy” after the Sunday Times published a video showing the RMT union president, Sean Hoyle, at a rally saying trade unions were working together to “bring down this bloody working-class-hating Tory government”. Cash said: “We are a serious trade union dealing with serious issues around safety on the railways. That is our absolute priority. RMT is not party to any Trot conspiracy to bring down government.” RMT has spent months locked in a bitter dispute with GTR over the company’s plans to introduce driver-only trains, which would allow some services to run without a second staff member on board. The company says this would reduce delays and cancellations when a second staff member is not available. The union says it would pose a safety risk. On Friday Aslef’s general secretary, Mick Whelan, wrote to members that talks at mediation service Acas had been unsuccessful, and “at no time during the course of discussions did the company make any kind of formal offer” to end the dispute. A GTR spokeswoman said no further talks were planned but “our door remains open”. The Royal Mail has said it does not anticipate trouble for postal services in the run-up to Christmas despite a planned strike on Monday, Tuesday and Saturday by Post Office staff belonging to the CWU. A spokeswoman for the Post Office said the strike would only affect the 300 branches it directly manages, as the majority of the country’s 11,000 branches are managed through franchise arrangements."
2016-12-19T10:08:34Z,uk-news,UK news,"Wave of UK strikes could bring chaos to railways, airports and post offices","A wave of industrial action over pay and safety standards is expected to bring widespread disruption to the railways, airports and post offices over the Christmas period. More than 3,000 Post Office workers were taking industrial action on Monday in a dispute over proposed branch closures and pay. On Southern rail staff are continuing their dispute with the train operator over the role of guards, bringing disruption to about 300,000 passengers.
Meanwhile, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic face industrial action over Christmas. Talks aimed at averting strikes by British Airways cabin crew over Christmas will be held at Acas on Monday, but unless a deal is reached, members of Unite are due to strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. Conservative MPs have criticised the strikes as “politically motivated”, calling for tougher laws to make it harder for staff to take action. But Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, dismissed the suggestion, saying the UK already had some of the most draconian anti-union laws in the western world. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she added: “Some MPs seem to be calling for even more draconian laws against trade unions ... most people agree striking is the last resort; we don’t want to do that, we want a fair agreement but the right to strike is a fundamental British liberty that the vast majority of the public support.” O’Grady said working people in the UK were worse off than before the financial crisis and they were demanding a fair deal from their employers. “These disputes are all different but we are working in a background where workers are still £20 a week worse off than before the financial crash, we have had pay cuts come in, we have had the rise of zero-hours contracts and sham self employment.” She said unions successfully negotiated and settled “thousands of deals” every year without resorting to strike action, adding: “I think perhaps you should be focusing on what is wrong with these companies that we are ending up in a situation of a dispute. ” Unions say that Monday’s strike by Post Office workers will involve about 3,500 workers taking industrial action over branch closures, jobs and pensions. The CWU said hundreds of crown post offices would be hit However, Mark Davies, the head of communication at the Post Office, told the Today programme that the vast majority of customers would not be affected. “The message today to customers of the Post Office service going out to post Christmas letters and parcels is that it will be business as usual. This very regrettable strike action will have a minimal impact on customers.” The CWU general secretary, Dave Ward, has accused managers of rejecting a peace offer and warned of a continuing closure programme that would mean the Post Office would cease to exist on high streets. It is thought the impact of the strike might be exacerbated by Royal Mail staff refusing to cross picket lines to collect mail from post offices. A Royal Mail spokesman said: “There will be little or no impact on Royal Mail as a result of the CWU strike at the Post Office. Deliveries will carry on as normal and the last posting dates for Christmas remain unchanged.” Our 120,000 Royal Mail frontline colleagues are not involved in the Post Office dispute. “Post Office limited has over 11,000 branches which will continue to operate as normal. Customers who need to post at a Post Office should use these branches. “Royal Mail customers will also continue to have access to Royal Mail services including pre-paid parcel drop- off through over 1,200 Customer Service Points at Delivery Offices nationwide.” Meanwhile, the strike by conductors in the RMT union on the Southern rail franchise – coupled with a continuing ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union – is expected to bring a second week of havoc to 300,000 passengers between London and the south coast on Monday and Tuesday. The RMT strikes are part of a long-running dispute over the role of conductors, with further walkouts planned for next month.

2016-12-19T10:12:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds of thousands of fish wash up on Cornish beach,"The shingle of one of the most picturesque beaches in Cornwall, Marazion at St Michael’s Mount, was covered in hundreds of thousands of dead fish at the weekend, the second time this month there has been a mass beaching of fish. Katrina Slack, who visited the beach on Sunday intending to photograph flocks of starlings, instead witnessed an extraordinary sight, shoals of dead fish. She told the Plymouth Herald: “The first thing I came across was a dolphin already decomposing and as I approached the shoreline, I was astonished. It was almost as if the waves were made up of thousands of shimmering fish. “The closer I got I realised the beach was just covered in dead fish and more and more were coming in with every wave. It was a horrible but breathtaking scene.” A fortnight ago the same eerie sight was witnessed on another beach, Pentewan at St Austell. Bad weather further out to sea, attempts by the fish – mostly mackerel and pilchard – to escape large predators, or dumping by trawlers that have exceeded their quotas have been suggested as possible explanations. Dog walkers and other witnesses at both incidents said the fish were quite fresh and not smelly, though flocks of gulls soon arrived to take advantage of the feast. James Wright, an expert at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, believes the fish washed up alive. He told the BBC such strandings were more common in summer, when mackerel follow prey into warmer, shallower water. “It’s quite unusual for fish to want to leave the water, it’s usually a result of panic, because of a predator, but at this time of year that would be unusual.” He suggested the weather could be a factor: “It is possible they were all caught in particularly bad weather when they were near the surface and washed up by the waves.”"
2016-12-19T11:33:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office pilots one-day immigration application scheme,"The Home Office is piloting a one-day only system for immigration applications that could eventually be rolled out for EU citizens living in the UK who could lose their right to residence in the country after Brexit. It is trialling the scheme with a small number of corporate clients, according to City sources. PwC, which is taking part in the pilot, says it will allow applicants and their dependents to “check in” their passports and have them assessed and returned immediately. Until recently, applicants had to physically hand over their passports for up to six months, curtailing their ability to travel for work or personal reasons. During the summer a pilot scheme for an “online check-in” of passports was launched, but this was only for individuals. Monday’s pilot allows an individual to check in passports for their entire family. The 3 Million, a grassroots group lobbying for the rights of EU citizens, has criticised the cumbersome process for permanent residency, which involves an 85-page application form and complicated diary of movements in and out of the country. It has also pointed out that residency systems in other EU countries are much more user-friendly and less designed to “catch out” illegal immigrants. The 3 Million has estimated that at the current rate of processing it would take the Home Office 47 years to deal with applications for permanent residency from all EU citizens living in the UK. Lawyer Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global immigration at PwC, confirmed the consultancy had a number of clients taking part in the trial. She said that although the government had not yet indicated how it would treat the 3 million EU citizens living in the UK before the referendum, clients were getting “very worried” about their staff and future recruitment because of the uncertainty. “As we are approaching the triggering of article 50, employers are very worried about their EU staff and people are making choices about not going to work in the UK,” said Onslow-Cole. She said at a previous Brexit briefing for the media that some senior executives were deciding “not to take that post in London but to take the one in New York” because of the uncertainty. The Home Office said Monday’s pilot was “a small test” and was part of a modernisation programme launched before the referendum. The government has been accused of planing to use EU citizens as “bargaining chips” in the Brexit negotiations. The Joint Committee on Human Rights and a House of Lords select committee has urged Theresa May to secure the status of EU citizens living in the UK at the start of the article 50 negotiations. Onslow-Cole said that although EU citizens did not legally have to make the application for permanent residency, it was “a wise precaution” as acquired rights, including the right to remain in the country, would “be in the ether” after Brexit."
2016-12-19T11:42:34Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK strikes at a glance: why, where and when is action taking place?","Railways Union: RMT Company: Southern rail Reason: Ongoing dispute over safety on the railways and the role of guards. How many workers: 320 guards were balloted. Other staff may join the action. When: Monday and Tuesday this week with further action planned for the new year, when the drivers’ union Aslef is due to strike. Impact: Disruption across the Southern rail network is likely to be less severe than last week as drivers are not striking. However, the dispute will mean further misery for the 300,000 daily passengers travelling between London and the south coast. Post Office Union: CWU Company: Post Office Reason: Closure or outsourcing of up to 300 crown post offices – some of the bigger high street branches as well a dispute over pay and pensions. How many workers: CWU said around 3,500 staff would be involved. When: On Monday, Tuesday and Saturday Post Office counter staff will on strike. On Thursday and Friday supply chain members who deliver cash to post offices will take action. Impact: Action will be focused on 300 of more than 11,000 post offices across the country and bosses say the effect for customers will be minimal. However, these crown post offices are often the bigger high street outlets and if Royal Mail staff such as postal workers refuse to cross picket lines the impact could be more extensive.
Cabin crew Union: Unite Company: British Airways Reason: Union says crew on mixed fleets – those who operate on both short- and long-haul flights – are being paid less than those on other flights, leading some to take second jobs to make ends meet. How many workers: BA employs around 16,000 cabin crew. When: Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Impact: Both sides are at Acas on Monday and there are hopes of a settlement. If the strike goes ahead it is likely to have a widespread impact on hundreds of BA flights. Baggage handlers Union: Unite Company: Swissport Reason: Long running dispute over pay. How many workers: 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew. When: 23 and 24 December. Impact: Airports including Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, Luton, Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Bournemouth, Cardiff, Doncaster, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds/Bradford, Manchester, Newcastle and Southampton will be affected. Pilots Union: Professional Pilots’ Union (PPU) Company: Virgin Atlantic Reason: Dispute over whether the company recognises the union. How many workers: PPU represents the majority of Virgin pilots. When: “Pilot goodwill” will be removed from 23 December. Impact: PPU said some flights would be cancelled. Virgin said it did not expect flights to be affected."

2016-12-19T12:07:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Crossrail documents reveal fears over welfare of workers,"Workers on one of the UK’s biggest construction projects have faced volatile, overcrowded conditions and been “physically and mentally” exhausted, according to internal documents seen by the Guardian. An email chain between one of the main contractors on the Crossrail project and Crossrail bosses appears to acknowledge the extent of the problems facing workers in the tunnel, highlighting a “lack of/no welfare in the tunnel” and describing the staff as “exhausted physically and mentally”. Other messages seen by the Guardian appear to suggest that Crossrail was monitoring a protest about workers’ welfare. The revelations are the latest in a string of claims of poor welfare standards to have dogged the high-speed rail line that will run under London and is due to open in 2018. Earlier this month, the Health and Safety Executive announced it was prosecuting three other contractors over alleged breaches of safety, and last month a group of MPs lodged an early-day motion in parliament stating they were “deeply concerned” about “rapidly deteriorating industrial relations”. The internal emails, released under freedom of information legislation to the building union Ucatt, were sent in September between the ATC consortium, which is running the tunnelling refit on the project, and Crossrail. The names of the senders and recipients are redacted, but some identifying details remain. One email from the ATC consortium’s employee industrial relations manager, dated 27 September, begins: “Dear All, Notes and action plan from my visit to Fisher Street”, one of Crossrail’s central London locations. It states there was only “one turnstile used for entering and exiting site” creating delays of 20 minutes leading to a “volatile environment with overcrowding/cramped conditions”. It goes on to describe a “lack of/no welfare in tunnel”, and “no toilets in the tunnel this morning and no communication to workforce” with “2 miles walking to the toilet”. It adds “current mood one [sic] site - Workforce are exhausted physically and mentally”. Jerry Swain, regional secretary for Ucatt’s London and south-east region, said: “Our members have told us that they are working until they are physically exhausted and have to undertake tasks which are beyond their skill levels. This would be disgusting on any project but this is the flagship public sector project in London. It’s seems, because the workers are underground their health and welfare is out of mind.” ATC pointed out the issues raised in the emails date back to September and said they had now been addressed. A spokesperson added that the consortium was “working with Crossrail to ensure that we provide a safe working environment, with appropriate welfare facilities for our staff”. “This is a priority for us. We are working on a complex engineering and construction project which, at times, presents logistical constraints and challenges. Through an open dialogue with colleagues we have taken action to address and resolve challenges as they have arisen.” A spokesperson for Crossrail said it required all its contractors to adhere to UK health and safety legislation, adding all its sites “have welfare and toilet facilities which includes the provision of chemical toilets below ground where required”. But last month’s early-day motion suggested there were ongoing problems. Dated 22 November and signed by 12 MPs, it stated: “This house is deeply concerned with rapidly deteriorating industrial relations” on the project. It highlighted “totally substandard welfare facilities, with workers having to walk miles to go to the toilet” and expressed alarm “that workers have reported being required to work until they are physically exhausted and to undertake tasks which are beyond them”. Other emails obtained by Ucatt appear to suggest that Crossrail was monitoring a protest about workers’ welfare on 29 September . Under freedom of information legislation the union asked for “any reports, photos or instructions which were recorded and distributed … by Crossrail” relating to the demonstration. The subsequent email chain includes regular updates from someone apparently at the protest. An email with subheading “6am update” states: “All - no sign of any protest at the moment.” Another titled “6.30am update” reads: “Around five people have arrived with handheld banners and one standup banner.” Another at 7am states “numbers increased to 15” and has a photograph of the demonstration attached. Later that day another email starts: “All Quick summary of today’s demonstration at Fisher Street site.” It states: “Demonstrators mostly Ucatt officers convenors etc. However two representatives of the Unite rank and file also appear to have attended” with an accompanying picture taken from the Unite the Resistance Twitter account. The address and details on the emails are redacted. The construction industry has been dogged by accusations of blacklisting, where workers are penalised for raising welfare concerns, their political beliefs or being active in a trade union, for years. Earlier this year, leading construction firms formally apologised to hundreds of trade unionists for putting them on an illegal blacklist and denying them work, agreeing to pay sums understood to total about £75m to 771 blacklisted workers. In their early-day motion, the MPs expressed concern that “following peaceful and orderly demonstrations management have undertaken covert surveillance and recording of workers, which raises concerns about blacklisting and is in breach of data protection laws”. Crossrail did not respond when the Guardian raised the matter. Ucatt said the blacklisting scandal “still casts a long shadow over the industry”."
2016-12-19T13:01:02Z,uk-news,UK news,No 10 accuses striking workers of 'contempt for ordinary people',"Downing Street has accused rail, postal and airline workers going on strike of causing “untold misery” and showing “contempt for ordinary people”. Theresa May’s deputy official spokesman condemned the walkouts in the run-up to Christmas in unusually strong terms on Monday morning, saying the disruption they will cause was “massively unwarranted”. He suggested the prime minister would not be prioritising further strike laws demanded by some Conservative MPs but refused to rule this out as a possibility if the industrial action gets worse. Asked about the strikes affecting Southern rail, the Royal Mail and British Airways, he said: “What the prime minister thinks is that the strikes are wrong and that they are causing untold misery to hundreds of thousands of people. “There are hundreds of thousands of people having their lives disrupted on a massively unwarranted scale by these strikes … If [these strikes] have anything in common, it is shared contempt for ordinary people trying to go about their daily lives … [The unions’] actions are clearly designed to bring about maximum damage and disruption during the festive period.”
Former cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine and Norman Tebbit are among senior Tory figures who have called on May to take a tough line on trade unions following the wave of strikes and threatened walkouts. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “The government should be looking at positive ways to resolve disputes, not demonising working men and women who only consider strike action as the very last resort. “I have never encountered a worker who wants to strike. When they have to take industrial action it is an expression of frustration at not being heard by employers. “I urge the government to concentrate more on understanding why industrial relations break down, not slinging around threats to remove fundamental freedoms.” Industrial action by conductors in the RMT union on the Southern rail franchise – coupled with a continuing ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union – is expected to bring a second week of havoc to 300,000 passengers between London and the south coast on Monday and Tuesday. The RMT strikes are part of a long-running dispute over the role of conductors, with further walkouts planned for next month. Aslef has joined the RMT dispute, striking for three days last week and entirely shutting down the Southern network. BA and Virgin Atlantic also face walkouts over Christmas. Talks aimed at averting strikes by BA cabin crew will be held at Acas on Monday. Members of Unite are due to walk out on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. BA said it intended to run a full service on both days despite the strikes. Alex Cruz, the British Airways chief executive and chairman, said: “We are making sure that this attempt to ruin Christmas for thousands of our customers fails. Over the weekend we have been working on detailed contingency plans to ensure that we are able to operate our normal flight programme from all our airports on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day.” Cruz said the strike call was causing anxiety among BA’s mixed fleet cabin crew. He said they were seeking to improve the compensation package for mixed fleet cabin crew, who earn a minimum of £21,000 a year for full time work. There will be talks on Tuesday between the airport services company Swissport and Unite, aimed at averting a 48-hour strike by 1,500 baggage handlers and other airport staff in a dispute over pay, due to start on Friday. The Post Office is facing possible shutdowns of branches as members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) strike in a pay dispute. Last week, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told the BBC that he would look at all options to stop rail unions from striking, and while he was not “ruling anything in” he wasn’t “ruling anything out” either. Lord Heseltine, meanwhile, told the Sunday Telegraph: “You cannot have small groups of people holding society to ransom, regardless of personal inconvenience or cost. It was reported that about 20 MPs had called on Grayling to take action against strikes. MPs in seats across Southern’s network have faced angry demands for action from their constituents, although the Department for Transport has declined to get involved in the dispute between Southern’s operator, Govia Thameslink Railways (GTR), and the unions. Labour MPs also appeared to be split over how to handle the dispute. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has defended unions planning to strike. “Of course these strikes are going to be very disastrous if they all go ahead for the public over Christmas, but people do have a legal right to strike,” Abbott told the Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan on Sunday. She added: “It’s not my role to second-guess the decisions of trade union leadership.” But Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said on the same programme that unions could be shooting themselves in the foot by opting for industrial action over the festive season. “There needs to be a wakeup call about the impact on hardworking people trying to get to work or go on holiday,” she said. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, was forced to deny that the union was part of a “Trot conspiracy” after the Sunday Times published a video showing the RMT union president, Sean Hoyle, at a rally saying trade unions were working together to “bring down this bloody working-class-hating Tory government”. Cash said: “We are a serious trade union dealing with serious issues around safety on the railways. That is our absolute priority. RMT is not party to any Trot conspiracy to bring down government.”"
2016-12-19T13:29:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Killer of Nicola Cross to be held indefinitely in secure hospital,"A man who broke into a family home and stabbed a mother of two to death while she was on the phone to her husband has been given an indefinite hospital order. Nicola Cross, 37, was killed defending her two small children on the night of 14 September 2015 while her husband was away on business. The terrified mother phoned her husband, Dan, after Marcin Porczyński, a car mechanic who lived a few streets away, smashed his way into the house at about 11.30pm in a psychotic state. Last Friday at St Albans crown court he pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. It emerged during the police investigation that he had paranoid schizophrenia and had been hearing voices telling him to save children who were being starved. After killing Cross, 37, he tried to take her two young children away from the house in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. On Monday, Judge Andrew Bright QC ordered that Porczyński should be detained at Rampton secure hospital in Nottinghamshire under a hospital order with a restriction without limit of time. Cross’s husband was in court to hear the judge tell Porczyński: “The circumstances in which you killed Nicola Cross were utterly horrific and senseless and represent the worst possible nightmare of every husband and parent. “You have devastated the lives of the Cross family and left two young children to grow up without the wonderful mother who so loved and cared for them. “Those responsible for deciding if and when you should ever be released back into the community will need to look long and hard at the full circumstances of the dreadful killing which your mental illness led you to commit. “The paramount consideration which must govern any decision about your release must be the safety of the public. “You must not be released until those responsible for your care and treatment are completely satisfied that you no longer pose a danger and that you will be subject to qualified medical supervision which will be sufficient to ensure the safety of the public in whichever country you may choose to live.”
On Friday, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told the court that Porczyński needed medication for the rest of his life. He may wish to return to Poland but there would need to be assurances that he remained on medication so he did not lapse into psychosis and pose a danger to the public, whether in Poland, in the UK, or any other country in future. The judge told Porczyński, who appeared via a video link from Rampton: “As you were breaking in, Nicola Cross was on the phone to her husband, Daniel. Although Nicola Cross tried to reason with you and heroically did her best to protect herself and her two young children from you, she was completely defenceless against the vicious knife attack you launched upon her.” Bright said “no one could fail to be deeply moved” by the victim impact statements of Daniel Cross, Nicola Cross’s mother and her sister and “the account they give of the devastating effect which her death had upon each of them and upon the two young children she left behind”. He said: “It is plainly necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to impose a restriction order because there is currently a serious risk that you would commit further offences if set at large.”"
2016-12-19T15:41:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Sudanese children stage protest in France as UK rejects asylum claims,"Sudanese children staying in France who have had their applications for asylum rejected by the UK have staged a demonstration to mark their anger at the Home Office’s decision. The teenagers, who had previously been dispersed from Calais and are staying at a centre in Biscarrosse in south-west France, tried to get into the town centre to launch their protest but were prevented from doing so by the police. They received the news that the UK Home Office had rejected their claims on Friday. After the police intervention they demonstrated close to their accommodation with placards saying: “Stop racism, we are locked in a cage” and “Please help us, one child wants to sucide” (sic). Another read: “This is not fair some are accepted, some are not. We all have families in the UK. This is a crime against humanity.”
There are 39 boys at the centre who have been told that they cannot come to the UK. The Home Office says that it has given them advice about how to claim asylum in France instead. One 16-year-old boy, Adam, said: “The conditions here are very bad. We managed to stop one child here from committing suicide a few days ago. After we made our protest the staff in the centre were very angry with us. We got a letter from the Home Office saying our cases have been rejected but that we can appeal. I am going to appeal.” One boy in the centre recorded an audio message appealing for help from the outside world. “This is a message to you guys if you know someone who can help us,” he said. “We don’t have any right to speak out but we are children and we need better help and better support.” Hundreds of other child asylum seekers across France who had been expecting to come to the UK were also told on Friday of the Home Office decision and given advice on making French applications. Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at the UK-based Duncan Lewis solicitors, said that the 12 children he and his team are representing were informed verbally but given no written reason for the decision, a process he described as “absolutely shocking”. The Home Office has previously said that it would prioritise under-15s from Sudan and Syria. A spokeswoman confirmed that the transfer of children previously in the Calais camp and now in French reception centres had ended. She said that more unaccompanied children were undergoing initial screening in Italy and Greece and may be brought to the UK."
2016-12-19T17:18:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman deceived by undercover officer accuses police of delaying lawsuit,"A woman who is suing police after discovering that she had a sexual relationship with an undercover officer has accused police of using a variety of delaying tactics to obstruct her legal action. The woman, known as Deborah, started legal action against police in 2012, alleging that she suffered psychiatric harm from being deceived into forming an intimate relationship with the undercover officer, who used the fake name of Marco Jacobs. Four years after the legal action began, police now say that a search through classified files for relevant information will be so complex that it will take until April and cost at least £80,000. The woman says that the delay is exacerbating the abuse she experienced from her relationship with the spy. Commenting on the police’s conduct, Deborah said: “Dragging it out is causing me more distress. I feel it’s abusive what they are doing. They know how distressed we are. It feels really cruel how they have treated us.” Jacobs spent five years infiltrating a group of anarchists in Cardiff which had about 10 regular members. The woman took legal action after investigations by the Guardian and the anarchists unmasked Jacobs in 2011. Another woman who had a sexual relationship with Jacobs, who recently settled her case, had also complained that the lawsuit had been dragged out unduly. Both women had been unaware of his real identity. During his undercover deployment, Jacobs started a relationship with Deborah while she was the girlfriend of another member of the group, Tom Fowler. She broke up with Fowler soon afterwards. Jacobs’s involvement in Deborah’s life was such that he often met her parents and attended her father’s funeral. Until recently, police refused to confirm or deny that Jacobs, who was also known as Mark, was an undercover officer and declined to answer questions about his deployment, such as what he was authorised to do and who supervised him. The police say that the search through classified files is necessary to determine which ones can be disclosed to Deborah or to Fowler, who is also taking legal action. They and the other woman who recently settled her case were told that there could be as many as 30,000 references to them in classified electronic police files. Deborah said police were claiming that they would have to pay lawyers at least £80,000 to review these electronic files and another 737 paper files - containing 25,000 pages - that were generated during Jacobs’s covert mission. Deborah, who does not have a criminal record, said she was shocked when police told her about the need to search the files. “It indicated that he was spying on every aspect of my life”, she said. “I find it shocking that my life at that point warranted that amount of surveillance. It makes me very uncomfortable that there is potentially information about very personal aspects of my life. It makes me think, what information was he gathering? How far did it go and on whom?” She questioned why the process had not begun already, adding: “It’s disgusting. They are trying to delay justice ... What happened was wrong. It should not have happened and it was abusive.” She pointed out that her legal action had yet to be concluded even though police had last year settled a lawsuit brought by seven women who had been similarly deceived into forming intimate relationships with undercover officers. In November last year, police apologised for the “abusive and manipulative” relationships and paid the seven women substantial compensation. Deborah said she was pursuing the legal action to find out why Jacobs intruded into her private life where there was no criminality and how the police believed that such intrusion was justified. She became close friends with Jacobs in 2005 after he joined the Cardiff Anarchist Network, claiming to be a truck driver. She did not know that, in reality, he was a police officer working for a secretive squad, the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, which monitored political groups. For three years, Deborah and Jacobs were friends and frequently met outside of the anarchists’ gatherings, leading her to believe that they were “kindred spirits”. In 2008, they had sex on a number of occasions and he told her he loved her. She ended her relationship with Fowler, believing that she was going to become Jacobs’s girlfriend. However Jacobs told her within weeks that he just wanted to be friends. She said: “I was devastated. I felt confused, stupid, used and lost. My self-esteem was shattered.” Jacobs disappeared in 2009, claiming to have got a job maintaining holiday villas in Corfu. Deborah said that since discovering that Jacobs “was not a real person”, she had experienced serious depression and had difficulties in her job in social care. “I feel a constant state of hopelessness and that there is a lack of purpose in my life. I feel despair and ask myself what’s the point of anything when it might not be real.” During their lawsuit, police went to court in an attempt to have the whole of the legal action struck out. More than 100 undercover officers have been deployed to spy on at least 460 political groups since 1968. Revelations about their conduct compelled Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to set up a public inquiry, led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Pitchford, into their activities. Police have also paid more than £400,000 to a woman who was profoundly traumatised after finding out by chance that an undercover officer, Bob Lambert, was the father of her son. The Metropolitan police said they remained “hopeful” that they could settle Deborah’s legal case. “An apology from all the relevant police forces is of course part of that settlement. Given the current stage no such disclosure process will be required,” they said. • If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here)."
2016-12-19T17:54:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Union leader says No 10 demonising working people in strikes row,"The government is “demonising working men and women” by accusing striking staff of having “contempt for ordinary people”, the leader of Britain’s biggest union has said.
Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, was responding to comments made by a Downing Street spokesman about walkouts by rail, air, Post Office and Weetabix workers.
Industrial action by Southern rail conductors in the RMT union and a continuing ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union were expected to cause further disruption for 300,000 passengers on Monday and Tuesday. Post Office staff who are members of the Communication Workers Union are striking for five days this week, including Christmas Eve, in protest at job losses, the closure of a final salary pension scheme and the franchising of crown post offices. The Post Office said fewer than 300 of its branches would be affected. BA and Virgin Atlantic also face walkouts over Christmas. Members of Unite are due to take action on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. BA said it intended to run a full service on both days despite the strikes. Workers at Weetabix have voted to go on strike in the new year in a row over shift patterns. Members of Usdaw, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, backed industrial action by 9-1 on a turnout of almost 70%. Asked about the strikes affecting Southern rail, the Post Office and BA, Theresa May’s deputy official spokesman said on Monday: “What the prime minister thinks is that the strikes are wrong and that they are causing untold misery to hundreds of thousands of people … If [these strikes] have anything in common, it is shared contempt for ordinary people trying to go about their daily lives.” The former cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine and Norman Tebbit are among the senior Tory figures who have called on May to take a tough line on trade unions, following the wave of strikes and threatened walkouts. In response, McCluskey said: “The government should be looking at positive ways to resolve disputes, not demonising working men and women who only consider strike action as the very last resort. “I have never encountered a worker who wants to strike. When they have to take industrial action, it is an expression of frustration at not being heard by employers. I urge the government to concentrate more on understanding why industrial relations break down, not slinging around threats to remove fundamental freedoms.” The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the government had the power to end the dispute on the rail network and accused ministers of “promoting ever more draconian responses” to workers’ grievances. “We need to take the heat out of the current situation. It’s vital that the parties agree to take a breath and there be a moratorium to enable some sensible, objective discussions to take place,” he said. He called on both sides to focus on passengers’ safety. “As Southern commuters are well aware, services are delayed, cancelled and overcrowded every day regardless of strike action. For the sake of passengers, the government must take this opportunity to resolve the dispute and sort out Southern’s unacceptable service.” The CWU, which staged a demonstration outside the headquarters of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in London, said there was strong backing from the public for its campaign.
The union’s general secretary, Dave Ward, claimed that the future of the Post Office was at risk because of the policy of franchising services from crown offices to retail firms such as WHSmith. The Post Office’s network and sales director, Kevin Gilliland, said: “Any action will affect fewer than 300 of our branches, and many of these will be open to maintain services for customers preparing for Christmas. “It will be business as usual in almost all of our network, with over 50,000 Post Office people on hand to support customers as they make their preparations for Christmas.” The dispute does not involve the Royal Mail, whose workers sort and deliver post. BA cabin crew who belong to the Unite union are due to strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a row over pay, although talks were being held at the conciliation service Acas on Monday. Talks are also due to take place on Tuesday to try to avert pay strikes later in the week by Unite members employed by Swissport as baggage handlers and other ground staff at 18 airports. Alex Cruz, BA’s chief executive and chairman, said: “We are making sure that this attempt to ruin Christmas for thousands of our customers fails. Over the weekend, we have been working on detailed contingency plans to ensure that we are able to operate our normal flight programme from all our airports on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day.” Ed Leach, of Usdaw, said of the Weetabix decision: “Despite long and detailed discussions, the company has so far refused to offer a suitable financial incentives for employees who have moved shift or will be expected to move on to the new 24/7 shift pattern. As a result of the failure to agree, Usdaw conducted a ballot for industrial action and members have overwhelmingly backed a series of 24-hour strikes. “It is deeply regrettable that the company has pushed staff to this point and we hope that they will look again at their offer, continue to negotiate with us and seek a solution that will avoid the industrial action backed by our members.” A spokesman for Weetabix said: “We are disappointed by the ballot result, but respect the decision and are keen to continue discussions. We have plans in place to minimise any potential disruption to our operations.”"

Most of the early season stories have been about problems with organisation and supporter behaviour. Some of the club’s devoted regulars have been feeling far from their former Green Street home. It didn’t help that the team’s early season form was poor. On the other hand, club vice-chair Karren Brady has insisted that the move will strengthen the club financially and take it forward as a brand. How are West Ham fans feeling now that the Premier League season is approaching its halfway stage and the team is picking up a few more points? To find out, I went to the London Stadium with footie-mad student filmmaker Max Curwen-Bingley before Saturday’s home match against Hull City. I asked the questions, Max pointed the camera.

2016-12-19T18:46:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Junior doctor who killed herself 'talked about leaving medicine',"A junior doctor who killed herself suffered from acute self-doubt and was anxious about remaining in the medical profession, an inquest has heard. The family of Rose Polge, 25, paid tribute after the hearing to a conscientious and dedicated young doctor and raised concerns about the pressures on junior doctors. The inquest in Torquay was told that, on the morning of the day she disappeared, Polge had asked her boyfriend of nearly five years, fellow doctor Alasdair Hawley, whether he would still love her if she left medicine. Hawley said: “I know she was struggling at work with perceived self-doubts. But feedback was that she was progressing well and was actually very capable.” The night before her disappearance, Polge talked about quitting medicine and was unable to sleep, walking on the beach instead, Hawley said. Polge left work at Torbay hospital, Devon, mid-way through a shift in February after having dark thoughts, Hawley said. She agreed to visit a doctor and go to Cambridge to spend time with her parents. The inquest heard that Hawley left work early after becoming concerned about Polge’s welfare but by the time he got home at 4pm she had vanished. He called the police after he found her web history showing that she had visited suicide sites. She left a note in her home and another in the glove box of her car, which was found near Anstey’s Cove in Devon. Her body was discovered in Portland Bay in April. The coroner, Ian Arrow, recorded a verdict of suicide and paid tribute to a “very highly regarded” doctor. Following the hearing, Polge’s aunt read a statement on behalf of the family, describing her as “a lively and lovely person who brought light into a room wherever she went. “She was also a conscientious and dedicated young doctor, described by her colleagues as one of the best they had worked with.” But the statement also raised concerns about the long hours and heavy workloads experienced by many doctors, adding: “Doctors can feel a dreadful sense of personal failure and inadequacy if they struggle to keep working. Sometimes, the despair can be sudden and overwhelming.” The family highlighted concerns raised about junior doctors by a recent General Medical Council training survey, which warned of a “crisis in morale”, and added: “Our hope is something will be done about this crisis in the health service soon.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."
2016-12-19T18:54:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Computer error blamed for HMRC blunder in Scotland,"A computer error meant that 420,000 individuals who should be paying the new Scottish rate of income tax were not told of their changed status, the National Audit Office has found. A report by the NAO reveals the number of potential Scottish taxpayers who were excluded from the initial identification exercise in 2015 because of an IT error and received their new “S” tax code three months after it came into force last April. The report identifies “significant challenges” for HM Revenue and Customs, which will assess and collect the new tax on behalf of Scotland. HMRC only discovered the initial scan of its database was incomplete after being contacted by members of the Scottish government and the public who had not received, or knew people who had not received, notification letters. The Scottish parliament has had the power to apply a Scottish rate of income tax (Srit) since 6 April 2016. Holyrood’s tax-raising powers have been further enhanced by the Scotland Act 2016 and, from 2017-18, it will be able to set the rates and band thresholds, excluding the personal allowance. The NAO noted that HMRC failed to carry out any special exercise to inform those it had failed to identify, other than sending them a note of their new tax code. This risked the creation of “a less informed group of taxpayers”, it said. The notification letters received by the 2.45 million taxpayers originally identified last December did not even contain a contact telephone number because HMRC’s strategy was “to minimise telephone contact”, said the NAO. Consequently, HMRC only recorded 312 calls between 1 December 2015 and 20 January 2016 specifically in respect of Srit. Recipients were instead directed to the relevant gov.uk website pages but, according to HMRC’s own analysis, there was no noticeable increase in the traffic as a result of the notification letters. The report also identifies the risk of tax avoidance and evasion if there are differences in tax rates or thresholds between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland’s finance secretary, Derek Mackay, confirmed in his draft budget last week that he would not replicate the UK Treasury’s tax cut for higher earners, meaning that the 40% threshold would only rise by inflation, to £43,430 in Scotland, while it will start at £45,000 in the rest of the UK. A Scottish government spokesperson said: “We have made it clear to HMRC that the identification of Scottish taxpayers must be robust and accurate. Our officials regularly meet with HMRC to receive assurances that the identification process is carried out in a satisfactory manner, that the integrity of Scotland’s income tax base will be maintained and to ensure where any issues are identified that they are addressed quickly.” But Scottish Labour’s Westminster spokesperson Ian Murray said the error raised serious questions about HMRC’s capacity to administer the new tax powers. “It is vital that businesses and taxpayers have all the information they need so that such errors are not repeated and that any disruption to taxpayers and future tax revenues is minimised. In order to achieve this, HMRC must have the staff and resources to function effectively, so the government should urgently review the planned closure of HMRC offices in Scotland, which could lead to the loss of around 2,000 workers,” he said. “The transfer of new tax powers to Scotland is a major challenge to HMRC and the Scottish overnment – one which they must be prepared to meet. It is difficult to see how drastically cutting staff numbers is conducive to that.”"
2016-12-19T20:13:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"G4S must pay for cost of Birmingham prison riot, says Liz Truss","The private security company G4S will have to foot the bill for the public sector Tornado special squads sent in to end the 12-hour riot at its Birmingham prison, the justice secretary has said. An inquiry has been launched into one of the worst prison disturbances since the 1990 riots at Manchester’s Strangeways prison. After Friday’s events, 380 prisoners have been moved out of the wrecked wings of HMP Birmingham to other jails across England. The dispersal of prisoners led to two incidents at Hull prison on Sunday and a further incident at Cardiff. The Prison Service’s “gold command” headquarters operation is remaining in place, monitoring all prisons in England and Wales for signs of potential unrest. Liz Truss told MPs that insufficient staffing levels, a rise in new psychoactive drugs, gangs and bullying lay at the root of the Birmingham riot, adding they were common problems across public and private prisons: “The next few months will be difficult,” the justice secretary told MPs. “It will take time and concerted action, but I am confident we can turn this situation around.” Labour MPs pressed Truss over whether warnings from the independent monitoring board at Birmingham had been acted on. They questioned her about the impact of a £700m budget cut and a reduction of 7,000 prison officers on the stability of the Prison Service. Labour’s justice spokesman, Richard Burgon, said the riot should prompt the government to review the running of prisons by private companies such as G4S and Serco. Truss said G4S would have to pay the cost of the public resources that were used, including 10 Tornado teams of highly trained officers deployed to retake control of the prison. She told MPs that the Birmingham riot started at 9.15am on Friday, when six prisoners in N wing climbed on to netting. Truss said: “When staff intervened, one them had their keys snatched. At that point, staff withdrew for their own safety. Prisoners then gained control of the wing and subsequently of P wing. “G4S immediately deployed two Tornado teams. At 11.29am, gold command was opened, and a further seven additional Tornado teams were dispatched to the prison. At 1.30pm, prisoners gained access to two more wings. Gold command made the decision that further reinforcements were needed and dispatched an additional four Tornado teams to the prison.” She said that paramedics and staff tried to help an injured prisoner shortly after 3pm but were prevented from doing so and the afternoon was spent preparing to take back control of the wings. “At 8.35pm, 10 Tornado teams of highly trained officers swept through the wings,” she said. “Shortly after 10pm, the teams had secured all four wings. The prisoner who had previously been reported injured was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital, along with two other prisoners.”
The inquiry into the prison riot will be carried out by Sarah Payne, an adviser to the chief inspector of probation and a former director of the Welsh Prison Service. Although Truss repeatedly refused to confirm that she had read the Birmingham prison watchdog’s report in October, which warned of the need for urgent action to tackle understaffing and the spread of “black mamba” psychoactive drugs, she said the issues had been discussed with the prison governor. The justice secretary’s Commons statement followed a renewed warning from the president of the independent monitoring board, John Thornhill, that insufficient staff numbers lay behind the rising levels of violence in prisons in England and Wales. “It is the board’s view, echoed by prison staff, that there are insufficient staff numbers to deal with many of the day-to-day situations that occur in a local prison … The result, as we have seen in recent weeks, is an increase in riots that damage the system individuals,” he said. “The impact of this unrestrained violence is that a large number of prisoners have to be transferred to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues.” Truss will publish a prison and courts bill in the new year to introduce wide-ranging reform and to build on the recruitment of 2.500 extra prison officers."
2016-12-20T10:00:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Gangmasters agree to pay more than Â£1m to settle modern slavery claim,"A Kent-based gangmaster couple have agreed to a landmark settlement worth more than £1m in compensation and legal costs for a group of migrants who were trafficked to work on farms producing eggs for high street brands. The deal reached with six Lithuanian chicken catchers is the first settlement of a claim against a British company in relation to modern slavery, and came after the group became frustrated at the lack of a criminal prosecution. Ten other claimants are now expected to bring similar cases against DJ Houghton Chicken Catching Services, of which Darrell Houghton and his wife, Jacqueline Judge, are the sole directors. The couple agreed to the compensation deal after a high court ruling this year found that they had failed to pay the national minimum wage, had made unlawful deductions from wages and had failed to provide adequate facilities to wash, rest, eat and drink.
The claimants alleged to the court that they had been threatened and assaulted by Lithuanian supervisors who intimidated them with fighting dogs, and that they were housed in appalling conditions. They said they were forced to work back-to-back eight-hour shifts for days at a time and were denied sleep and toilet breaks, forcing them to urinate in bottles and defecate in carrier bags in minibuses as they travelled between jobs on poultry farms around the UK. A Guardian investigation in 2012 revealed that one of the businesses that regularly used the Houghton company for casual labour was Noble Foods, the leading producer of eggs to supermarkets and owner of the Happy Eggs brand. The legal case has raised questions about the extent of Noble’s information about the conditions endured by the Lithuanian workers it was using. In his defence filing, obtained after a Freedom of Information request, Darrell Houghton said Noble had required him to install a GPS tracking system in his minivans so that it could monitor where the chicken-catching gang were at any time. Noble has admitted in correspondence that it received tracking data but told the Guardian it was not aware of the workers’ conditions. Noble Foods is the UK’s largest egg company and both the firm and its former chairman, Peter Dean, have been major donors to the Conservative party. The company helicopter was on occasion loaned to David Cameron for election campaigning. The company has recently been restructured and is under new management. Noble Foods said: “The welfare and treatment of all employees of Noble Foods, or those working for the company via a third party, is of paramount importance. The condition under which certain contracted staff employed by DJ Houghton Catching Services had been working in 2012 was not known to Noble Foods and resulted in the immediate and permanent cessation of DJ Houghton Catching Services’ contract.” The Lithuanians were sent to work in supply chains producing premium free range eggs for McDonald’s, Tesco, Asda, M&S and the Sainsbury’s Woodland brand. The farm sheds they cleared of chickens also produced eggs sold under the Freedom Food brand. The migrant workers were trafficked to the UK from Lithuania by a man whom the Houghtons admitted paying to find workers for their chicken catching business. As poultry production has become more intensive and large-scale in recent decades, the job of catching the egg birds when they have come to the end of their laying life has been outsourced to specialist travelling teams of catchers. Houghtons was one of a tiny pool of agencies offering the service to UK producers. The plight of their Lithuanian workers was uncovered when some of the men turned to a Citizens Advice Bureau for help. In 2012 Kent police, the Gangmaster Licensing Authority and what was then the Serious Organised Crime Agency conducted joint raids on houses owned by the Houghtons to liberate more than 30 men believed to be victims of human trafficking for labour exploitation. The supermarket companies said at the time that they were shocked by the allegations and would take action to ensure their ethical standards were met fully. Laurynas Kelpsa, one of the Lithuanian workers who brought the claim for compensation, said he was happy that a civil settlement had finally been reached after four years, although he remained disappointed that the police had not brought charges. “It has been a really hard time for me, not just physically but mentally, and for all of us victims. I am really excited that we have got justice at last,” he said. He plans to use his share of the compensation award to set up his own car valeting business. The legal action was led for the Lithuanians by solicitors Leigh Day on a mixed basis of no-win, no-fee and legal aid. Shanta Martin, a Leigh Day partner, said the award should act as a deterrent to others who planned to exploit migrant workers. “We are extremely pleased to have achieved this result for our clients as it will go a huge way towards helping them rebuild their lives. The large bill faced by the defendants is also a salutary lesson to other who might seek to profit from modern slavery,” Martin said. Noble Foods said it had instigated “a major review of its existing systems to ensure strict protocols were in place to protect all employees and enable any wrongdoing to be identified at the earliest opportunity”. Houghtons did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian understands that it has settled the claims relating to threats and assault without admitting liability."
2016-12-20T10:05:31Z,uk-news,UK news,The future of Denmark Street: rebirth opportunity or dystopian hell?,"On a building site gazed over by the latticed middle finger that is Centre Point, Amy Lamé, writer, entertainer, sometime Pink List National Treasure and recently appointed as London’s first “night tsar” by Sadiq Khan, explained to a hi-vised, hard-hatted showbiz camera crew why flattening a patch of a conservation area has been a good idea. “This is incredibly exciting,” she enthused: “We’ve got the infrastructure. London’s changing and having a night tsar is part of that. What a wonderful opportunity.” That infrastructure is Crossrail. That opportunity is to be most conspicuously realised as what is shown in CGIs as a glass and gold-coloured construction to be called the NOW building: perhaps NOW as in POW and in WOW. It will grace what site developer Consolidated Developments has suggested will become “the equivalent of New York’s Times Square in London”, a cultural piazza at St Giles Circus, beckoning from the teeming, expanding Tottenham Court Road transport junction where Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road meet. There will be a ground floor “urban gallery” hosting exhibitions, product launches, award ceremonies, conferences and fashion shows and a “sky bar”. The development as a whole will include a hotel, shops, some intermediate affordable housing and, somewhere in the mix, what is described by one of the scheme’s consultants as “the London home of the Outernet”, this being a “a radical new technology-driven marketing, entertainment and information service housed in a super-flexible, digitally enabled streetscape” to be “wrapped around the main exit from the new Tottenham Court Road Crossrail station and spreading into Soho”. Below ground there will be a brand new 800-capacity hall for live music and other events. This last in particular pleases tsar Lamé.
“It’s time to change the conversation about the night-time economy, and start thinking about the benefits it brings,” she explained. “This is living proof of what we can do.” Lamé’s job is to protect and promote nocturnal fun. She is well aware that London has lost a lot of music venues in recent years – around 50, some 35% of them – due largely to soaring property prices inducing owners to shut down and sell up. The coming of Crossrail has intensified the trend. The Astoria on Charing Cross Road has been demolished to make way for it. Smaller nearby clubs have closed. Given all this, especially the new performance space, you might wonder why the St Giles Circus project has inspired a lot of hostility and bad press, in particular from musicians and music lovers. There was a clue just a few yards from where Lamé held court. Preparing the site has entailed knocking down buildings that faced on to the narrow part of St Giles High Street except for their facades. Squatting against the backdrop of these propped-up remnants and braced with metal struts like an accident survivor in intensive care, is an early 18th century blacksmith’s forge that until last year had formed the stage of the 12 Bar Club at 26 Denmark Street, a short avenue of music history known as London’s Tin Pan Alley. The 12 Bar resided there for more than 20 years, before relocating to the Holloway Road in 2015 (and sadly not lasting there for long). Its remnant will be embedded within a new small “grassroots” performance space beside the main subterranean hall. “Living proof,” in Lamé’s words, “that it won’t all be shiny and new here”. Her need to give this reassurance was telling. The salvaging of the 12 Bar relic, hoisted through space and time as if by some preservationist Tardis, shows how sacred to some the old place was. But it will not still the fears of those most perturbed by what is happening to the creativity cluster at the heart of the capital, whose main avenue Denmark Street has been for a century. For them, Lamé’s upbeat promise cannot compensate for the erosion of something less tangible yet more substantial than any digitally-enabled streetscape. They might call it the spirit of rock’n’roll. Dystopian hell There’s a pub called The Angel on St Giles High Street, just beyond Denmark Street. There I met Henry Scott-Irvine, who got straight to the point. “What is special and unique about rock music is that people like it to be scuzzy and old and with sticky floors and black walls in small spaces where young bands can start,” he said. An experienced music documentary maker and researcher, Scott-Irvine started his career during a summer break from film school on Ken Loach’s Riff-Raff, working at 7 Denmark St synchronising clapper boards (“they don’t do that anymore”). He loves its history of guitar shops and the rooms above them housing a beehive of agents, managers, publishers, instrument-repairers, all making a living from one performing art or another. He loved going to the 12 Bar Club – “I saw Jeff Buckley there, in 1994. It was one of the finest gigs I’ve seen in my life” – and is now the leading light of a campaign called Save Tin Pan Alley. He fears that peril has been impending since November 2013, when Camden council gave permission to the West End firm Consolidated Developments to hollow out the one-acre site to the north of it: “I could see that money was rolling in and creativity was rolling out. And I wanted to fight it.” Others felt the same way. The club was squatted until Consolidated took legal recourse. By then, familiar battle lines had been drawn and familiar protests were being heard. As London booms, we hear them about Soho as a whole and from everywhere, about pubs and bookshops and street markets and football grounds. The cry is that greed and gentrification are turning London into a sanitised, corporatised “playground for the rich” and robbing the city of its soul. Scott-Irvine is firmly in that camp. He anticipates the coming of the NOW and the Outernet with horror. “It’s dystopian hell. It’s a monolith for brands that people don’t even want, if you ask me – that’s what’s driving them. It will end up dead like the Elephant and Castle shopping centre did and the worst aspects of Le Corbusier. Yet here we have it, in the new millennium. It’s just a box.” He’s made every effort to hold back the tide, annoying Consolidated, nagging Camden council, raising a petition, speaking in court, generating publicity (this article is just the latest example) and tracking down a host of past and present Denmark Street inhabitants and luminaries for a film about the street to be called Tin Pan Alley Tales, which has just succeeded in raising the £21,600 it needs. He knows as well as anyone the roll call of agents, publishers, writers, producers and performers whose endeavours form the potent Denmark Street lore. These range from the Rolling Stones, who recorded their first album there in 1964, to Jimmy Kennedy, the man who wrote The Hokey Cokey and the Teddy Bears’ Picnic, to Charlie Chaplin, who co-wrote the lyrics to Smile in the street at the office of Keith Prowse in 1954. He’s happy with what has become of La Giaconda, originally a cafe where David Bowie and scores of other stars and dreamers used to hang out and now a restaurant, but he hates the thinning out of the guitar and other instrument shops and what he says is an ongoing exodus of the sorts of people who’ve made the London music industry sing. That singing is certainly struggling to be heard just now, drowned by the sound of heavy vehicles and machinery as parts of the insides of old Denmark Street addresses are gouged out, refurbished and converted, some to be transformed into flats.
Amy Lamé and City Hall think Camden has placed enough conditions on the development, initially approved in November 2013, to ensure that Denmark Street retains its musical character. Under a provision called Tin Pan Alley Uses, protections have been negotiated for existing retailers in the properties Consolidated owns (which is most of them) and requirements written in that new tenants for any units becoming vacant must be reserved for businesses conforming to Tin Pan Alley Uses for six months. Such measures did not previously exist. But Scott-Irvine doesn’t think them sufficiently strong: “They are vague enough to be open to interpretation. And rents will go up. They’re not going to multiply by five, but they will go up incrementally.” He suspects that individual rent levels are tailored to the landlord’s desire to see certain tenants moved out and otherwise retained for now, giving an impression that, so to speak, the beat goes on, but which will ultimately prove to be cosmetic. “It’s developer chess,” he says. “They’ve got every move worked out.” Very little about the St Giles Circus development comforts him, despite Consolidated’s insistence that both its heart and its business head see the value of retaining the area’s special qualities. The company’s owner, Laurence Kirschel, told London writer Peter Watts in 2014 that he could have got rid of the guitar shops years ago had he wanted to and that the relatively low rents the tenants had been paying meant that some of the buildings were becoming dilapidated. Will the St Giles Circus scheme, as Watts put it, “create something new that doesn’t kill the spirit of the old?” Iconoclasts and conservationists The allure of Denmark Street has lasted long and travelled far. I first felt it years before I went there, thanks to self-immersing in pop music during my small town adolescence far from the capital. My sense of connection with it has a further, far more recent, dimension too. My youngest son bought a guitar there when he was in a teenage band and my youngest daughter auditioned for a film role in the office of a casting director at number 20, above one of the guitar shops (and got the part). My children kindly indulged me as I imparting my bits of knowledge in the hope that, if nothing else, I could convey something of the magic that can brew in a city’s covert clusters, the backwaters of romance, difference and disrepute that the mainstream passes by. But the problem now for Denmark Street might be that the mainstream is at last devouring it fully, just as alternative music itself, be it punk, or skiffle, or disco, or psychedelic rock, or reggae, or indie or folk, has always been commodified for the masses. What was Denmark Street itself when in its prime if not a corridor of such popular commerce? My fellow Guardian writer Simon Jenkins, though a London heritage defender and critic of Crossrail, wrote in the Evening Standard two years ago that the case for saving Denmark Street was a hard to make. Regretfully, he called it “a mere ghost of its past”, largely because the very making of music is different nowadays. He was “all for treating as historic the place where Pete Townshend bought his first Fender Stratocaster”, but doubted there are enough would-be, modern-day Townshends to keep Denmark Street the way it was halfway through the last century. The same can be said of recording and releasing music, things people can now do in their bedrooms. And there’s more to music in London than Denmark Street. Some defenders of its milieu have looked young, but my son had never heard of it until I took him there. The band he was in rehearsed in a cheap studio in Stoke Newington, recorded in a smarter one in Forest Hill and played gigs at, among other places, the Borderline, the Nambucca, the George Tavern, the O2 Academy and Upper Street’s Hope and Anchor, not sticky-floored or smoky as it was in the punk and pub rock era when I went there, but still in business a generation on. As for core Soho’s creative industries, most of my daughter’s acting endeavours involve auditions in its tucked away corners or ADR tweaks in its warren of post-production studios. It’s not a dead zone yet. As ever, there are ironies in all this: Henry Scott-Irvine wants musicians and their industry to buy leases in Denmark Street and turn it into a “music heritage zone”. Despite its current, blighted look he’s yet to accept that the music has to die and is understandably pleased that former Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Paul Cook, who lived on Denmark Street for a while, are among those who’ve wished him well. But see how yesterday’s iconoclasts have become today’s conservationists. There are also other points of view: while the area’s more nefarious activities mean gritty authenticity to some, to others, not least some local residents, they are menacing criminality.
The space Consolidated is now changing, which takes in Denmark Place and Andrew Borde Street, has long been earmarked for a major makeover. Camden produced a development brief way back in 2004, to “ensure a comprehensive approach to development of the land at Denmark Place” and “maximise the benefits”. Phil Jones, the council’s cabinet member for regeneration, transport and planning, sticks up for the scheme. “London is changing and we want renewal, we want growth and we want jobs,” he says. He points out that local authorities can only do so much in the face of global economic forces that drive development, and that just saying “no” to developers isn’t an option for long, given their right to repeatedly appeal. “What we can do is to try to shape those forces of change so that some solid public benefits are built in.” Those benefits or otherwise will, of course, be in the eyes of different beholders of the St Giles Circus project as it unfolds. Will it be bland and expensive or an engine of evolution, helping this celebrated niche of central London be reborn for a new age? Amy Lamé, whose exploits include chairing the successful campaign to save the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a famous gay venue in south London, from demolition, is clearly hopeful. Mayor Khan, who has pledged to protect music and other cultural assets, such as cinemas, from threats posed by redevelopment and has set up a commission to support night time industries, will hope that this proves justified. Henry Scott-Irvine, whose film looks worthy of your support whether or not you share his views, remains to be convinced. He does, though, allow that if Laurence Kirschel’s firm delivers all it’s promising there ought to be a statue in his honour. Perhaps we shouldn’t rule it out. After all, some people have even learned to love Centre Point."
2016-12-20T10:33:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland should keep free movement, Nicola Sturgeon will say","There is no reason why Scotland should not keep free movement of EU citizens even if the rest of the UK puts new immigration controls in place after leaving the bloc, the Scottish government is due to say. Ahead of the launch of a Scottish government paper setting out its approach to Brexit, the MP Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s Europe spokesman, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday: “We want to remain in the single market, something similar to what Norway does and allow us to trade freely with our partners. “Freedom of movement is good for the economy, EU nationals contribute so much to our universities, businesses and our society. It also benefits the millions of UK nationals living and working in Europe.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will launch the paper, titled Scotland’s Place in Europe, on Tuesday morning. She will propose that Scotland should remain in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves, which she says would require a “substantial transfer of new powers to Holyrood”. Without those changes, Sturgeon will say, a second independence referendum is highly likely. Gethins pointed out that UK ministers including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, had already suggested free movement could be maintained between the UK and Ireland. “If Ireland can maintain freedom of movement and the common travel area … there’s no reason why Scotland can’t do exactly the same thing,” he told the BBC. “If Ireland can have a common travel area and the Westminster government doesn’t think that will imperil [the economy], why is Scotland different?” Downing Street has said it would seriously consider the proposals, in contrast to previous comments by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who appeared to rule out any special deal on trade or immigration during a visit to Edinburgh earlier this month. Charles Grant, a member of the Scottish government’s advisory standing council on Europe and director of the Centre for European Reform, told the FT that a special deal for Scotland would be “extremely difficult” and had little support from the UK government. “It would be legally possible for Scotland to have control over immigration that would allow freedom of movement, but politically Mrs May would be highly unlikely to go for it,” he said. Speaking before the launch of the paper, Sturgeon said: “Being part of the European single market is vital for Scotland’s future economic wellbeing. And losing our place in the single market would be potentially devastating to our long-term prosperity, to jobs, investment and people’s livelihoods. “It would end our current status as part of the world’s biggest free trade area, a market around eight times bigger than the UK’s alone, and would have a profound and long-lasting impact on our national economic standing and our standards of living.” The first minister will say the Scottish economy is expected to take a hit of about £11bn per year by 2030 and cite independent forecasts of about 80,000 job losses and a cut in average earnings of about £2,000 per person. “It is not just the loss of existing jobs and investment that would be at stake. In addition, there is the prospect of lost investment and employment – money and jobs which our place in the single market would ensure but which would otherwise never materialise,” Sturgeon will say. “That is why the paper we publish today is centred on retaining our place in the single market – and why it is so important Scotland avoids the hard Brexit threatened by the rightwing Brexiteers in the Tory party. “Our proposals deserve full and proper consideration, as the prime minister has already pledged, and I look forward to discussing them in the weeks ahead.”"
2016-12-20T12:04:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Essex police force admits failings in 'Goldfinger' murder case,"A police force has admitted failings in the handling of the murder of the notorious criminal John “Goldfinger” Palmer after officers mistook six gunshot injuries for surgery wounds. At an inquest into Palmer’s death, DCI Stephen Jennings of Essex police said officers did not properly inspect the gangster’s dead body as it lay in the garden of his home in South Weald, nor did they conduct appropriate background checks that would have revealed his high-profile criminal background. As a result, Palmer’s death was not treated as suspicious until six days after he died.
Palmer, who was 64 when he was killed on 24 June 2015, was cleared of handling proceeds from the £26m Brink’s-Mat bullion raid at Heathrow in 1983, but his alleged involvement earned him the nickname Goldfinger. He was jailed in 2001 for an estimated £33m timeshare fraud, and served half of an eight-year sentence. He spent the last eight years of his life on bail following his arrest in Tenerife in 2007 where he was charged with fraud, firearm possession and money laundering. After a short hearing in Chelmsford, the coroner, Caroline Beasley-Murray, concluded that Palmer had been unlawfully killed. The police investigation into his murder is ongoing. A separate inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into Essex police’s handling of the case is also ongoing. “There were failings on behalf of Essex police,” Jennings told the inquest. “The body was not completely searched and relevant intelligence checks were not taken which would have identified his lifestyle of criminality.” He said 700 lines of inquiry had been opened and 200 witness statements had been taken as part of the investigation. The force believed the murder had all the hallmarks of a “contract-style killing”, he added. Considering motives for taking out a hit on Palmer, the investigation has looked at his criminal past, including his links to the Brink’s-Mat robbery. Palmer was also connected to some of the men convicted for their roles in the more recent Hatton Garden diamond heist. There were 16,000 victims in the timeshare fraud case, which Jennings described as “16,000 motives” to kill. Jennings told the inquest that Palmer had gall bladder surgery on 17 June 2015, five days before his death, and initially his injuries were believed to be linked. Palmer’s home was remote and set amid three acres of land with fencing around the property, Jennings said. CCTV footage showed Palmer using a motorised buggy in his grounds at 5.18pm. He was found lying dead in the grass by his son’s partner after stumbling about 15 metres from the site of the shooting. After a postmortem concluded the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the chest, Essex police launched a murder inquiry. Detectives discovered a small hole drilled in the perimeter fence of the property, which they believe was used by Palmer’s killer to spy on his movements. The gun used was an 8mm pistol with .32 calibre and most likely had a silencer fitted, Jennings said, adding that Palmer had been burning paperwork in the corner of his garden when he was shot. The investigation will continue in 2017, Jennings said. “The search is not just for the gunman but for the person who wanted someone to kill him.” Ashley Thilthorpe, the partner of Palmer’s daughter, was the only relative to attend the hearing."
2016-12-20T12:13:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Barbara set to batter parts of UK and disrupt Christmas travel,"Gusts of up to 90mph are set to batter parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland over Christmas as Storm Barbara wreaks havoc over the festive period. Forecasters have warned that power supplies may be hit, ferries delayed and bridges closed due to strong winds on Friday and Christmas Eve. Western and northern Scotland are expected to be worst-affected by the gale-force winds – overnight on Friday. An amber weather warning – meaning be prepared – is in place for the Scottish highlands and Shetlands, where gusts of 80-90mph are forecast into Christmas Eve. Parts of Northern Ireland and northern England will also be hit, the Met Office has warned, with gales of between 60mph and 80mph expected on Friday and the early hours of Christmas Eve. Forecasters said Storm Barbara had the potential to disrupt travel over the Christmas period and urged people to make alternative plans. Nicky Maxey, from the Met Office, said: “It has the potential to be quite disruptive so we would urge people to think about their travel arrangements if they’re trying to get away for Christmas. “There is a risk that it could disrupt power supplies, bring disruption to ferries and flights, bring restrictions on bridges – it’s quite important people think about their travel arrangements as much as they can.” The gusts could cause chaos on the roads for the 3.5 million drivers predicted by the RAC to be planning a Christmas getaway on Friday, with 3.8 million expected to take to the roads on Christmas Eve. Snowfall of up to 10cm has been forecast in upland areas of western and central Highlands. Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has said 21 of its 26 routes had already been disrupted by the weather, with several services cancelled."
2016-12-20T14:32:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who ran bomb factory in Northern Ireland jailed for 11 years,"A mechanic originally from the Irish Republic has been jailed for 11 years by a Northern Ireland court for running a bomb factory that contained enough explosives to build what could have been one of the biggest bombs ever used by terror groups in the region. Barry Petticrew was caught on a rural farm in County Fermanagh that had been transformed into a workshop building bombs. Antrim crown court was told that Petticrew had been under surveillance by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) at the farm near Kinawley, close to the border with the Irish Republic. The surveillance operation was part of a security drive on October 2014 against dissident Irish republican activity in the county, the court heard. Petticrew was said to have tried to run across fields in the direction of the border when armed police raided the farm.When captured, he told PSNI officers: “I’m not involved in terrorism. This house belongs to a friend of mine.” The PSNI found high-grade explosives, pipes, timer units and ammunition at the property.
The court heard there were enough explosives to build the largest bomb ever seen in Northern Ireland before or after the Troubles. In sentencing the 45-year-old, from Swanlinbar in County Cavan, on Tuesday, Judge Gordon Kerr QC pointed out that Petticrew had allowed himself to be associated with dissident republicans five years after he had been convicted of a terrorism-related offence at the Republic’s non-jury special criminal court in Dublin. DI Davy Lowans from PSNI said: “This haul contained many of the components used by a terrorist group, everything from time power units and fertiliser to a coffee grinder, ammunition and forensic suits. “We believe this was for use by dissident terrorists in Fermanagh and other parts of Northern Ireland. The quantities and range of items recovered would have enabled a number of explosive devices to be constructed. The seizure will have an impact on the terrorists’ capabilities and undoubtedly has saved lives.”"
2016-12-20T14:50:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Tories pressure Theresa May to bring in hardline anti-strike legislation,"Conservative MPs have piled pressure on Downing Street to consider tougher action to end the strikes on Southern rail, with one politician tabling legislation that would change the rules governing industrial action. Chris Philp has submitted a private member’s bill that says strikes on critical national services, including rail, buses and the NHS, should have to be “proportionate and reasonable” in the view of a high court judge. The MP for Croydon South has argued that it is unfair for a dispute, which he describes as being about whether train conductors or drivers press a button that opens the doors, to have affected 300,000 commuters for a number of months. He has also suggested provisions that exist in Spain, Italy and Canada for services that means they will continue to operate at a 50% level during a dispute.
The intervention comes as Theresa May and the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, resist calls for legislation, with sources saying that it would not provide a quick enough fix to the crisis. The pair did convene an emergency meeting at Downing Street on Monday night with 25 Tory MPs whose constituencies are affected by the continued disruption on the route. At the meeting, the politicians backed the idea of extra commuter buses. However, Whitehall sources said the meeting was not a brainstorming session but instead an opportunity for May to listen to concerns. The Guardian understands that the government believes a full bus replacement would be logistically impossible because of the number of vehicles required and the traffic at peak times. Trains run from some stations to London 10 times an hour, carrying 1,000 passengers each, underlining the complexity of any replacement bus service. A source in the meeting said the majority of those present urged the prime minister to consider a more hardline stance on strike action, including new legislation, which courts could adjudicate. “Almost everyone there was expressing support for those ideas, because thousands of people can’t get to work,” the source said. “There is growing support in the wider parliamentary party too.” Industrial action by Southern rail conductors in the RMT union and a ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union caused further disruption for up to 300,000 passengers on Monday and Tuesday. More strikes are scheduled from 9-14 January, and Conservative MPs from London, Surrey and Sussex are eager to get new measures agreed before the new year. Southern has already advised commuters not to attempt to travel during the January strikes.
Philp said the government needed to consider all options to help people get to work. “If the buses can help, it’s a good idea,” he said. “Anything that eases the problem even a little bit is worth doing.” Philp, who authored a series of proposals on strike legislation, including the proportionality test, said: “The unions talk about people’s right to strike but nobody is trying to remove it. The suggestions are about balancing the right to strike with the rights of the public to get to work and see their loved ones. Some constituents have been fired or had to quit their jobs because of this. What about their right to work?” Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, said those at the meeting had expressed concern not only about the strikes but about the performance of Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Southern. “A number of things were discussed, a whole range of ways to improve services and end the strike action,” he said. “Everything needs to be in the mix. It’s causing misery on a daily basis to passengers’ lives. People are losing their jobs, time with loved ones in the evening. It’s hugely damaging to the economy, so all ideas that are potentially viable need to be explored.” On Monday the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the government had the power to end the dispute. “We need to take the heat out of the current situation,” he said. “It’s vital that the parties agree to take a breath and there be a moratorium to enable some sensible, objective discussions to take place. “As Southern commuters are well aware, services are delayed, cancelled and overcrowded every day regardless of strike action. For the sake of passengers, the government must take this opportunity to resolve the dispute and sort out Southern’s unacceptable service.”"
2016-12-20T18:01:10Z,uk-news,UK news,UK airport baggage and check-in staff strikes called off,"A planned strike by baggage handlers and check-in staff at 18 airports has been called off, the trade union representing them has announced. Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, took part in the talks and said that the unions had accepted a new and improved pay offer. “I am delighted to report that we have reached an agreement which our shop stewards will recommend to our members,” he said. Members of Unite employed by Swissport were due to walk out from Friday for 48 hours, threatening disruption for those leaving the UK for Christmas. The baggage handlers and check-in staff had voted for industrial action in protest at a 4.65% pay rise offer over three years. The airports affected would have included Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, East Midlands, Stansted and Belfast. Aberdeen, Bristol, Bournemouth, Cardiff, Doncaster, Edinburgh, Leeds/Bradford, Luton, Newcastle and Southampton could also have faced disruption. The strike was called off following talks at the conciliation service Acas. Talks are continuing in an attempt to avert a separate strike by British Airways cabin crew but McCluskey said progress was “painfully slow”. BA crew are due to strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. The airline said it will run a full service despite the strike. McCluskey appealed to senior management at BA to get involved in the talks, saying that a resolution is still possible. “I will make myself available 24 hours a day to try to reach an agreement,” he said."
2016-12-20T19:18:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Thom Yorke's ex-partner Rachel Owen dies at 48,"Rachel Owen, the former long-term partner of the Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, has died aged 48. The artist and Oxford University lecturer, who had cancer, separated from Yorke last year after 23 years together. They have two children – Noah, 15, and Agnes, 12. Owen had been in poor health for the last year but continued to teach Italian into her last months. Her death on Sunday was announced by Pembroke College in an obituary posted online on Monday. She was an internationally renowned artist, mixing photography and printmaking, while her scholarly work focused on Italian medieval literature. Her PhD subject was the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. One of her last artistic projects, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante’s first book of the Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR art gallery next spring. Yorke and Owen met as art students at Exeter University. They announced the end of their relationship in August 2015. “Rachel and I have separated,” Yorke said in a statement at the time. “After 23 highly creative and happy years, for various reasons we have gone our separate ways. It’s perfectly amicable and has been common knowledge for some time.” Their breakup is said to have influenced Radiohead’s latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool. On the track Daydreaming, the repeated phrase “half of my life” is believed to refer to the time Yorke had spent with Owen, and on Identikit, Yorke repeats the phrase “broken hearts make it rain”."
2016-12-20T23:47:43Z,uk-news,UK news,UK and Argentina agree to identify unknown victims of Falklands war,"Britain and Argentina appear to have made significant headway towards improving relations after reaching an agreement to identify the bodies of more than 100 unknown Argentinian soldiers buried on the Falklands Islands after the 1982 war. The two countries also agreed to increase the number of flights between Argentina and the islands, which they claim as the Malvinas. The 74-day war, which began when Argentina seized the islands and Britain sent a taskforce to retake them, saw 649 Argentinian and 255 British soldiers, as well as three Falkland islanders, lose their lives.
Under the agreement announced on Tuesday, the Red Cross will assemble a team of forensic experts, including two Argentinians, who will retrieve DNA samples from 123 unidentified Argentinian combatants buried at at Darwin Cemetery on East Falkland. The samples will then be compared against the samples taken from the volunteer Argentinian families. Work on identifying the remains will begin early next year, according to the Argentinian foreign ministry’s statement. The two governments also announced that talks are proceeding smoothly for the opening of extra flights between the South American mainland and the islands. FCO minister Sir Alan Duncan tweeted that Argentina and Britain had “agreed a way forward on new flights from Falkland Islands to Latin America”. Press reports in Argentina indicated that these could include a flight from São Paulo, Brazil, and Mount Pleasant airport near Port Stanley, the capital of the islands, stopping over at Argentina’s capital city, Buenos Aires.
The Argentinian foreign ministry said in its statement: “Both countries will negotiate with the air authorities in Brazil and Chile to determine what the stopovers will be.” At the moment a twice-weekly flight is operated by the British ministry of defence from the United Kingdom to the Falklands, as well as a weekly flight from Punta Arenas in Chile that makes a monthly stopover at Rio Gallegos in Argentina. Relations between London and Buenos Aires have improved significantly since Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, took office a year ago. Macri abandoned the confrontative attitude of former president Cristina Kirchner, who restricted hydrocarbon exploration in the area around the islands and at one point barred sea cruisers bound for the Falklands from docking at Argentinian ports. The agreement was signed in London by Sir Alan Duncan, minister for Europe and the Americas at the Foreign Office, and Argentinian foreign deputy minister Pedro Villagra Delgado. The signing was attended by Falkland Islands officials."
2016-12-21T00:01:02Z,uk-news,UK news,National Trust prepares to celebrate its gay history,"The long happy marriage and the very separate bedrooms of Vita Sackville-West and her husband, Harold Nicolson, will be celebrated at their Kent home as the National Trust turns its attention for the first time to the gay history locked within the walls of many of its properties. The Nicolsons were a famously devoted couple, and had two sons, the writer and publisher Nigel and art historian Benedict, but both also had passionate relationships with partners of the same sex.
Their book-lined cottage home still full of their possessions, surrounded by the idyllic gardens they created at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, has rarely been seen by the public because it was maintained by the family as a writer’s retreat, but it will now be on view by timed ticket every day the gardens are open. Sackville-West’s relationship with Virginia Woolf inspired her novel Orlando, following a gender-changing hero across centuries at Knole, the palatial ancestral home Sackville-West adored but could not as a daughter inherit, and so had to leave while a male cousin moved in. Knole is also now a National Trust property. This month the trust bought a first edition presentation copy of the book, inscribed by Woolf to Edward Sackville-West, the cousin who inherited the property. The trust will publish a new guidebook next year telling the LGBTQ history of some of its properties, and put on a range of events under the headline Prejudice and Pride, including Sutton House Queered, a year-long programme at the property in Hackney built as a Tudor merchant’s mansion and which by the 1980s had become a heavily graffitied anarchist squat.
Sarah Waters, author of the bestselling historical novel Tipping the Velvet, who is working with the trust on the project, said: “These days we can all be a bit bolder about exploring and enjoying the UK’s rich heritage of sex and gender diversity. And I’d argue that without an awareness of that heritage our experience of certain National Trust properties is incomplete.” Displays at Smallhythe Place in Kent will focus not on the glamorous Victorian actor Ellen Terry but on the women her daughter, Edy Craig, shared her life and home with. In June there will be performances of The Boy, a dramatisation of De Profundis, the anguished letter Oscar Wilde wrote to his lover Bosie from Reading jail. Simon Murray, director of the National Trust, said the year’s programme – on which it is working with Leicester University – was only the beginning of its efforts to tackle more complex aspects of its history, including women’s suffrage in 2018 and the bicentenary of the Peterloo Massacre in 2019. “Over the next few years we will be exploring some of the complex and often more difficult aspects of the history of our places, stories we have perhaps shied away from, but which are important to our understanding of their history,” he said."
2016-12-21T01:33:02Z,uk-news,UK news,UK police forces on high alert after Berlin attack,"Police forces across Britain are reviewing their security plans after the Berlin Christmas market attack and remain on high alert. The threat level in London remains at “severe”, meaning an attack is considered highly likely, the Metropolitan police said on Tuesday. A Downing Street spokesman said: “The safety and security of British citizens is the government’s number one priority. Clearly in the light of what has happened in Berlin, police will be reviewing what is in place.” Theresa May sent a message of condolence to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Monday night. “She expressed that her thoughts are with the people of Berlin and we stand ready to assist in any way we can,” a spokesman said. Greater Manchester police said they had strengthened their presence at Christmas markets across the city. Scotland Yard said an attack with a large vehicle had already been considered as a possible scenario prior to the Berlin lorry attack.
“The Metropolitan police has detailed plans for protecting public events over the Christmas and new year period. As a matter of routine … we review our plans after attacks overseas, and we are doing so at present following the awful incidents in Berlin and Ankara last night,” the Met said. The Met also said it would it be bringing forward enhanced security measures for the Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace, with the ceremony set to take place on Thursday and then again on Christmas Eve. The Met said it would be implementing road closures during the ceremonies. Large numbers of people will be in London around the festive period as post-Christmas sales start, while more than 100,000 revellers are expected to attend the New Year’s Eve fireworks display on the banks of the Thames. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, sought to reassure Londoners and visitors that the Met would review its security plans in light of Monday night’s events. “Keeping everyone safe remains the highest priority for the Met commissioner and for me,” he said. Khan added: “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the awful suspected attack on Berlin last night, particularly those who were injured, the families and friends of those who were killed and all the emergency responders. “We don’t yet have the full details, but this appears to have been a horrific and cowardly act of terror. All Londoners stand in solidarity with the people of Berlin today. This was an attack on our shared values, freedoms and way of life.”
Britain’s experience of Islamist terrorists using vehicles to stage attacks dates back to 2007, when a car was driven into Glasgow airport in an attempted suicide bombing. So-called “hostile vehicle mitigation measures” have been in place for several years. The threat to Christmas events and shoppers is seen by UK counter-terrorism officials as part of the severe threat level Britain faces. Nothing seen so far in Isis propaganda, which has inspired previous attacks, has urged plots targeting Christmas events. But there are calls for attacks against westerners at any time of the year. Counter-terrorism officials believe an attack against the UK is highly likely, in keeping with the current threat level. They are understood to be tracking and investigating plots they fear may be attempts to cause mass casualties in Britain. In Manchester, police said they had strengthened their presence at the city’s Christmas markets, which have almost 350 stalls spread across 10 sites. Assistant chief constable Debbie Ford said police already had a visible operation in place around the markets and in other key areas. She said: “We will be working in line with the national response and have strengthened our policing presence at the Manchester Christmas markets and stepped up visible patrols, to ensure that people feel safe to go about their daily lives. “I would like to stress at this point that there is absolutely no information or intelligence suggesting any attack is imminent in Greater Manchester.” Dave Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands police, tweeted:
Birmingham’s Christmas market, which claims to be the largest outside Germany and Austria, had concrete barriers installed to guard against terrorist attacks like that in Nice in July, when a 19-tonne cargo truck was driven into crowds celebrating Bastille Day. It is estimated that 5.5 million people will visit the market before it closes on 29 December. A West Midlands police spokesman said: “A number of security measures were agreed before the market opened, including installing some concrete bollards at a number of locations.” Supt Andy Parsons said the bollards were part of the original security plan and not a result of any specific intelligence. “It is a busy time of year for the city and we want to ensure a safe and enjoyable time for everyone who visits over the festive period,” he said. “Our policing tactics and security measures are constantly reviewed and we, along with our partners, are working around the clock to keep our cities as safe as can be.”
North Yorkshire police said their plans were constantly under review, and road closures and increased patrols were in place to protect people around York Christmas market and pedestrianised areas. A Merseyside police spokesperson asked people to remain vigilant during the festive season but added that police had a plan to ensure people’s safety. This month Northumbria police were criticised by shoppers for the presence of armed officers at Newcastle’s Christmas market. Visitors complained on social media that officers with guns should not be at an event with so many children. Nic King wrote on Facebook: “I don’t want to see guns the size of my child when Christmas shopping and these images have put me off going into Newcastle.” Northumbria police said the armed officers served to reassure the public. Police Scotland said their plans were being assessed after the events in Berlin. Assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins said: “Police Scotland has detailed plans in place to ensure the safety of the public at a wide range of festive and major events. “There is no intelligence at this time to suggest a threat to any specific event in Scotland. Any suspicious activity should be reported. Police Scotland work with a wide range of partners including the UK counter-terrorism network to ensure people can go about their lives safely and securely at all times.” National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for protective security, deputy assistant commissioner Lucy D’Orsi, said it was “routine” to review and assess security measures following incidents like the attacks in Germany. “I would like to reassure everyone that the police, along with the security and intelligence services, are tirelessly working together to deal with the terrorist threat to keep the public safe,” she said."
2016-12-21T07:00:11Z,uk-news,UK news,London garden bridge: accusation of conflict of interest over public funds,"London’s troubled garden bridge project has been accused of benefiting from a significant conflict of interest after it emerged that a senior official helped win millions of pounds of public money for the project after accepting a job with the engineering company behind it. Richard de Cani, at the time head of planning for Transport for London, played a key role in securing £7m in additional funding from his organisation and the Department for Transport last February. According to correspondence obtained by the Architects Journal under a freedom of information request, De Cani was serving a notice period with TfL, having accepted a senior job at Arup. The global engineering firm, where De Cani is now head of planning for the UK, Middle East and Africa regions, is the engineer behind the planned £185m bridge across the Thames. The Thomas Heatherwick-designed project, intended to run 367 metres from South Bank to Temple and featuring 270 trees and thousands of plants, has been granted £60m in public funding between TfL and the DfT, to be released in stages. According to the documents, the terms of the deal with the Garden Bridge Trust, the charity behind the project, will see the transport department and TfL each hand over £3.5m to the project in February after the signing of a construction deal. The correspondence shows that De Cani’s role included persuading the DfT to release its share after arguing the trust had all the necessary money and consents needed to build the structure, something which remains in doubt. While there is no evidence any of this £7m would have gone directly to Arup, the engineering firm would be expected to benefit if the bridge is eventually built. Tom Copley, a Labour member of the London assembly, said he planned to write to the head of TfL, Mike Brown, to ask about the perceived conflict of interest.
“We’re not talking small fry, we’re talking millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money handed over when there were still crucial concerns about the trust’s ability to meet the conditions of its contract,” he said. “This project has been cloaked in a thick smoke screen from the very start. This is only going to reduce public confidence that their money has been put to proper use.” While the bridge is touted by supporters as a tourism and transport boon for central London, it has faced criticism for using significant sums of public money on a river link in a part of the city that is already well served, which will be privately run and closed at night and for occasional corporate events. The project has faced significant planning and logistics delays, with the start of construction already at least a year late and senior politicians debating whether it should go ahead at all. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has asked the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge to examine whether it provides value for the public money committed, almost £40m of which has already been spent. Khan has pledged that the bridge will receive no more public funds. In October, a National Audit Office report into the project said that ministers repeatedly handed over more money despite official advice against doing so. TfL said suggestions that De Cani had a conflict of interest were “completely unfounded”. A spokeswoman said: “Our funding agreement with the trust requires us to make grant payments once certain milestones have been reached, one of which was the signing of the construction contract. We have kept the Department for Transport informed of these payments because of their financial contribution to the project.” A DfT spokesman said: “There is no conflict of interest here. The funding agreement between TfL and the Garden Bridge Trust, drawn up in 2015, made clear that once the construction contract was signed further funding would be released to the trust.”"
2016-12-21T11:45:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Four men from Midlands deny plotting to carry out terrorist attack,"Four men from the Midlands have denied plotting to carry out a terrorist attack. Naweed Ali, 28, and Khobaib Hussain, 24, both of Sparkhill in Birmingham, and Mohibur Rahman, 32, and Tahir Aziz, 37, of Stoke-on-Trent, entered not guilty pleas on Wednesday when they appeared via videolink at the Old Bailey in central London. The men were arrested on 26 August in a series of raids in Birmingham and Stoke. They are accused of a single count of preparing for terrorist acts, contrary to section 5 of the Terrorism Act, between 25 May and 27 August this year. Rahman and Ali appeared via videolink from Belmarsh prison in south-east London. Hussain and Aziz appeared via videolink from Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes. They spoke only to confirm their names and enter their pleas. All four were all remanded in custody. The trial is scheduled to begin on 27 February and is expected to last eight to 10 weeks."
2016-12-21T14:15:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Changing of the guard security tightened after Berlin attack,"Security has been tightened around Buckingham Palace for the changing of the guard – one of London’s most popular tourist spectacles – following the Berlin attack. Roads around the palace were closed on Wednesday, causing traffic jams, and there was a heightened police presence for the ceremony, as Scotland Yard introduced a new security procedure earlier than planned. The mid-morning ceremony was a curious mix of pageantry and modern policing, as officers of the Queen’s Guard wearing bearskin hats marched past armed police officers, watched by Met officers on horses and bicycles, and the pipes and drums of the band competed with the clatter of a police helicopter circling overhead. Spectators were largely supportive of the heightened police presence. “It doesn’t bother me – I would rather be safe after what’s been happening on the continent,” said Janice Butcher, who was visiting London from east Yorkshire with her husband for a Christmas break. “I’d think there would be more police after what happened in Berlin.”
The regularity with which terrorists have struck in Europe has added to the nervousness of counter-terrorism officials in Britain, amid fears an attack in the UK is a matter of when not if. Already this year UK authorities believe they have stopped four attack plots and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre which sets the terrorist threat level, assesses it is highly likely there will be a terrorist atrocity. The increased security measures at Buckingham Palace, while not based directly on any specific intelligence, are aimed at deterring any potential attackers. “It seems a little bit serious – it makes me a little bit uncomfortable,” said Tommy, visiting with family and friends from Hong Kong, who did not want to give his surname. “We’re not used to such high security – in Hong Kong it’s not usual to see so many policemen standing around for such a big event.” But he added that it was understandable following the Berlin attack. The new measures will be in place for every changing of the guard, which happens three or four times a week, for the next three months, with surrounding roads closed from 10.45am to 12.30pm each time the ceremony takes place. The Met stressed that there was no specific threat but said it was tightening security as a precaution. Commander Simon Bray said: “Police continue to work in partnership to minimise disruption, but the priority is to ensure the safety and security of those who live, work and visit London.” In 2016, despite the resources thrown at them in Iraq and Syria and ramped up security efforts in Europe, Islamist terrorists struck or hatched plots in France, Belgium, the UK, and this week struck with deadly effect in Berlin, Germany. The threat level in the UK for Islamist terrorism has been at severe, the second highest, since August 2014.
On Wednesday, the road closures led to widespread traffic jams, and black-cab drivers said they expected these to become routine. “I’ve had a few people get out because I couldn’t get anywhere,” said James Baglin, a black-cab driver, adding that he would be working different hours or changing his routes to avoid losing money. “You can understand why they have done it … If that’s what they have got to do because of the current world you can’t begrudge them that, because they’re putting the public first.” Mark Twort, another black-cab driver, agreed that the traffic was worse than usual. “It’s unfortunate, but I suppose these are the times we’re living in,” he said."
2016-12-21T14:39:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Police hunting train surfer calling himself 'the Silver Shadow',"Police are searching for a man who calls himself “the Silver Shadow” after he was filmed travelling on top of a train moving at up to 70mph. British transport police said the man, who appears to be in his 20s, put his own life and the lives of others on the train at risk when he climbed on to its roof on 11 December. The man was seen boarding the exterior of the train in between two carriages at Rock Ferry station in Birkenhead, Merseyside, at about 1.30pm and waiting for the doors to close. Seven minutes later CCTV captured him on top of of the train at Bromborough Rake station, waving at startled people on the platform, before he climbed down at 1.39pm. He concealed his face as he briefly spoke to booking office staff at the station, telling them he had travelled from Birmingham and was called the Silver Shadow. Andrew Richardson, the investigating police officer, said that even attempting to get on to the roof of a train was “a nonsensical and idiotic thing to do”. He said: “The man concealed himself between two carriages above electrified rails and so one slip could have easily killed him and endangered the lives of those on the train. “This isn’t cool, it isn’t funny. It’s dangerous and we will not stand for it. If you recognise the man in these pictures, please get in touch.” Police are appealing for anyone with information about the incident to contact them. The man could face charges of trespassing on railways and endangering his own safety. • This article was amended on 22 December 2016. An earlier version, relying on information provided by British transport police, referred to a train moving at “up to 100mph”. The maximum speed on the line in question is 70mph."
2016-12-21T15:22:52Z,uk-news,UK news,St Helens priest robbed at gunpoint,"A well-liked priest was left “extremely shaken” after he was robbed at gunpoint and ordered to empty a church safe, police have said. Three men, one believed to have been holding a handgun, made off with charity donations for a children’s orphanage in the robbery at about 6.25pm on Tuesday. The assailants rang the doorbell of Father Peter Hannah’s residence in St Helens, Merseyside, and demanded money before marching him to Vincent de Paul church. There they ordered him to empty the church safe, before making off on foot. The priest was not assaulted or injured during the incident, Merseyside police said. Local residents and churchgoers expressed disgust at the robbery and said it was the second time the priest had been held by armed men. Volunteers at the church said Father Hannah had been robbed at knifepoint several years ago. Angela Thompson, a parishioner at the church, said the crime would be “difficult to forgive”. “I am absolutely disgusted. The money was being donated to an orphanage,” she said. “It is the lowest of the low to go and take money from a priest like that. He is a lovely man and you could go to him for absolutely anything.” Ian Bradley, a local resident, said he was in disbelief and would donate money to replace part of the stolen kitty. “I heard about the robbery and that the money was for an orphanage. I was disgusted and surprised someone would rob and target a church. I can’t imagine what’s going on in people’s minds who would do such a thing.” A spokesman for the archdiocese of Liverpool said: “Our thoughts and prayers are with Father Peter Hannah, who was not injured but left shaken by the events of yesterday evening. “Such events are an attack on the whole of the worshipping community who in these last weeks have given of their time to raise money for an orphanage in Zimbabwe. The repercussions of this act will be felt far beyond the town of St Helens.” Officers carried out an extensive search of the area but were unable to trace the three men. CCTV is being examined and house-to-house inquiries are being conducted in an attempt to identify and catch the offenders. The three were described as white and aged between 17 and 21. All three had their faces covered during the incident. DS Chris Burrows, of St Helens CID, said: “I am sure the people of St Helens will be shocked and saddened to discover the church has been targeted in this way. “It is a focal point for many in our community, particularly at this time of year, and it is heartbreaking to think the offenders have taken money which we understand was a charitable collection intended for a children’s orphanage. “While he was thankfully not injured, this would have been a very frightening incident for the priest. I would like to reassure people who live locally that we are doing everything we can to trace the offenders.” Anyone with information about the robbery should contact detectives at St Helens CID on 0151 777 6811 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2016-12-21T17:06:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Conviction of man jailed for murder overturned after 16 years,"The conviction of a man who has served 16 years in jail for a murder he denies has been quashed by the court of appeal. In November 2000, Jonathan Embleton was one of three men convicted of the murder of Middlesbrough pensioner Mohammed Sharif in April 1999. He was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years. On Wednesday, three judges at the court of appeal in London ruled that new information had thrown into doubt key evidence and therefore the conviction was unsafe. Embleton, now 42, has always maintained that he was with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Tracy Wright-King, at the time of Sharif’s murder. But Wright-King was unable to recall whether he had been with her that night. Another woman, Lindsey Clark, claimed Embleton had visited her house at around 4am on the night of the murder with a bleeding hand. But Embleton argued that he had gone to her home on another occasion after getting into a fight. Speaking on Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, sitting with Mr Justice Turner and Mrs Justice O’Farrell, said the disclosure of a police report that was not presented at the original trial had undermined Clark’s evidence. She refused a prosecution request for a retrial. An officer who visited Clark before she made her statement recorded that she claimed Embleton told her he had “hit a lad”, that his girlfriend had been with him at the time and that he was going to go to hospital. Records show that Embleton assaulted someone and visited hospital for a knuckle injury days after the murder took place. “We conclude that Mrs Clark’s evidence was pivotal to the prosecution case against the appellant, in shoring up the otherwise weak case against him,” Lady Justice Macur said. “The new disclosure throws her evidence into doubt on a crucial point. The remaining evidence is dubious. We are not satisfied that the conviction is safe.” Sharif, a scrap collector, was killed in his garden after he confronted men he suspected of stealing from him. He suffered a severe neck injury, a fractured eye socket and four broken ribs. His attackers left him on the ground, where he died six hours later from asphyxiation. An initial appeal against Embleton’s conviction was dismissed in April 2003. He applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, in 2010; the body referred the case back to the appeal court last year, with 14 boxes of new evidence put forward for consideration. Embleton’s original co-defendants, Mark Graham and Stephen Ham, remain convicted."
2016-12-21T19:51:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Wakefield council and police criticised over 'child sexual abuse video' case,"A family court judge has criticised “serious and systemic flaws” in how West Yorkshire police and Wakefield council handled a case in which a girl and her mother were wrongly identified as appearing in a child sexual abuse video. The police and council have paid £20,000 in damages and Wakefield council apologised for the “horrendous” allegation, after the girl and her brother were kept in care for more than nine months. It emerged that the police had known for months that the video did not show the girl and her mother before the children were returned. Judgments in the family court are usually private, but Mr Justice Cobb decided to make his ruling, issued this week, public on the condition that the family involved was not identified. The two children, a boy and a girl, were removed and placed in foster care in February 2015 after their parents were arrested in relation to an investigation into child sexual abuse content. During the search, police found a video that they believed showed the mother engaged in a sex act with the daughter and a photograph they believed showed the daughter. The children were kept out of any contact with their parents for several days after being taken into care, despite expressing “very considerable distress”, the judge wrote, and a lack of coordination between the police and safeguarding authority meant that the girl was medically examined twice in three days. Forensic experts told the officer leading the investigation, DS Hudson, in late March that video analysis had “eliminated” the mother as a possible candidate for being the woman in the video. In June, evidence emerged showing the video had been shot in the US, rather than West Yorkshire and that it conclusively did not show either the woman or her daughter. But West Yorkshire police did not share this crucial evidence with social workers or anyone else involved in the case for almost five months. Even the police lawyers were only told of the new evidence in passing in August and were only made aware of how crucial it was in November. In the meantime, the police continued to investigate, interviewing the parents under caution and showing them the photo of the girl in the video despite knowing it was not their daughter. DS Hudson “struggled to shake off” his conviction that the video showed the mother and daughter, the court found. At a meeting in August, the judge found, he “misled the local authority” by encouraging them to spot similarities between the woman in the video and the mother. “At that time, he knew that the mother had been definitively excluded from consideration,” Cobb wrote. The children’s father pleaded guilty to having downloaded images of child sexual abuse in August and was later sentenced to jail. The mother did not learn that she had been cleared until November and her children remained in foster care until mid-December. The authority later accepted “without reservation” that she neither abused her daughter nor allowed her daughter to be abused by the father. “The damage has been significant; for a period of many months, two children were separated from their mother against whom allegations of the most serious form of abuse were levelled, while all the while, evidence was available which served to exonerate her,” Cobb wrote. Wakefield council and West Yorkshire police acknowledged a series of failings in their handling of the case. The judge found that although it had been correct to take the children into care when their parents were first arrested, the way the investigation was handled led to the authorities “profoundly and obviously” breaching the human rights of the mother and her children. Among the failings, he said, was “a casual regard, and in some respects total disregard, of ordinary principles of good professional practice”."
2016-12-21T21:42:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Belfast Christmas market sealed off after stabbing incident,"Belfast’s Christmas market has been sealed off after a man was seriously injured in a stabbing incident close by. Ambulances rushed to Belfast City Hall around 8pm on Wednesday after reports that a man, believed to be in his 40s, was found stabbed close to the market. The Northern Ireland ambulance service said: “We got the call before 8pm to reports that a man in his 40s was stabbed at the city hall. We sent a rapid response paramedic along with our A&E crew. The patient was treated at the scene and was taken to the Royal Victoria hospital where he is in a serious condition.” The Police Service of Northern Ireland also confirmed that a man had been found at Donegall Square North close to city hall with a stab wound. It is not believed that the incident was terrorism related. Adrian Huston said he and his wife Felicity were walking through the stalls at the Christmas market when they saw a man beyond the barriers at city hall with his head drooped to his chest. “From what we could see he was a very bad colour, very grey. He was just standing there very still and there was a steward from the market standing with him talking to him. We couldn’t see that he was injured but he seemed to be in a bad way,” Huston told the Belfastlive website. The attack happened just after a musical display involving a group of drummers at the city hall gates. Belfast’s deputy lord mayor Guy Spence condemned the attack. He tweeted: “Hearing there’s been a stabbing at our Christmas Market in Belfast. Liaising with PSNI in City Hall, no justification for this heinous act.” The Continental Christmas market has become a regular feature of Belfast’s cultural and social life during the festive season with trades and stall owners from all over Europe doing business in the grounds of city hall."
2016-12-22T09:55:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Appeal launched over boys who vanished 20 years ago in Solihull,"Police have launched a fresh appeal for information surrounding the disappearance of two boys 20 years ago. Patrick Warren, 11, and David Spencer, 13, were last spotted at a petrol station close to their homes in Chelmsley Wood, Solihull, just after midnight on 27 December 1996. David’s brother, Lee O’Toole, who was nine when his brother disappeared, urged anyone with information to help bring closure for his family. Now 29 and a father himself, O’Toole said he still suffered nightmares about the day his brother disappeared. “I’ve come to terms with the fact David is dead but I wake every night wondering what happened to him and how he died,” he said. “I just want to find him so he can be laid to rest and we can have somewhere to go and visit him.” O’Toole gave permission for the police to release the first piece of moving footage of David, filmed at a boxing match, in the hope it might jog someone’s memory.
The two boys were seen by a police officer playing with friends by a frozen lake on Boxing Day afternoon. The officer warned the boys that playing on the lake was dangerous and told them to go home. The pair then returned to David’s house, where they told his family they would stay with Patrick’s brother that evening. The last sighting of them was at a Shell petrol station just after midnight, where a member of staff gave them a packet of biscuits. The boys were reported missing in the early hours of the next day. Patrick’s Christmas present, a red Apollo bicycle, was later discovered hidden in an area used for storing commercial bins at the back of the petrol station. In 2006, Brian Field, who was jailed in 2001 for the murder of the schoolboy Roy Tutill, was questioned by police in connection with the case but was never charged. In 2003, a 37-year-old man was arrested over the boys’ disappearance, but later released on police bail. DCI Caroline Marsh, from the homicide team at West Midlands police, said the force would never close the case. “I do believe that the boys are deceased and something very serious must have happened to them,” she said. “If the boys were murdered someone knows who is responsible for that and I appeal to anyone with information to come forward.” She added: “Our thoughts are with the families as the 20th anniversary approaches, and we continue to support them through our family liaison officers. Until we find out what happened to David and Patrick, this investigation will never close.”"
2016-12-22T10:27:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Charles: rising intolerance risks repeat of horrors of past,"The Prince of Wales has warned that the rise of populist extremism and intolerance towards other faiths risks repeating the “horrors” of the Holocaust. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s religious Thought for the Day slot, the prince delivered an outspoken attack against religious hatred and pleaded for a welcoming attitude to those fleeing persecution. He said: “We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith. All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s.“My parents’ generation fought and died in a battle against intolerance, monstrous extremism and inhuman attempts to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe.” The prince did not mention any politicians by name, but his address will be seen by some as a veiled reference to the election of Donald Trump in the US, the rise of the far right in Europe, and increasingly hostile attitudes to refugees in the UK. “That nearly 70 years later we should still be seeing such evil persecution is to me beyond all belief,” he said. “We owe it to those who suffered and died so horribly not to repeat the horrors of the past.”
Prince Charles said religious hatred was on the increase, leading to a rise in refugees fleeing persecution. “According to the United Nations, 5.8 million more people abandoned their homes in 2015 than the year before, bringing the annual total to a staggering 65.3 million. That is almost equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom,” he said. “The suffering doesn’t end when they arrive seeking refuge in a foreign land.” The prince urged listeners this Christmas to remember “how the story of the Nativity unfolds with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution”. He added: “We might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina, he did so because he too was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship.”
The prince recalled meeting a Jesuit priest from Syria. “He told me of mass kidnappings in parts of Syria and Iraq, and how he feared that Christians would be driven en masse out of lands described in the Bible,” he said. “He thought it quite possible there would be no Christians in Iraq within five years.” He continued: “The scale of religious persecution around the world is not widely appreciated. Nor is it limited to Christians in the troubled regions of the Middle East.” He then cited a recent report that found an increase in attacks on minority faiths. The Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, welcomed the prince’s intervention. He said it was “obvious” which politicians the prince was referring to, “but for protocol reasons he can’t say”. Moraes told the Guardian: “It was a good intervention I think when the right and rightwing UK newspapers dominate the anti-refugee, intolerance, and anti-EU protectionist narrative.” The prince was invited to speak as part of BBC Radio 4’s religious programming. It was the third time the heir to the throne had given the address. He first broadcast in the Thought for the Day slot on the anniversary of VE Day in 1995, and did so again in January 2000 to mark the new millennium. He pre-recorded his message on Monday at his official London home, Clarence House, before it was announced that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had delayed plans to travel to Norfolk for Christmas, because of illness. The prince did not mention the health of his parents."
2016-12-22T11:16:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Court to decide whether activist can sue Trump golf course,"A court in Edinburgh is to decide whether an environmental activist can sue Donald Trump’s golf resort near Aberdeen for breach of privacy and damages after she was apparently filmed without her consent on the course. Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by the US president-elect, is expected to fiercely contest the action at Edinburgh sheriff court on Thursday. A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a long-time critic of the environmental and community impact of the resort, has accused Trump’s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course. The Guardian revealed in August that TIGC had breached the UK’s strict laws on data protection and privacy after it failed to register with the information commissioner’s office (ICO), despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers, guests, staff and suppliers. The resort insisted this was due to a clerical error. The case results from an incident when Beyts, 62, and a friend used a public footpath across the Trump course to reach the sand dunes and beach that border the golf links. As they returned from their walk, Beyts says she was challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. Three days later Beyts was visited at home by two police officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump’s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. Beyts’s lawyer, Mike Dailly, the principal solicitor at Govan Law Centre in Glasgow, told the Guardian: “This is a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the golf course has admitted that they weren’t registered with the ICO.” Dailly has written twice to TIGCS advising it that Beyts is seeking £3,000 damages for breach of privacy and for being “deeply distressed” at being filmed. Her prosecution raised fresh concerns among local activists that Trump’s staff were deliberately targeting his critics and monitoring their movements on the resort."
2016-12-22T11:47:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Man's death after mass brawl prompts murder investigation,"Detectives have launched a murder investigation over the death of a man after a mass brawl outside a lapdancing club. Police were called to a report of 10 men fighting outside the bar in Altrincham town centre at about 2.40am on Thursday. Greater Manchester police said officers found a 31-year-old man with serious head injuries. He was taken to hospital, where he later died. On Thursday night police announced that two men, aged 25 and 22, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, section 18 assault, affray and possession of an offensive weapon. DI Neil Coop, said: “We have two men in custody but we are still in the early stages of the murder investigation. “If anyone has any information about the set of events, which led to a man’s life being cruelly taken away from him and his family, please contact us as soon as possible.” On Thursday morning, forensic officers were working in and around two police tents outside the club – Totties, in The Causeway. A Home Office post-mortem examination is due to take place to establish the exact cause of death. Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said: “This is such a tragic situation, made even more devastating by the fact it is days before Christmas and what should be a happy time turned into violence. “My thoughts are with the man’s family and our specially trained officers are supporting them through this difficult time.” Totties, the only lapdancing bar in the Manchester borough of Trafford, has been open since 2002. It was granted a fresh licence in 2011, when it had to re-apply under a new policy giving councils more control over lapdancing clubs. No objections were raised to the application, the Manchester Evening News reported at the time, and the bar’s proprietor claimed it had a “zero call-out rate from the police”. Anyone with information is asked to telephone police on 0161 856 6777 or 101, quoting reference number 210 of 22/12/16, or to call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2016-12-22T11:53:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Planners reject Donald Trump's revised plans for Scottish golf resort,"Donald Trump’s plans to expand his Aberdeenshire golf resort by building 2,750 new homes and holiday flats have suffered a significant blow. In a major victory for the president-elect’s opponents in Scotland, senior planning officials have rejected Trump’s bid to build a far less ambitious and cheaper version of the vast holiday and sports resort he originally fought for in 2008. The officials appointed by Scottish government ministers to review Aberdeenshire’s development plan have decided Trump must stick to his original master plan for a major hotel, timeshare and sports complex – one he priced then at between £750m and £1bn. They have recommended to Scottish ministers and the local council that Trump should also be told to build hundreds of affordable homes, a new primary school, other community facilities and a new roundabout on the main A90 road nearby at his own expense – as he had originally promised. Trump should also be forced to accept “robust” environmental checks on the site because of its proximity to legally protected dunes, they said. Their report has been released as lawyers acting for Trump were in court in Edinburgh on Thursday to oppose a civil action brought by an anti-Trump protester for breaching her right to privacy.
The rejection of Trump’s revised plans raises further questions about the fate of the resort, about 10 miles north of Aberdeen. Following his election as the next US president, Trump promised to divest himself of his vast property empire and investments. He has yet to disclose who will take control over his businesses or when. His neighbours in Aberdeenshire believe his son Eric will run that resort and the family’s second resort, the Open championship course and hotel at Turnberry in Ayrshire. Despite heavy opposition from Scotland’s environment agencies, Trump won planning approval in 2008 to build across rare legally protected coastal dunes in Aberdeenshire only because his resort would be an economic investment of national importance and would employ 1,200 people. It would involve a multistorey five-star hotel with spa and conference centre, two 18-hole courses, a golf academy, riding stables, shops, and a sprawling housing development involving time-share apartments, private villas and homes for local people. But after admitting that “the world had crashed” after the 2008 recession, Trump dropped those plans, instead building just a single 18-hole golf course with a driving range and a small clubhouse, and converting the estate’s main house into a small 19-bedroom boutique hotel. He also withdrew without agreement from a multi-agency environmental monitoring group which was set up as part of the 2008 planning approval. Company accounts suggest he has spent only £38.5m on the resort so far, with 95 full-time equivalent jobs. He repeatedly claimed he would not build anything more until plans for an offshore windfarm project several miles south of his resort were dropped, entering into a bitter and public feud over renewables with the then first minister Alex Salmond. Even so, after lodging plans for a second golf course and an extension to the boutique hotel, Trump then applied early last year for outline planning permission to build 850 private homes and 1,900 “leisure accommodation units”. Aberdeenshire council then included that proposal as a normal development in the belief it was covered by the 2008 planning approval. The planning reporters have now ruled that this scheme should be dropped. They said: “The outline consent issued on 16 December 2008 was granted for exceptional reasons based on the predicted social and economic benefits of the proposed development.” The development plans should not “offer or imply” support for a different plan. The Trump organisation said in a statement: “We remain committed to maximising economic benefits in the current economic and market conditions, locally and nationally. The report reaffirms our outline planning permission for 500 houses within the local development plan which has been endorsed by the reporters. Any future proposals that we may bring forward will go through due process.” Martin Ford, a councillor whose casting vote on an Aberdeenshire local committee in 2008 forced Trump into a major battle to win approval for the site, said the reporters’ decision was “about as restrictive as it could be for planning policy pertaining to Mr Trump’s land. “The reporters’ text is clearly intended to be a barrier to any attempt by Mr Trump to cherry pick from amongst the elements consented in 2008 or to use that consent as a Trojan horse to justify an alternative scheme.” His colleague Debra Storr, a former councillor who was also heavily involved in opposing the original application in 2008, said: “The Trump organisation has attempted to subvert the planning system at every step and hitherto has been allowed to get away with this by local and national government. I am pleased that Aberdeenshire council’s attempt to simply include the land at Menie into the local plan as normal development land has failed.”"
2016-12-22T12:15:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Nick Clegg accused of using emotive language in Sheffield tree row,"South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner has accused Nick Clegg of using irresponsible, emotional and exaggerated language in his opposition to Sheffield city council’s controversial tree-felling programme. The long-running battle over Sheffield’s trees attracted national media attention last month when two women in their 70s were arrested for trying to prevent trees on their road from being chopped down, after they were woken at 5am to move their cars. “In scenes you would expect to see in Putin’s Russia, rather than a Sheffield suburb, council contractors and police descended on Rustlings Road under the cover of darkness, dragged people out of bed to move their cars and detained peaceful protesters – all to chop down eight trees,” the former deputy prime minister wrote in the Sheffield Star. Responding to a series of written questions from a Liberal Democrat councillor, the Labour PCC, Dr Alan Billings, described Clegg’s comments as nonsense. “To speak about ‘a premeditated ambush’ is not helpful and seems designed to heighten emotions in a quite gratuitous fashion,” he said. “This emotive language was also employed by the MP for Hallam, Nick Clegg, when he spoke about people being ‘dragged from their beds’ by the police. This undermines trust in the police service and I hope he will think twice before uttering such nonsense in the future.” Sheffield city council later apologised for the dawn operation, which was undertaken by the private contractor Amey, and Billings has since criticised it for involving the police and causing “reputational damage to the force at a time when it cannot afford it”. Billings added in a later statement: “I have said before that I do not believe the police should have been put in a position where they were drawn into the operation on Rustlings Road. Equally, I do not think it is very responsible to use the kind of emotional and exaggerated language that has been used with respect to police involvement.” Campaigners claim 4,000 trees across the city have been chopped down since a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal with Amey was signed in 2012. The council argues that the trees earmarked for felling are either diseased or dangerous, or have roots that prevent people in wheelchairs and people pushing buggies from using pavements. The local authority has said that maintaining the trees that are damaging pavements would cost more than £50,000, which is “not viable” given the cuts to its budget by central government. It has to find £51m of savings this financial year. The deal to maintain the city’s roads and pavements, it is claimed, will “see Sheffield’s roads transformed from some of the worst in the country to the best”. The contract was first negotiated by the Liberal Democrat-led council, before being signed after Labour gained control of the council in 2011. While Clegg declined to comment personally, a Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “This is yet another a distraction tactic by a Labour politician attempting to shift the debate from the real issue. Before the PCC dismisses genuine complaints as ‘nonsense’, we would ask him what has undermined trust in the force more: the words of an MP in a local paper or the actions of Sheffield city council’s Labour leadership, which put frontline officers in a compromising position and led to many people drawing the understandable conclusion that South Yorkshire police were being used by the council and its contractors for unjustifiable operations?”"
2016-12-22T13:31:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother sexually assaulted in Stockport as children heard screams,"Detectives have launched an investigation after a woman was sexually assaulted in her home while her young children heard her screams. The 35-year-old woman was in bed when she heard a repeated knocking at the house’s front door shortly before 10.30pm on Wednesday, police said. She opened the door and the stranger grabbed her by the throat and pushed her to the ground. He then sexually assaulted her before fleeing because of her loud screams, Greater Manchester police said. Detectives appealed for information about the violent attack and said additional police officers would patrol the area in Heald Green, Stockport. DI Julia Bowden of GMP’s Stockport borough said: “This was a terrifying attack for both the victim and her children who heard their mother’s screams. “They are currently being supported by specially trained officers. Incidents of this nature are horrifying but rare and we are doing everything in our power to find the man responsible. “We have a team of highly skilled detectives working round the clock and there will be additional officers patrolling the area. “I would urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time to please contact us immediately.” Police said the attacker was described as Asian, about 20 years old and 6ft with a slim build. He was wearing a dark green zip-up hooded top and dark blue baggy jeans. Officers searched the surrounding area immediately after the attack and inquiries were continuing on Thursday, the force said. The incident comes five weeks after a 22-year-old woman was raped at knifepoint in her home in Old Trafford, Manchester. The two attacks have not been linked."
2016-12-22T14:04:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Barbara: fears over Christmas travel as Met Office issues warnings,"Storm Barbara is threatening to play havoc with Christmas getaway plans as winds are forecast to reach up to 90mph. Around 12m cars are expected to hit the roads on Friday and conditions are likely to be challenging across most of the UK, with predictions of heavy rain adding to concerns. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for all UK regions apart from east and south-east England (including London), alerting people to the risk of poor driving conditions and surface water flooding. In Scotland, where amber “be prepared” warnings have been issued, winds could hit 90mph, leading to restrictions on bridges and ferry crossings and possible disruption to power supplies. Elsewhere, gusts of 60-70mph are expected. Grahame Madge, a Met Office spokesman, said: “The main part of Barbara will be further north. However, there’s a squally front moving across the UK associated with Barbara, which will bring strong winds and sharp bursts of rain. “We have issued a yellow [be aware] warning, given that there will be many people on the roads, extending from the north-east right down to the south-west.”
The RAC suggested people should travel on Thursday or on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, when conditions are forecast to be more forgiving. Rod Dennis, spokesman for RAC Traffic Watch, said: “The weather is taking a decided turn for the worse as we near Christmas itself, and drivers are going to need to be on their guard. “Heavy downpours and extremely gusty winds will join forces to make the going tough for anyone driving on Friday especially. Early indications are that more storms could also roll in in the days to come.” The winds are expected to gradually ease during Friday evening, except across the Northern Isles, and Saturday will be more settled before a further spell of windy weather moves in on Christmas Day. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and the West Midlands on 25 December, with gusts expected to hit 50-60mph.
Scotland experienced high winds on Thursday, resulting in the cancellation of some ferry services. Fog caused disruption to flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports on Thursday morning but later cleared up. The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, said its members were fully prepared for the possibility of storms, floods, snow, sleet and high winds. People who have power cuts are advised to dial 105 – a new, free national phone line – if the weather affects their electricity supply. Despite the winds, the UK is still on course for an unseasonably mild Christmas Day. Temperatures are expected to hit double figures across most of the country and 14C, or even higher, in London and Aberdeen. The warmest Christmas Day temperature officially recorded is 15.6C, registered in Edinburgh in 1896 and Killerton, Devon, in 1920. Madge said the Met Office did not currently expect that temperature to be beaten, but added: “We could see levels very close to those and there’s always the possibility we could see a record.”"

Sky News broadcast live footage showing the helicopter on its way to Norfolk. It landed safely at Sandringham 40 minutes later. A spokesman would only confirm that the couple had left Buckingham Palace. A spokeswoman declined to comment further when asked about the health of the Queen and the duke. Earlier, a spokeswoman confirmed that the Queen’s Christmas message would be broadcast as usual at 3pm on Christmas Day. “It is recorded some time in advance,” the spokeswoman said. The couple had been expected to travel from London to King’s Lynn by train on Wednesday and then on to Sandringham. But in a statement on Wednesday, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have heavy colds, and so have decided not to travel to Sandringham today.” On Tuesday, it was announced that the Queen would be stepping down as patron from 25 national organisations at the end of her 90th birthday year, with the patronages passing to other members of the royal family. The monarch and the 95-year-old duke hosted their annual Christmas lunch for dozens of relatives at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The Prince of Wales did not mention the health of his parents in his Thought for the Day message, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday morning. He recorded his remarks about the rise of populist extremism on Monday."
2016-12-22T15:42:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Activist can sue Trump golf resort for breach of privacy, court rules","A court in Edinburgh has ruled that an environmental activist can sue Donald Trump’s golf resort near Aberdeen for breach of privacy and compensation after she was apparently filmed without her consent on the course. A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a long-time critic of resort’s impact on the environment and community, accused Trump’s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile-phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course.
The ruling raises the prospect of Trump facing a battle in the Scottish small claims court a few months into his first term as US president. The Guardian revealed in August that Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by Trump, had breached the UK’s strict laws on data protection and privacy after it failed to register with the Information Commissioner’s Office, despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers, guests, staff and suppliers. The resort insisted this was due to a clerical error. Beyts’s lawyer, Mike Dailly, said the result was fantastic. “Although the defendant sought to have the case dismissed as incompetent, or transferred to the ordinary courts with unlimited expenses, or transferred to Aberdeen, all attempts to stop the case progressing were rejected by the sheriff,” he said. “So now there is a case to answer, and witnesses will have to give evidence on behalf of TIGC”. Beyts, 62, told the Guardian she was delighted with the result and looked forward to making her case. The case arose from an incident last April when Beyts and a friend used a public footpath across the Trump course to reach the sand dunes and beach that border the golf links. Returning from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. Three days Beyts was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump’s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. Her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump’s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting opponents and closely monitoring their movements on the resort. The claim was heard before Sheriff Gordon Liddle on Thursday morning, who swiftly dispatched the arguments made by Paul Motion, the solicitor advocate acting for the resort. Dailly argued that the case was a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the resort had admitted it was not registered with the ICO, and that being filmed without her consent had caused distress to Beyts, for which she was seeking £3,000. Motion questioned whether a small claims court was competent to deal with such a case. Liddle concluded, however, that while he was aware that he was “dealing with ifs and buts, not black and white”, nothing had persuaded him that the case was incompetent as a small claim. When Motion argued that the case should be held in Aberdeen, closer to the golf course and relevant witnesses, Liddle quipped: “Should I transfer it to Manhattan?” before noting that there was no reason why Beyts could not sue a company in the place where it had a registered office, in this case, Edinburgh. Liddle was staunch in his defence of the principle of the small claims court when Motion argued that the case should be transferred to the ordinary courts. The sheriff said: “The effect of sending it to ordinary proceedings may well be [that Beyts] is discouraged from pursuing it because of the expense implications.” The limit on expenses was an “essential component” of the small claims system, he said. TIGCS said: “Our position on Rohan Beyt’s claim remains unchanged and the matter is now in the hands of our lawyers.” The next hearing is set to begin on 3 April and last for three days."
2016-12-22T16:08:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Homelessness group worker suspended for sleeping rough in council garage,"A woman working for a council-owned organisation helping to alleviate homelessness has been suspended for sleeping rough in a council garage. Arleen Matthews, 48, has worked for almost a decade for Homes for Haringey – an arms-length management organisation that looks after the council’s housing stock and manages its assessment of homelessness applications. Its website states: “We want to prevent homelessness whenever possible.” Matthews’s job is to ensure that the council’s housing estates, where there are 16,000 tenants and 4,500 leasehold properties, are properly maintained. She had been living in private rented accommodation with her son, Kishur Williams, 18, but she fell behind with the rent and was evicted.
In desperation and with nowhere else to go she and Kishur started sleeping in a garage on one of the estates she managed. When Homes for Haringey discovered what she was doing, it suspended her and she is facing a disciplinary hearing for sleeping in the garage on Friday. She has received a letter from her employers stating that she has breached health and safety rules by sleeping and storing her belongings in the garage. She has also been accused of misusing a Homes for Haringey property for personal use. Her appalling living conditions came to light when Matthews and her son presented themselves as homeless to the council’s housing officials. “We were just using the garage as a stopgap,” she said. “I kept looking for alternative, cheaper accommodation. But every door we knocked on to try to get a place to stay they refused us. They told us that they only wanted tenants who were earning at least £30,000. There’s nothing out there for the helpless.” In desperation Matthews and her son presented themselves to Haringey council’s homelessness team. “The housing official who interviewed me wanted to know absolutely everything about me. She even asked me: ‘Where do you wee?’ I said ‘I’m not going to answer that’.” Matthews has a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and says her health has deteriorated as a result of becoming homeless and being suspended from her job. “I have had five DVTs in my right leg,” she said. “My mum died of thrombosis at 48. I’m now 48 and I’m under so much stress because of all this that I’m terrified I’m going to die at the same age my mum did. My blood pressure has gone sky high because of everything I’m going through.” She said her take home pay was £1,352 a month, supplemented by £320 working tax credit and £82.50 child benefit for Kishur because he is still in full-time education. The rent in the place she was evicted from was £1,200 a month, leaving her with little money left for essentials. “I ran up rent arrears of £5,000,” she said. “I offered to pay off £3,000 but the landlord said I had to pay off everything in one go. I tried to do everything I could to resolve the situation but in the end we were evicted on 1 November and my son and I had nowhere to go. My husband died five years ago but I’m still paying off the cost of the funeral and the other debts he left.” A few days before she and her son were due to be evicted Matthews spoke to a woman who rented out garages on one of the housing estates Matthews looked after. She asked if she could rent one of the garages and the woman agreed. The rent was £15 a week. She said the woman handed her a key and told her that they could sort out the paperwork later.
“We slept on a sofa and a mattress from our previous accommodation. It was horrible. Water came in when it rained and we found mouse droppings. There was no heating or water.” Matthews and her son stayed in the garage until the beginning of December. She had a plastic bowl that she carried with her and washed wherever she could. “All the time we were living in the garage we continued to look for alternative cheap accommodation. It was a terrible experience living there, something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. We would get up between 5 and 6am to avoid being seen by anyone on the estate.” “When I went to the council and declared myself homeless I was made to feel so worthless by the member of staff who dealt with me. She forced me to tell her where we were sleeping. A couple of days later I was called in to see my manager and was told I was being suspended because I was sleeping in a council estate garage. “The whole thing has made me really ill. I have been getting terrible headaches. I came back to work in March of this year, although my doctor felt I wasn’t really fit to work. We have been treated worse than animals.” Matthews and her son are currently living together in a tiny room in a hostel in Tottenham, which is infested by cockroaches. Matthews is paying £159 a week for this. “I just don’t know what’s going to happen to us,” she said. Her son is at college studying sport and accountancy and hopes to pursue these studies at university but says it is a struggle to study because he and his mother are homeless. “I’m so depressed,” he said. “I feel like I’m living in a prison.” A Homes for Haringey spokesperson said: “All our staff are paid at least the London living wage and our most junior positions offer salaries of £18,324 to £19,374, depending on length of service. “We at Homes for Haringey know as well as anyone the challenges of the private rental market in London. We will help anyone who comes to us with applying for housing benefit or other financial assistance should they need it – for example, those on lower incomes. We cannot comment on the details of any ongoing internal investigations.” • This article was amended on 23 December 2016 to clarify some references that suggested Arleen Matthews is a Haringey council employee. She was not directly employed by the council; as stated elsewhere in the article, she works for Homes for Haringey, which is owned by the council."
2016-12-22T16:13:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Parents accuse Met of errors and prejudice in inquiry into son's death,"The family of a teenager whose body was found in the Thames last year have claimed that a catalogue of errors led to their son’s death being wrongly determined to be a suicide and accused Metropolitan police service staff of racist behaviour. Krishna Chummun, 19, was preparing to begin his second year of a business studies degree at BPP University in London when he went missing. Before his death he had told his mother he was “madly in love” with someone from another religion, a Sikh woman whom he hoped to marry despite disapproval from members of the local community. On 7 August 2015 he boarded a night bus home after playing football with friends in Enfield, but never arrived. His body was recovered eight weeks later after being spotted by a passerby near the London Eye, but he was not identified until December. His cause of death was eventually described as “unascertained” in an open verdict by the coroner William Dolman, who said there were “too many gaps” in the case to establish the exact circumstances. Pradeep Chummun, 52, and his wife, Medha, 47, say a series of police missteps could have undermined the investigation into their son’s disappearance. In a witness statement Pradeep Chummun says that Met staff were “insensitive, rude and at times unhelpful” because they were “prejudiced due to our ethnicity”. A Met spokesman said the matter had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
The family are calling for a murder case to be opened, and their complaints against the Met are the subject of an inquiry by the IPCC. “Every day we are dying slowly,” Medha said. “I’m so stressed out. Nothing is happening. It has been nearly one and a half years since my son is gone and still we are left in the dark. “We are just given excuses and left to our own pain every day. I can’t understand it in a country like this where justice is supposed to be. We keep asking the police questions but they are still sleeping on the case.” Among their claims, the couple say police: Failed to recover CCTV footage from cameras that could have recorded their son’s final moments. Said there was “no point” in carrying out a forensic autopsy, and suggested the parents pay for one themselves. May have failed to take a proper statement from a key witness who allegedly said she saw Chummun being beaten and kidnapped on the day he went missing. Issued a missing persons appeal for Krishna in November 2015, three months after he disappeared and after his as yet unidentified body had been moved to a morgue in south London. Joked in an interview with the parents while Chummun was missing that he was “not going to fit” in a suitcase seen in the family home. Treated them like second-class citizens because they are from an ethnic minority. Chummun’s body was recovered on 10 October, still wearing his black Nike AirMax trainers, a black T-shirt with the words “premier premium goods” and a distinctive Casio gold-plated watch that had been a gift from his uncle. It was evident from the condition of the body that he had been in the river for some time, and police were apparently unable to identify him despite the distinguishable items worn. The Met has previously said he was wearing a different shoe size and clothes to those he had been described as wearing when reported missing. It was not until 21 December that he was identified, using three teeth extracted from his mouth that were matched during a speculative one-off search of the national database.
Five days later, on Boxing Day, five months after he went missing, the parents were told their son had been found. On the same day five years earlier, Medha had suffered a stroke, which led to her undergoing five operations. “It’s an unlucky date for us in this family,” Pradeep said. “When Medha was ill, Krishna was always at her bedside and devoted much of his time to caring for her. He was a good son to her and she is heartbroken without him.” A postmortem examination was unable to determine Chummun’s cause of death and toxicology tests found no trace of drugs in his liver. At an inquest on 7 April, Dolman ruled there was not sufficient evidence to find that the teenager had intended to kill himself. He said: “Applying the facts to the law, we don’t have any evidence of what act he undertook that might have led to his death. We don’t know if he fell, was thrown, slipped … we just don’t know.” In the days after Chummun went missing, his parents launched a frantic effort to find him, texting and calling friends and relatives. They say his girlfriend visited and told them the couple had argued on the phone on the night of his disappearance, and he had sent her text messages claiming he was going to kill himself. At the inquest into his death she said that he had made similar comments “once or twice” before.
The couple said that when they contacted the police, officers tried to brush off their concerns that the disappearance was out of character. “From day one we were treated like second-class citizens,” said Pradeep, who works as a psychiatric nurse. “They think because we are from an ethnic minority we are ignorant. “A woman from the missing persons unit saw a suitcase in our house. She shook it and said: ‘He’s not going to fit in there, is he?’ Our son is missing and she is making a sarcastic joke. It really upset us.” A week after Chummun’s disappearance, the family say, a relative reported that their neighbour, an 82-year-old woman named Rita, claimed she had seen him being attacked and kidnapped on the night he went missing. “Rita said that she saw from an upstairs window Krishna being attacked by three men,” Chummun’s father claimed. “She said one had a gun in his hand, one was arguing with Krishna and a third man attacked him with a baseball bat. Then she said they put him in a black Transit van and drove away.” Babs Ryan, another neighbour, said that a few days after Chummun’s disappearance Rita had confided in her about what she had seen on the Friday night he went missing. “She said that these men came up in a van and demanded that he go with them. She said they took his keys and that they were shouting at him. She said something about they had a gun in their hands and they banged him on the head and threw him in the van. It was near midnight.” Ryan went on: “She took ill about the same time and died a few weeks later. She shut herself away and she pined. She was unwell anyway but worrying about him didn’t help.” The family say they immediately related the allegations to police but were alarmed at the way they were handled. “They said they had looked into it but called back about half an hour later and said no such thing had happened … that it was all hearsay and rumours,” Pradeep said. “At this point I was trying to calm Medha down because she was hysterical.” Rita confirmed her account to Medha, the family say, but died in December and the couple fear police never took a proper statement from her. The Met and IPCC declined to comment on specifics of the case.
The couple also claim they urged police to check CCTV in the area, but were later told that CCTV footage was only kept for 30 days. Police knew about the abduction allegation within 23 days of the disappearance. Pradeep said he was also told “there are thousands of cameras in London” and it was not possible to search them all. He said he also asked if the river could be searched, but claims he was told: “No, the Thames current is so strong that it would break the body to pieces and drag it away.” The family say they do not know whether records from Chummun’s Oyster card, bank card and mobile phone were checked. “I feel like in our dealings with the police we are the ones being treated like criminals,” Medha said. “It has taken its toll on my health and I have to take sleeping pills and antidepressants to get through the day. “We have made a vow to find out what happened to our boy. I’m 100% sure my son was murdered and someone is just sitting there getting away with it.” A spokesman for the Met police confirmed that their inquiries into the death had concluded, and added: “The IPCC is independently investigating issues raised by the family of Krishna Chummun in a complaint. This was voluntarily referred to them by the Met on 2 February. “We await the IPCC’s report and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage. No officer is suspended or on restricted duties.” The IPCC said its investigation was continuing and it would therefore not be appropriate to comment."
2016-12-22T18:59:19Z,uk-news,UK news,The UK is at high risk of a terror attack – but how has it avoided one so far?,"London or any other part of the UK presents an obvious target for Islamic terrorists, more so than Germany given the UK’s high-profile involvement as the closest military ally of the US. UK intelligence agencies repeatedly warn that it is just a matter of time before a British target is hit. In a rare speech earlier this month, Alex Younger, the head of the UK’s overseas intelligence agency MI6, described the threat posed by groups such as Islamic State or its sympathisers as “unprecedented”. One of the most alarming warnings came last year from Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army officer and chemical weapons expert, who raised the risk of Isis mounting a chlorine attack in the London Underground, similar to the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. In spite of such warnings, the UK has seen only one death from Islamic terrorism since the 2005 London bombings that killed 56, including the four perpetrators. The solitary death was Fusilier Lee Rigby, murdered in an al-Qaida-inspired attack in London in 2013. There have been two deaths – Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham in 2013 and MP Jo Cox this year – inspired by white supremacism. Republican dissidents have killed soldiers and prison officers in Northern Ireland. So how has the UK managed to avoid the kind of terror witnessed in France, Belgium and Germany? The UK agencies will seldom engage in such discussions, wary of accusations of complacency and well aware that words spoken today could look foolish if there was to be an attack tomorrow. But the UK enjoys several advantages. One of the first is that the security services, especially MI5, learned a lot of lessons during the IRA bombing campaigns of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although Italy had to cope for much of this time with its Red Brigades and Germany with the Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof group), the UK faced a much more sustained and relentless bombing campaign. The intelligence agencies and the Royal Ulster Constabulary proved adept at penetrating the IRA, establishing agents – for money or through blackmail or some other means – in the highest ranks.
Also, it is harder to acquire guns in the UK compared with continental Europe. The Polish driver of the hijacked truck used in the Berlin attack was shot. The killers in Paris and Brussels were heavily armed. It is riskier for would-be jihadists to try to enter Britain compared with the relative ease of movement on continental Europe. Perhaps most significant of all is the drastic reorganisation that the police and UK intelligence agencies underwent after the London bombings. Instead of being so London-centric, MI5 officers were dispersed throughout the country: to the Midlands, the north of England, Scotland and Wales. Networks of contacts and informers were established. In the aftermath of the London bombings, traditional rivalry between the agencies also began to be broken down and today teams from MI5 can be found at the headquarters of MI6 or GCHQ and vice-versa. All three of the UK intelligence agencies – MI5, MI6 and GCHQ – have been expanded and are undergoing further recruitment. MI5 is expanding from 4,000 to 5,000 and MI6 from 2,500 to 3,500. MI6 hints that it has penetrated Isis, with Younger talking in his speech about taking the fight to the enemy “upstream”. The most powerful intelligence-gathering organisation in the world is the US’s National Security Agency. GCHQ is a junior partner, benefitting from a lot of the data acquired about Isis and other extremist groups. Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College, London, who monitors Isis, sees the US and UK as superior to continental intelligence agencies. “The US and the UK do it better,” Maher said. “It is one of the things that keeps us safe in the UK: so far, so good. If you look at disrupted plots here in the UK, it is down to good tradescraft and that does not seem to be happening elsewhere.” In an interview with the Guardian in October, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the UK security services had stopped 12 terrorist plots since 2013. In 33 years with MI5, Parker said had never seen the tempo as fast as it is now. The constant fear of the intelligence agencies is they will not stop the next plot. The current threat level in the UK was raised to “severe” – one short of the highest “critical” – in 2014. As Parker put in the interview, with no equivocation or caveats: “There will be terrorist attacks in this country.”"
2016-12-22T19:03:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Bells sound out at York Minster despite mass sacking of ringers,"Many feared a Silent Night, but in the end it was Ding Dong Merrily on High. The bells of York Minster, silenced for the past two months following the dismissal of its entire team of ringers, rang out on Thursday evening, courtesy of volunteers from elsewhere in the county. Worshippers arriving at the 15th-century cathedral for the traditional service of Nine Lessons and Carols were greeted by the sound of the bells after a team of experienced ringers offered to step in. The unidentified volunteers made their intervention despite claims by the Minster that campanologists from other churches and cathedrals had been intimidated by the sacked ringers into refusing invitations from the cathedral’s governing body, the Chapter. Earlier this week, ringers from Leeds rejected an approach from the Minster as an “act of solidarity”. The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers advised members to follow their consciences in relation to the dispute amid fears the bells would be silent over Christmas for the first time in more than 650 years. But on Thursday the cathedral said a “team of experienced ringers from Yorkshire kindly offered to support the Minster’s and the city’s festive celebrations by ringing the bells to welcome people to one of the cathedral’s best loved and most popular services of the Advent and Christmas season.” Vivienne Faull, the dean of York Minster, said: “We are grateful to the ringers of Yorkshire for kindly providing such a wonderful festive welcome for worshippers to the cathedral tonight.” The task of replacing the 30-strong bellringing team at York is likely to take until Easter. The Chapter is expected to first hire a paid “head of tower” in the new year to lead a new team, which will be recruited over the next few months. The sacked ringers are eligible to reapply for positions. The previous team was abruptly sacked in October in the culmination of a bitter and long-running dispute. Initially, the Minster gave “health and safety” issues as the reason for the dismissals. The move caused an outcry among campanologists around the country and many members of the public. Dave Taylor, the lord mayor of York, described the sackings as “shocking and unreasonable” and York Central MP Rachael Maskell said the action had been “disproportionate”. Six days after the dismissals, John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, disclosed that safeguarding concerns were at the centre of the dispute. It emerged that the concerns dated back to 1999 when David Potter, a former ringing master at York, was subject to a police investigation over an alleged indecent assault. Potter – who was awarded an MBE in 2000 for services to bellringing – was not charged. Last year, North Yorkshire police applied for a sexual risk order against Potter, which was initially granted on an interim basis but later refused by York magistrates court. The Chapter at York Minster commissioned its own risk assessment, and eventually decided that Potter should be permanently excluded from the bellringing team. However, other bellringers “consistently challenged the chapter’s authority on this and other important matters”, according to Sentamu, leading to the entire team being dismissed. As Potter’s supporters accused the Minster authorities of acting vindictively, more than 17,000 people signed a petition demanding the bellringers’ reinstatement. A source at the Minster said this week that amid “heightened levels of emotion, bellringers [from other churches and cathedrals] have been subject to intimidation and harassment”. But the Minster had received increasing numbers of messages of support for its actions, “people saying, ‘it’s right what you’ve done’,” the source added. A statement issued by Potter’s solicitor, Colin Byrne, said: “Mr Potter has never been cautioned, prosecuted or convicted of any criminal offence. In addition no civil finding has been made against him.” Offers to meet the archbishop ”in the spirit of reconciliation” had been declined. “Rather they choose to deal with this publicly.” It added: “Safeguarding is of paramount concern to all, but should not be used as a cloak to avoid transparency and due process.”"
2016-12-23T10:50:29Z,uk-news,UK news,School cleaners who went on strike over pay sacked before Christmas,"Three long-serving primary school cleaners, who went on strike over claims their wages and conditions were cut when a private company took over the contract, have been sacked days before Christmas. The women – Lesley Leake, Marice Hall and Karen McGee – sparked a debate over outsourcing when they went on strike for 14 weeks after their school in West Yorkshire was turned into an academy earlier this year. Known as the “Kinsley cleaners”, the women said they had their wages cut from £7.85 an hour to the minimum wage of £7.20 once the contract switched from Wakefield council to C&D Cleaning in April. The women, who between them have more than 28 years’ experience cleaning Kinsley primary school, returned to work earlier this month. But on Thursday they were told they had been sacked. Jeremy Corbyn said he was angered by the news of the cleaners’ dismissal. “When I met them, they explained how their wages were cut following the outsourcing of their contracts to a private company,” the Labour leader said. “Outsourcing is bad for our public services and workers. The cleaners’ jobs must be brought back in-house with fair pay and conditions. The race to the bottom in wages and working conditions faced by huge numbers of workers right across Britain is a national disgrace and Labour would put a stop to it.” Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said the women had bravely taken action to protect their wages and employment rights. “To then sack them just days before Christmas is heartless in the extreme,” he said, adding that the union would be consulting lawyers over the decision to dismiss them. Speaking to the Guardian in October, Leake – who has two adult children and a second job – said her pension, sick pay and holiday entitlement had also been hit by the outsourcing. “The first month [under C&D Cleaning] when we got our payslips we just thought it could be a few teething problems, but the second month it was the same, and it just went on and on,” she said. The women said they had tried to raise the issues with C&D Cleaning but were “fobbed off”. In the end the three got in touch with their union, Unison, but C&D Cleaning, based in nearby Barnsley, was reluctant to discuss the women’s cases. In one email seen by the Guardian, the company’s head of human resources, Nick Thorpe, replied to Unison: “I understand … the impact for you as an organisation when members realise that we are no longer living in the 1980s and they question the actual value of union membership when you have no say, power or influence over their employer.” The three women decided to go on strike, staging their first picket outside the school at the beginning of September. “It was a bit scary at first because none of us have ever done anything like this, but we didn’t know what else we could do,” said Leake. “It wasn’t just the money we were losing, it was the stress that was affecting us and our families as well.” A statement from C&D Cleaning read: “The employees were invited to a disciplinary hearing on an earlier date in December to respond to allegations of gross misconduct. At the employees’ request, the hearing took place on 19 December 2016 as their chosen Unison representative was not available on the earlier date. “Full details of the allegations were provided to the employees in advance of the hearing. The employees and their representative were given full opportunity to put their cases. The outcome of the hearing was termination of employment. The individuals have been informed of their right of appeal. The company will not comment further at this stage so as not prejudice any internal process.” Jon Trickett, the local MP, said all the “three courageous women” had done was stand up for their right to work. “With only days until Christmas, it looks like Scrooge has been brought back to life from Victorian times and ruined the festive period for three families in my constituency,” he said. He said the women’s experiences were unfortunately common. “Our country needs better pay, better conditions and better corporate governance to make sure that all employees are treated fairly,” he said. “It is also time that we stopped outsourcing services paid for by the taxpayer to rogue employers.”"
2016-12-23T14:26:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen gives Theresa May royal seal of disapproval over Brexit,"Monday The party given by my close friend with terminal brain cancer that I wrote about last week turned out to be even more extraordinary than expected. It somehow managed to be both joyous and heartbreaking in equal measure – I’ll never forget it – and most people managed to save their tears for the way home. Stephen set the tone for the evening by saying that everyone had been sympathising with him about how difficult it must be. “It isn’t,” he said. “It’s actually incredibly easy. The diagnosis has given me an absolute clarity. A clarity of what really matters.” He then asked five friends who were personally involved in local and national charities to give presentations and invited everyone present to turn the occasion into a fundraiser for them. That, in turn, gave me a little clarity of my own. I’d been wondering about which charities should benefit from the Wasim Akram cricket sweater I sold at auction a couple of weeks ago. Now I know.
Tuesday In the run-up to the general election last year, Nick Clegg described George Osborne as “a very dangerous man” whose plans were “harder than anything arch-Thatcherites would do”. The former Lib Dem leader was also scarcely less disobliging about his old coalition mucker in his book Politics: Between the Extremes, in which he called out the former chancellor for being “petulant and underhand” when he didn’t get his own way. But a few months can be a long time in politics, and Clegg appears to be willing to let bygones be bygones as the pair were spotted having a long and convivial lunch. With recent polls suggesting that more people now identify as being for or against Brexit than Conservative or Labour, there are rumours that Clegg and Osborne are preparing to launch a new political alliance aimed at hoovering up those voters who want to keep links with the EU as close as possible. Stand by for Coalition 2.0. Wednesday The Labour party may be 14 points behind the Tories in the polls – imagine how far they might be behind if Theresa May had anything resembling a Brexit plan – but it is awash with cash. One of the knock-on effects of two leadership campaigns, which saw the party membership grow to more than 500,000 with new members paying anything from £3 to £25 for the privilege of voting, has been that Labour is no longer broke. Whether that money is being spent wisely is another matter. Week by week the numbers of people working in central office seems to be growing exponentially as Labour gears itself up for another general election in May or June next year. The thinking goes that once the supreme court has rejected the government’s appeal and parliament gets to have a laugh about the paucity of the Conservative’s Brexit strategy, the Maybot will call an election in a fit of pique. Given the polling figures, the Tories will romp home with a massively increased majority and Labour will have to make redundancy payments to all the new staff it has just taken on. And you thought 2017 couldn’t be any worse than 2016.
Thursday Given the volatile economic times in which we live, we should be encouraging Boris Johnson to double up his overseas visits as foreign secretary as opportunities to do a spot of book signing on the side, rather than demanding an investigation into his moonlighting. If the government could persuade the publishers to pay half the travel costs, everyone would be better off. The possible savings are considerable. The most recent publication of MPs’ financial interests shows that Theresa May is the recipient of an Amanda Wakeley discount card. With all the free publicity the prime minister has given the fashion designer in recent weeks, it would seem only right that she should coincide her first visit to Donald Trump with next year’s New York fashion week. And with Chris Evans having ducked out of Top Gear, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, must be in line as a possible presenter as he has received donations from both Toyota and the RAC in recent months. Liam Fox might be a harder sell. No one can give away copies of his 2013 epic Rising Tides: Facing the Challenges of a New Era, let alone pay for him to sign them. Friday Reports that even the Queen is getting fed up with Theresa May’s lack of clarity on Brexit will come as no surprise to anyone in Whitehall. Though the Maybot often finds it impossible to answer any question with a straight yes or no – odd for someone who gives every appearance of having been programmed in binary – she isn’t that keen on letting anyone else answer on her behalf. Civil servants are tearing their hair out over her micro-managerial insistence that she has to sign off every detail from every department, not least as it is taking at least 10 weeks for her to come back with a few preliminary queries. Government is almost at a standstill. One can only imagine what the conversation between the Queen and the prime minister must have been like: HM: Can you tell me what your Brexit plan is? PM: I’m not going to give a running commentary. HM: One’s only asking for a few details. PM: Brexit means red, white and blue. HM: That’s a sodding flag, not a plan. PM: Do you want to borrow my Amanda Wakeley discount card? Digested week: Nukes away!"
2016-12-23T15:21:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Two men convicted of involvement in funding Syrian extremists,"Two men have been convicted of involvement in funding extremists in Syria by smuggling supplies in aid convoys, including the convoy that took the taxi driver Alan Henning to the region before he was kidnapped and murdered by Islamic State. The Old Bailey heard that convoys led by members of the British Muslim community had become unwitting vehicles for funds and supplies used in the planning of terrorist attacks. Syed Hoque, 37, from Stoke-on-Trent, was found guilty of two charges of providing £4,500 to terrorists, while his “fixer” Mashoud Miah, 28, from east London, was convicted on one count of helping Hoque get £1,500 to Syria. The first £3,000 was delivered via a Children in Need convoy in July 2013 and another £1,500 was sent via the same convoy that Henning travelled with. Two co-defendants were cleared of involvement: Mohammed Hussain and Pervez Rafiq, a prominent charity fundraiser who was a friend of Henning’s and said he had been courted by MI5 as a potential informer. The prosecutor, Annabel Darlow QC, told jurors the convoys were used as a means of moving money and other property out of the UK to Syria. “Normal routes are not much use when you look at Syria. So if you do want to get property or money out to Syria, the convoys would have provided a useful conduit,” she said. The court had heard that Hoque, a former probation officer, sent £4,500 to his nephew, Mohammed Choudhury, who was fighting with a Syrian group linked to al-Qaida. In incriminating WhatsApp exchanges, Choudhury, 26, asked for money to buy a Dragunov sniper rifle. Hoque was put in touch with Miah, a gas engineer, who travelled to and from Syria with aid convoys in 2012 and 2013. Miah was convicted of helping Hoque get money to Syria, but was cleared of a further charge over an alleged plot to create a “night team” of terrorist marksmen in Syria. He had been accused of drawing up a list of the equipment needed and delegating the job of sourcing much of it to Rafiq and Hussain. Giving evidence, Hoque admitted sending money to his nephew via Miah because he was fighting “in defence of those who cannot defend themselves”. He denied knowing his nephew was with a group linked to al-Qaida. Miah told jurors the Syrian people needed help and “had every right to be defended”. Following his arrest, Rafiq said he had travelled in a convoy with Henning, who was taken hostage and beheaded by Mohammed Emwazi in October 2014. Known as Jihadi John, Emwazi was killed by a US drone strike in November 2015. Giving evidence, Rafiq said he had not been back to Syria since December 2013 because of threats against him by Isis and other extremists over Henning’s death. He told jurors: “I was trying to save the life of a non-believer. He was not a Muslim.” The court heard that MI5 had offered Rafiq, who had raised £200,000 for charity, £30,000 to work for the secret services. Jurors were also told he had always cooperated with authorities who searched convoys on their way out and stopped him on the way back to the UK. Henning joined the Al-Fatiha Global convoy taking aid to Syrian refugees, and was kidnapped soon after he crossed the border in December 2013. Judge John Bevan QC said he would sentence the pair next year."
2016-12-23T16:47:26Z,uk-news,UK news,"If Theresa May can't trust the Queen, it bodes ill for their future relationship | Stephen Bates","When a leak emerges from Buckingham Palace, and especially when that leak tells us what the Queen supposedly thinks, interest is unsurprisingly intense. Regal unknowability – as exemplified in the recent Netflix series The Crown, where the young Elizabeth II is portrayed as learning that she must stay publicly above the fray at all times – is an essential part of our image of the royal family, and so any claimed breaches in the facade are bound to be studied closely. On Friday, one such incident provoked strong interest among royal watchers: the news reported in the Times that the Queen was “disappointed” in Theresa May for refusing to tell her about her plans for Brexit, attributed to a “source close to the monarch”. How seriously should such leaks be taken? And who would reveal such a confidence? To understand the provenance of any leak, the first question is: who benefits? If it was a senior courtier passing on palace gossip, the intention will have been to indicate a touch of monarchical exasperation at the government’s evident lack of a plan (the Queen would not be the only one). But it won’t have been officially authorised and the one certainty is that the Queen will not have been amused. In reality, the latest leak is more about May than the Queen. It confirms what Westminster gossip has long held: that the PM is a laborious decision-maker, almost to the point of constipation, and that her government – at least in September – had little idea how to go about Brexit. If May thought she could not take even the Queen into her confidence, it does not bode well for their future relationship. The Queen’s relationship with her prime ministers – Theresa May is the 13th – has always been a source of speculation, not least because their discussions, including the weekly meetings, are confidential. Usually, no third person is present and no notes are taken. The Queen does not leak her views and certainly does not give a running commentary, so any gossip about what has passed between them can normally be traced to political sources. What her more recent prime ministers know is that she has more experience of British and world affairs than any of them. Her first prime minister, Winston Churchill, was born in 1874, while three of her four most recent PMs were born after her reign had begun. She has seen every state paper and intelligence report since 1952 and met every minister and senior MP, as well as a quarter of all the US presidents who have ever lived, six popes and most world leaders and celebrities – and she has never publicly gossiped about any of them. The Queen tends to get on best with ministers who are confident enough to relax and gossip with her; she is thought to have got on best with characters like Macmillan and Wilson and less well with Thatcher, who – as Queen Victoria said of Gladstone – tended to lecture her as if she was a public meeting. She liked Alec Douglas-Home (a Scottish landowner like herself) and apparently David Cameron – younger than any of her children – despite his incautious leaking of her views on the Scottish referendum result in 2014, when he told the mayor of New York that she had purred down the phone when he called her with the outcome. (Cameron’s boast was probably an exaggeration, as she’d already have known the outcome by then – she listens to the BBC.) Stephen Bates wrote about the royal family for the Guardian for 12 years.

2016-12-23T17:00:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Camber Sands deaths blamed on victims' 'culture' by council,"The council that did not provide lifeguards at Camber Sands beach has blamed drownings over the summer on the limitations of “non-swimming persons of a certain culture”, according to an internal document seen by the Guardian. Seven men – one of Asian heritage, one Brazilian teenager, and five of Tamil origin – died at the popular seaside resort of Camber Sands in East Sussex in July and August. All the men were described by family members as capable swimmers. There is no lifeguard in attendance on the beach, where up to 25,000 people visit on hot days. But an incident log filed by a Rother district council official after the first two men drowned warned that the fact that the beach attracts “predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue”. Despite the high number of fatalities during the summer the council said it had not yet made a decision about whether to introduce a lifeguard service on Camber Sands next year.
A senior lifeguard manager from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was on the beach carrying out a safety assessment on 24 August, the day the five men of Tamil origin drowned, the Guardian understands. In 2013 the RNLI carried out a risk assessment recommending that a lifeguard service be introduced at the beach, a recommendation that was not taken up by Rother district council. Relatives of the five men who drowned on 24 August expressed shock and anger about the comments referring to nationality and culture and about the failure to provide a lifeguard service during the busy summer months. “I don’t understand why these things are said about nationality and culture,” said Uthayamalar Srithavarajah, whose 27-year-old son Gurushanth was among the dead. “The job of the council is to protect people, not to judge them on appearance.” Others said the revelations had compounded their grief. They also hit out at inaccurate initial reports in some sections of the media that variously described the men as illegal immigrants trying to swim to the shore, non-swimmers and people unable to speak English. “All this incorrect information about our sons has made our heartbreak so much worse,” said Jegaleela Saththiyanathan, 52, who lost two sons, Kenugen, 18, known as Ken, and Kobikanthan, 22, known as Kobi, in the tragedy. According to their relatives all seven of the men who drowned could swim, although the council official who wrote the incident log said he was informed when Dupar got into trouble in the sea that he could not swim. Of the five young Tamil men, all of whom had been resident in the UK for several years, three were at university, a fourth was in full-time education and a fifth had secured a university place. The others who died with Srithavarajah and the Saththiyanathan brothers were their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, and Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23. They all lived in London. The Brazilian teenager Gustavo Cruz and Mohit Dupar, a man of Asian heritage from London, died on 24 July. Dupar lost his life trying to save Cruz.
The RNLI has been in dialogue with Rother district council since 2003 about safety issues, the Guardian understands. A spokesman confirmed that one of the RNLI’s senior lifeguard managers was on the beach on the day the five men drowned. “He was there for an informal visit to view the beach during the summer period as part of our ongoing relationship with the council,” he said. Mayura Ravi, 17, sister of Nitharsan Ravi, condemned the stereotyped views expressed in the internal council document and inaccurate media reports. “The boys were studying. All five could swim really well and had no problems with speaking English so these things that have been said are just rubbish,” she said. She added that all had been legally resident in the UK for a number of years and that some of them loved the beach and the sea so much that they went there five or six times a year. Some of the boys had been brought up close to the seashore in Sri Lanka and were used to swimming in the sea. Jegaleela Saththiyanathan said her two sons and the other young men knew each other well, as did their families. She described them as upstanding individuals who did not drink or smoke or indulge in antisocial behaviour and, as well as loving sports like cricket, did voluntary work to help their community. The incident log for 24 July , the day the first two bathers drowned, written by a council official, states: “We are again faced with incidents of non-swimming persons of a certain culture that enter the water in great numbers with deadly results. The combination of a beach as shallow as Camber attracting predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue over the last 10 years and the risks that these people create upon their lack of ability in being ‘tempted in’ to such a shallow bay are becoming unsustainable and unfair for us to deal with or carry the burden of responding to.” The report goes on: “For a non-swimmer to jump into the deep end of Rye swimming bath would be foolish but we are faced with thousands entering an ocean and responding to their actions and inevitable consequences. An incoming tide, sand bars and breeze is a lethal combination for such people of little swimming ability and we are being left with the trauma of responding to the consequences.”
At a pre-inquest review into all seven deaths last month the council official who wrote the incident log gave evidence and talked about the changing demographic of people using the beach and the associated language and educational issues. “This is something we have to adapt to,” he told East Sussex’s senior coroner, Alan Craze. “We are constantly dealing with people’s naiveties and lack of education.” Gurushanth Srithavarajah’s mother, Uthayamalar, condemned the lack of lifeguards on the beach that day. “No one from our community will ever go to Camber Sands again,” she said. “But we want to ensure that other members of the public are protected for the future. We want to see lifeguards in place on that beach. Had there been lifeguards there on the day we lost our sons they may still be alive today.” She added: “No other person should ever have to go through the kind of loss and pain we are experiencing. We should be the last. Irrespective of skin colour, whether people are white, black or Asian, we don’t want to see anyone suffer the way we are suffering.”
At the inquest hearing, Patrick Roche, representing the Tamil families, said that as well as the deaths there had been seven “near-deaths” at Camber. The coroner is investigating what public safety measures could be introduced at Camber Sands. He said: “The provision of safety for the vast numbers of people that go to Camber is now an extremely important matter, and I owe it to the community as a whole to investigate as far as I conceivably can do.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, whose Hastings and Rye constituency includes Camber Sands, said she was “deeply saddened” by the deaths and had visited the beach along with councillors and an RNLI official to establish ways to improve swimmers’ safety. “I am taking a strong interest on this issue of beach safety, and I wait to hear the outcome of the inquest next year,” she said in a statement. In a statement the RNLI said: “The RNLI have been in talks with RDC [Rother district council] since 2003 and has carried out several risk assessments over the years. The most recent assessment was carried out in 2013. As part of this we suggested the RDC consider a series of potential control measures to manage specific hazards. One of these recommendations included considering the option of introducing a seasonal lifeguard service and that a service level assessment should be carried out. At that time, this suggestion was not taken further but the charity has remained in conversation with the council and, following the incident in August in which five young men drowned, the RNLI was able to set up and provide a temporary lifeguard service to cover until 4 September.” A Rother district council spokesman said: “We continue to look closely at all options for Camber beach and are in discussion with relevant partners. Money has been earmarked in the 2017-18 budget to ensure funding is available to implement the agreed option.” The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on other matters before the inquest, which is due to resume early next year."
2016-12-23T20:21:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Two men convicted of trying to leave UK to join Islamic State in Iraq,"Two men have been found guilty of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Iraq, while a third has been convicted of attempting to keep their plan a secret. Aras Hamid, 26, and Shivan Azeez Zangana, 21, who goes by Azeez, were both convicted of preparing acts of terrorism, while Hamid was also found guilty of assisting another in commission of terrorist acts. Ahmed Ismail, 19, was convicted of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. At the start of their trial at Kingston crown court on Monday, the prosecutor Robin Sellers told the jury the three men were involved in a “concerted attempt” to leave the country and further terrorist activities either themselves or by aligning themselves under Islamic State. He said Hamid played the leading role and was the common link between the other two and, while all three were “Kurdish in origin”, Ismail had been naturalised and was a British citizen. The offences took place over a relatively short period of time in mid-2016 and included a meeting between Ismail and Hamid in Coventry on 10 May. Three days later, a number of people called 999 to express fears that Azeez was planning to leave the UK, prompting the authorities to try to locate him. Azeez left his brother’s home in Sheffield the same day and met Hamid in Birmingham, with the pair later visiting a travel agent to buy a plane ticket for Azeez to travel to an airport in Iraq from Gatwick. On 17 May, officers from the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit (WMCTU) found the pair sleeping as they executed a warrant at the Al Noor mosque in Birmingham in the early hours of the morning. The police arrested Azeez and seized items from Hamid. Hamid was detained two days later when he was discovered hiding in the back of a lorry travelling on the A2 at about 2am. “The crown says he was trying to leave the UK covertly [by] in effect being smuggled out,” Sellers said. The court heard that Ahmed Ismail’s brother, Mohammed Ismail, travelled to Syria to fight with Isis in 2014 and Ahmed is believed to have originally intended to travel with Hamid and Azeez, but changed his mind after concerns over his brother’s status with his superiors within the militant group, who suspected his brother of being a spy. Ahmed Ismail was arrested on 22 May. Hamid, of no fixed address, was also convicted of having a false Bulgarian passport after pleading guilty to the offence at an earlier hearing. He, Azeez, who is from Sheffield, and Ismail, from Coventry, will be sentenced on 3 January. The head of WMCTU, Ch Supt Sue Southern, said: “As a result of enquiries, counter-terrorism investigators discovered Hamid’s instrumental role in organising travel plans for himself and Azeez for preparation for acts of terrorism. We also uncovered examples of Hamid’s extreme ideology and radicalisation and the pivotal role he played in orchestrating the travel plans for himself and Azeez. “Evidence shows Ismail, a local student, was in contact with Hamid and was well aware of plans to travel to the conflict zone. “There is always a danger that people travelling to Syria and Iraq will be trained and come back and be a threat to the UK. We also need to be aware of the far-reaching effects on local communities and the families of those involved. “If anyone is concerned that a friend or family member is thinking of travelling to Syria it is very important that they tell us as soon as possible. Police and other agencies can offer support to help safeguard those who are vulnerable to radicalisers.”"
2016-12-24T07:00:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Isis commanders 'liaised with plotters planning to attack UK in past year',"Islamic State commanders in Syria have communicated with jihadis attempting to stage terrorist attacks in Britain in the past year, counter-terrorism investigators believe. The intention was to add Britain to the list of western countries hit in the past 12 months. An attack in 2017 is still deemed highly likely and the severe terrorist threat level is expected to remain. A source said: “There is an assumption that it won’t abate in 2017. People do not believe that it is going to get better.”
In the last 30 months, since the rise of Isis in 2014, 11 Islamist attack plots on British soil have been identified and disrupted. Authorities in Britain believe there were four plots in 2016 aimed at inflicting mass casualties, all of which were shut down after arrests were made. Some are believed to have been inspired by Islamist propaganda. But there have been plots with direct involvement from Isis military planners in Syria, communicating with terrorists trying to attack the UK, investigators believe. Extra security measures were introduced in Britain after a truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin killed 12 on Monday. Police and the National Crime Agency have launched their biggest effort to take guns off the street before terrorists can get hold of them. On Friday the NCA said the effort to capture illegal firearms had “never been a more significant priority”. Counter-terrorism detectives and MI5 are experiencing intense workloads as they track terrorist activity. More than 850 Britons are believed to have travelled to Syria after Isis declared a caliphate in August 2014. About 15% were killed while overseas, mostly while fighting for the terrorist group. An estimated 350 remain abroad. Of the remainder, the prime concern for counter-terrorism investigators is the estimated 300 people who went to train with Isis in Syria then returned to Britain. The rate of Britons going to join Isis in Syria has slowed, possibly because awareness campaigns, or that most of those minded to join have already done so. The rate of Britons returning from Syria has also slowed. Investigators believe that a former commander in charge of planning attacks on Europe, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, sent a fellow terrorist to British cities to plan an attack. Mohamed Abrini visited locations in Britain in 2015 including shopping centres in Birmingham and the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester. Abrini, since arrested over the attack on Brussels airport in March, claimed he was in the UK to collect money. The Guardian understands pictures taken during Abrini’s British trip were found on a phone belonging to Abaaoud, which were recovered by French authorities after the November 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 130, and which Abaaoud led. He was later killed by French police. Raffaello Pantucci, from the Royal United Services Institute, said: “Isis is very interested in hitting the UK, but it is harder, so they are going where it is easier. We’re likely to see a continuing level of threat we’ve seen in the last couple of years.” The threat has been mitigated by the fact Britain does not share extensive land borders with Europe and has tight gun laws. But throughout the past year the increasing availability of guns has been a growing concern. The rise of Isis and its threats to attack the west led Britain in 2014 to raise its terrorist threat level. “Severe” means the joint terrorism analysis centre believes an attack is highly likely."

2016-12-25T13:12:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Thousands of homes without mains water in west London,"Thousands of households in west London battled a Christmas morning without water after a broken Thames Water pump shut down a mains supply in the Twickenham area. At least five postcode areas, including Twickenham, Hounslow and Hampton, had their service disrupted for several hours on Christmas Day. Thames Water apologised to those affected and said engineers were working to fix the problem. It later said the water supply was being reconnected on Sunday afternoon. A Thames Water spokeswoman said: “We apologise to any customers whose Christmas Day has been impacted by this. We have got a team on site who are investigating and trying to bring the water back as quickly as possible.” She said the postcode areas hit were TW2 (Twickenham), TW3 (Hounslow), TW4 (Hounslow Heath and Cranford), TW12 (Hampton) and TW13 (Feltham). Twitter users claimed that other areas were also hit.
The spokeswoman added: “We think it is potentially an issue with a pump at one of our strategic waterworks. We have got boots on the ground there now and are looking to get it fixed as quickly as possible.” Later the company said it had managed to restart pumps at its Hampton site, meaning that supply and pressure should return to normal.
But this was too late for many in west London as they struggled to make Christmas lunch without mains water. Shops that were open quickly sold out of bottled water.
Amy Beth Hayes, an actor who plays Kitty Edwards in the TV drama Mr Selfridge, said she was struggling to cook dinner with no water.
Others reported more serious problems. Writing on Twitter, @nataliemay88 said her father was struggling to take medication without running water after recovering from open heart surgery.
Dozens of furious customers expressed their anger and frustration at Thames Wate. Many gave graphic details of facing a Christmas without water.
With no water, others turned early to alcohol – at least for cooking vegetables.
Others thanked Thames Water’s engineers for working on Christmas Day to resolve the problem."
2016-12-25T15:04:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen uses Christmas message to urge Britons to 'take a deep breath',"The Queen has suggested that Britain needs to “take a deep breath” to face the “world’s big problems” after a tumultuous political year. In her annual Christmas message, the monarch made no mention of Britain’s historic vote to leave the European Union, focusing instead on the “inspiration” of Britain’s successful Olympics team. In what could be seen as a coded message to the nation in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, she said: “When people face a challenge they sometimes talk about taking a deep breath to find courage or strength. In fact, the word ‘inspire’ literally means ‘to breathe in’.” The Queen’s Christmas address was recorded before she fell ill, forcing her to miss the annual church service at Sandringham for the first time in almost 30 years. She had also delayed travelling to the royal estate for the annual Christmas break earlier this week.
In the address, she added: “Even with the inspiration of others, it’s understandable that we sometimes think the world’s problems are so big that we can do little to help.” She partially echoed a Thought for the Day message given by the Prince of Wales earlier this week, in which he had called for more tolerance towards refugees by urging people to remember that Jesus, Mary and Joseph were forced to flee violent persecution. The Queen did not go that far, but in an address which traditionally has a strong religious theme, she pointed out that Jesus was “maligned and rejected by many, though he had done no wrong”. The Queen has done a Christmas broadcast every year of her 64-year reign except for 1969, when there was an overload of royal coverage due to her son’s investiture as Prince of Wales. Unlike the annual Queen’s speech to parliament, the Christmas address is written without the help of government advisers. The theme of this year’s broadcast was “inspiration”. She used the word “inspire” or its derivates 10 times as she spoke about the achievements of the UK’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes, and those from the Commonwealth. She added: “To be inspirational you don’t have to save lives or win medals. I often draw strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours; unsung heroes whose quiet dedication makes them special.” This year’s message reflected the increasingly devout nature of the monarch’s Christmas addresses of the past few years. She repeatedly stressed the importance of “small acts of goodness” and she cited Mother, now Saint, Teresa of Calcutta, as saying: “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” Using her own words, the Queen added: “Christ’s example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.” She continued the theme in paying tribute to the 600 charities of which she is patron. “Many of these organisation are modest in size but inspire me with the work they do.” Last week it was announced that the Queen would be stepping down as patron from 25 national organisations at the end of her 90th birthday year, with the patronages passing to other members of the royal family. The Queen recorded her Christmas message in Buckingham Palace’s Regency Room while seated at a desk featuring a photograph of her with the Prince of Wales, released earlier this month to mark the end of her 90th birthday year.
Illness forced her to miss the Christmas Day service at Sandringham’s St Mary Magdalene church for the first time since 1988. More than a thousand people had gathered outside the Norfolk church for a glimpse of the monarch, including some who had arrived before dawn. In a brief statement issued before the service, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery.” It added: “Her Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas celebrations during the day.” The 90-year-old Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, 95, were forced to fly to their Sandringham estate in Norfolk by helicopter on Thursday after their initial Christmas plans to travel by train were cancelled because of ill health. The duke was well enough to attend the service. He was accompanied by other senior royals, including the Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and Princes Andrew Edward and their families. The royals showed no sign of concern about the health of the Queen. Prince Harry was seen chatting and joking with some of the crowd. Ada Nesbitt, 93, decorated her wheelchair for the occasion, and also wore tinsel and Santa earmuffs. Her daughter Jane Nesbitt, 56, from Norfolk, said: “Harry said you expect to get noticed, dressed like that. It’s a pity to miss the Queen but if she’s not well, she’s not well.” The Duke of Cambridge broke with tradition by spending Christmas at his wife’s family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a service in nearby Englefield church with their children George and Charlotte."
2016-12-25T15:10:17Z,uk-news,UK news,The Queen's speech in full: 'We can do small things with great love',"There was a time when British Olympic medal winners became household names because there were so few of them. But the 67 medals at this year’s Games in Rio and 147 at the Paralympics meant that the GB medallists’ reception at Buckingham Palace was a crowded and happy event. Throughout the Commonwealth there were equally joyful celebrations. Grenada, the Bahamas, Jamaica and New Zealand won more medals per head of population than any other countries. Many of this year’s winners spoke of being inspired by athletes of previous generations. Inspiration fed their aspiration; and having discovered abilities they scarcely knew they had, these athletes are now inspiring others. A few months ago, I saw inspiration of a different kind when I opened the new Cambridge base of the East Anglian Air Ambulance, where Prince William works as a helicopter pilot. It was not hard to be moved by the dedication of the highly skilled doctors, paramedics and crew, who are called out on average five times a day. But to be inspirational you don’t have to save lives or win medals. I often draw strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours; unsung heroes whose quiet dedication makes them special. They are an inspiration to those who know them, and their lives frequently embody a truth expressed by Mother Teresa, from this year Saint Teresa of Calcutta. She once said: ‘Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love’. This has been the experience of two remarkable organisations, the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award and the Prince’s Trust, which are 60 and 40 years old this year. These started as small initiatives but have grown beyond any expectations, and continue to transform young people’s lives. To mark my 90th birthday, volunteers and supporters of the six hundred charities of which I have been patron came to a lunch in the Mall. Many of these organisations are modest in size but inspire me with the work they do. From giving friendship and support to our veterans, the elderly or the bereaved; to championing music and dance; providing animal welfare; or protecting our fields and forests, their selfless devotion and generosity of spirit is an example to us all. When people face a challenge they sometimes talk about taking a deep breath to find courage or strength. In fact, the word ‘inspire’ literally means ‘to breathe in’. But even with the inspiration of others, it’s understandable that we sometimes think the world’s problems are so big that we can do little to help. On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine. At Christmas, our attention is drawn to the birth of a baby some two thousand years ago. It was the humblest of beginnings, and his parents, Joseph and Mary, did not think they were important. Jesus Christ lived obscurely for most of his life, and never travelled far. He was maligned and rejected by many, though he had done no wrong. And yet, billions of people now follow his teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them because Christ’s example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe. The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received, and that love begins small but always grows. I wish you all a very happy Christmas."
2016-12-25T18:00:20Z,uk-news,UK news,"Far-right protests draining police resources, figures reveal","South Yorkshire police have spent nearly £5m on policing far-right protests since the beginning of 2012, figures have shown. Freedom of information requests by the Guardian have revealed that 99.5% of the force’s overall expenditure on protests from the beginning of 2012 to October this year went on policing demonstrations by far-right groups. Between the start of 2012 and October 2016, the force spent £4,672,083 on policing demonstrations by the far right, with a single demonstration in Rotherham in September 2014 costing just over £1m. The figures provided by the force do not include salaries and planning costs, so the total figure is likely to be higher. Of the police forces that responded to the Guardian’s request for information, South Yorkshire’s overall costs were by far the highest. West Yorkshire police spent £1,055,732 between the start of 2014 and October 2016, compared with £2,907,955 by South Yorkshire. In the same period, West Midlands police spent £898,767. The Metropolitan police said they did not routinely cost such events and Greater Manchester police said the information did not exist in an “easily retrievable format” in their database. South Yorkshire’s biggest bill was run up on 13 September 2014, a month after the Jay report concluded that 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited by groups of mostly Asian men over 16 years. Hundreds of far-right protesters descended on the town and the cost of policing was £1,010,343. Rotherham experienced 14 demonstrations by the far right in the space of 14 months following the publication of the Jay report. In May 2015, Rotherham council commissioners and South Yorkshire police asked the Home Office for special powers to ban demonstrations by some far-right groups such as the EDL and Britain First, but the Home Office said the legal criteria for a ban had not been met. South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner, Alan Billings, said a case could be made for banning certain groups from demonstrating because of the community tensions they caused and the cost to the public purse. “It’s very difficult to call for the banning of assemblies because, for all of us in politics, there will be times when we want to protest and be on the streets saying our piece,” he said. “It’s very hard for us to say that’s fine for us but not for somebody else but, with the far-right groups in Rotherham, I’d say a case could be made because they’re not just coming and saying their piece and going away. “South Yorkshire police doesn’t just have to deal with the far-right marches, but with the reasons that there are far-right marches here, which are things like CSE [child sexual abuse] investigations.
“We also had the Hillsborough inquests and we’ve had to put up the tab for that and now the civil claims will start against South Yorkshire police as a result of the Hillsborough verdicts and as a result of non-recent CSE in Rotherham … so our expenditure goes up exponentially as a consequence of all that. Into the midst come these far-right marches.” Rotherham’s Labour MP, Sarah Champion, said the figures came as no surprise. “Rotherham has been subjected to repeated – almost monthly – demonstrations and this has led to locals feeling nervous and a notable drop in people shopping in town,” she said. “We must, of course, respect the right to peacefully protest. However, this must be balanced against the needs of the local community. It is deeply concerning that these national demonstrations represent such a significant drain on South Yorkshire police’s budgets and are diverting resources away from local frontline policing and investigations.” Champion said she had repeatedly raised these issues with the government, with a view to increasing available funding and taking action to limit the impact and frequency of marches, but the government had not taken meaningful action to address the problem. Among the other police forces who responded to the Guardian’s request for information was Kent, with an expenditure of £751,954 on policing far-right protests since the beginning of 2014, Bedfordshire police (£529,777.97) and Sussex police (£463,192)."
2016-12-26T07:00:36Z,uk-news,UK news,"A year after the deluge, York is still counting theÂ cost","A year ago, Walmgate in York was about to become less of a road than a river, leaving a silver Mercedes floating outside the gadget shop, soldiers rescuing inhabitants via dinghy and a few hardy residents deciding to stick it out in their upstairs flats with no electricity. Twelve months on and the historic thoroughfare has finally dried out, but a tidemark of resentment remains. “The truth is, the city of York council completely failed residents,” says the local Labour MP, Rachael Maskell. The gadget shop never reopened. Nor did a shop selling hearing aids. Just up on Fossgate the Loch Fyne seafood restaurant only got back in business on 2 December. The Blue Bicycle restaurant is still out of action. One of its walls bowed after being hit with a ferocious tide of water when the Foss burst its banks following the decision late on Boxing Day to lift the flood gates further up stream – a much disputed move the Environment Agency insists saved more properties than it ruined. Perhaps most damagingly of all for a city reliant on Viking-heritage tourism, the much-loved Jorvik Viking Centre, with all its Norse sights and smells, is not going to be ready to reopen until April. Some 453 residential properties and 174 businesses flooded in York between Boxing Day and 28 December last year, when the Ouse peaked at 5.2 metres above its normal summer level. Wendy Hudson remembers coming down to Walmgate to see stock in the furniture store where she works bobbing about. “There were people behind me laughing and it made me really upset. We lost all of the stock, at least £20,000 worth,” she said this week.
It was April before Hambleton Furniture reopened. A few doors up, at York Catering Supplies, they were not as fortunate. Kevin Pateman, who has run it for 14 years, could only move back in six weeks ago, after protracted wrangling with his insurers and their appointed builders. He is still waiting for a final insurance payment to cover loss of business, and his new policy has an excess of £25,000. “If we get flooded again I don’t know what we will do,” he said. Over the road, the inside of the Walmgate Ale House has been repainted, with a white line at about three feet showing the high-water mark last Boxing Day, as well as those from previous floods, in 1982, 1947 and 1978, all before the Foss barrier was installed. Half a mile away from central York, a less telegenic disaster was unfolding for the residents of the James Street Traveller site. The council had put the site on a flood plain: it is in a dip opposite a Morrisons, right next door to the Foss Islands high-level culvert, which operates as an overflow from Tang Hall Beck to the River Foss. It is mostly hidden from view by a red brick wall, which is about 2.5 metres high on the site side. When the Foss flooded, water rushed right over the top of the wall, said Megan Ellis, a 22-year-old resident: “The site was like a plunge pool.” The Travellers remain angry that no one warned them about the floods and claim they were ignored by the fire service and council workers during the rescue and clear-up of all 20 plots. The water was lapping against her chalet’s top step in the middle of the night when Ellis bundled up her six-month-old baby and her toddler, grabbed milk and nappies and got out. It was eight months before she could return to the site after a local charity, Two Ridings, raised funds to buy her a new mobile home. “We had to do everything ourselves,” she said. “The council did nothing. We kept seeing fire engines drive by through the waters really fast, causing waves. They were laughing at us.” The rescue and clear-up operation focused on the historic city centre and the well-to-do residents of Huntington Road, around the corner from the site, she complained.”
The council insists it did not abandon the Travellers. “Once the water subsided, the council helped the Travellers move their own caravans. All were supported to make alternative accommodation … or to stay on other sites,” said Tom Brittain, interim director of housing and community safety. The site reopened in April after it was cleared of all debris, oil and flood detritus, he added, saying the council was “looking at long-term resilience for the site”. The cleanup cost the council half a million pounds, excluding damage to council assets including properties and infrastructure. It persuaded the government to pay £17m for Foss Barrier improvements and £45m for wider flood risk management improvement works across the city. But Maskell, MP for York Central, said the council totally failed in the immediate aftermath, claiming: “They had no plan for the flooding and they were totally absent in the most socially deprived areas.” She wants to know why the independent flood inquiry commissioned by the council back in January has yet to report. “A year on, we are no further forward. What on earth are they doing?” A council spokeswoman insisted the report would be published in the new year. York was not the only place devastated by record rainfall. In nearby Tadcaster, work continues to restore the 18th-century bridge, which partially collapsed due to the force of flood water last Christmas. The £4.4m reconstruction job will not be finished until the end of January, North Yorkshire council says. In Leeds, where 2,683 residential properties and 678 commercial premises were affected by floods, at least 12 businesses are still not trading. Recently, geologists from Leeds University began a research project to improve responses and long-term resilience to floods and droughts in urban and rural areas. In Calderdale in West Yorkshire, where 2,000 homes and 1,000 businesses were flooded in towns including Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd and Todmorden, repair work continues. The council says its final bill for the Boxing Day floods could exceed £50m, with the cost of the damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure alone estimated at £25m. And in Cumbria, which had been hit by Storm Desmond at the start of December, around 500 households are not back in their homes. A year has passed but the anger has yet to subside – especially when it was reported last week that four times as much is being spent on protecting London from flooding than the whole of Yorkshire and the Humber. “It would all be different if the floods were happening on politicians’ doorsteps in Westminster,” said Hudson in her York shop. “If they had floods where they lived it would soon get sorted out.”"
2016-12-26T17:00:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Copeland byelection: 'We are a community of two halves',"The constituency that Jamie Reed will soon no longer represent is a curious one. One of the biggest and most remote in England, Copeland covers 470 sq miles and takes in Keswick and the western Lake District fells, as well as 32 miles of Cumbrian coast, from Millom up to Whitehaven. On paper, its inhabitants enjoy the third highest salaries in the UK – £721 a week, second only to the City of London and Tower Hamlets, according to the Office for National Statistics in 2015. But visit Whitehaven, the largest town in the constituency, and the wealth is not obvious. Cafes advertise full Christmas dinners for a fiver and a few miles out of town is the Woodhouse estate, which is within the 3% most deprived wards nationally, where a three-bed terrace still costs just £60,000. The reason for this disparity lies behind a big fence on a two sq mile site by the coastal village of Seascale: Sellafield, a nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site where the Windscale nuclear power station once stood. About 10,000 people are directly employed there, with thousands more in the supply chain, many in highly skilled engineering and scientific jobs. A further 6,000 are due to be employed in the construction of the Moorside nuclear power station, which is to be built next door in the next 10 years. NuGen, the Japanese-backed company behind the project, says Moorside will bring at least £20bn investment into the UK. “It is an unprecedented opportunity for this part of the world to become the fastest growing part of the UK economy,” said Reed, who is quitting politics for a role as head of development and community relations at Sellafield.
“We are a community of two halves,” says Pat Graham, the managing director of Copeland borough council. “As a proportion of our workforce we have got more PhDs per head of population in Copeland than anywhere else in the UK. We have the nuclear-related wealth, which captures the highly skilled and the affluent and the upwardly mobile. But we also have those people who don’t have the ability to access nuclear, so therefore we have the extremes of really attractive, beautiful Lakeland places and poverty and all the challenges that come with deprivation.” In the EU referendum, Copeland voted by a margin of 62% to leave the EU. Reed was an outspoken remainer, warning constituents that their lives would be worse if the UK left. He was devastated – but not surprised – by the result, telling the Guardian that he had to take some of the blame.
“It is the fault of people like me over a long period of time for not pointing out the benefits of the EU, for allowing myths to go unchallenged and to be cemented as facts in people’s minds,” he said. “It is a tragedy that communities like this have voted to leave a political body which very often did more for them than its national government ever did.” Reed points to numerous European-funded projects in Copeland, including the harbour redevelopment and the Westlakes Science park, home to engineering company Westlakes Engineering. Its managing director, Andy Hooper, voted to remain and was aghast at the result. “It seems so retrograde to leave. Why do we want to be so insular?” he said. His firm has designed safety systems for theme park rides across Europe and employed many EU graduates. He can see some positives from Brexit: “From a purely selfish point of view, I suppose we might benefit if it becomes harder for Sellafield and others to contract overseas firms.” But he doesn’t want to only be able to recruit from a small group of people. In the end, he’s trying to look on the bright side: “As an entrepreneur I think change is good and chaos can be creative.”
Hooper is in the minority in Copeland. For the past 22 years Gerard Richardson has run a fine wine shop in Whitehaven town centre. He strongly objects to the idea that those who voted to leave did not understand the consequences. “The people who voted remain seem to think they are the only ones who made an educated choice. They think that those who voted out are white, thick, racist and unemployed. I’m only one of those,” said Richardson, a 54-year-old grandfather of eight. “It’s so arrogant. They seem to think that to vote leave you are some sort of little Englander flying the Union Jack in your garden.” He is not anti-European, he insisted – “I’m a fine wine merchant, for goodness sake.” He just did not think the EU and its institutions were fit for purpose. “I don’t have a problem with immigration. I just think Europe has become too unwieldy. When you’ve got a political class who can’t even decide on one home and so create two parliaments just to satisfy two different factions, you’ve got a problem.” Though he disagrees with Reed on Europe, Richardson respects him, he said. “If I want to talk to my MP, I know where I can find him. I don’t know who my MEPs are. I’ve never seen them campaign in Whitehaven. I’ve never known them to hold a surgery. I shouldn’t have to make an appointment with some pillock in Preston or Manchester. They should come up here. Educated people like us should know what their MEPs do and we don’t. All I know is their wages and expenses are phenomenal. Forget all that rubbish about giving £350m to the NHS. Get rid of all the bloody MEPs and use their money instead.”
Though Reed is generally popular locally, his parliamentary majority has steadily reduced over three general elections. When he first became an MP, in 2005, he had a 6,320 majority. By 2015 that had reduced to 2,564, with the Tories second on 14,186 and Ukip third, gaining more than 5,000 votes on the previous election to win a 15.5% vote share. “They came out of nowhere like a great white shark,” Reed says of Ukip. The seat, with varying boundaries, has been Labour since 1935, but it cannot be considered in any way “safe”. Last May Copeland chose its first elected mayor, with voters shunning the Labour and Conservative candidates in favour of Mike Starkie, a local businessman who ran as an independent. Starkie voted for Brexit and was only surprised that even more people in Copeland didn’t follow suit. At his rugby club “everyone” seemed determined to vote out before the referendum, he said, including all the Sellafield workers. Drinking an afternoon pint in the Manor House pub in St Bees this week, one 58-year-old man working in a factory making chemicals on the Sellafield site, said he voted out because he couldn’t see how it would be detrimental.
“I think we should be able to decide on our own laws,” he said. He knew Copeland would vote to leave. “Here in the real north-west of England – and I don’t mean Manchester or Liverpool – we are very isolated. Look at our infrastructure. We have two-carriage diesel trains and 300 people trying to get on them each morning to get to Sellafield. We don’t have a dual carriage way out. We are always the last in the pecking order.” Many local people complain about not being given their share from central government, particularly when the high wages paid contribute so much to the exchequer. They feel unfairly treated by the media too. In 2010 Fleet Street descended on the constituency following the gun rampage of a local taxi driver, Derrick Bird, who killed 12 people and then himself, painting a picture of a community riven with divisions few locally recognised. Four years later the pack came back after statistics suggested Whitehaven was the fattest place in England. Reed feels strongly that the government – and the Labour party – needs to stop neglecting areas such as Copeland, which are geographically and culturally so far away from Westminster. “Remotely accessible peripheral areas are overwhelmingly ignored by the centre of government and that has to change. I passionately believe that that sense of grievance is one of the principle factors which fuelled Brexit. “I’ve talked about our lower league towns, our rugby league towns, it’s true. It’s true that vast swaths of people in our country feel ignored and are unsure of their place in the national story. And that means they are unsure about their sense of worth as a community. And that’s not a good place to be.”"
2016-12-26T17:27:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Trains halted across UK as 200 engineering projects begin,"Britain’s rail network ground to a halt on Monday for the traditional Boxing Day travel disruptions, which are likely to extend into the new year in many cases. About 200 engineering projects were scheduled to start on the day after Christmas, with services on most of the country’s biggest train lines suspended and disruption on some lines lasting until early January. On Sunday night, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservatives of hypocrisy for being critical of the last Labour government during the regular Boxing Day rail standstills, but failing to do anything to tackle the problem now they were in power. Among the companies to have suspended services were Arriva Trains Wales, c2c, CrossCountry, East Midlands, Grand Central, Great Northern, Great Western, London Midland, Northern Rail, South West, Thameslink, TransPennine Express and Virgin. London’s Paddington station will be closed until 30 December while work on the new Crossrail line is carried out, and some services into London’s Liverpool Street station will be cancelled until 4 January. People travelling into Charing Cross and London Bridge will see a reduced service until 28 December and the Heathrow Express, transporting passengers between the airport and central London, will not run until 29 December. The line between Cardiff and Newport will be closed into the new year, and services into Manchester will be reduced until 28 December. Road users were advised to plan their routes carefully before they set off, taking into consideration the higher volume of traffic that would come with the reduced rail services. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: “Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. But we know some passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day, and that the scope for Boxing Day services is considered when we are planning future franchises.” The transport difficulties came as the southern fringe of Storm Conor continued to hit parts of northern Scotland, causing heavy snow and winds of more than 80mph, as it moved past the British Isles and up towards Norway. The Met Office issued an amber “be prepared” weather warning for the Highlands and Northern Isles, which was due to expire at 6pm on Monday, with lesser yellow warnings issued for much of the rest of Scotland where winds were reaching 50mph to 60mph. Helen Roberts, a Met Office meteorologist, said Monday would see “a north-south divide” in weather conditions, with strong winds and wintry showers in Scotland, but fine weather and “crisp winter sunshine” elsewhere. While it was forecast to be a cold, frosty start to Tuesday morning – with temperatures in towns and cities around freezing, and temperatures in more rural areas a few degrees lower – the next few days were expected to be bright and dry. The “generally fine” weather was predicted to last until the end of the week."
2016-12-27T12:55:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Three crashes prompt temporary closure of M5 in Somerset,"Three separate crashes prompted part of the M5 in Somerset to be closed in both directions on Tuesday. The motorway was shut for two and a half hours due to ice on the road, as the south of England awoke to extensive frost. The M5 was closed at about 9am northbound between junction 21, near Weston-super-Mare, and junction 18A, near Bristol, and southbound between junction 18 and junction 19, near Portishead. A spokesperson for Highways England said the road’s closure had come after the three accidents on Tuesday morning. The stretch of motorway was reopened at about 11.30am once gritters were able to attend the scene. The closure has caused heavy traffic and queues in the surrounding area. Drivers were advised to check travel conditions before setting off on journeys and to allow extra time for travel before the area is cleared. As was forecast, areas in the south of England were greeted by an extensive frost on Tuesday morning before mist and fog patches cleared for a fairly dry and bright day. Wednesday is forecast to see another cold start, with more frost in the south of England."
2016-12-27T16:39:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Nurse struck off for leaving dementia patient in storeroom overnight,"A senior nurse has been struck off after leaving a distressed, hallucinating patient with dementia in an unlit equipment cupboard overnight. Heather Davies was the nurse in charge of a night shift on a dementia ward in Hinchingbrooke hospital, Cambridgeshire, when a patient with dementia became delirious and started shouting, disturbing others in her bay, a disciplinary hearing by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard this month. A more junior nurse, Lisa Ndlovu, moved the patient into a corridor and was told by Davies the size of her bed meant “they would need to find somewhere with double doors like the ones on the equipment room”, the NMC’s report on the incident said. Davies told the disciplinary panel she meant this as an example, but Ndlovu wheeled the patient’s bed into a dark storeroom at about midnight. A healthcare assistant who saw this later alerted Davies and they found the patient, who was frightened and hallucinating, in the dark storeroom with a window open. She was shivering and sweating, and had no call bell or “cot bumpers” on the bed to prevent her from falling. Davies conducted a brief check-up but left the patient in the room until about 6am. Davies, who had no previous disciplinary record, told an internal inquiry the patient had been left in “an unsuitable, unacceptable, dangerous and frightening environment” and acknowledged this was a mistake. But she added the ward was under additional pressure that night because of a virus. The NMC panel found that although Davies had not placed the patient in the storeroom herself, as the nurse in charge she had not challenged the nurse who did so and “took no action to deal with the situation or remove [the patient] from an unsafe environment”. This was an “extremely serious incident involving a serious error of judgment by Mrs Davies”, the panel found, deciding to strike her off. Ndlovu was suspended for six months for her part in the incident. Davies declined to comment when approached by The Sun about the case. Hinchingbrooke hospital confirmed to the paper that it had dismissed her."
2016-12-27T18:09:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Garden bridge charity warns more delays could terminate project,"The charity behind the proposed garden bridge across the Thames in London has warned that any more hold-ups to the controversial and much-delayed project could see it having to be scrapped altogether. While the Garden Bridge Trust insists it remains confident the tree and plant-filled pedestrian crossing will be built, it has conceded that the delays have affected fundraising and that any more significant obstacles could prove terminal. It was ultimately up to the charity’s trustees, who include the project’s originator, the actor Joanna Lumley, to demonstrate the money committed – £60m of which comes from taxpayers – was being used prudently, its executive director said.
“The trustees at every point of the way have to decide whether the project is viable, and if it’s prudent to keep going and spending money,” Bee Emmott told the Guardian. “If at any point the hurdles become actual blockages that we can’t remove, then we have to reassess whether the project is ultimately viable or not.” Emmott added that she remained “confident that we can make progress”. Her comments emphasise the seriousness of the delays to the controversial bridge, designed by Thomas Heatherwick and intended to run 367metres from South Bank to Temple in central London. Construction was originally due to begin in spring 2016, but a series of problems have forced the trust to put contractors on hold, pushing up projected costs by £10m to £185m. Part of the delays are logistical, including complex and ongoing negotiations with Coin Street, a community housing trust which holds a long lease on the site where the south end of the bridge would land, and must grant permission before any work can begin. The political climate has also changed. The decision to give the bridge £60m of public money during a period of austerity, split between the Treasury and Transport for London (TfL), was taken when George Osborne and Boris Johnson, both big fans of the project, were respectively chancellor and London mayor. Both have now moved on. Johnson’s Labour successor, Sadiq Khan, pledged that no more public money would be spent on the bridge and has asked the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge to examine whether it provides value for money. Of the £125m that the Garden Bridge Trust needs to raise itself privately, it has so fair achieved little over half, with £69m committed. While Emmott said she was confident the rest would come, she conceded that fundraising had proved difficult amid the delays and the unknown timetable of Hodge’s investigation. “It’s very difficult to get new funds committed while you’ve got that level of uncertainty,” she said. “We hope that the Hodge review will be concluded soon to remove this.” The bridge has received a mixed reaction since the £60m was committed to it in 2013. At one point Lambeth council on the south side of the project withdrew support, only changing its mind when £20m of the TfL grant was turned into a long-term loan.
While supporters say it will more than pay for itself as a driver of tourism and a transport link, critics argue it is in an over-crowded section of London already well served by bridges. They also question why taxpayers’ money should go on a link that will be privately run and can set its own rules and close at night and for corporate events. Paradoxically, the one thing that might save the project is that so much public money has already been spent on it. Khan has argued it would cost more to cancel the scheme than to go ahead with it. Emmott said the coming few months were very important for the bridge’s future. She placed much of her faith on similar arguments, saying that Hodge should see the value for money argument in pushing ahead. The trust has already spent £36m of the public funds on pre-construction work, she said. “If the project terminates at this point we could spend up to an additional £9m covering our termination liabilities. “Value for money, from a pure numbers perspective, would be to deliver the project and get the full benefits. The Garden Bridge Trust pays back the TfL loan and £20m-plus in VAT. The maths of it is where the value for money argument lies.”"
2016-12-28T00:01:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office targets nail bars over illegal immigration,"Nail bars have been targeted by immigration officers, leading to dozens of arrests as part of an operation last month, the Home Office has announced. Robert Goodwill, an immigration minister, revealed there has been a week-long operation that saw 97 people held, 68 businesses warned they could face fines and 14 people identified as potentially at risk of modern slavery. The majority of the people arrested were Vietnamese nationals, but there were also people from Mongolia, Ghana, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and India. The Home Office said those who are potential victims of trafficking will be offered support, while those who have no right to be in the UK will be removed. Goodwill praised the operation for sending a “strong message to those employers who ruthlessly seek to exploit vulnerable people and wilfully abuse our immigration laws. “Modern slavery is a barbaric crime which destroys the lives of some of the most vulnerable in our society,” he said.
The operation, led by Immigration Enforcement, took place from 27 November to 3 December and saw officers visit more than 280 businesses across the UK. The crackdown has so far focused on the construction, care, cleaning, catering, taxi and car wash industries during 2016, with further activity in similar sectors planned for 2017. As home secretary, Theresa May made it a priority to legislate against modern slavery. She has also repeatedly stressed over six years that she wants to bring down illegal immigration as well as reduce numbers of people who enter the country legally. Some of those policies have been controversial including trials of vans urging migrants not legally in the country to “go home”. It emerged last month that the Home Office under May had also proposed allowing the children of parents unlawfully in the UK to be dropped to the bottom of lists for school places – a proposal that was not taken forward."
2016-12-28T13:46:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"Sellafield unrest could dent Tory byelection chances, unions warn","“Serious industrial unrest” at Europe’s biggest nuclear site could threaten the Conservatives’ chances of winning a forthcoming byelection, unions have warned. The byelection in the marginal Cumbrian seat of Copeland has been described as “Theresa May’s to lose”. But the Conservative candidate hoping to overturn Labour’s 2,564 majority will have to explain to thousands of workers at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site why the government is trying to downgrade their final-salary pension scheme. Trade unions representing many of Sellafield’s 10,000 workers have written to the government warning they cannot support either of the options being considered.
The Guardian has seen a letter sent shortly before Christmas to Lady Neville-Rolfe, minister of state at the business department. It comes from the Prospect union, which represents more than 5,000 Sellafield engineers and specialists. The letter, signed by Prospect’s deputy general secretary, Dai Hudd, on behalf of his union, the GMB, Unite and Aslef, tells the minister “serious industrial unrest” cannot be ruled out by workers employed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The NDA is the public body that owns Sellafield, a huge site in Copeland that processes nuclear waste from the old Windscale nuclear power station, where a fire in 1957 caused the UK’s worst nuclear accident. It says: “Employees across the NDA estate fought hard to secure the statutory pension protections that currently apply. There will be an understandable adverse reaction with any proposals that trample over those protections. “They will certainly not respond well to a raid on their pension benefits intended to achieve arbitrary savings agreed between the NDA and the Treasury, and agreement to which the workforce and their representatives played no part. “If the NDA proceeds with its proposed consultation in its current form there will inevitably be a significant reaction from the members affected. The likelihood of serious industrial unrest cannot be ruled out.” The two money-saving proposals on offer involve either a series of changes including increasing the pension age from 60 to 65 or state pension age (whichever is higher), or breaking the final-salary link for the pension scheme, according to Prospect. A 60-day consultation period on the options opens on 9 January.
According to Hudd, either proposal will affect thousands of Sellafield employees as well as thousands of employees at other nuclear sites, some of which are also in the constituency. Each member of the scheme would lose tens of thousands on average, he claimed. “I expect the reaction will be particularly robust because this group of members were granted statutory pension protection in the legislation that effectively privatised the industry and these proposals would mean overriding those protections,” he told the Guardian. “There are few constituencies where a single industry (indeed employer) is as significant as the nuclear industry and Sellafield is to Copeland. For the government of the day to attack the pension terms for the employees in this industry in the run-up to a crucial byelection, there is incredibly bad timing to say the least.” A spokesman for the NDA said: “Government policy is that all public sector final-salary pensions schemes should reformed by 2018, and 4 million public sector workers have already moved to new pension arrangements. “Specific decisions on how to change the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s estate pension schemes have yet to be taken. We expect to begin formal consultation in the new year.” More than 10,000 people are employed at the Sellafield site, which measures 6 sq km and is the largest nuclear site in Europe, containing more than 1,000 nuclear facilities. Almost half of the UK’s nuclear workforce is based at Sellafield, which is home to among the largest inventories of untreated waste in the world. The NDA purpose is to deliver the decommissioning and cleanup of the UK’s civil nuclear legacy in a safe and cost-effective manner."
2016-12-28T13:59:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Snow cabins and jungle showers: the latest perks of a luxury London flat,"It was once thought to be enough to offer basement gyms and bowler-hatted concierges as a lure for the property-buying global elite. But now potential purchasers of £23m flats overlooking the Thames in London are being offered access to their own “snow cabin”, where they can unwind from the rigours of the capital’s social scene among artificial white drifts. This frosty cousin of the sauna is being offered to buyers of apartments at One Blackfriars, a 50-storey tower with views across to St Paul’s Cathedral. It is one of several novel attractions to lure would-be purchasers to the tower, including a “rainforest shower experience” involving a dousing to the sounds of the jungle, a virtual golf course with a whisky bar, a wine tasting room, a hot stone massage parlour and a 20-seat cinema.
The perks are being offered as demand for the most expensive new homes in the capital falls dramatically, forcing some developers and estate agents to look for novel ways to encourage sales. Nine newly built homes worth more than £5m were sold in the six months to October, down 83% on the same period in 2015, according to analysis of Land Registry data published earlier this month by property investment company LCP. Increases in stamp duty announced by the former chancellor George Osborne and the uncertainty of Brexit have been blamed. A Chinese developer in Battersea’s Nine Elms area, where there is a glut of newbuild luxury apartments, is promising that staff will turn down buyers’ bedsheets at night, while a rival is offering membership of a private club complete with a rooftop orangery and transparent swimming pool that spans two towers. Marketing staff for the Blackfriars tower believe the snow facility will contribute to a “five-star hotel experience”. A similar attraction, Snow Paradise at the K West hotel in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, consists of a 2m squared cave-like room kept at -15C (5F), with snow pumped into it from a machine that uses air and water. Natalia Rakowska, a marketing manager at K West, said: “It’s like Narnia. You rub your snow into your skin and it feels amazing.” While no affordable housing is being built on the prime site at Blackfriars – the developers have made a £29m contribution to the construction of homes elsewhere in the borough – little expense is being spared on attractions for residents. As well as the snow cabin and rainforest shower, apartment owners will also have access to more standard facilities: a 20-metre swimming pool, a sauna, a steam room, valet parking and a 24-hour concierge provided by Harrods. The first residents are due to move in in 2018. Tom Copley, Labour’s housing spokesman on the London assembly, said: “These kinds of additions are vastly beyond the reach of most of the people we need to house in London. We need to be building homes that people can actually afford to live in. “If you juxtapose the image of the snow room or the jungle shower with the rising number of people sleeping on the streets and in housing need, it paints a very uncomfortable picture of the inequality that exists in London.” Estate agents recognise that the quality and novelty of perks on offer is increasingly important as demand cools. Lauren Kemp, a spokeswoman for LCP, said: “The top end of the market has been battered by taxes. There have been three increases in stamp duty since 2012 and the top rate of stamp duty, for properties above £1.5m, is now 12%. Anybody buying through a company, which was popular for foreign investors, can be hit by a tax of up to £250,000 a year.” In its marketing literature, Berkeley Homes says: “Maintaining the comfort of the residents at One Blackfriars is essential.” One Blackfriars was criticised last year when it was advertised with a video that showed a young couple arriving in the capital in a private helicopter. A narrator described their visits to “exclusive boutiques” and London’s museums. The video faced criticism accusing it of being elitist. It came amid growing concern that London’s housing market is being distorted by an increasing number of foreign investors, some of whom rarely occupy their homes. Earlier this month, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, appointed the London School of Economics to carry out an inquiry into the impact of foreign investment on London’s housing market. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that a 50-storey block of 214 luxury apartments by the river Thames in Vauxhall was more than 60% owned by foreign buyers. One-quarter of the flats were held by companies in secretive offshore tax havens and many were unoccupied."
2016-12-28T17:07:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Calais child asylum seekers launch legal action against UK government,"Thirty-six child asylum seekers who previously lived in the Calais refugee camp have issued a legal challenge to the home secretary. They claim Amber Rudd acted unlawfully in the way she handled their applications. It is the first time children from the camp have taken individual legal action against the government. The children were dispersed across France after the site was dismantled on 31 October. Twenty-eight of those bringing the legal action have had their applications refused, while another eight are awaiting decisions from the Home Office.
Of the 28 refused, 11 are aged 14, seven are 15, nine are 16 and one is 17. Sixteen are from Eritrea, 11 are from Afghanistan and one is from Sudan. They have been dispersed to 15 reception centres around France. In the legal challenge the government is accused of reneging on its commitment to bring vulnerable accompanied refugee children to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act, known as the Dubs amendment. This makes provision for particularly vulnerable children to come to the UK at the discretion of the government. According to the children’s lawyers, the Home Office has failed to allow the relocation of many of the most vulnerable children to the UK, failed to give proper written decisions in refusing these applications and failed to use its discretion in response to extreme cases. The judicial review focuses on the specific circumstances of one 14-year-old boy from Afghanistan as well as on the broader issues affecting all of the children. The boy’s father helped Nato troops and was targeted by the Taliban as a result. The boy was shot in the neck by the Taliban when they came to the family home searching for his father. He was lucky to survive and fled his home country and travelled through eight countries to reach France. Along the way he was buried alive while travelling in a car attacked by Iranian military, almost starved to death when he spent four days and nights in a Bulgarian forest, was physically and sexually exploited by people traffickers and was shot with rubber bullets and teargas while in the Calais camp. His wrist was broken there when he was beaten by a French police officer wielding a baton. He tried to kill himself on four occasions while in Calais.
His legal team at Duncan Lewis Solicitors wrote to the Home Office on 2 November and 5 December to raise concerns about the boy’s condition but neither letter received a response. While social workers have assessed him to be suffering from suicidal ideation and depression, and an independent psychiatrist assessed him to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and to be a “traumatised and vulnerable boy” who needs treatment, a Home Office social worker who assessed him said there was no evidence that he had any particular emotional or psychological needs. He was one of many children who were informed on 15 and 16 December that their applications to come to the UK had been unsuccessful. He has twice expressed a desire to kill himself since being moved to a reception centre in France.
In an initial response to the legal action, Home Office officials said they could not prioritise cases of children who had legal representatives, and that if the child felt the French authorities were not looking after him properly he could seek redress through the French courts. Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said: “The government has rendered these children, including some as young as 13, to effectively be without any legal remedy until well into the new year, which is the earliest that the relevant Home Office officials have agreed to give reasons for refusing some of these children.” He added that to date only 200 children had come to the UK and no more were expected from Calais. “The way that this has all been handled by both the UK and French authorities is nothing short of shameful. It is morally reprehensible and, we argue, simply unlawful that these children have not been given written reasons as to why their applications were refused and that these children were told about the refusals in group meetings without a proper procedure in place.” Some of the children whose applications have been refused have been sending SOS messages to the Guardian. One 16-year-old Sudanese boy in Biscarrosse, whose application to seek sanctuary in the UK has been refused, sent a series of messages on WhatsApp on Tuesday night, saying: “… am just tired of my life. Even I don’t know when or how I can sleep. All I know I just wanna do anything right now to forget.” He referred to the staff at the reception centre as a “heartless machine”, adding: “I told them two weeks ago, please shoot us to relax us coz this not human, I would swear.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."
2016-12-28T18:36:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Brexit Britain will depend on 'foreign' London and its Muslim mayor in 2017,"They’re still at it out there. “Sadiq Khan getting elected as mayor tells you all you need to know about London!” declares a self-described royalist and Rangers fan on Twitter: “[it’s] Becoming a muslim/immigrant shit*****e!”. Here’s someone calling themselves Deadpool commenting at the Daily Mail: “How in hell did this guy get voted as London mayor. Ooh I forgot, no English living in London nowadays”. And meet a woman from Yorkshire, keen on opera, plants and reincarnation: “I’ve been warning what imho is #Londonmayor’s intention – London caliphate”. Nearly eight months on from his election triumph in May, the London-born London bus-driver’s son, “proud feminist” and gay marriage backer continues to be accused of coming from another land bent on placing the capital under sharia law. Never mind that Khan’s swearing in as mayor was conducted at Southwark Cathedral and presided over by a Church of England cleric, or that his first official function as mayor was attending a holocaust memorial event in Hendon. And so what if he returned to the historic English cathedral the other day to celebrate Christmas “and our way of life here in this great city”? In the view of a “proud Briton” tweeting from Norfolk, his real plan for Christmas was to cancel it. And another thing. Khan has vowed to “DEFY Brexit” by working on proposals for London-only work visas, not because he and the city’s business leaders believe this would help buttress its economy in the uncertain years ahead, but simply in order to “maintain the number of migrants entering London”. That was not the view of a social media crank but the Daily Express. The article crossed the Atlantic. On arrival at the website of the co-founder of something called the American Freedom Defense Initiative it was re-published beneath a headline in which the migrants it referred to were all Muslim, complete with a claim that Khan was eager to sustain their inflow because he has “close ties” to “jihadis, Islamic supremacists and Islamic Jew-haters”. Bats in the belfry. The suggestion that London’s mayor, who for years has been an energetic champion of interfaith understanding and at the forefront of urging his fellow British Muslims to follow his example by participating in mainstream politics, is engaged in a secret plan to fill the British capital with foreign jihadists is poisonous, imbecilic drivel. But as 2016 has taught us, ignorant fantasists, loudmouth bigots and dirty propagandists anywhere in the western world can no longer be just laughed at and dismissed. They get rewarded with newspaper columns and radio shows, because the conflicts they stir up are good for business. They influence elections. They even win them. In the UK, they and their opportunist fellow travellers prevailed in the EU referendum. As the year’s end approaches, they are crowing, smearing, jeering and gleefully anticipating a 2017 in which their triumphs will continue across the West. They are hell bent on wrenching Britain out of the EU as quickly and completely as possible and the bees in their bonnets buzz that leaving will be just the start of a glorious restoration, a cathartic national purging of all that they recoil from as unnatural and unclean. That is the new mood encircling remain-voting London with its 300 languages, its ethnic and cultural “super-diversity” and its Muslim mayor, the son of migrants from Pakistan. On bad days the capital can feel, more than ever, like an island of social and economic liberalism, not to mention Labour Party strength, in a blue Home Counties sea and, since 23 June, amid a wider national ocean that is swelling with resentment and rage. The referendum outcome cannot be explained by geography alone: both Birkbeck professor Eric Kaufmann and the British Election Survey team have shown how values, nostalgia and social psychology cut across spatial categories and those of income too; Scotland’s blanket “in” vote shows the limitations of any town-versus-country characterisation of the EU result, as does the fact that some of England’s other big cities voted strongly to remain (Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol) while others opted narrowly to leave (Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham). But British voters in no English big city region as a whole wanted to stay in the EU as heartily as London, which voted 60% to remain. Look at the leave margins in Bolton (64%), Oldham (61%) and Wigan (64%) and grasp why Andy Burnham, Labour’s candidate to become Greater Manchester’s first directly elected “metro mayor” next year, has been speaking up about doorstep concerns over free movement of workers. Burnham’s stance and that of Khan, who says he voted for Burnham to become Labour leader in 2015, could hardly contrast more sharply, reflecting a highly fragmented UK. The “London is Open” campaign Khan launched the month after the EU vote was the start of a sustained drive to maintain the city’s status as a magnet for international visitors, labour, investment and trade. It underlines the differences in attitudes between the millions of Britons in the London metropolis and the majority of their compatriots. In so doing, it also underlines how the capital and its Labour mayor represent so much of what Brexit Britain resents and fears. It is the city the then British National Party leader Nick Griffin ludicrously described in 2009 as “no longer British” and as “ethnically cleansed” of British people. It is the London Nigel Farage disparaged in 2014 as being like “a foreign land” because he heard languages other than English being spoken on a train from Charing Cross. What an irony it is that the UK whose independence from the EU the erstwhile Ukip leader so fervently craves is now likely to become even more reliant on “foreign” London, with its teeming immigrants, its “metropolitan elite” and that Muslim mayor, than it already is. Dependency culture Bear with me while I strap some armour on. I agree with Philip Hammond’s autumn statement remark that “for too long economic growth in our country has been too concentrated in London and the south east”. I’ve no quarrel with the government protesting that it’s time to narrow the north-south divide. When people from elsewhere complain that “London gets everything” I, a dedicated Londoner since migrating to the capital from a very different part of England 37 years ago, can see what they mean. I am uneasy about the capital inhaling ambitious young people from all corners of the land and only breathing them out when they retire to Surrey. So it is not with any cavalier, Big Smoke sneer that I break it gently to Leave Nation that Remain City is going to go on giving it an awful lot of what it needs. Here’s something else the chancellor said: “London is one of the highest productivity cities in the world and we should celebrate that fact”. He went on to note that no other economically big league nation has such a massive output gap between its first city and the rest. He could have rubbed some noses in the detail: London contributes a massive 23% of the UK’s annual economic output; London has been growing half as fast again as the UK’s nations and regions as a whole; thinktank Centre for Cities has calculated that London contributes 30% of all UK taxes that are dependent on growth - such as on income, land and property – which is as much tax altogether as the next 37 largest UK cities combined; a report compiled for Brexit poster boy Boris Johnson when he was London mayor found that the equivalent of £2,500 per Londoner is exported to the rest of the UK every year. So, even as things stand, the rest of Britain gets a hefty subsidy from the capital. Roads and bus services in Barnsley (68% leave), schools in Boston (76% leave) and health services in Blaenau Gwent (62% leave) are all helped by the contributions of a workforce that speaks 300 languages and around 40% of which was born abroad. Most especially, they are helped by London’s financial sector, habitat of “the bankers” whose industry and employees continue, like it or not, to do a lot to keep the UK and its people afloat. It’s hard to see that dependency decreasing. London’s economy has proved more resilient than that of the UK as a whole to economic shocks in the recent past. It came through the last recession relatively unscathed, its business organisations are stoutly upbeat and Hammond has at least done some of the things, notably on affordable housing, the capital needs him to do if it’s to keep on propping up the rest of the country. Business rate revaluation, which will see increases in the capital and the opposite elsewhere, have been criticised by Khan and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, yet may end up looking like the start of a national rescue operation. In the words of the Institute for Fiscal Studies: “It will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole”. But what if, as some detect, the capital’s power is already fading? Other European cities - Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam and more – have been making overtures to international City firms. Reports suggest that tens of thousands of Square Mile jobs could disappear if passporting rights – a mechanism enabling London companies to operate freely across the EU nations – are lost under the Brexit terms, an outcome thought increasingly likely as the prime minister makes immigration curbs her top priority. Companies in other sectors are putting investment decisions on hold until the departure deal becomes clearer. Construction has picked up, but it’s an industry heavily staffed by non-British EU workers. Whatever its hopes of sunny uplands ahead, the country cannot afford to let its capital decline. So while it might gratify some to metaphorically slaughter the London cash cow, Brexit Britain is going to have to keep on feeding and milking it. Khan’s capital When he crushed Tory Brexiter Zac Goldsmith to become mayor in May, Sadiq Khan did not expect to be spending much of the rest of 2016 and beyond coping with the consequences of leaving the EU. Having deployed his pro-EU views during the mayoral fight as part of depicting Goldsmith as a backwoods toff, he then played a prominent part in the remain campaign. This included keeping a promise to share a platform with David Cameron, despite the then prime minister having disgracefully joined in with the attempts to smear him as an apologist for Islamist fanatics. There was more to this than sticking to his word. Khan needed a working relationship with the then Conservative premier. He needed London to stay in the EU. The referendum outcome changed everything. It had always been Khan’s intention to lobby national government for greater powers and resources, as his predecessors Johnson and Ken Livingstone had done – that’s par for the mayoral course. But Brexit has added urgency to that mission and with it some theoretical extra leverage. The Khan administration’s early dealings with Cameron’s ministers were encouraging: they seemed to get the point that London is different and that the country needs it to stay strong. Then came the dramas of the Tory leadership succession and a new government line-up under the mutely pro-remain Theresa May. Khan’s purchase with these has been variable, perhaps reflecting the new prime minister’s eagerness to break with the perception of Cameron and his coterie as London trendies, perhaps a lack of policy coherence on her part, perhaps her attitude to the London mayor himself. As home secretary, May made her own small contribution to Goldsmith and the Tory media’s dishonest “extremist links” attacks. Of more relevance now are stories of her annoyance with her chancellor for meeting Khan prior to the autumn statement without her say so. Would a prime minister sure of her ground have reacted so strongly? Would one firmly committed to giving London more autonomy in the national interest have allowed her transport secretary, Brexiter Chris Grayling, to dump an agreement made between his predecessor and Khan’s to devolve control of suburban rail services to Transport for London, seemingly for reasons of politics and personal dislike? On the other hand, Khan and his housing team are pleased with that autumn statement deal on affordable homes brokered with housing minister Gavin Barwell (who is also minister for London and a London MP). Maybe in time Khan will extract more. The autumn statement promised to eventually devolve the adult education and work and health programme budgets to London government, so that provision can be designed and precious resources used to best local effect. The wheels of Whitehall are moving very slowly, though. Khan would also like London to run its own post-16 skills training and, ideally, secure much more direct freedom to spend taxes, especially property taxes, raised from the capital in the capital in ways that he and the London boroughs see fit, although the latter in particular still seems a long way off. He is, though, pressing on with developing the proposals that so inflamed the Express, for a London-only work visa which would enable London employers to continue to recruit workers from EU countries with ease. It’s not an outlandish idea: such “asymmetric” migration arrangements have been made in other countries, notably Canada. Khan is pleased to be sitting down once a month with Brexit secretary David Davis, with whom he apparently gets on well. They have things in common: a Tooting council estate upbringing is the most obvious; past concerns about controversial extradition treaties is another. Meanwhile, he’s getting on with the business of exercising the uneven spread of powers he currently has. As he says himself, he’s only just getting started in a job where it takes a long time to get big things done. He’ll come under heavy opposition pressure from the first working day of the New Year, especially over the ambiguous phrasing of his fares freeze pledge and the detail of his first budget. London Assembly Tories think he’s better at politics than administration and will eventually come unstuck. Tactically, he’s been quite defensive, sharply so at times, determined to give nothing away. His question time performances have been bus parking exercises, executed rigidly. To extend the football metaphor, he’s been more of a Mourinho than a Klopp. In some policy areas Khan could and could maybe afford to be bolder. In time, he might do well to become more expansive about the city of opportunity he wants to build, and a more complete advocate for those many Londoners struggling to make ends meet. That said, he and his team have been pleasingly workmanlike so far. Their know-how and industry come as a relief after Johnson’s showy but complacent and sometimes slapdash eight years. Just as he weighed up and defeated his rivals to become his party’s mayoral candidate and then did the same to Goldsmith to punishing effect, Khan has sized up the job of bossing City Hall from a starting point on the practical Labour left and proceeded with focus and energy. It’s a task for a pragmatist, an alliance-builder and a persuader. He’s addressing it with application and energy. His election win and his efforts in post so far should not be undervalued by the progressive left (whatever that is these days). It may seem small consolation for being battered by Brexit, terrified by Trump and depressed by the consolidation of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. But it already serves as an example being adapted by Labour politicians seeking to become “metro mayor” leaders of other English big city regions next spring. Burnham’s immigration intervention puts a clear distance on the issue between himself and his party leader. Meanwhile, Steve Rotheram, Labour’s candidate for the Liverpool city region and Corbyn’s parliamentary private secretary, has echoed a Khan election campaign slogan by saying he would want to be “the most business-friendly metro mayor possible”. Big city mayors may represent Labour’s best chance of surviving as a plausible party of national government. As for everyone else, they will view Khan’s mayoralty much as they view London - with everything from delight to dislike, with some of the latter of the vicious variety triggered by places and people wrongly deemed irredeemably alien. Alas for those so afflicted, the country needs a thriving London. Its mayor can help that to happen, which is why, in 2017, Brexit Britain needs more success for Sadiq Khan. Dave Hill’s book Zac versus Sadiq: the Fight to Become London Mayor can be purchased from the Guardian Bookshop or directly from the author. • This article was amended on 3 January 2017 to recognise that voters in the area covered by the government’s Liverpool City Region devolution agreement of November 2015 voted narrowly to remain."
2016-12-28T18:49:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Debenhams apologises to homeless man for Boxing Day drenching,"Debenhams has apologised to a homeless man after his possessions were drenched as he slept in a doorway of its city-centre Portsmouth store on Boxing Day. Russell Lucas Allen alleged a security guard told him to “enjoy your water bed” after he woke up to find his belongings, and those of his dog Lexy, soaked with water. He wrote on Facebook that water poured from inside the store had “ruined clothing, food, dog bedding, public donations brought by the kind members of public”. He wrote that he and some friends had complained, adding: “When confronting the guard I got told I deserve it.” Debenhams said it was an “unfortunate accident” and replaced Allen’s bedding. The original Facebook post led to hundreds of comments on social media and offers of help. An online petition calling for the guard to be disciplined gathered more than 8,000 signatures within 24 hours. Allen, a former assistant building site manager, told the Guardian the response was overwhelming. “I didn’t think such a small incident would escalate into such a big situation,” he said. “I just want to tell everyone I appreciate the love that everyone has shown me … if anything, it will make people think differently towards homeless people and those less fortunate.” Paul Godier, an independent who chairs Portsmouth city council’s homelessness taskforce and spent 10 years homeless himself, said he and Allen had held “constructive” meetings with Debenhams representatives and expected the store to offer training to its employees. But a lack of empathy towards the homeless is not unusual, he added: “A church up the road evicted a load of homeless from their grounds a few months ago.” The incident raised broader questions about homelessness in the port city, and why anybody was sleeping in a doorway on Christmas Day, when overnight temperatures fell as low as -3C.
A count earlier this year identified 37 rough sleepers in Portsmouth, and others are known to sleep in their cars, but getting firm numbers for homelessness is notoriously difficult. A winter shelter opened a couple of months ago catering for 36 people, but Godier said Allen had told him he was turned away because it was full. Godier said he and the council’s head of housing had been working to address the situation on Wednesday. “It highlighted a situation that shouldn’t have arisen and we have solved that problem or we had better have,” he said. “I have worked with Russell for a long time. He’s a good guy in a terrible situation.” A spokeswoman for Debenhams said the retailer took the matter seriously and had investigated. “We have established that this was an unfortunate accident in which the routine cleaning of the fire exit from the inside of the store resulted in some of the gentleman’s property on the other side of the fire exit becoming wet.” She added: “Debenhams has now supplied the gentleman with new bedding and clothing, and a member of our team has met him to offer our sincere apologies for any distress caused.”"

The block of flats in St Austell was cordoned off following the discovery at 4.30pm on Wednesday. The cause of the deaths is being investigated. Devon and Cornwall police said officers found the bodies inside the property. One man, a 31-year-old from St Austell, has been identified and his next of kin have been informed. The second man, thought to be in his 20s, has yet to be formally identified and his next of kin yet to be informed. The force said: “At this time, police are conducting thorough inquiries and an examination of the scene is under way to establish the causes of death.” “A scene guard remains at the property while a forensic examination and searches are conducted.” DI Marie Ward said: “This investigation is at a very early stage and inquiries continue to establish the circumstances around the deaths.” Police are appealing to anyone who may have information to contact them at 101@dc.police.uk or call 101 quoting reference 0544281216."
2016-12-29T11:58:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Man questioned in bed company investigation after death of baby boy,"Detectives have questioned a man as part of an investigation into a bed company after the death of a baby boy. North Yorkshire police have said that a 35-year-old man, believed to be the company boss, Craig Williams, has been interviewed under caution and is assisting police with ongoing enquiries. A joint investigation between the force and South Yorkshire trading standards officials was launched into Playtime Beds, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, after a seven-month-old boy from York died on 3 November. The company issued a safety warning following the death stating that its made-to-measure beds “could lead to risks to children such as asphyxiation or strangulation, falling, entrapment or crushing”. The bespoke bunk beds, which include castle and princess-themed products, have been sold between £300 and £740 since 2011. A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire police said: “We are investigating the sudden death of a seven-month-old at a property in Melrosegate, York.” North Yorkshire police are appealing to customers of Playtime Beds who have safety concerns, or have experienced cases where a child has suffered an injury in relation to a purchased bed, to come forward. Playtime Beds has been supplying beds since 2011 but has now stopped trading, it said in a statement. The safety warning advised customers that “until such time that they are able to determine which bed and extras you purchased, you stop using the bed immediately either for sleep or play, and ensure that children in particular do not climb, sleep in it or play in or on it”. People concerned about their purchases have been asked to call a dedicated line set up by North Yorkshire police on 01609 643642."
2016-12-29T12:35:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother of missing RAF serviceman says he was 'social hand grenade',"The mother of Corrie McKeague, the RAF serviceman who has been missing for three months, has said her son was a “social hand grenade” who would put himself at risk. Nicola Urquhart has always feared that someone else may have been involved in her 23-year-old son’s disappearance, but police have downplayed the concerns, saying they have found no evidence of foul play. She participated in a 90-minute question and answer session on Facebook Live on Thursday, which was viewed by more than 39,000 people, during which she spoke about her son’s disappearance and the police investigation.
“He’s not so much a social butterfly, more a social hand grenade who absolutely lives for the moment,” Urquhart said. “He will make choices and decisions that are sometimes reckless that other people might not. “Would he get into a stranger’s car? Yes. Would he go to a stranger’s house that he’s never met before that he’s met on a social dating site? Yes. He would put himself at risk because Corrie believed he could handle himself.” McKeague was last seen in the early hours of 24 September after a night out with friends in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. He was reported missing on the following Monday, 26 September, after he failed to turn up at his base at RAF Honington, 11 miles (18km) away. Speaking from her home in Dunfermline, Scotland, Urquhart called for a number of people seen in the area on CCTV that night to be identified, including a man walking along Cornhill Walk around the time McKeague was last seen. She said four vehicles had entered the area where her son was last seen and said she believed one of them did not have a legitimate reason to be there. Urquhart said three men had set fire to a vehicle not far from the site the next day, which she thought was “highly suspicious”. She said: “[Police] have made some efforts, they have put equipment up to look on top of the buildings, and they’ve also had some aerial footage given to them as well. “They’ve done some door-to-door, they have had civilians tap on doors with bits of paper asking if they’d been aware of anything happening to Corrie, if they heard anything that night. This did take about seven weeks before the people went round. Unfortunately, if someone has somebody tied up in their house, or they’ve done something to Corrie, I wouldn’t imagine they were about to tell the person standing at their door. So I would like that area forensically searched.” CCTV footage showed McKeague walking alone and eating fast food in Brentgovel Street at 3.25am the morning he disappeared. Police scoured woodland areas in the vicinity and also searched a bin lorry, believing his phone had been lost or discarded and ended up in rubbish. In October, detectives said they had received a report of a possible sighting of McKeague near the Hollow Road industrial estate, heading towards RAF Honington. Officers were called by a man who told them he had been driving in the area when he spotted a man in light clothing at the back of a sugar beet factory at about 4.20am."
2016-12-29T15:22:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Last known Wordsworth descendant joins fight to stop Lake District pylons,"The last known descendant of the Romantic poet William Wordsworth is to join campaigners marching to “save the Lake District from pylons” on New Year’s Day. Ninety pylons the height of Nelson’s column are planned across an estuary in the area of outstanding natural beauty where Wordsworth wandered lonely as a cloud. Christopher Wordsworth, great-great-great-great-grandson of the poet, is fighting a £2.8bn plan to “fence in” the scenic Lake District. National Grid wants to link the proposed nuclear plant at Moorside near Sellafield, Cumbria, to the UK power network at the Heysham power station in Morecambe. After agreeing not to place 47-metre-high pylons all the way through the Lake District national park, the utility giant proposed a £460m plan to run cables underground. However, that will still see pylons placed along a two-mile (3.3km) stretch in Whicham valley, just 10 metres from the boundary of the national park. Campaigners say the line of pylons will also run right across the top of the Duddon estuary, interrupting stunning views into and out of the high fells of the Lake District, scarring a cherished landscape steeped in history. Christopher Wordsworth said: “William Wordsworth was enthralled by the unique beauty of the Duddon, which inspired his famous series of sonnets. “As much as the works of my ancestor are an important part of our literary heritage, his ‘long-loved Duddon’ is an important part of our natural heritage. We owe it to his memory to preserve its beauty for future generations to enjoy.” The MP John Woodcock will also join the New Year’s Day walk with environmental campaigners carrying banners and placards highlighting opposition to the plans. Woodcock said: “In more than six years of representing the people of Barrow and Furness, few campaigns I have been involved in have stirred as much passion as this fight to protect the beauty of our landscape from these giant pylons. “National Grid has said it will listen to the views of local people and we need to demonstrate our strength of feeling ahead of the public consultation. “Our campaign has received the backing of the Broughton-based CGP textbook publishing company which is placing full-page advertisements in the local and national press on a series of dates around the Christmas period and we are all looking forward to the walk.” The landscape charity Friends of the Lake District and campaign group Power Without Pylons have joined forces to fight the plan. They have asked National Grid to adopt an alternative solution, which would remove the need to take the power cables up the valley and around the estuary. Friends of the Lake District is urging local people to take part in a consultation, which ends on 6 January. Dr Kate Willshaw, policy officer at Friends of the Lake District, said: “We need as many people as possible to tell National Grid that putting pylons just metres outside of the national park’s south-western boundary will cause unacceptable damage, destroying the special qualities of the national park and interrupting people’s enjoyment of our beautiful landscape renowned throughout the world.” National Grid claims it is proposing extensive measures to reduce the impact of the project on the landscape of Cumbria while balancing this with the need to keep energy bills affordable. The company aims to submit an application for consent to build the new connection to the Planning Inspectorate in 2017. A decision will then be made by the secretary of state for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. If consent is granted, construction work is expected to start in 2019. Graham Barron, secretary of Power Without Pylons, said: “Protecting this important area is not just a local issue but a national issue. “More than 40 million people visit Cumbria each year to enjoy these special landscapes. They don’t want them scarred by lumps of metal and unsightly overhead wires. “There are feasible alternatives to pylons which we have campaigned for from the outset. If enough people state their objections to giant pylons in writing we believe the wall of opposition will force National Grid to reconsider.” The author Bill Bryson, who has also joined the campaign, said: “Britain’s countryside doesn’t stop being glorious at the boundaries of its national parks. It is beautiful – and vulnerable – nearly everywhere, and should be respected and cherished wherever it enhances a landscape. It would be a tragedy to lose these exquisite views just for the sake of one company’s bottom line.” Earlier this year, a wave of protests helped stop the North West Coast Connections project, which intended to install pylons through the Lake District. National Grid confirmed that it would now put 14 miles of cables underground, running through the western side of the national park. A National Grid spokeswoman said: “We have had to make some difficult choices about landscapes outside the national park but we believe that we can reduce the impact on them by sensitive placement of pylons and screening.” She added: “We have had thousands of conversations with people over the six years we’ve been developing this project and Friends of the Lake District have attended many of the meetings we held to develop our proposals with local authorities and other key bodies. “We have spoken to hundreds more people about our plans during our current consultation exercise. This continues until 6 January 2017 and we encourage people to give us their feedback as this will be vital in helping us shape the project.”"
2016-12-29T19:03:33Z,uk-news,UK news,German neuroscientist also told to leave UK after residency rejection,"Sam Schwarzkopf, a German neuroscientist living in the UK, contacted the Guardian after it published the story of Monique Hawkins. He said he had a similar experience at the hands of the Home Office to Hawkins, a Dutch woman who was told to make preparations to leave the UK after she applied for British citizenship following the EU referendum. This was despite her living in the UK for 24 years and having two children with her British husband.
Schwarzkopf said: “I am a German citizen who moved to the UK in 1999 to study neuroscience at Cardiff University, both my undergraduate degree and my PhD. After I got my PhD in 2007, I decided to remain in the UK to work. I am now married to a British woman and am a faculty member at University College London. “I originally applied for that permanent residence document in March 2016 because it is necessary for a British citizenship application. “In June, one week before the referendum, my application was rejected. The reason was that I hadn’t included my passport in the application, only a legally certified colour copy. This rejection letter contained the phrase that I ‘should now make preparations to leave’ the UK. “I was pretty pissed off at that moment, so I wrote a couple of complaint letters including [one] to the then home secretary Theresa May (she never got back to me). “Just to be clear, I don’t think that was anything more than a mistake on the part of the Home Office. They simply use these standard letters. “But it is also quite outrageous. Under current rules, EU/EEA [European Economic Area] nationals automatically gain permanent residence after five years (provided certain criteria are met at least). The PR document I applied for doesn’t give me permanent residence rights, it simply confirms them. So it really should be a formality. But the Home Office seems to want to make it excessively difficult for people. “The rejection letter actually acknowledged that I had a German passport. It said that they couldn’t verify my nationality from a photocopy because they can be fabricated. That’s fair enough, but you might think they practice some assumption of innocence until proven guilty of passport forgery. “But I would also have fully accepted if they had simply told me to reapply and include the passport this time. However, telling me to leave the country even though it should be blatantly obvious that in all likelihood I actually am an EU citizen is just offensive, and more importantly it also directly violates free movement rights. “My MP got involved in this, writing letters to the Home Office, and this was very helpful. At first they explained that this was simply the way they write their rejection letters, but eventually someone wrote back with an apology. More importantly, they said they would take this issue on board and consider changing the phrasing. From the story in the Guardian, it sounds that at least so far they haven’t changed it yet.”"
2016-12-29T19:19:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office urged to reform residency process by frustrated EU citizens,"A campaign group representing EU nationals living in the UK has urged ministers to reform Home Office permanent residency procedures after it emerged people were being told to prepare to leave because of minor paperwork issues. Representatives of the3million said the case of Monique Hawkins, a Dutch woman who has lived in the UK for 24 years but received a Home Office letter advising her to make preparations to leave, showed the application process was too complex. “We need reform of the system, this is a massive bureaucratic task,” said Nicolas Hatton, a French citizen and founder of the grassroots organisation campaigning for the rights of EU citizens.
“This is just one example of the numbers of people who are getting rejection letters. This is happening every day. I think the point here is that we have got a system that does not work, it cannot deal with the registration of three million people. It is a massive bureaucratic task that even the government has got to realise has to be addressed.” The more than three million EU nationals living in the UK are not required to register their presence in the country but many have rushed to apply for permanent residency as a way of guaranteeing their rights after Brexit. But growing numbers complain they are being erroneously rejected. The immigration lawyer Jan Doerfel criticised what he called the “refusal mindset” at the Home Office. “Hawkins’s case highlights the tick-box exercise approach of the Home Office,” he said. “There is definitely a refusal mindset whereby any ambiguity is resolved against the candidate. When they haven’t got a yes/no answer they move to reject.” The Tory MP Dominic Raab, who intervened on Hawkins’s behalf, said he thought EU nationals who were settled in the UK before the referendum should be protected but that other EU countries had to agree to reciprocate. “I have always made clear I believe we should protect the rights of existing EU nationals here at the time of the referendum, and it has been the EU that rebuffed the early UK efforts to provide reciprocal clarity on this,” said Raab, who supported leave. The Home Office has issued statements since the referendum telling EU citizens that their status in the UK has not changed. But it has been inundated with permanent residency applications from EU nationals who fear their rights will be eroded post Brexit. The number of outstanding applications went from 37,618 in June 2015 to almost 100,000 “currently in progress” in July 2016, including those seeking permanent residence cards and documents for non-EU family members of European citizens. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Hawkins had her application for permanent residency rejected because she included a solicitor-certified copy of her passport rather than the original, which she said she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death or her father. “As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave,” Hawkins’s rejection letter stated. The Cambridge University graduate is married to a British man and they have two British children. She decided to apply for permanent residency after the referendum. Hawkins said she never thought she would be deported but when she phoned the Home Office to discuss the decision communicated to her in October, four months after her application, she was told her case could not be discussed on the phone or by email. She described her treatment by the Home Office as being as absurd as a Monty Python sketch. She has reapplied after obtaining a Dutch identity card, which allowed her to submit her passport. A German national, Lars Graefe, who has been in the UK since 1988, received a similar letter. An aerospace executive, he travels every week and said he could not surrender his passport for the six-month period it can take the Home Office to process applications. “Clearly the Home Office don’t know how to deal with EU citizens,” he said. “If you were in the private sector and treated customers like this you would be sacked.” Doerfel called for a review of the Home Office procedures and a return to more practical practices. “What we need is for the Home Office to go back to the system in the 1970s, 80s and even the 1990s where case workers engaged with applicants and contacted them if issues arose, that would resolve things so much quicker than this idea of refusing and then appealing. It would be cheaper for the state, more humane and probably [result in] quicker resolution of immigration applications,” he said."

The Resolution Foundation said all workers who find themselves without a permanent, full-time role lose out in terms of wages, but people hired on zero-hours contracts suffer the biggest financial punishment. The thinktank said its research showed that workers on zero-hours contracts faced a “precarious pay penalty” compared with other workers doing similar jobs.
The pay penalty directly associated with zero-hours work amounted to 6.6% or 93p an hour. For a typical zero-hours worker doing 21 hours a week, it amounts to £1,000 a year. An examination of workers in low-paid roles revealed a bigger penalty of 9.5% The foundation said its analysis were the first to pinpoint a specific penalty associated with zero-hours contracts. It said it was well known that zero-hours workers earned less than permanent employees – 38% an hour less on average – but it had previously been assumed this was down to their concentration in low-paying sectors, and younger and less experienced staff. “To get to the real pay penalty associated with zero-hours contracts, the foundation’s analysis compares the pay of zero-hours and non-zero-hours workers with similar characteristics and doing similar jobs,” it said.
“It does this by controlling for a wide range of factors including the worker’s gender, age, experience, qualification level, their occupation, the industry they work in and how long they’ve been in their current job. These factors explain around four-fifths of the overall pay gap between zero-hours workers and other employees.” Zero-hours contracts are widely used by retailers such as Sports Direct and JD Sports, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels. The care industry is estimated to employ 160,000 workers on zero-hours contracts while the public sector, especially the health service, has increasingly adopted them. Figures show the number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts rising steadily in recent years, and official data for the last year reveals a leap of 20% to more than 900,000, indicating that insecure employment has become a permanent and growing feature of the jobs market. Laura Gardiner, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Concern about the use and abuse of zero-hours contracts goes far wider than a few notorious firms. There is mounting evidence that their use is associated with a holding down of wages.
“While some people value the flexibility offered by zero-hours contracts, they also carry a significant ‘precarious pay penalty’ that can cost workers around £1,000 a year. That’s a big price to pay for work that too often lacks the security workers desire.” The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Zero-hours workers suffer the double whammy of lower pay and fewer rights at work. That’s why the Taylor review must drag employment law into the 21st century. Far too many workers have no power to stand up to bad bosses.” Earlier this month a report by the thinktank showed that agency workers suffered an average pay penalty of 22p an hour, equivalent to £430 a year for those working full-time. The loss of earnings jumped to 45p an hour for permanent agency workers. A report by the UK’s largest trade union, Unite, estimates that the number of workers in insecure employment of one kind or another has topped 5 million. The government has commissioned a review of modern working practices by Mathew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts, who said after his appointment that he wanted to put forward reforms that gave workers more control over their lives. In recent months several employers have distanced themselves from the growing disquiet at the overuse of contracts that offer no guarantee of work by offering workers full-time contracts. The pub chain Wetherspoons and Everyman cinemas have said workers will be offered more secure employment."
2016-12-30T09:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,The great outdoors: readers share their best weather photos from 2016,"It’s been a another stunning year for weather photography and readers have been sharing their most striking shots throughout the year from across the world. From bitterly cold winter scenes to sunlit beach memories, here’s a selection of the landscapes you’ve enjoyed capturing this year. Post Blizzard - Lorenzo, Texas, January
I took this photograph 10 miles south of our family cotton farm in Lorenzo, Texas using a Canon 7D camera and Tokina 11-16mm lens. I grew up here and travel back to visit every year for the holidays. It snows in this part of Texas but I never remember it snowing this much before. Cory Aycock Coney Island - New York City, February
I’ve been to New York on many occasions but never visited the coast line of Coney Island. New York was just recovering from a snow storm so I jumped on the subway and checked this town out. I took this picture with my iPhone 6. In my bag I had my Olympus Trip 35 film camera and a Nikon D800, but for street shots I usually just use my phone. Sometimes you can’t beat using it as a camera, especially if the light is kind. Robin Pope Langsett Reservoir - Peak District, March
This was taken from the footpath that runs alongside Langsett Reservoir, managed and very well-maintained by Yorkshire Water and on the very edge of the Peak District National Park. I am fortunate enough to live around four miles from the reservoir and it is one of my favourite year-round circular walks leading past waterfalls and up into wild moorland, finishing up at the Wagon and Horses Inn for some real ale, pies and chips. I love the beautiful muted colours on an afternoon stroll in the spring sunshine. It was an amazingly still, spring day with barely a ripple on the water. I was experimenting with my new, lightweight Fuji X-T1 and a 35 mm F1.4 lens. This was a hand-held shot and I had to scramble down a bank to get a clear view as surrounding trees lining the footpath encroached on my first attempts. Carole Tidball Burnham-on-Sea - Somerset, April
This is the lower lighthouse on the north side of the beach at Burnham-On-Sea. We spend a lot of time walking along the beach in all weather as its a perfect place for walking our seven month old Cockapoo Fudge. Sunsets along the beach are always stunning, as such its our favourite time of day to go for a walk. My eight-year-old daughter Poppy took the picture on a Cannon EOS 11OOD using an 18-55mm lens. I’m the one doing the cartwheel. Vicky Harris Gallows Hill - west Cumbria, April
I live in Whitehaven which is about 12 miles away from Gallows Hill near Gosforth in west Cumbria. I often walk in that area. There are a few lonnings (country lanes) in that area which are particularly pleasant to walk. This was one path I’d not been down before, but as soon as I reached the top of the hill and the landscape dropped down through the sunken lane to the farm, I knew it would make a superb picture. The macabre history of the hill apparently being used for public hangings in medieval times seemed to add to the atmosphere of the picture too. Alan Cleaver ‘Yellow daze’ - Cheltenham, May
I was walking a route I do many times with my black Labrador Merlin, when the yellow of the oil seed rape flowers bloomed from a field just off a busy road. There is a public footpath through the field so this was the path we took that day. It had been quite a dull day in May, but the colours of the flowers were stunning and brought a warm and sunny feel with them. Susanne Quinn Blackstone Edge Reservoir - Rochdale, May
This is a shot from my daily commute home by bike from Manchester to Hebden Bridge. I was training for a 4,500km MTB race in Canada from Banff to the Mexican border with the USA at the time. It was taken with a Sony RX100 Mk1. It pretty much lives in my pocket all the time as carrying a Leica around on a bike is not so smart. Greg May Bardsea Beach - Lake District, June
This was taken on Bardsea Beach during the school holidays. The weather was a surprise to us, as this was the week in June where the whole of the UK was bombarded with rain apart from the Lake District which was protected by the Pennines and was very warm and sunny. I used a Nikon d3100 with at 35mm lens. Tom McMahon Albanian Riviera - Albania, June
I visited Albania for the first time this year, and this was my favourite holiday snap. I love the contrast between the wispy cloud, the sillhouetted people and the graffiti on the wall. We were driving on a spectacular coastal road along what they now call the Albanian Riviera. The camera was my rather retro little Nikon Coolpix p7000 which I love. Penelope Farmer Marsden Bay- South Shields, June
Marsden Bay lies just north of Sunderland about nine miles away from my home in Seaham Harbour, County Durham. I often have a stroll there with my camera. That morning I was enjoying a coffee at the Marsden Grotto overlooking the beach, when I saw two men pushing their bikes to fish from the shore. There had been a mist for a few days but on that day the mist had disappeared leaving a beautiful sunny morning. Anne Stancliffe Astoria, Queens - New York, July
I had recently moved to Astoria in Queens NY. It was my first time visiting that particular area. It was a particularly hot summer day, and there was an hour long queue to get into the pool as it was at full capacity. Jana Pejkovska The Solent - Portsmouth, August
I live in Portsmouth, the UK’s only island city. You are never far from the sea. I regularly take a walk along the seafront especially in the summer, when the daylight lasts well into the evening. On this particular day I noticed a new structure off shore that I hadn’t seen before - a post that will hold navigation lights for large aircraft carriers in the Solent. It was a beautifully still day with a calm sea and the sun was low on the horizon. The contrasting colours of the sea and sky were stunning. I used a tripod to keep my Nikon DSLR camera steady for a 13 second exposure. Since then several more of these navigation posts have appeared as new features in a constantly changing Solent. Jon Neil Lake Pukaki - New Zealand, August
I moved to New Zealand three years ago. I go up to the lake a few times a year as it’s on the way to Aoraki Mount Cook. I took this picture in August when my mother and step father were visiting NZ for the first time and I was showing them around. Cloud inversions are quite common on New Zealand’s big lakes in the winter. We hit the fog about 20 minutes before the lake and I was really worried my folks weren’t going to be able to see Aoraki. We created a rise a little further round the shore and broke out of the cloud to this beautiful view with the classics turquoise colours of the lakes in full splendour. Late winter sees fog rolling off the glacier lakes and rivers, filling up the Mackenzie Country basin. Luckily for my sightseeing parents, we emerged from it coming around the edge of Lake Pukaki and were greeted by this beautiful symphony of winter colours. Rose Hanley-Nickolls Aldeburgh - Suffolk, September
This was taken on the Suffolk coast in Aldeburgh, looking out to sea after the sun had set behind me. Using a Canon 6D, with a 24-70mm lens at 42mm f/16 ISO100 for 72 seconds, I attempted to capture in a long exposure of just over a minute the wondrous lustrous light and the particular stillness in the sea that evening. Phillip Edwards Fly Agarics - The Hague, Netherlands, October
Close to the former Queen’s Palace at Haagse Bos in the city of The Hague, there is a small piece of woodland with a majestic beech lane. It’s a public park near a residential area. Fly agarics are quite rare in our region, but this is one of the few spots I know of where they can appear. At first it was too dry for them to surface, but finally the rain came and they popped up immediately. So I got out my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ30 and my bike, and set off from my home in Voorschoten. I was duly rewarded with this photo. There were so many of them this year. It was a sight to behold. Gerrie Stegehuis Grangemouth - Stirlingshire, October
We’d been having some nice sunsets that week and on this particular October evening I grabbed my camera and headed out. The air was absolutely still and the vapour rising from the refinery over in Grangemouth had been hanging around in the sky for hours like this. Just as the sun was setting this vapour cloud lit up and, in combination with another serendipitous cloud that appeared, turned the evening sky into something quite apocalyptic looking. Brian Smith Chorlton Meadows - south Manchester, November
Our dog Florrie gets walked two or three times a day and during the week it tends to be in the local park. But at the weekend we like to use the extra time to give a bit of variety, so we popped across south Manchester to Chorlton where you can get to the banks of the Mersey. While fog isn’t a shock in November, it’s not the most common weather phenomenon and can be tricky to capture in a photo. I just thought this was a nice moment to get the iPhone out and have a go because of the yellow leaves and Florrie’s apparently curious stance. In reality she would have been checking for squirrel activity. The fog accentuates the relaxing solitude that can be had on a long dog walk. Stuart Fear Little Chesterford - Essex, December
We were just finishing up in the garden when the mist appeared. I took my Canon EOS 40D with 24-105 lens and walked into the meadow beside the church, where a horse wandered in front of the setting sun. The mist, unusual in the evening, appeared suddenly and was gone just as quickly 30 minutes later. Gerard Clinton Kingston-upon-Thames - London, December
I took this while cycling to work one morning. It was colder than usual and we’d had lots of frost and fog. I brought my Canon 5d and 28-300mm lens on this day as I thought I’d get some wonderful early morning shots along the Thames. I was right. Gareth Logue"
2016-12-30T15:51:39Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scrap insurance rule for stay-at-home parents from EU, says Tory MP","Ministers should scrap strict immigration rules that risk disqualifying EU citizens such as stay-at-home parents and students from securing permanent residency in the UK if they have not taken out private health insurance, according to a backbench Tory MP. Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, said she would be supporting a petition that calls for the removal of the little-known requirement, after several EU citizens applied to the Home Office post-Brexit and discovered they should have obtained health insurance when not working.
The MP said a new “simple, efficient and rapid” immigration registration process for the 3 million EU citizens in the UK was needed as soon as possible to end the “bureaucratic nightmare” they faced. She added it was “completely unacceptable” that EU citizens living in the UK were being left in limbo, and said their situation, and that of Britons in Europe, should be the “number one priority” in Brexit negotiations after Theresa May triggers article 50. The petition backed by Wollaston was launched by the EU citizen Claudia Holmes and has so far been signed by more than 5,000 people. It also calls for an automatic right to remain for all spouses and civil partners of Britons and of UK servicemen and women. The petition calls for the removal of “comprehensive sickness insurance as permanent residency requirement for EU/European Economic Area students, homemakers, carers, retired, and disabled people or applicants self-sufficient through other income, including their non-EEA spouses/civil partners”. EU citizens are currently entitled to live in the UK under European law, but once the UK leaves Europe, almost all rights apart from the right to own property or a business, which are protected under international law, will need to be reasserted. The Home Office has repeatedly said since the referendum that the status of EU citizens living in the UK has not changed, and Theresa May says she is keen to clarify their long-term residency rights at the same time as negotiating with the EU over the rights of UK citizens living in the other 27 member states. Despite that, the Home Office has been inundated with applications for permanent residency from EU citizens who fear that their rights may otherwise be eroded. The latest figures available show that more than 100,000 cases are currently being processed. Wollaston said the Home Office needed to come up with a new system for handling applications. “They need to have something that is very quick, efficient and low cost. It is completely untenable that [the current permanent residency process for non-EU citizens] could be the process that would be in place for EU citizens. “It has to be something simple, rapid in place and that’s before you get to the morality of it. There are real people being caught up in this. It is totally unacceptable. This is something they are not in any way to blame for and it is up to politicians to put themselves in people’s shoes and see the anxiety it is causing and do something about it.” She said one of her constituents, a British man who did not want to be named, had discovered that his EU wife of 30 years had been told by the Home Office that she was in the country unlawfully because she had never been in full-time employment. He was told by the Home Office that his wife, originally from the Netherlands, would have to leave the country and apply for permission to live in the UK from abroad even though she has spent the past 30 years in the UK, bringing up their children, studying and working freelance. Wollaston said no one expected the man’s wife to be kicked out of the country, but thousands of EU citizens panicked into applying for permanent residency were being made to feel like second-class citizens. About 30% of the current applications for permanent residency are failing and the Guardian has already uncovered several instances of EU citizens married to Britons who are being failed for simple bureaucratic reasons. Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that the Dutch-born software developer Monique Hawkins, who has been in the country for 24 years, had been told to make preparations to leave the UK because her application process failed after she included a solicitor-certified copy of her Dutch passport with her paperwork instead of an original.
Others have since contacted the Guardian to report that they also received rejection and “prepare to leave” letters. The Italian Francesca Gernone, a partner in an architectural practice in London who has been in the UK for 22 years, had her application for permanent residency rejected two weeks ago. “I have received the exact same [prepare to leave] letter from the Home Office. They have obviously not changed the offensive phrasing from their letter yet,” she said."
2016-12-30T17:57:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Spanish UK resident feared insurance rule would force her to leave,"A Spanish woman who has been living in the UK for the past 16 years and is married to a British national feared being unable to remain in the country in the long term because she did not take out health insurance when she was looking after her young son. Maria Luisa Llorente, 45, discovered that EU citizens living in the UK are supposed to have private insurance when they are on parental leave or otherwise not working – and not to have taken it out could affect a person’s right to secure permanent residency in the country.
Under current rules, EU citizens who have lived in the UK for five consecutive years gain permanent residency rights provided certain criteria are met. For those in full-time employment this is rarely an issue. But for full-time mothers or fathers it can be. Llorente lives in London and worked full time in the early part of the last decade but then took a break from work after having her son. She returned to work part-time four years ago and after the EU referendum decided to apply for permanent residency. She then discovered that even though she was not dependent on the state, she had to have comprehensive sickness insurance in addition to proof that she was a permanent resident in the UK. EU regulations require that EU citizens who are non-workers resident in another member state for more than three months must be covered by their own insurance. For workers there are reciprocal arrangements in place. Llorente said she was concerned her application might not succeed, but that she had been told she was eligible for permanent residency because she spent six years working full-time between 2003 and 2009, and so was hopeful that she would be accepted. But she believes her case – which has yet to be processed by the Home Office – nevertheless highlights the little-known regulation that would particularly affect EU citizens who are homemakers or carers living in Britain. “I had never heard of this before and it is mainly affecting women, mothers, people who have to stop work or those that are sick or people who care for children or the disabled or elderly. It is very very unfair. “I worked full-time between 2003 and 2009 and paid my national insurance and tax and just because you go on maternity leave you have to have this insurance. The problem is not so much having the insurance; it’s that we didn’t know about this and now it’s a retrospective requirement following Brexit. If I had known this is what I needed I would have got it,” said Llorente. “It is not just people who stay at home who are being affected. I know one mother who is at home not out of choice. She has a child with respiratory problems, she’s a carer. These people are vulnerable and are really, really scared that at some stage they might not be able to justify their existence here.” Another cohort affected are spouses of UK servicemen and women. One Italian woman who contacted the Guardian said she feared she may not qualify to remain because she spent most of her married life in Italy where her husband was posted and would not have proof of residency in the UK required to meet the five-year test should the couple seek to move back."
2016-12-30T21:52:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Freezing conditions and fog to continue over new year weekend,"The thick fog that has caused travel chaos in southern England, with hundreds of flights cancelled and many more delayed, is expected to continue into Saturday, forecasters have warned. The Met Office warned people to be aware of the risk posed by the freezing fog, with driving conditions likely to be difficult and more delays to air travel possible. That came after the UK’s biggest airport, Heathrow, reportedly said 119 flights had been cancelled, London City airport reported about 180 flight cancellations by Friday evening and Stansted airport said 33 flights had been grounded. There were also cancellations at Gatwick, Manchester and Luton airports.
Earlier on Friday, 17 people were injured when a coach veered off a motorway slip road in Oxfordshire and overturned. “Areas of fog have persisted in places through Friday and are expected to become more widespread and freezing in places again on Friday night and into Saturday morning,” the Met Office said. The south-east of England was expected to be the worst hit but forecasters later said the south-west of England was also likely be affected.
“Fog and freezing fog patches with visibility less than 100 metres in places are expected to become more widespread again during Friday night. The fog patches are expected to slowly clear from the north and west of the area during the second half of the night, although some fog is likely to persist across parts of southern and south-eastern England into Saturday morning. The remaining fog should clear from all parts by late Saturday morning.” London City airport said there had been “significant disruption to flights all day”. A spokeswoman said: “Disruption is expected to last all evening and passengers are advised to check their flight status with their airline before they travel.” There were delays across all arrivals and departures at Luton on Friday evening, though the airport reported only two cancellations. “We advise anyone looking to travel tonight or tomorrow morning to check the status of their flight with their airline and to check in as normal unless the airline confirms the flight is cancelled.” While Stansted had seen more cancellations, a spokesman said all flights were “scheduled to operate on Saturday”. A spokesman for Heathrow airport told the BBC that the 119 cancellations may be followed by more. Ferry services to the Isle of Wight were also cancelled, with lengthy delays on some of those running, thanks to foggy conditions in the Solent. A spokesman for the operator Wightlink blamed fog and low tide for the suspension of the service between Lymington and Yarmouth. He said passengers had boarded the ferry in Yarmouth before the captain made the decision that it was not safe to travel, so they disembarked. “We are just keeping an eye on the weather at the moment to see how soon we can actually start sailing again.”
Services between Portsmouth and Fishbourne had delays of up to two and a half hours because of the restricted visibility. Red Funnel services between Southampton and East Cowes were delayed by up to an hour. Brighton and Hove Albion’s home match against Cardiff City was called off because of the poor visibility. The club tweeted: “Match postponed due to fog: The match as been called off after consultation between match officials and both clubs.” A statement on the club’s website added: “Further information, including details of the rearranged game, will be confirmed in due course.” Fulham FC’s match against Reading was also abandoned because of the fog."
2016-12-30T22:30:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Antarctic expert and HIV research pioneer among scientists made dames,"A polar scientist who helped to uncover dramatic historical warming in Antarctica and became the first woman to lead the British government’s research in the region has been made a dame in the New Year honours list. Prof Jane Francis, the director of the British Antarctic Survey and a veteran of more than a dozen expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctica, receives the award for her services to polar science and diplomacy. “It’s a complete surprise and I’m greatly honoured,” Francis told the Guardian. She will travel to Antarctica on Sunday for a week and again at the end of January to visit the Halley research station, which is being moved to avoid an ominous-looking crack in the ice sheet. Francis, who first sailed into Antarctic waters on a BAS expedition in 1989, said: “The word awesome was invented for Antarctica. It completely blows your mind. It is incredibly beautiful, but also very humbling. Being a fragile human in such a cold and remote place can be daunting.” Also awarded a damehood is Prof Amanda Fisher, the director of the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre at Imperial College in London. Fisher’s discoveries helped pinpoint HIV as the virus that causes Aids. The honour also recognises her work on stem cells and epigenetics, and her advocacy for women in science. Other researchers to receive damehoods are Prof Ottoline Leyser, the director of the Sainsbury Laboratory at Cambridge University, and Prof Caroline Watkins, the only nursing professor of stroke care in the UK. Sir Alec Jeffreys, whose accidental invention of DNA fingerprinting transformed forensic science, has been awarded the companion of honour, as has Mary Warnock, who brought about an overhaul of special needs education and shaped Britain’s fertility regulations, now widely regarded as the best in the world. A number of scientists receive knighthoods, including Prof Shankar Balasubramanian, a Cambridge University chemist and co-inventor of next-generation DNA sequencing, a procedure available for less than £1,000 that can read a whole human genome. Nicholas Black, a professor of health services research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Jim Smith, the director of research at the Francis Crick Institute, have also been awarded knighthoods."
2016-12-30T22:30:11Z,uk-news,UK news,New Year honours for 'ordinary people doing extraordinary things',"A London teenager whose quick thinking helped save the life of a 19-year-old youth he found stabbed and beaten in the street is among the youngest recipients in the New Year honours list. Jeremiah Emmanuel, 17, an A-level student and anti-violence campaigner, drew on life-saving skills learned as an army cadet to stem the victim’s bleeding by improvising with T-shirts, belts and hoodies before emergency services arrived at the scene of the attack near Emmanuel’s home in Brixton, south London. The victim of the attack, whom he did not know, made a full recovery. Almost three-quarters (74%) of the New Year honours are for local community, charity or voluntary work by the “ordinary people doing extraordinary things” highlighted in the Queen’s Christmas broadcast. Emmanuel, who receives a BEM (British Empire Medal) and is recognised for his anti-violence community work among young people following the loss of a friend, has now started a campaign with the young man who was stabbed to introduce lessons in life-saving skills to secondary schools. “I hope it can inspire people to go into their communities, get involved with organisations and charities, and give back to other people,” said Emmanuel, who has been involved in community work since the age of four, encouraged by his mother “who taught me to give back to others, not necessarily to think about yourself, but to think of your community and the people around you”. Others honoured for their inspiring community work include solicitor Saba Nasin, a volunteer cricket coach from Redbridge, who receives a BEM for her work encouraging girls to get involved in the game. “It’s been great to use sport to drive change in the local community,” she said. Manisha Tailor, a qualified headteacher, changed career to become a football coach in London, inspired by her brother who suffered a breakdown. She said she wanted “to raise awareness of social inclusion and mental health”. She receives an MBE for services to football and diversity in sport. Samaritans volunteer and former teacher Alan Woodhouse, 83, from Merseyside, who has been helping people for 57 years, said his MBE “is not about me, it’s about recognising the work of Samaritans volunteers throughout the decades”. The oldest recipient in this years’ honours is 94-year-old Janet Gillespie, who is given the BEM after 60 years volunteering with Poppy Scotland. This year also sees the first ever honour for services to glass blowing. Thomas Young, 79, from Bridge of Allan, Scotland, has been making glass by hand using traditional methods for almost 60 years. He said of his MBE: “I’m overwhelmed, humbled and very grateful for this award, which I never expected to receive and had no idea I had been nominated for.”"
2016-12-30T22:30:11Z,uk-news,UK news,"Company boss who gave £930,000 to Tory party receives knighthood","A company boss who has given nearly £1m to the Conservative party and long-serving MPs from across the Commons head the list of political figures who receive a knighthood in this year’s New Year honours list. David Ord, who becomes a knight in the new year, is a co-owner of Bristol ports and a member of the Conservative party’s Leaders’ Group, who were granted exclusive access to cabinet ministers under David Cameron and George Osborne. He has given more than £930,000 to the party since 2013. Ord, a major opponent of the Severn Barrage, was once embroiled in a donations row after it emerged in 2014 that Bristol North West MP Charlotte Leslie had failed to declare the port owner’s donations to her local party on time, despite making numerous parliamentary interventions about the project. She apologised and was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary watchdog. Jeremy Corbyn said the honours for Tory donors were an insult to those who had been rewarded for charitable work or achievements. “The Conservatives are making a mockery of our honours system,” the Labour leader’s spokesperson said. “Every crony appointment is an insult to the incredible people from right across Britain who are rewarded for the great contributions they make to our national life.”
A Downing Street source defended the honours for Conservative donors, saying: “Being involved in political parties is generally considered to be an important part of civic society, and the alternative is having state funding for political parties, which is not where the consensus lies. When people dedicate their time and service to civil society it’s appropriate they can be honoured.” Two veteran sitting MPs were knighted. Conservative MP Julian Brazier and Labour’s David Crausby, a former member the HS2 select committee, which sat for almost 100 days over eight months taking evidence from up to 40 petitioners a day. Former Lib Dem minister Steve Webb, one of the architects of the coalition’s “triple-lock” pension guarantee and auto-enrolment in workplace pensions, has also been knighted. Vera Baird, the former Labour MP who is now Northumbria police and crime commissioner, has been made a dame for services to women and equality. The former QC, who was solicitor general under Gordon Brown, was honoured for her role in the Equality Act 2010. Baird said she saw the honour as “giving the cause of equality a boost”. Politicians receiving the highest honours included Liberal Democrat peer Shirley Williams, who has been made a companion of honour to mark more than 50 years in political life. Lady Williams, a former Labour education secretary under James Callaghan, was one of the so-called gang of four of influential Labour politicians who split to form the Social Democrat party, which later merged with the Liberal party to form the Lib Dems.
Other Tory donors receiving honours this year include associate party treasurer Dominic Johnson, who lent the Cameron family his west London townhouse rent-free when the former prime minister resigned and left No 10. The register of MPs’ interests shows that the family stayed in the Chelsea property until the end of October before they moved back into their Notting Hill home, which had been rented out. M&C Saatchi founding director Jeremy Sinclair, credited as the brains behind the famous Conservative campaign poster showing Tony Blair with “demon eyes”, also receives a CBE. Key members of Conservative party headquarters have also been honoured, including director of campaigning Darren Mott, who received an OBE, with Alexandra Broadrick, chief of staff to the party chairman, and Louise Goodall, the deputy head of fundraising, receiving MBEs. Whitehall staff also received dozens of awards, including 14 for Home Office officials who served under Theresa May when she led the department. However, some critics questioned the number of awards handed out to staff from HMRC, given the recent poor performance of the department. Staff received the honours for their work on tackling tax non-compliance and tax avoidance, as well as for customer service. The department was recently criticised by the National Audit Office for pursuing only one successful criminal prosecution despite a new specialist unit identifying almost £2bn in tax evasion and avoidance by the super-rich. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said the honours for HMRC investigators “dishonour the honours system” given the department’s poor performance on tax evasion and delays on consumer hotlines. “HMRC have had the worst year; not only billions of pounds not collected from the biggest tax dodgers, but the average punter has been made to wait for hours on the phone on hold,” he said. “It’s a farce. I thought this was a joke, but it’s not.” A government source said it had a “proud record of tackling tax evasion, one of the toughest in the developed world, and not only are these civil servants being rewarded for their work, the service itself is doing good work.”"
2016-12-30T22:30:11Z,uk-news,UK news,New Year honours list: arise Sir Mark Rylance,"Mark Rylance has been awarded a knighthood, capping a year in which the veteran Shakespearean actor won an Oscar and two Baftas, as talent from across the performing arts was recognised in the New Year honours. It is the first honour for the actor who played Thomas Cromwell in the BBC’s Wolf Hall and won an Oscar for his portrayal of Rudolph Abel in Bridge of Spies. Speaking earlier this year, Rylance said he did not set much store by the various accolades he had collected over his career: “People say things about competing as actors and I know that is necessary to make a show out of it, but those actors are so good I feel I’m more of a spokesman when I win rather than better than the other nominees. I don’t take it too seriously.”
Patricia Routledge, 87, best known as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances, was among those in the world of theatre and television honoured with a damehood. Speaking to the Guardian in 2011 ahead of a return to the stage at the National Theatre, Routledge said she still got fan mail from all over the world for the 1990s sitcom, and attempted to answer every letter. The actor said it had not been a burden to be so closely identified with one character. “If everything focuses on that, it’s just too silly. But it would be churlish of me not to appreciate what it’s brought me. If a good number of people come into a theatre because they know me from the dreaded Mrs B, I couldn’t be happier.”
Richard Eyre, 73, the playwright and director and former artistic director of the National Theatre, was also awarded the Companion of Honour, while actor Helen McCrory was given an OBE following her critically acclaimed performances on stage at the National Theatre in both Medea and Deep Blue Sea, as well as on screen in the BBC series Peaky Blinders.
Kinks frontman Ray Davies, 72, said he felt a mixture of joy and embarrassment on being awarded a knighthood for services to the arts. Despite the Kinks parting ways in 1996, Davies forged a solo career and two years ago collaborated on Sunny Afternoon, the Olivier-award wining musical based on his music and lyrics. “This is for the people who supported my music over the years,” said Davies. “I’m kind of reluctant to collect rewards. I usually back out of ceremonies. I’m kind of a shy person.” There was also a knighthood for veteran comedian Ken Dodd, who, despite being 89 and recently admitting his memory was beginning to fail, still performs lengthy musical and comedy shows that often run well past midnight. He said he was “highly tickled” to have been made a knight. Dodd, who entered the Guinness Book of Records in the 1960s for telling 1,500 jokes in three hours, began his foray into comedy at 14 and built up a following for his speedily delivered one-liners. He has also had 19 songs enter the Top 40 over his career, with his version of Tears topping the UK charts for five weeks in 1965. Dodd said he had no plans to retire anytime soon, adding: “I’m very proud, I’m very, very happy and full of plumptiousness.” Welsh opera singer Bryn Terfel said he was “truly humbled” to be among those receiving a knighthood, an honour that was also given to Jeffrey Philip Tate, the chief conductor for the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra, for services to British music overseas. Naomie Harris, who played loyal crown servant Eve Moneypenny in James Bond films Skyfall and Spectre, received an OBE, as has Tim Pigott-Smith, 70, who made his break in The Jewel in the Crown in 1984 and was recently nominated for both an Olivier and a Tony award for his portrayal of the Prince of Wales in Mike Bartlett’s play King Charles III. One of the few nods for the visual arts was a CBE for Chris Ofili, the Turner-prize winning painter who has represented Britain at the Venice Biennale and was one of the few British artists of African descent to emerge as part of the Young British Artist movement in the 1990s."
2016-12-31T03:02:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"Irish minister opposed Queen Victoria statue being sent to Sydney, cabinet papers reveal","John Bruton, a former taoiseach of Ireland, objected to a decision to gift a statue of Queen Victoria to Australia 30 years ago, declassified Irish cabinet papers show. The statue was sent despite the opposition of then finance minister Bruton and the director of the director of the National Museum of Ireland, John Teahan. It has stood outside Sydney’s Queen Victoria Building ever since. The Irish Times reported that then taoiseach Garret FitzGerald backed the plan to send the statue, which was originally unveiled at Dublin’s Leinster House in 1908, to Australia.
However, Teahan wrote a memo objecting to the plan because it was the work of an Irish artist, John Hughes. “I advise that such a figure be retained and protected until we have grown up sufficiently to look that Queen, long dead, straight in the eye,” Teahan said. Bruton took the same view when the matter came before cabinet. “The minister for finance strongly objects to the removal of the Queen Victoria statue from Ireland. The monument is representative of one of the many traditions of Irish history. It is part of our heritage in no less a way than Norman or Viking remains,” said a memo. “In the context of the Anglo Irish Agreement, in which reference has been made to the ‘two traditions’, the minister for finance sees great danger in publicly jettisoning a figure of the second tradition. The repercussions for the government from such an act would far outweigh any minor adverse publicity that might arise if the Australian request were refused.” Despite the objections, the cabinet agreed to send the statue to Australia “on loan until recalled”. After Irish independence from the UK in 1922, Leinster House became the home of Ireland’s parliament, the Dáil, and the statue stayed there until 1948 when it was moved to storage after decades of protests from politicians.
At one point the statue was due to be sent to the city of London, Ontario, but neither the Canadian nor Irish governments were willing to pick up the transport tab. But in June 1986, Ireland’s ambassador to Australia, Joseph Small, received a request from the office of the lord mayor of Sydney, Doug Sutherland, asking if it would be possible to send Queen Victoria to Australia on loan. “For over two years we have been searching the world in vain for a life-size bronze statue of Queen Victoria. We have looked to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Yemen, etc all to no avail. Yesterday, just when we were giving up hope we received advice that there is stored in Dublin a fine bronze statue of Queen Victoria ... it appears to be ideal to locate it in front of the Queen Victoria Building looking towards the town,” said the letter from Sutherland’s office. FitzGerald received a letter from Niall Glasser, director of promotion for the Sydney project, saying a loan or a gift of the statue would be accepted with gratitude. “There it would stand as a constant reminder of the permanent bond and friendship between our two countries,” he said, adding that the statue would be properly maintained."
2016-12-31T10:30:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Andy Murray and Mo Farah knighted in New Year honours list,"Britain’s sporting elite has been rewarded in a New Year honours list in which Rio Olympic medallists Andy Murray and Mo Farah are made knights and Katherine Grainger and Jessica Ennis-Hill become dames. Olympians and Paralympians make up 10% of the 2017 list, which also includes knighthoods for Kinks frontman Ray Davies, 72, comedian Ken Dodd, 89, actor Mark Rylance, 56, and a damehood for actor Patricia Routledge, 87. Murray’s honour caps a remarkable year for the Scot, who claimed a second Wimbledon title, defended his Olympic crown and took the world number one slot from Novak Djokovic in an extraordinary run of form. Aged 29, he is among the youngest to be awarded a knighthood in modern times and had once said he felt too young for such an accolade. Four-time Olympic gold distance runner Mo Farah, 33, said of his knighthood: “I am so happy to be awarded this incredible honour from the country that has been my home since I moved here at the age of eight. Looking back at the boy who arrived here from Somalia, not speaking any English, I could never have imagined where I would be today – it is a dream come true.”
Sir Roger Bannister, 87, the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, is made a companion of honour – the highest award. So, too, is percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, and political veteran Baroness Shirley Williams.
Among the 1,197 people honoured, Anna Wintour, 67, editor-in-chief of US Vogue becomes a dame in the diplomatic and overseas list for services to fashion and journalism. Designer and former pop singer Victoria Beckham, 42, receives an OBE for services to the fashion industry, matching the honour given to her husband, David, 13 years ago. This year sees the highest number of awards to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background recipients, who make up 9.3% of the successful candidates. Awards include a damehood for nursing pioneer Prof Elizabeth Anionwu, and a knighthood for Cambridge chemist and DNA expert Prof Shankar Balasubramanian.
The honours list is put together by nine independent committees set up by the Cabinet Office, and this year there are equal numbers of male and female recipients. A small number of honours are in the Queen’s personal gift, and included a knighthood for adventurer David Hempleman-Adams, 60, who said he was astonished to be made a knight commander of the Victorian order in recognition of his services to the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme. In recognising Britain’s historic success at the summer Olympics, sporting stars were honoured not just for sporting excellence, but also for their contribution to giving back to their sport or community, the length of their career achievement and any previous honours.
Glasgow-born Grainger, 41, the first female Olympian to win five medals at five games, becomes a dame for services to rowing and charity, said it was “such a lovely honour to get”. “What is lovely when you hear the titles and the names of the New Year honours list, if anything it makes you feel you have to step up again. It is something to live up to – it is almost like a new standard,” she said. “The honour is for sport, but also for charity, and I think that it is lovely that a lot of athletes have been able to give a lot back, and it is some of the areas I will probably go into when I move into other worlds and be able to do more charity work”.
Heptathlete Ennis-Hill, 30, who like Grainger is now a dame and has also now retired from competitive sport, added silver at the 2016 games to her gold in London, and was already a CBE. Highly decorated Paralympic equestrian Lee Pearson, who already had the MBE, OBE and CBE for services to equestrianism and to disabled sport, is knighted. Max Whitlock, 23, from Basildon, who won double gymnastics gold at Rio, said receiving an MBE was “an amazing feeling”. “It looks pretty cool to see my name with an MBE on the end of it. I’m very proud, and it gives me a lot of motivation.” Whitlock, who is getting married in 2017, added: “As an athlete I never expected to receive it and to be recognised is amazing”. Para-swimmer Ellie Robinson, 15, who took both gold and bronze at Rio, said she hoped to inspire others as Ellie Simmonds had inspired her. Of her MBE she said: “If a 15-year-old with a disability can do it then anyone can do it. They have so much diversity in the awards now, and it just keeps getting better every year.”
Bishop James Jones, 68, former Bishop of Liverpool and chair of the Hillsborough independent panel which led to the quashing of the original inquests, receives a knighthood. He described the honour as a “salute” to the Hillsborough families. “It is a great honour but it is obviously tinged with sadness because of the enduring sense of loss the families have,” he said. Acclaimed photojournalist and war photographer Donald McCullin, 81, who worked on the Observer and the Sunday Times, said he felt “inwardly warmed” by his knighthood. Northumbria’s police and crime commissioner, Vera Baird QC, is made a dame for services to women and equality. Justine Roberts, co-founder and CEO of Mumsnet, is made a CBE.
The prime minister, Theresa May, is setting new priorities for future honours lists. She wants particular focus on services and work with children and young people, and those who have encouraged social mobility. She also wants emphasis on those who work against all forms of discrimination and for the list to reflect the merits and achievements of people from all walks and parts of the United Kingdom. Television presenter and cancer campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood, 68, former face of BBC’s Watchdog programme, said she had turned down an MBE, believing the honours system to be unfair, and calling for it to be overhauled to “drag the country into the 21st century”. She said she did not know who put her name forward for her work in consumer safety, but she felt she would have been a hypocrite to accept it. She objected to the word “empire” on the end of it, and “just wouldn’t accept it while we still have party donors donating huge amounts of money and getting an honour”."
2016-12-31T15:06:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen may miss New Year's Day church service,"The Queen may miss the annual New Year’s Day church service at Sandringham after Buckingham Palace said the 90-year-old could still be too unwell to attend. A spokeswoman said: “The Queen is continuing to recover from her heavy cold and is still in the residence of Sandringham. We probably will not know what is happening until the morning.”
The monarch has not been seen in public for 11 days since she and Prince Philip caught heavy colds, forcing them to cancel the traditional train journey to their north Norfolk estate for Christmas. Instead, the royal couple were flown directly from the palace by helicopter, with the Queen missing the Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church for the first time in 28 years. Philip, 95, was well enough to go to the 25 December service with Prince Charles, Prince Harry and other family members before reportedly joining the traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot. If the Queen does attend church, she may be accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple and their two children spent Christmas with Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, in Berkshire. After a tweet from a fake BBC News account claimed earlier this week that the Queen had died, the palace was forced to issue a statement confirming she was still alive."
2016-12-31T19:28:26Z,uk-news,UK news,London’s ‘Boris bus’ reaches end of road as Sadiq Khan halts purchases,"Sadiq Khan has dumped the “Boris bus”, a key part of the now foreign secretary’s legacy as London mayor, because it is too expensive to produce. The new generation of red double-decker Routemasters, with folding doors that allow passengers to hop on and off, was introduced by Johnson in 2012, to great fanfare. Designer Thomas Heatherwick was credited with giving the new Routemaster a modern “London look”. After the bus was first introduced, he said it was a compliment that it had so quickly become “part of London’s landscape and personality”. Heatherwick also designed the cauldron for the opening of the 2012 London Olympics as well as the so-called Garden Bridge, yet to be built across the river Thames. At the time, the London mayor described the new bus, built by Northern Ireland company Wrightbus, as a “stunning piece of automotive architecture” representing the “very best in British design, engineering and manufacture”. However, during the mayoral campaign last year, Khan suggested that as London mayor he would look at holding off on purchases of the new Routemaster as a way of making budget savings to help pay for a promised four-year public transport fares freeze. It has now been confirmed in Transport for London’s business plan that “new capital investment will be reduced significantly as we discontinue purchases of new Routemaster buses”. The move will be a blow to Johnson, whose legacy as mayor now looks increasingly slim. In March, former Downing Street adviser Steve Hilton said that he struggled “to think of what his legacy is”. Hilton added: “The real legacy of moving London’s transport system forward, I think, happened with the previous mayor, with Ken Livingstone with the big moves – the introduction of the congestion charge and the Oyster card – and in those two areas of transport and promoting London it’s really difficult to think of something specific that you could [point] at as being Boris Johnson’s legacy.” The new Routemaster, first raised as a possible project before the 2008 electoral victory that put Johnson in City Hall, had been intended to combine cutting edge green technology with a revival of hallmark features of the original London Routemaster. Its reintroduction, seven years after the original Routemaster had been withdrawn to be replaced by easy access low-floor buses, was also celebrated by many as a move to rid the capital of Livingstone’s unpopular “bendy” variety. Johnson originally said he hoped there would be 2,000 Routemasters on London’s streets by 2020. Wrightbus, the Northern Ireland firm that makes them, warned earlier this year that its Routemaster production line would have to be shut down within months if no new orders were received. The original contract was to supply up to 1,000 buses. He paid £354,000 per bus for an initial bulk consignment in 2012 of 600, and approximately £325,000 for an additional 200 in 2014. The new fleet was attacked at the time as an expensive vanity project and soon became the subject of a series of unfortunate stories, including the revelation that the batteries on a large number of them had failed. The hybrid diesel-electric technology is also now widely seen as having been superseded by electric battery technology. And in July last year, 300 London bus conductors were told they were to lose their jobs to make transport savings of £10m a year. The staff cuts mean that hopping on and off the buses is no longer an option. Asked to comment on the move, a spokesman for Khan said TfL would instead be investing in a new generation of buses that would help to improve air quality."
